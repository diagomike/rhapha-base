there was the meaning of the word prepared, because that preparation itself is a process",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","then it is a state of readiness.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","And then every activity that you take to be ready is part of the preparation.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","So it's a process, it's a state, it's the activities.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","So that means when you told us it's a year of preparation, and then it has emerged to us critical factors.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","We must not joke with them.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","Because finally, when he told us, prepare to meet

ought to be doing.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","We found where you should be.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","Also, there was someone that asked me a question a few years ago, and Pessin was asked, it seemed like a joke.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","When Pessin said, oh, I'm born again, but sometimes maybe I'm not in service.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","So what if on the date of the rapture, I'm not in service?",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","And Pesso, you answered that date.",(0,n.jsx)(t.br,{}),"\n","He said, if you're not where you're supposed to be, you will not go with the first
