In simple terms, Fasting helps you to tame the flesh and lift the spirit. As Christians, we are required to walk in the spirit, always. This means to be spirit-controlled and not flesh-controlled. This is important because Rom 8:6 says "to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace" and also in John 6:63 our Lord Jesus said "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing. So how does Fasting help you to tame the flesh and lift the spirit?'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(i.p,{children:"One of the cravings of the body is food. It is a craving that is connected to the senses. When we fast, we deliberately abstain from food even though our body tcraves it. We resist the urge to eat thereby improving our mastery over the cravings of the body, and instead focus on activities that build the spirit. Of course, we could engage in activities that build our spirit without abstaining from food, but the abstinence from food adds a level of 'seriousness' and 'discipline' to the exercise."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(i.p,{children:"\u2022 Fasting helps to sharpen our ability to receive or hear from God. It is like raising a spiritual antenna to pick the finer signals of the Spirit's communication. But how does this happen?

There should be a deliberate cessation of all unnecessary activity and a conscious increase in activities of that engage the spirit.
