Hebrews 10:14 says,  \u201cFor by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.\u201d He wasn\u2019t just the perfect sacrifice; His sacrifice perfected us.\r\nThe Psalmist, David, gives us a light into this and tells us something striking in Psalm 141:2. He said, \u201cLet my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.\u201d Being a prophet, he had a revelation of the future and the new dispensation that should come into effect after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.\r\nThe sanctuary of the old covenant was going to be removed and replaced. What then would take the place of the incense that was offered to God regularly, and the sacrifices that He commanded the priests to offer morning and evening?\r\nIt\u2019s our prayers of worship and the lifting up of our hands! God says this should be perpetual; it should never cease. It\u2019s the reason we worship Him always, with our hands lifted. Every time you worship the Lord, especially when you do it in the spirit, that is, in other tongues, your prayers go to Him as incense. The Bible says, \u201cAnd the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel\u2019s hand\u201d (Revelation 8:4)\r\n.\r\nAs you lift your hands to Him, eulogizing and making confessions to His Name, it\u2019s like the evening sacrifice, a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice that pleases God.

So, the Bible already tells us that he begot us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So we are into that living hope today by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And remember, when Jesus died, we died with him; when he was buried, we were buried with him; when God raised him from the dead, we were raised together with him! So today we have a new life in Christ. We are no longer in bondage. We don\u2019t need that deliverance anymore. So, when you became a Christian, you were completely delivered.
