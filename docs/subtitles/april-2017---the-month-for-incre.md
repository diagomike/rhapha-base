title: April 2017 - The Month for Increasing Knowledge
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Praise God.  
Now I'm going to tell you about the month of April.  
 And I asked praying and just talking to the Lord about the Mount of April and really wanting to know in a mind of God, what does this Mount like?  
What does it want us to do?  
And what the Spirit of God was telling me was there are three things that He brought together and He wanted us to catch this tree because of that significance.  
 All right?  
But sometimes you just wonder, why doesn't the Lord just tell us everything at once?  
It sort of just gives you one step at a time, one step at a time.  
I thought, oh Lord, I wish you just gave me all three from the beginning.  
Guess what I would have done with it?  
Can you imagine?  
I'm telling the Lord what I would have done with him.  
He knew already what I would have done with it.  
And he didn't think I would have done the right thing, so he didn't tell me.  
 See, so he just waited and gave me the first one, and then he gave me the second one, and then I needed, okay, so what's the next one?  
And then he gives me, and then tells me that they are tied.  
Here I thought, why didn't you say so from the beginning?  
But he is wisdom personified.  
Whatever he says is just right.  
Whatever he does is just right.  
We can only thank him.  
 It was the month of prophecy.  
You remember?  
It was a month of prophecy.  
Wonderful.  
And then we got into March.  
And March was the month of insight.  
And so he says, prophecy, insight, and then the third one.  
He says, prophecy, insight.  
What do you think is the next one?  
Wow.  
Wow, wow, wow.  
 Okay, now I know that none of you in the room might just be sure.  
So I'm gonna read some things to you from the Bible.  
At least I'll get others to read.  
Okay, let's start with Reverend Ken.  
Can you read Second Peter chapter one from verse five,  
 Diverse?  
Nah.  
So, computer, chapter 1.  
Yes.  
From verse 5 to verse 9.  
 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue.  
Add to your faith, virtue.  
And to virtue, knowledge.  
And to knowledge, temperance.  
And to temperance, patience.  
And to patience, godliness.  
Isn't it wonderful?  
He says, add.  
Yes, sir.  
He tells us that God's going to add it.  
He says, add to your faith.  
 Because he is the one who gives us that faith.  
Embarrasses in God had dealt to every man, Romans chapter 12 verse 3.  
God had dealt to every man, given to every man the measure of faith.  
He gives you faith, then it tells you what to add to your faith that he gave you, right?  
So add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge.  
 and to knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, love charity.  
 for if these things be in you.  
If these things be in you and abound.  
Hallelujah.  
They make you.  
They make you.  
Yes, sir.  
Oh, boy.  
That is shall neither be barren.  
That is shall neither be barren.  
No, unfruitful.  
No, unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
We just had time to tell you about this.  
Oh, dear.  
Verse 9.  
 But he that luck at these things, he that luck at these things is blind and cannot see a far off and have forgotten that he was far from his own sense.  
It's terrible.  
Proverbs chapter 8 and verse 10.  
Reverend Ray, can you read that verse?  
Yes, sir.  
Proverbs chapter 8, verse 10.  
 receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold.  
This is powerful.  
This has received my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold.  
You know, some people think their problem is money and their problem is not money.  
They think, oh, if you just, if you just give me this amount of money, I'll be fine.  
I'll be cool.  
Everything be all right.  
It's not going to be all right because money will not solve a problem.  
 No one has a money problem.  
It's not a money problem.  
Understand it.  
Look what he tells you in the scripture.  
He says, receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold.  
Who's talking?  
Wisdom.  
Wisdom's talking.  
Wisdom's talking.  
Wow.  
 Colossians chapter 1, verses 9 and 10, read it first.  
Colossians chapter 1, from verse 9, it says, for this course, for this course.  
We also, since the day we heard it, do not cease.  
 to pray for you and to desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of his will.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
Hallelujah.  
He might be filled with the knowledge  
 That you might walk worthy of the Lord.  
That you might walk worthy of the Lord.  
Onto all places.  
Be fruitful in every good work.  
Be fruitful in every good work.  
Imagine if your life is described that way.  
Fruitful in every good work.  
I'm fruitful in everything.  
I'm fruitful in every good work.  
And this is it.  
Look at it.  
Read it.  
Be fruitful in every good work.  
I'm increasing in the knowledge of God.  
 Oh, wow, wow, wow.  
Being fruitful in him, he says that he might walk, ward your Lord unto all pleasing.  
Being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.  
Ma, ma, ma.  
Now, let's go back to 2 Peter chapter 1.  
I'll show you something.  
2 Peter chapter 1.  
We're reading from verse 5.  
 Second Peter chapter one.  
And beside this, given all diligence, add to your faith, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge.  
He says, add it, acknowledge.  
You gotta have knowledge.  
He says, acknowledge, acknowledge.  
He says, receive what?  
Knowledge rather than choice gold.  
Receive instruction, rather than silver.  
 Knowledge, knowledge.  
So the Lord said, prophecy, insight, knowledge, prophecy, insight, knowledge.  
These three, how important these are.  
 prophecy, insight, knowledge.  
We're talking about this is the year of flourishing.  
You're going to flourish then you need to have prophecy.  
Prophecy is God's word coming to your spirit and your spirit taking a hold of God's word and you're releasing that word into the realm of the spirit.  
 and joining in that direction of prophecy because your life is a life of prophecy.  
Then it gives you what?  
Insights.  
Insights.  
You know by the Spirit into things that others can't know.  
You have insights.  
Insights.  
It's inspired within you by the Spirit of God.  
It's wisdom granting you insight.  
 then now he tells you, hey, get in the Word, get the information, add knowledge, become knowledgeable, add knowledge.  
Remember the words of Jesus?  
You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.  
You shall know the truth.  
 We just read in Colossians, it says, being failed, being failed with knowledge, the knowledge of his will, being failed with the knowledge of his will.  
He wants you to be failed with the knowledge of his will.  
He wants you to increase in the knowledge of God.  
 increase in the knowledge you've got.  
This month, that's what you're going to center your mind on.  
Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge.  
Listen, our world, the whole world changed because of the age of knowledge.  
Remember this, just go into history.  
You understand it.  
First, it was a breakthrough in science.  
 You know, discovery, discovery.  
That's like insight.  
Think about it.  
Men began to have insight, the science, science that tells us it's discovery.  
They began to look into things and get things out of their world.  
They discovered what they could do and they buried their world.  
But that wasn't going to help enough.  
They needed knowledge.  
The age of knowledge followed the sciences.  
The breakthrough was first in Europe.  
 The age of knowledge.  
This is the origin of the political world that we have today, the new government system that we have today.  
The structure of our world today is coming from that age of knowledge.  
 that followed the age of science.  
They don't end, the science didn't end, but the knowledge brought a balance to what we were learning and how to bring these things into our environment and how we can have a better life, how we can relate to one another, how we can have structures to make our world better.  
 You know what?  
You can build your life through knowledge.  
With more knowledge of God's Word, you can have a greater life.  
You can build your life.  
You can have a more exciting life, a more fulfilled life with knowledge.  
That's why it tells us, be filled with the knowledge of His will.  
And it wants you increasing in the knowledge of God.  
Oh, if you will do this this month, if you will get knowledge this month, if you will do it just this month,  
 There's no telling.  
The blessings that will come in your life, the glory of God that you'll see in your life.  
So what are you going to do?  
Get the messages, get on to pass the grace to each library.  
Listen to those messages.  
There's a whole lot of them you've never heard.  
All right?  
Get the books, read them.  
And the new books are coming out.  
Read those things.  
Get the materials.  
Get soaked in them.  
Have the knowledge of God's Word.  
Don't just listen.  
Take your Bible and write.  
Make your notes.  
 Get this knowledge, increase in the knowledge of God, knowledge of divine things, divine verities.  
You will be amazed what this will do to your life.  
You'll be amazed.  
The progress that you will make  
 So that's the amount of April for you, and I'm expecting for you.  
I believe that at the end of April, you are going to be singing a new song.  
Because you're going to be so filled with knowledge of his will, you'll be like another man.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
He says, receive my instruction rather than silver.  
And knowledge.  
 then choice go.  
Pray talk to the Lord now.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.
