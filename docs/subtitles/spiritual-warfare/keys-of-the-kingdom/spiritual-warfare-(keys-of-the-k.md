title: Spiritual Warfare (Keys of the Kingdom Part 4)
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirit.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 Let's get another occasion here in the Bible, Book of Joshua.  
Chapter eight, we'll read from verse one.  
And the Lord said unto Joshua, fear not, neither be thou dismayed.  
Take all the people of war with thee and arise.  
Go up to eye.  
See, I have given into thy hand the king of eye and his people.  
 and his city and his land.  
Verse two.  
And thou shalt due to I and her king as thou this unto Jericho and her king.  
Only the spoiler of and the cattle thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves.  
Lay thee and ambush for the city behind it.  
Okay.  
Now let's move on to verse 18.  


  
 And the Lord said on the Joshua, stretch out, which the Lord said on the Joshua, stretch out the spear that is in thy hand, toward eye, for I will give it into thy hand.  
He already said, I've given it into your hand.  
So what's he doing now?  
He's showing him the strategy.  
Stretch out the spear that is in thy hand, toward eye, toward eye.  
 God said to Moses, stretch your hand over the sea.  


  
Okay.  
Stretch out no spear that is in that hand toward earth.  
I will give it into that hand.  
And Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.  
Next verse.  
 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place.  
And it ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and the internet into the city and took it and hasted and set the city on fire.  
Hallelujah.  
Keep reading.  
 And when the men of the eye looked behind them, they saw and behold the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to flee this way or that way.  
And the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.  
And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again and slew the men of the eye.  
 And the other issued out of the city against them so that they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side, and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape.  
And the king of Ayyide took alive and brought him to Joshua.  
 And it came to pass when Israel had made an end of slain, all the inhabitants of I in the field, in the wilderness, wearing they changed them.  
And when they were all fallen on the edge of the sod, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned onto I and smote it with the edge of the sod.  
And so it was that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were 12,000, even all the men of I.  
 Praise God.  
They killed everyone.  
And the Bible tells us Joshua didn't take down his hand until I was completely defeated.  
His hand was up with the sword throughout, until I was completely defeated.  
 Because this time, this was a strategy.  
Are you there?  
This was a strategy.  
Question is, in dealing with spiritual forces, do you realize that you need strategy?  
Any strategy?  
Look at that.  
The next verse, we're reading 25.  
Look at 26.  
 For Joshua drew not his hand back, where with his stressed out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all inhabitants of eye.  
God said, stretch your hand over a two-edged eye with your spear.  
And he kept his hand that way until eye was completely defeated.  
He didn't take down his hand.  
 He had learned from the story of Moses.  


  
Hallelujah.  


  
Just a few scriptures for us to come and see them.  


  
 So, can we bind demons?  
Obviously, obviously, to think we can is to deceive oneself.  
Scripture is clear that we can.  
We very much can.  


  
For example, if you look at Ephesians chapter 6, verse 18,  


  
 Remember when he told us about what we should put on, the whole armor of God.  
Then he got to this, praying always with all prayer.  
That means all kinds of prayer.  
So there are different kinds of prayer.  
Question is, do they know what type of prayer to pray?  
And that's why we wrote the book, How to Pray Effectively.  
 How to pray effectively.  
How to pray effectively.  
And in our prayer life, we, let's remember something.  
We are not on the same level with demons, no matter how high they are.  
We are seated together with Christ in the heavenly realms.  
Okay?  
We're seated together with Christ in the heavenly realms.  
 So the more understanding that we have of our place in Christ, the better for us.  
So it's not as though in dealing with the demons, we are in these deep struggles where we say something and then they also say something.  
And we keep exchanging words with them.  
That's not the situation we give others.  
 We give others, we tell them what to clear off.  
That's why Jesus used the strongest words possible.  
He said in Mark chapter 16 verse 17, this signs shall follow them that believe.  
In my name, they shall cast out.  
That means thrust out.  
It's like, you know what it is to pluck out?  
You know how to pluck out something?  
How do you do it?  


  
 It gives the picture of grabbing somebody by the head and, you know, thrust out.  
He says, in my name, they shall cast out, throw out, throw out, block out devils.  


  
It's not worse than binding.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 And that's what Jesus said.  
He gave us the authority to do that.  
Cast out.  
And then he didn't give us limits.  
He didn't say if they are very close to you, you can't cast them up, but if they are far away, you can't.  
He didn't say that.  


  
He's given a name that is above every name, that the name of Jesus Christ, every knee should bow of things in heaven.  
 In earth, and not in the earth.  
So it doesn't matter how high in the heavenlies they are, we speak in the name of Jesus, they have to obey.  
They have to obey.  
We don't have to come close enough.  
The Bible doesn't say we should come close.  
We give the word wherever they are, they hear and they obey.  
Even when you start praying from here,  
 Irrespective of where the trouble is.  
They hear you.  
So that's why they're not a factor.  
Can you see why they're not a factor?  
 That's where there was no need for the writers of the New Testament, their pieces, particularly, to devote chapters.  
And that's what some people expected to see, that if this thing were that important, they should have devoted large portions to this.  
Why would they devote large portions after Jesus told us they've been taken care of?  
We are seated together with Christ.  


  
 So Satan and the courts of hell are no, they're not a factor at all.  
In fact, when you're told that something, that demons are responsible for anything, you should understand that that makes it easier.  


  
Because they understand authority.  
Whenever I know that demons are responsible for something, it makes me happier because to me, that makes it easier.  
 I always prefate when demons are responsible.  
Because that's quick response.  
They understand the message.  
Sometimes I cast out their voice by using my head, I say, mm-hmm.  
They understand it.  
It's easier.  
 You know, some people think it's harder, you know, because they say, it's demons are responsibility.  
It's demons.  
These devils are very wicked.  
We are not using our own authority that we got by ourselves.  
We are using the authority given to us by Jesus Christ himself.  
And he didn't say if I have faith.  
No.  
 No, it was not based on any condition.  
It's by who I am.  
It was seated together with Christ.  
It's by who I am.  
If there's a devil, then even if I'm feeling sleep, I say, get out.  
Here we go.  


  
It depends on what you think about Jesus.  
The name of Jesus.  
Let me just give you an idea.  
 You know, my dad was teaching one time, and he said to us, he was trying to explain something about authority.  
He said, we were in a family gathering.  
He said, if one of the young ones comes to you to say, that is calling you.  
He said, even if he was joking,  


  
 And you weren't sure whether or not he was joking.  
You must answer.  
He said, because he is not telling you in his own name.  
He's using Daddy's name.  
He said, first go and answer.  
Say, Daddy, are you calling me?  
Then let me say, I am not calling you.  
 See, he's teaching us authority.  
That's the way Jesus studies disciples.  
He said, the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat.  
Therefore, I say unto you, whatever they ask you to do, do it, but don't do what they do.  
He says, for they say, and do not.  
See?  
He says, the Pharisees, they don't keep the word, but they represent Moses.  
They represent the law.  
So therefore, whatever they tell you to do, do it.  
Otherwise, you'll be breaking the law.  
 because they represent Moses.  
But don't act like them because they say and they do not.  
Can you see it?  
And that was how the Spirit got taught me about authority.  
The very first crusade, the miracle crusade where I preached, because the very first one I organized, my friend asked my friend to preach.  
But the one where I preached, this was how the Lord prepared me for it.  
It took me to this scripture.  
 The Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.  
Therefore I say unto you, whatever they say unto you to do, do it.  
Or don't do what they do.  
So he also said, my children, they sit on whose seat Jesus sits.  
Forget about, how am I acting?  
How am I behaving?  
How am I?  
How am I?  
I sit on Jesus' seat.  
 Therefore, they have been told that whatever I said to them to do demos do, just like Jesus said to the disciples, leave the Pharisees' actions to me.  
But obey them.  
Same way the demons understand us and switch our principle.  
 So even if they are accusing you, how can you cast me out?  
You that you don't tell the truth.  
How can you cast me out?  
You lie out.  
You say, no, I sit in Jesus' seat.  
I order you to come out.  
Then we leave.  
Is this supposed to judge us?  
Okay, okay.  
Let me show you scripture.  
Zechariah chapter three.  
 Let's read from verse 1.  
You see something now.  


  
Zachariah chapter 3 from verse 1.  
And he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the angel of the Lord, and satan standing at his right hand to resist him.  
 What's he trying to do?  
Is there to accuse?  
Okay, next verse.  
And the Lord said unto Satan, the Lord rebuked thee, or Satan.  
Even the Lord that had chosen Jerusalem rebuked thee.  
Is not this a branch blocked out of the fire?  
Is that to resist him?  
And what does the Lord say?  
Joshua, you see now?  
If you were doing the right thing, would Satan be here to resist you?  
Was that what he said?  
No!  
He turned to Satan and said, the Lord rebuked you.  


  
 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  
 Demons are with Satan.  
He said when he speak it, he speak it natively as a liar.  
He cannot tell the truth.  
Satan doesn't tell the truth.  
He cannot, he said, it is not in him to tell the truth.  
He can't tell the truth.  
He naturally cannot tell the truth.  
 talking to people, casting out devils, and then they said that, so the devil now said that he was 14 years ago, sat telling all the story.  
Stop where Jesus stopped.  
Where did he stop?  
What is your name?  


  
That is enough.  
My name is Legion, for we are men.  
He can go ahead and say, we are ten of us.  
 And I know that I cast out, I know that sometimes they tell lies.  
They tell you we are three, and I find they are nine.  
So I only used the one that, what is your name?  
That's what Jesus asked.  
He wasn't engaging them, he said, okay, now tell me.  
You know, some people were cast out there, they keep the person, they're cast out there for days, consulting with him.  
Consulting with him.  
 Tell me exactly when you came here.  
Tell me exactly when you came here.  
So they've written that.  
Okay, what are the things you have done?  
What are the things you have done?  
Then we say, I keep three people.  
I keep three people.  
I keep three people.  
I keep three people.  
I shot one.  
I can't one.  


  
And we're recording what is said.  
Let's write it down.  
It's that he shot one, it's that he caught one.  
 And he died.  


  
And you really believe all those tears that devil is telling you?  
What did Jesus say about him?  
That he tears lies.  
Ask him only the question Jesus asked.  
What is your name?  
Is it enough?  
I'm telling you to get out.  
I'm telling you to get out.  
 Then I said, I'm the one that I've been traveling to charge.  
I'm the one that I've been traveling to charge.  
Now we continue to travel to charge.  
Then you see.  
Okay, okay, okay.  
So you're the one traveling to charge.  
Yes, yes.  
I travel to charge.  


  
 And he's writing it down.  
He's the one that's telling the church.  
So how many of you have been telling the church?  
There are ten of us.  
You know, you don't need to get the information from him.  
Because he's a deceiver.  
Most likely, he's deceiving you.  
 Once he said, I'm the one who just said, you are living now.  


  
You are living now.  
He said, I will go if my other, my team members will follow me.  
Say, who are your team members?  
They are 15.  
Two of them are past.  


  
 That's the way they've caused chaos in certain churches and in certain circles.  
So now, instead of the gift of desorino spirits, we are using what?  
Demonic consultations.  
He's now telling us, he's revealing to us.  
We believe him.  
He told me he has 15 people here.  
I believe him.  
I really believe him.  
A devil.  


  
 No, years ago, a man was casting out devils, a man of God casting out devils.  
Then the devil, after a while of wrestling, I'm not going, I'm coming out, I'm not going.  
Then he says, Jesus Christ defeated you.  
He said, no, don't say that again, don't say that again.  
Then he said it again.  
And the devil said, no, no, don't say that.  
Then later on, the devil said, OK, let me just tell you the truth.  
Let me tell you the truth.  
 The truth.  


  
And they were telling the truth.  
And you know what?  
The devil gave him the history, how he fell, and how all these things, you know, things that we are supposed to be seeing in the Bible.  
How everything came and how he was defeated, but not completely.  
 You know that man of God actually wrote the story in the book?  
Sit down toward him the truth.  


  
And use the statements or the devil that he was casting out as things to warn God's people on things they should be very careful of.  
 And there are a lot of things that people tell us.  
They got from the devil.  
They tell us the things we should be very careful about.  
 Very careful.  
If you sleep and you wake up with something like this, be careful.  
If you want to sleep, make sure you don't drink too much water.  
You might dream, this kind of dream.  
Be careful.  
If you want to have your butt, make sure that you face this side or be careful.  
So we find ourselves becoming very careful about different things because we don't want demons to come into our lives, come into our lives.  


  
 Demons.  


  
Wonderful.  
You have to be very careful.  
If you find yourself drinking in your dream, then the devil has come into your life.  
No, a thousand times no.  
 No.  
No.  
Don't accept those things.  
We have been placed far above brings uponities and powers.  
Far above them.  
We're far above them.  
We're far above them.  
 And do you know that if you're studying the scriptures, even if you had devils in your life, which you opened up to, you know, a Christian can open himself to a devil, or there are many ways of opening yourself to a devil.  
There are several avenues.  
Number one is believing in life.  
The same way that when you believe truths, God's spirit enters into you through your believing truths.  
That's the same way Satan enters into a man through his believing lies.  
 You believe lies, you can receive demons coming to your life.  
It's just plain simple.  
So you accept the word of God and not satan's confessions.  
Are you hearing me?  
So it's important that we stay on God's word and not what the devil tells us.  
 Demons can come into someone's life through fear.  
Because remember, life begets like you attract what is in you.  
If you have faith, you attract the spirit of faith.  
You attract the things of God.  
If you have fear, you also attract the spirit of fear.  
You attract the spirit of fear.  
Fear brings demons into someone's life.  
 So unbelief does, fear does, bitterness does, anger does.  
These are all evil things that bring demons into someone's life.  
I'm talking about even a Christian.  


  
Can open a door.  
How can they go?  
 If you meditate on the Scriptures, study the Word of God.  
The same way those devils ain't tied without announcements.  
They can also leave you without announcements.  
That's the power of God's Word.  
The power of God's Word.  
When the light comes, the darkness leaves.  


  
 Because you know, as you receive God's word, faith starts coming to you.  
And what happens?  
Fear starts leaving you.  
As fear leaves, so does the spirit of fear depart.  
As you study the word of God, the love of God is increased in your life.  
Hatred, anger, and unbelief, they just go.  
And as they leave you, so do the demons that follow them also leave.  
They just leave.  
 That's why it's not every one we minister to people, even when their demon possessed, and they don't know God.  
Once we bring the gospel, what does the Bible say?  
Romans chapter 1 verse 16, turn to it.  
Yeah, this is why I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.  
 The gospel is the power for salvation.  
So if it will work for non-Christians, how much more easily will it work for Christians?  
Which means if I preach the gospel to a non-Christian, even if it was demon possessed, I'm bringing the power of God that brings salvation.  
Salvation from demons, salvation from sin, and brings him into righteousness.  
Once he hears this gospel, his heart receives the light of God.  
Darkness dissipates.  
 The same thing with a Christian who is here in the world.  
The word of the gospel.  
Love is minister to him.  
Fate is minister to him.  
As he listens, hatred disappears.  
Fear disappears.  
Unbelief, he just notices that he's changed.  
That's why if you keep preaching and teaching the Word of God, you will find that you are transforming lives in the church.  
 So even if you're told, that boy, that girl, that brother, that sister is this or that, trust the message that God has given you.  
It is a weapon.  
It will produce results.  
It's a weapon.  
The gospel is the power of God.  
The gospel is the power of God.  
Alleluia.  
 The next one, 1st Timothy chapter 6 verse 12.  


  
This is, fight the good fight of faith.  
Lay hold on eternal life.  
We're going to die out also called and ask professor good profession before many witnesses.  
Fight the good fight of what?  
Faith.  


  
 So no matter what you're going through, you stay what?  
In faith.  
And you refuse to go into unbelief.  
It's a struggle, standing in faith in God's words.  
No matter the kind of deception that Satan tries to pull against you, but you're standing in God's words.  
See, so each one of us has that fight of faith.  
So he says, lehot on eternal life.  
 Hallelujah.  


  
Now, let me show you another thing here that's very important.  
So you understand that we are not alone and there is a spiritual warfare and angels carry out the things that we say in the name of the Lord.  
They do.  
They do.  
They do.  
 They don't carry out human instructions.  
But if language means anything, Jesus gave us the power of attorney to use his name.  
So when I use the name of Jesus, I'm no longer using my human authority.  
I'm using the authority of Jesus Christ.  
What I cannot tell an angel to do,  
 In the name of the Lord, He will do.  
Can you see the difference?  
Let me show you something.  
Samadus goes to chapter 26.  
From verse 51,  


  
 We talked about Elijah that had that army all around him.  
Look at this.  
Behold, one of them, which were with Jesus, stretched out his head and drew his sword and struck his servant of the high priest and smote of his ear.  
You remember when Jesus was arrested?  
Okay, now Peter did this.  
 52, then said Jesus unto him, put up again thy sword into his place, for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.  
53, think as thou that I cannot now pray to my father, and he shall presently give me more than 12 legions of angels.  
If Jesus could, so can we.  
 He says, don't you think that I can ask my father right now?  
And he will give me 12 legions of angels?  


  
Hi.  
So what were you waiting for all the time you were fleeing and running?  
I refuse to fear.  
 He says, thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and shall presently give me more than 12 legions of angels?  
Next verse.  
But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that does it must be?  
In that same hour said Jesus of the multitude, I come out as against the thief with swords and staves for to take me.  
I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you laid no hold on me.  
 Now he's in charge of the meeting, but all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled, then all the disciples for Sukhim and fled.  
Can you see that?  
Peter's trying to fight for Jesus, and Jesus has put back your sword.  
Don't you think I can ask my father now and he will give me 12 legions of angels?  
He's trying to remind him about Elijah.  
 because it was not only light, it was for every one of us.  
We are protected.  
And the interesting thing is that Jesus said, don't you think I can request right now?  
Which means even if we were outnumbered, I can have reinforcement right now.  
But he's not allowing the angels to do anything.  
 because the scriptures must be fulfilled.  
So Jesus lets down his life.  
Said, this one thing I received from my father, he gave me part to lay my life down and part to take it up again.  
So the angels are there waiting and it gives no instruction for action.  
So they stay action.  
You remember what Elijah did to those guys?  


  
 They were struck with blindness.  
What do you think they are on their own evil angels?  
What do you think happened to them?  
They were all arrested.  
Elisha's spiritual angels arrested the angels that came with those soldiers and took them away and Elisha took these ones away and they were all blinded.  
Their eyes were opened but they knew not where they were going and took them into the heart of the city.  
When they got there, you opened their eyes.  


  
 whatsoever thou shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.  
That means heaven is with us.  
Amen.  
We are not alone.  
Glory to God.  
We are not alone.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Let me show you two things now then.  
 Second Samuel, chapter 24.  
Let's read from verse 15.  
So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed.  
And they died of the people from Danivan to Bathsheba, 70,000 men, 70,000 people.  
That's a whole lot of people.  
 All men, and they died.  
And when the angels stretched out his hand, it was an angel that was killing them.  
But on the earth, it was a kind of pestilence and some unknown disease.  
What kind of trouble is this?  
There's some epidemic in town, they said.  
People are just dying and already reported 70,000 people.  
And now the sickness is about to go into Jerusalem.  
 Look, and when angels stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the Lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people, it is enough.  
Stay now, thy hand.  
And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing place of Aarona, the Jebusites, the angel of God.  
He's doing this.  
He's destroying people because of what David did when he numbered Israel.  
 People don't know there's an angel involved.  
They just see people dying.  
People are just dying.  


  
Next verse.  
And David speak unto the Lord when he saw the angel.  
David was a prophet of God.  
And God opened his eyes and he saw vision.  
He saw the angel that smote the people and said, no.  
 I have sinned, and I've done wickedly, but these sheep, what have they done?  
Let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me and against my father's house.  
And God got the prophet, came that day to David, and said unto him, go up, re and alter unto the Lord in the trenching flow of around the Jebusite.  
See, he's praying to God, doesn't know what to do.  
He's hoping that God would just change his mind.  
 and the prophet of God comes to you and says, no, it's not like that.  
There's a way to do this thing, you know, and shows him, gives him instruction of what to do.  
So it's really an altar and offers sacrifice to God.  
Okay, so go to, let's read 19th verse, verse 19.  
And David, according to the saying of God, went up as the Lord commanded.  
 Verse 25, Anarana looked and saw, no, no, no, and David built there an altar onto the Lord and offered bond offerings and peace offerings.  
So the Lord was in treated for the land and the plague was stayed from Israel.  
They only knew there was a plague, but they know it was spiritual.  
 But something began to happen in the physical realm.  
Hallelujah.  
At the end of time is the church that's going to cause the final battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil.  
And I want to show you something very interesting about it.  
Revelation chapter 12.  


  
 from verse 7.  
Have you seen it?  
And there was war in heaven.  
Now not in God's heaven, it's like you say the heavenlies, okay?  
And there was war in heaven.  
Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels.  
This is going to be the final battle between them.  
 and prevailed not.  
Neither was their place found anymore in heaven."  
That's in the heavenlies, okay?  
And the Great Dragon was cast out, that old serpent called a devil and Satan, which to see that the whole world, he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him.  
 They couldn't function in the heavens anymore.  
And I heard a loud voice saying, see, they're being defeated.  
Watch now.  
I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.  
Hallelujah.  
And there overcame Him.  
 I thought the angels were going to say, we overcame.  
No!  
If the angels didn't think they overcame, they are crediting us with the victory.  
Because of what we did.  
You see, we were responsible for the fights.  
Remember, when Daniel prayed, the angel of God was dispatched from heaven.  
 And then he encountered the prince of Persia.  
And while he was there, the prince of Israel was sent, Michael the Archangel, to fight the prince of Persia and release this angel who went, deliver the message and said, I'm going back to the fights.  
I'm going back to fight the prince of Persia.  
And after I'm gone, the prince of Grisha shall come.  
So Grisha will replace Persia because we're going to overthrow this devil.  
 But when they do, Satan will reappoint another one.  
Who caused it?  
Daniel.  
Daniel was the reason for all that fight.  
Daniel quickened the hand of God to cause the prophetic electrons to be established.  
 And this is how the church is going to do it in these last days.  
He says, and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives onto the deaths.  
As we use, proclaim the blood in our communion, taking the communion, breaking bread.  
He says, as long as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, ye show the Lord's death till he comes.  
 And the word of our testimony would be a testimony of Christ as we continue to be a testimony, not walking in our own self-love.  
What does the Bible say?  
That war will take place.  
And Satan and his angels will be overthrown.  
And all those evil accusations against us will cease.  
 and the angels who proclaim they overcame Him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony.  
And they love not their lives unto the death.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
So just keep doing what you're doing, walking in love full of glory, teaching God's Word with your heart on the kingdom of God.  
Knowing that one of these days very soon, the Son of God will show up  
 And we will be cut away from here.  
Hallelujah.  
We'll get out of this world.  
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.  
Amen.  
Open your mouth and worship Him and pray.
