title: May 2023 â€“ The Month of Victory
---
 Praise God.  
This nonce of May, you want to know what it is, right?  
So I'm going to read you a scripture  
 In 1 John 5 verse 4, for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.  
And this is the victim.  
 that overcometh the world, even our faith.  
This month of me is a month of victory.  
And we have victory on every side, the power of the Holy Ghost.  
 Power of the Holy Ghost, the power of the Holy Ghost.  


  
And let me read you this scripture.  
If you turn on me chapter 20, I'm reading from verse number one.  
I want you to follow carefully what the Lord is saying.  
When thou goest out to battle against dine enemies,  
 and see us horses and chariots, and the people more than thou, be not afraid of them.  
For the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt."  
Did you see that?  
This is when you go out in battle against your enemy.  
And then you see horses.  
 And chariots, and there are so many numbers that you are outnumbered.  
He says, be not afraid of them.  
Why?  
Because with them is the arm of flesh.  
And with us is the spirit of the living God.  


  
 He told us, whatever is born of God is victorious over the world.  
And this month, especially, we will walk in victory by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
See victory only.  
 See victory only.  
You have victorious.  
Throughout this month, see victory only.  
Hallelujah.  
Right away we're going to pray and acquire leaders in the sound of victory.  
Hallelujah.  
 Glory to glory, victory to victory.  
Every phrase belongs to you.  
I hear the sound of peace.  
I sweet friends, you are the great.  
Oh, it was transfer.  
It's a home.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
We proclaim.  
Free trees we have won.  
From the names.  
Set some glory.  
To you Lord.  
To you Lord.  
We give you glory.  
Your word is  


  
 So glory to glory, victory the vision, as a repress.  
Wake me in your glory, your word is prepared, in every nation.  
Glory to glory, glory to glory, victory the vision.  


  
 your world is free from glory from glory to glory  


  
 The glory to glory, victory to glory, victory to glory, victory to glory, victory as a repress.  


  
 Glory to God.  
Glory to God.  


  
 Go ahead and worship Him.  
Talk to Him by yourself.  
Keep praying and phrasing Him for this month of victory.  
You're going to have a great month of victory by the power of the Holy Spirit.  
Say it out loud, say it's my month of victory.  
 Everywhere I go, everything I do, everything that concerns me, victory only.  
I see victory only in every situation.  
All things work together for good to us who love God, who are the cards,  
 according to His purpose.  
Thank you Lord.  
Amen.  
Glory to God.  
So let's do this song of praise.
