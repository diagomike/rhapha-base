title: December 2018 - The Month of Gathering Sheaves
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Hallelujah.  
This month is the month you want to hear.  
Okay.  
Go to  
 Psalm 126.  
Have you seen it?  
126.  
Read verse 6.  


  
Want to go.  


  
 Very nice.  
Go to Genesis chapter 37 and verse 7 and read.  


  
 All right.  
Well, it's not really what those two verses are giving you on the bigger picture that I'm trying to show you.  
I'm just trying to get you familiar with the term.  


  
A shift is a bundle of whatever.  
When you bind  
 some things together, like maybe you went to harvest your corn in the corn fields, and you were now binding them together, or rice, whatever.  
So this was what we just read, particularly written with these farmers in mind, okay?  
But it means to bond you together, all right?  
 This month is the month of gathering sheaves.  


  
It's a month of gathering sheaves.  
What's happening?  
What's happening?  
Did you know?  
Did you know their ideas that the Lord gave you during the year?  
Did you know?  
You need to gather them.  
 You need to gather them.  
Go find those things that the Lord spoke to you about and bind them.  
Bring them together.  
Because there are, there are things in there that you overlooked.  
And God wants to point out something to you.  
This is one of the sheaves.  
We call them idea sheaves.  


  
 It's a lot of gathering sheaves.  
Where are your idea sheaves?  
Go find them.  
Go gather them together.  
Bind them.  
This month you must gather them.  
Gather them.  
Find your notes.  
Find them.  
Wherever you put those things, go find them.  
And gather them together and review.  
Because God wants to talk to you.  
And God wants to update the information  
 Because some of that information is no longer useful because you didn't use them at the right time.  
Now, he needs to update them for you in a way that you can act on them and you give you the inspiration.  
It's the amount of gathering sheaves.  
Then your finances,  
 You be amazed where you have money that you have overlooked.  
You have money in different places that you have overlooked.  
Some of the money you have may be in cash.  
Some of them may be in some endeavor that you have forgotten about.  
Now God wants you to open your mind and gather these shives, your money shives,  
 Rather than you be amazed at the wealth that is about to come to you.  
You be surprised.  
Gather your money shifts.  
Ask the Lord to guide you.  
Where did you put money that you have forgotten?  
What in devil did you engage in that you have overlooked?  
 Where do you have money that accrues to you?  
And you fail to get it.  
Something is about to happen.  
So you're going to gather these sheaves.  
It's a month of gathering sheaves.  
 And the list is endless.  
As you pray in the Holy Ghost, He will be showing you each sheath, each sheath.  
As you pray, He will guide you.  
It's the month of gathering sheaves.  
It's the month of gathering sheaves.  
 He's about to do something really special in your life.  
I'm telling you.  
He's about to do something really special.  
He's about to do something really special.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, thank you Lord Jesus.  
What a blessing.  
What a blessing awaits each one of us.  
What a blessing.  
What a blessing.  
What a blessing.  
 Some of you have assets that could be turned into a numerous amount of money, although you didn't know.  
Something you have overlooked.  
You have assets that can be turned into wealth, but until you gather those sheaves, you cannot value them.  
Your God is about to guide you into those assets that you think  
 are useless.  
They're not useless.  
They're not useless.  
This is the month.  
This is the month.  
You are about to bring water out of the rock.  
This is the month.  
This is the month.  
That thing that looked like nothing, you are about to bring wealth out of it.  
This is the month.  
 Praying the Holy Ghost, everybody.  
Praying the Holy Ghost.  
Praying the Holy Ghost.
