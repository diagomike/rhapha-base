title: November 2017 - The Month of Exaltation
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Glory to God, this is the month of November and it's a beautiful month.  
 Just a few scriptures I want to share with you.  
The first one is from Psalms 12, Enverse 8.  


  
Pastor Larry, can you read it for us?  
Yes sir.  
 The wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted.  
Terrible.  
Did you see that?  
That's amazing.  
He says, the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted.  


  
He says, the wicked prowl.  
 They have a few days when the vilest men are exalted.  
And in many nations, the vilest men are exalted.  
The Bible says, the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted.  


  
You know, people with bad behavior, when they are  
 Exalted and celebrated.  
Then you'll have a celebration of wickedness.  


  
So think of the fact that the Lord said this in his word.  
So he's aware.  
He knows what's happening in our world.  
He's not caught up.  
He's aware.  
 He already said it.  
He said, when the wicked, when the vilest men are exalted, this is the wicked, walk on every side.  
They are everywhere, walking free.  
Then I want you to look at another verse, Proverbs chapter 11.  
 and verse 11.  
Master Fama, can you read that first?  
Yes, Pasa.  
By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted, but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.  
By the blessing of the upright, the city is exalted.  
A city can be overthrown  
 by the mouths of the wicked.  
But it tells us by the blessing of the upright, the city is exhorted.  
When the upright is blessed, when the upright prosperous, the city is exhorted.  
These are two important verses that tell us  
 what God is thinking.  
They tell us what is thinking.  
And God's plans for cities, for nations, families and individuals.  


  
In the mind of God, we are  
 We are functioning right now in a certain time.  
And that time is not on November in heaven.  
In God's timing, it's not on November.  
He doesn't have November.  
November is in the earth.  
 But every so often, we find ourselves walking in his seasons, in the seasons that God has planned for us.  
And if you're a child of God, you find you got to walk in the consciousness of God's plans.  
You don't just walk in the chronometer of the world, but you walk in the consciousness of God's heavenly seasons.  
 You walk under his atmosphere of blessings.  
Remember the Bible tells us when the children of Israel came out of Egypt, they carried their own atmosphere with them.  
That's amazing.  
The Bible says they were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.  
And so the presence of God overshadowed them from above and kept them  
 from the Scottish son.  
And then in the night time, it was the fire of God protecting them from the cold.  
God's presence was with them.  
They moved in the blessings of God in this Old Testament folks.  
 They're walking in that blessing because they were the seed of Abraham.  
And the Bible tells us, if we belong to Christ, we are Abraham's seed.  
And we belong to Christ.  
So we are Abraham's seed.  
And so we enjoy the blessings of the covenant.  
And that covenant is in the blood of Jesus Christ.  
 So we can expect to function in God's seasons, in God's planned seasons.  
So now again, and here's another beautiful thing.  
I've talked about this before.  
You know, every month we've got this inspiring messages coming from the Lord to us about the season we're walking in, in a particular month.  
 Don't walk away from it.  
At the end of that walk away from it.  
These are all wonderful blessings.  
Take them with you.  
For example, we've just come off October, a month of blessings.  
You know what I'm saying?  
I'm out of a month of October, so I'm out of the month of blessings.  
That's like functioning the earth.  
See, because you're out of October in the earth.  
But we're in God's seasons.  
 And so every new season, there's a new blessing.  
And all blessing, you don't throw it away.  
You can't along with you.  
So you're keeping blessings versus grace upon grace.  
It's not new grace replacing old grace, but grace upon grace.  
Grace upon grace.  
That's what the word says.  
It's grace upon grace.  
Hallelujah.  
 So here again, along with this wonderful blessings of the month of October, we come into November in the seasons of the Spirit and I'm praying and saying, Lord, what do we expect in November?  
I'm talking to the Lord that I'm ready to know.  
That's just this beautiful, wonderful month.  
 So how we function in your season?  
And God said, November is a month of exhortation.  
This is powerful.  
What do you mean to exhort?  
It means to raise in rank, in character or in status.  
It means to magnify  
 It means to increase, to enlarge.  
This is really great.  
It's a amount of exaltation.  
Oh, wow.  
Which means God's plan is to exalt you.  
This month he'll exalt you.  
The Bible says, the wicked prowl in the streets.  
 when the vilest men are exalted.  
And God's been seeing that.  
Now God says, I want to exalt my children.  
God's going to exalt you in a special way.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah.  
And when the righteous are blessed, the city is exalted.  
There's promotion in the city.  
The economy is boosted.  
 So God's got a strategy.  
He's got a strategy.  
His strategy for exalting a nation, blessing a nation, is to bless the just, the righteous, his children.  
And if you've been praying for your country, been praying for your city, been praying for your state, something is about to happen.  
 The righteous are being exalted.  
There's an opportunity in the realm of the Spirit and God is exhorting his children.  
The Bible says, the eyes of the Lord run to and fro upon the earth to show himself strong.  
On behalf of them whose hearts are perfect towards him.  
Says in the last days, the mountain of the Lord's house shall be exalted upon the mountains.  
 and above the hills, and all nations shall flow onto it.  
And they shall say, come ye, let us go on to the house of the Lord, and he shall teach us of his ways.  
Yes, for out of Zion shall the knowledge of the Lord be given.  
This is very, very powerful.  
This is something that's happening in the realm of the Spirit.  
We are as a fountain.  
 of God's love, of fountain, of living waters.  
And from us, we'll flow.  
And even now flowing, the gracious, gracious lessons of the living God coming out of us.  
And he's exalting us, he's positioning us in different places.  
 He was going to say, uh-oh.  
Think about the day that Samuel the prophet went out to look for David.  
Nobody was expecting it.  
Nobody thought it could be David.  
But the Lord wanted to exhort his people.  
He wanted to bless his people.  
He wanted to magnify his people, establish his people.  
And what did he do?  
He located David.  
 and blessed him and made him king.  
And when he did, Israel was blessed.  
God wants to do something very special, where you are.  
And this is your time, this is your moment.  
And God is going to exalt you.  
 You know, the Bible says, the Lord will exhort you in due time.  
In due time.  
Which means he hasn't appointed time.  
And this is due time.  
Glory to God.  
This is due time.  
This is the time.  
This is your season in the presence of God.  
 And you just, you, you say, is there anything I can do about it?  
Oh, yes!  
You get ready for it.  
You say, Lord, this is my season and I am exalted in the name of Jesus.  
I'm positioned in the name of Jesus.  
I'm positioned for that place that you have planned for me.  
I receive all that you have for me.  
In this season, this is my season.  
 Now think about it, what we said to exhort is to raise in rank, in character, or in status, to increase, to enlarge, to magnify.  
Think about it.  
It means to be put ahead.  
That's wonderful.  
That's wonderful.  
To advance.  
I'm being advanced of the Lord.  
Mama, mama.  
 I'm being put ahead by the power of the Spirit of God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
What a time.  
What a moment.  
What a season.  
What a season.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Go ahead and thank Him by yourself.  
It's your month of exhortation.  
Thank Him.  
Thank Him.  
Thank Him and rejoice in His presence.  
Hallelujah.
