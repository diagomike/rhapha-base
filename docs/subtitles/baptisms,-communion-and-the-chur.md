title: Baptisms, Communion and the Church
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and he left us with a message to tell the untold, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and his unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
Baptisms, communion, or church.  
When you were born again, you were baptized by the Holy Ghost into Christ.  
What about Jesus is a sign, is the outward sign that you are done with the world forever.  
Every time we regret the sweet thing about our fellowship,  
 of his body and his blood.  
We are the body of Christ.  
So we are building the body of Christ.  
Every time you win a soul, you have brought another member of the house.  
Until the Church of Jesus Christ is shown to be the most beautiful thing, the most beautiful preacher, the most beautiful living thing, living organism.  
In the face of the earth, somebody shout hallelujah.  
 baptism, communion in the church.  
I want to share some thoughts on three important subjects.  
These are baptisms.  
 communion and the church.  
I want us to go to the words of Jesus, first on baptisms.  
Why this is important, maybe I should read to you from Hebrews chapter number six, from verse one.  
Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ  
 Let us go on onto perfection.  
Now, to properly express that, can you put it in the amplified version?  
Just let's read this.  
Therefore, let us go on and get past the elementary stage in the teachings and doctrine of Christ.  
Advancing steadily toward the  
 completeness and perfection that belong to spiritual maturity.  
Do you now understand what I'm saying?  
So you're moving from the elementary stage of the teachings and doctrine of Christ.  
Remember, he's talking about the teaching and doctrines.  
 King James, therefore, leaving the principles of a doctrine of Christ, let us go on on to perfection.  
Not laying again the foundation.  
Did you see that?  
Not laying again the foundation of repentance from the dead works and of faith to God.  
So I'm talking about the teaching of these fundamental principles.  
It says, we don't have to remain in the foundation school.  
Do you get it?  
 We've got to advance into other areas that have to do with spiritual maturity.  
Now, let's go back to the amplified version.  
 Therefore, let us go on and get past the elementary stage in the teachings and doctrine of Christ in Messiah, advance in steadily toward the completeness and perfection that belong to spiritual maturity.  
Let us not have gained the lane, the foundation of repentance and abandonment of dead works.  
 dead formalism and of the faith by which you turn to God.  
You know, there are some elementary teachings about faith, elementary teachings about leaving the bad works for good works and so on and so forth.  
You've got to move to maturity.  
So let's look at the list.  
Go back to King James.  
It's shorter here.  


  
 Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on under perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, that's one, and of faith to it God, that's two, of the doctrine of baptisms.  
You see, they're teaching about baptisms.  
Okay, they're teachings in the scripture about baptisms, and a lot of them, and of laying on of hands, they had to teach them.  
 about laying on of hands.  
Why do we lay hands?  
What's the significance?  
All right?  
What's the power of it?  
What does it do?  
They taught them.  
So the new why will lay the hands on people?  
Why we should?  
And when we shouldn't, it's not everybody who lays the hands on you.  
There's a doctrine, there's a teaching about laying on of hands.  
It is in Scripture.  
 It's not just everybody who lays hands on you.  
Care to be careful.  


  
Look at the next verse.  
And this will we do in God permit glory to God.  
All right.  
So I picked out one of those things there, baptisms.  
And I thought to say some things about baptisms because some don't think  
 These are important.  
But did you notice the doctrine of baptisms?  
He didn't say a baptism.  
There's a plural word there, baptisms.  
Okay.  
Now, let's look at St.  
Matthew's gospel, chapter number 28, verse 19.  
Look at this.  
It says, go in there for and teach our nations.  
Amazing.  
You're still there?  
 Zora Akhtabas.  
Go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.  
Did you notice he didn't say in the names of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost?  
There's only one name.  
The name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost is Jesus.  
That's the name.  
 the father responds in that name.  
The son, of course, answers that name.  
And the Holy Ghost answers to the name of Jesus.  
Holy Ghost is not His name.  


  
Over in the Old Testament, there were seven names for God.  
But in the New Testament, He gave us one name for God.  
 and it tells us that the totality of divinity resides in Jesus Christ.  
So the name of God in the New Testament is Jesus.  
That's amazing.  
 That's what the Bible teaches.  
Now, look at it.  
It says, going there from teach our nations baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.  
And so when we go over in the book of Acts and see what their apostles did when they baptize people, the Bible tells us they baptize them in the name of Jesus, which means they understood the instruction of Jesus to mean that the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost is Jesus.  
 So they understood the teachings of Jesus Christ very clearly because they had different kinds of baptisms.  
They have different kinds of baptisms.  
But the best way to help you understand it so you don't get confused is the word itself in the scriptural connotation.  
It had to do with  
 ritual washes.  
There were spiritual kinds of cleansing.  
So baptism was actually one of the several kinds of cleansings.  
So when we say there were different kinds of baptism, I want you to understand that here we're dealing with one type of baptism which had to do with washes, cleansing.  
 the one Jesus is talking about here.  
So he used the term that the disciples could understand because John the Baptist was the originator of this type of washing, of this type of cleansing.  
They used to cleanse themselves by washing their hands and their feet and their face and that was all.  
 But when John came, he dipped them into the water.  
That's why it was called baptism.  
The brigad's baptism, it means to deep, completely into, to immerse completely.  
So he got a name for that.  
 The priest showed you how to wash your feet, wash your hands, wash your face, and you were done.  
But when John came, he was also a priest.  
John was a Levite.  
And he did his washings differently.  
He did the inside, so they called him John the Baptist.  
 the one who dips you inside.  
So are you going to sew and sew for your cleansing?  
Oh, yes.  
So they know what he's going to do, wash your face and your hands and your feet and you're done.  
Then they said, oh, you sprinkle on you.  
That was another type, another type of cleansing.  
Depending on what was on in your life, they either sprinkled on you and they washed your face and you're feeding your heads.  
 But if you were going to John, John wasn't going to sprinkle on you.  
John wasn't going to wash your face and your fingers and your... He was going to dip you inside.  
So they called him John the Baptist.  
He baptizes people.  
So he dips them inside.  
So when Jesus came, he didn't go to the others.  
He went to John.  
And he was dipped inside.  
 And remember, when John saw Jesus, he said, Master, I'm supposed to be baptized by you.  
So Jesus said, don't worry.  
Get this down to fulfill all righteousness.  
We've got to do it.  
So he let him baptize him.  
So go to St.  
Mark's Gospel, chapter 16, and we start reading from verse 15.  
 And he said unto them, Jesus is talking, go here all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.  
I like it.  
Oh boy, this is one of my best scriptures.  
He said, why?  
Why is it like this?  
Oh, I'm wondering what you think is so good for me here.  
Is it the instruction to go here in all the world and preach the gospel?  
So here, he said that.  
But that's not what really excites me.  
I want to tell you what excites me here.  
 Should I tell you?  
Every creature.  
That's the part that excites me.  
Because every creature means, boy, everything.  
That's what it means.  
That's what it's saying.  
Preaches the gospel to everything.  


  
You know,  
 a teenager, I remember one day, I preached.  
But I didn't know the scripture like this then.  
What I preached was so accurate.  
Or in a family, Catherine, who my dad was leading us in prayer and sharing of the scriptures.  
So, and they gave me an opportunity to talk.  
 and I began to talk about preaching the gospel and talking to everything.  
And just about that time, my dad had about three vehicles that were not working.  
They were not moving.  
And I said, like those cars outside, I was talking.  
I said, you can preach to them and talk to them and it's that moving.  
And I noticed my dad looked like, hm?  
I had never heard that before.  
 All right, so now I'm saying, you can talk to those cars, preach to those cars, and there's that movement.  
Years later, I saw so many scriptures in God's word that let me know how right I was.  
You can talk to everything, preach the gospel to every creature.  
 He that believes and is baptized shall be saved.  
But he that believe it not shall be damaged.  


  
But no one that concerns us, he that believes and is baptized.  
Don't take, see, he's talking about water baptism.  
How many of you here have not been baptized in water?  
 Raise your hand.  
Raise your hand.  
Just wave it like this.  
Yeah, some of you.  
You're not being baptized in water.  
Okay, how many have been baptized in water?  
You're gonna see that many.  
Good.  
So it's important that you are baptized in water.  
It is important.  
Now, you might ask, if I don't get baptized in water, will I go to hell?  
No.  
 if you didn't know about it.  
Because baptism doesn't save you.  
But when you get to know about it and you have the opportunity and you don't, something is wrong.  
Because if you sat selecting what you will follow in the scripture and what you want, you are living in rebellion.  
And the baptism is no rebel as a place in God's kingdom.  
 So, you just saw it.  
Hear that, believe it, and it's baptized shall be saved.  
So, get baptized.  
And when we win souls, we need to let them know that it's not over.  
There's something more.  
Come to church.  
See?  
Get taught.  
Did you notice they taught them about baptisms?  
 There's some people who say, we don't need foundation school.  
How else can you describe foundation school outside Hebrews chapter six from verse one, two, three?  
That's foundation school.  
If you ever went to foundation school, stop clapping now then.  
Thank you.  
Hallelujah.  
That's foundation school.  
Didn't you read that Paul had them in a school  
 He used a school and was teaching the new believers for a space of two years.  
The new believers.  
He used the school.  
That doesn't mean it was a school itself, but it does suggest something.  
He didn't say he used the class.  
He used the school.  
In school.  
 Often a school will have several classes.  
If Paul had them in several classes, it must mean he had some other people who were helping to teach.  
So they had them in different classes.  
So some people were ahead of others.  
It must be.  
No wonder he needed a school.  
Are you still there?  
It's important.  
 Pastor Chris will be right back.  
There are no limits to what you can achieve and no restrictions to what you can enjoy.  
His name brings to us repentance, permission and forgiveness, eternal life, healing and health, the Holy Spirit and His ministry.  
From this transforming teaching, five blessings in His name, you will learn deep truths about the blessings we have in Christ.

Let's look at this power of baptism.  
What it means.  
Romans chapter 6 verse 3.  


  
 No, you know that so many of us, as we're baptized into Jesus Christ, we're baptized into His death.  
Notice, this is so interesting.  
He says baptized into Jesus Christ.  
We're baptized into His death.  


  
Next verse.  
 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like us Christ, like us Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  
Colossians chapter 2 verse 12.  


  
 buried with him in baptism, wherein also he had risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who had raised him from the dead.  
When that minister of God dipped you into the water, it was in likeness of his burial.  
First, in your confession of faith and believe that God raised Jesus from the dead and proclamation of his logic by which he received salvation.  
 You know that you identified with you.  
And then in confirmation of your faith, in confirmation of your faith, we baptize you in water.  
When you're dipped in, you're buried with him by baptism into death.  
When you are raised out of that water, you are raised in the face of the operation of God who raised Jesus from the dead.  
 And so what we read in Romans is that now you must walk in newness of life because you have a new life.  
It's a significant thing.  
You see, the children of Israel, the Bible tells us that when they went out of Egypt, Egypt was a type of the world.  
Then it says that they were baptized onto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.  
 There were baptized under Moses in the cloud and in the sea.  
And it likens the baptism in the sea to what a baptism?  
Even though there were baptized under Moses in the cloud, which is a type of the Holy Ghost, are you following this?  
 They still were like, okay, we might be dragged back to Egypt.  
But when they were baptized onto Moses in the sea, Egypt was separated from them forever.  
What aboutism is a sign, is the outward sign that you are done with the world forever.  
Forever.  
No more worldliness.  
 You are no longer the Bible tells us Egypt was cut away from the children of Israel forever.  
When do we baptize in the sea?  
Egypt drowned in the sea when they tried to go through what Israel went over to the other side.  
So once you have baptized, you are over on this side.  
So you said you must now walk in newness of life.  
Your old girlfriend is no longer your girlfriend is over.  
 It's over.  
That life is over.  
It's over.  
You're baptized in the sea.  
You have come out on the other side of the sea.  
If they try to follow you, they will drown.  
They can't.  
Why?  
Because they were not baptized onto Moses in the clouds.  
Only those who were baptized onto Moses in the clouds can be baptized in the sea and come out alive.  
 Are you still there?  
I know that many people think that the term to be baptized in the Holy Ghost means when you receive the Holy Spirit, but that's not really true in Scripture.  
That's not true.  
When you're baptized in the Holy Ghost is actually when you're born again.  
That's when you're baptized into the Holy Ghost.  
Receiving the Holy Ghost and being baptized in the Holy Ghost are not the same.  
 when you're born again according to the Scriptures is when you're baptized in the Holy Ghost.  
Can you see it?  
And then you receive the Holy Spirit.  
The second experience is to receive the Holy Spirit into you.  
The first experience is when the Holy Ghost receives you into Him.  
That's when you're born again.  
You're baptized into Christ.  
You're baptized into God.  
 You see, that's when you, if any man be in Christ.  
First Corinthians chapter 12, that's verse 13, so you can see it.  
First Corinthians chapter 12, for by one spirit, that's the Holy Ghost.  
Are we all baptized into one body?  
Whether we be Jews or Gentiles.  
Did you see that?  
So by the Holy Ghost, are we baptized into one body?  
 What body is that?  
Christ, the body of Christ.  
When you were born again, you were baptized by the Holy Ghost into Christ.  
How are you following this?  
Very important.  
On the day of Pentecost, they were born again that day and also received the Holy Spirit to live in them that day.  
It has happened to many people.  
The same day they're born again, same day they received the Holy Ghost.  
 Some people wait, they don't even know anything about the Holy Ghost.  
They're like the ones in Ephesus, they never even heard about the Holy Ghost.  
So they say, well, I don't know anything about the Holy Ghost.  
Then maybe some months later, maybe some years later, then they receive the Holy Ghost.  
So being born again is actually, according to the scripture, if you study the scripture, you discover this.  
 That is when you have baptized into the Holy Ghost, by the Holy Ghost, into Christ, into God.  
John calls it being in God, and he distinguishes being in God from God being in you.  
You see that?  
You are born again, you're in God.  
See?  
Now, when you receive the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is the third person of the God here with saying,  
 But that's because we get to learn about him.  
He begins his actual ministry as the thought of the three.  
But in reality, he's the first to be revealed in the scriptures, writing Genesis, verses, and the spirit of God.  
Says, allohim created the word that created the heavens and the earth, and allohim is plural of God.  
It's plural.  
 But then it says, and the spirit of God moved over the waters.  
He's the first to be shown to us in the God here, praise the Lord.  
But he's the last of the three to begin his ministry or to carry out his ministry.  
Jesus said, I'll pray the Father, and he shall send you another comforter, even the spirit of truth.  
 then on the day of Pentecost, he came to begin his work of leading the church.  
There's something I want to tell you about the Holy Ghost.  
I really hope we can get there.  
Very important.  
I hope we can get there.  
But okay, you're getting this stuff.  
Very important.  
I'll just look at something here in Acts 8 and verse number 38, just to show you something.  


  
 And he commanded the charator to stand still, and they went down, both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.  
Did you notice?  
The boat went where?  
Into the water.  
I'm giving you an example.  
And then he baptized him.  
They went into the water.  
He baptized him in the water.  
 He didn't take a cup of water from the tap and pour his head.  
So you are now baptized.  
Praise God.  
All right.  
Now, so baptism is very important.  
What are baptism and talking about?  
What about this?  
But we did say there's a teaching about baptisms.  
The first baptism is the Holy Ghost baptism, being baptized of the Spirit, and that is being born again.  
Okay?  
And I gave you  
 a shadow of what was to come from Moses and the children of Israel.  
I'll give you a shadow of that.  
And after that baptism, which is likened to being baptized into Christ by which you become a Christian, now you're born again, then you go for water baptism.  
 When you baptize, it is your testimony of your faith in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus.  
And if you believe in the resurrection of Jesus and you've been baptized to prove that you believe in it, it says you must now live accordingly.  
Live in newness of life.  
Have a new life from a child of God.  
I've been baptized in water.  
It's my testimony.  
 Baptism is a testimony of your faith in his death, burial, and resurrection.  
It is a testimony.  
Praise God.  
All right, now here's another important thing.  
I said, the communion.  
You know, every month, because that's the most convenient for us.  
The Bible didn't say do it every month.  
All right, but that's the most convenient for us.  
Now, we want to read  
 First Corinthians, chapter 11, and I do read this to you, every communion service.  
Communion is important.  
A lot of times you have those, will you be in the communion service?  
I'm not sure what I'm gonna come or not.  
Where are you going?  
You have this appointment with a friend.  
Is it so important that communion that's only once a month, you can make it?  
Is it such a light thing to you?  
 from verse 23, 1st Corinthians chapter 11, from verse 23.  
For I have received of the Lord that which also I deliver unto you that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.  
And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, take, eat, this is my body which is broken for you.  
This do in remembrance of me.  
 Uh-huh.  
After the same matter also, he took the cup when he had stopped saying, this cup is the New Testament in my blood.  
This do he as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me.  
Jesus said to do it in remembrance of him.  
Oh, this is my body which is broken for you.  
 Do this in remembrance.  
This is the cup of the New Testament in my blood.  
This is it shed for many for the remission of sins.  


  
The cup of the New Testament.  
Why is this so important?  
It is the testimony of the gospel  
 It is the testimony of the New Testament, the new will.  
God's new will.  
The baptism, who said, is the testimony of my salvation, my faith in his death, burial, and resurrection.  
Now, the communion.  
 is my testament of my identification with his body and his blood.  
This is so important, brothers and sisters.  


  
 Look at this.  
First verse chapter 10.  
I'm gonna read from verse 15.  
Notice what it says here.  
From verse 15, I speak as to wise men.  
Judge you what I say.  
Next verse.  
 The cup of blessing, which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?  
The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?  
You see that?  
For we, being many, are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread.  


  
Glory to God.  
 Let me show you some more.  
Look at this verse 18.  
Behold Israel after the flesh.  
That is, he says, the Israel of the Old Testament, the natural human natural Israel is referring to them now.  
And not they which eat of the sacrifices, partikas of the altar.  
What say I then?  
Hmm.  
Listen.  
 that the idol is anything or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything.  
But I say that the things which the Gentiles, the heathen, sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God.  
And I would not that he should have fellowship with devils.  
Oh, so if I'm eating with people,  
 who have made sacrifices to devils, even though I'm not seeing the devils, I am having fellowship with devils."  
So he says, he warns them.  
Verse 21, he cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils.  
 You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils.  


  
What is it teaching us here?  
It matters where we go.  
It matters where we go.  
 and you find a Christian brother and a Christian sister.  
They have been Christians for a long time.  
Now they have a little bambino and you carry that child and what happens, they don't understand why his head is not standing on his shoulder.  
All the time, all the time, all the time.  
And then every once in a while when it looks like this, even they are scared.  
 They know something is wrong with the child, but nothing is wrong with either of them.  
Because with their faith, they have been able to suppress demonic things in their lives.  
But they have had fellowship with demons.  
Now they have passed that devil to the child and they're wondering where did it come from?  
Where did it come from?  
He warned you.  
He warned you.  
 If you was a brother, you marry a sister.  
There are demons in her life.  
You're going to have fellowship with demons.  
Why you and the lady may not necessarily experience any serious or severe problems with demons very likely because demons have been here from the dead last past.  
They've been here.  
So they don't mind waiting.  
 They don't mind waiting till children start coming before they start manifesting themselves.  
Because if they manifest themselves, they know you have faith.  
You send them away, so they're quiet.  
But all the time you've been carrying them everywhere.  
And you notice something about yourself.  
Everyone's in a way you are rebellious.  
The sign has been there.  
You just didn't know.  
Everyone's in a way.  
The pastor is preaching about something you get angry.  
Why should he talk like that?  
 Then you come down again, you are nice again.  
Every once in a while there's this manifestation of some bitterness in your life.  
Someone has wronged you.  
Every time you see him, you are upset.  
But because of God.  
Because of God.  
Because of God.  
You are doing because of God.  
You are suppressing.  
 You didn't forget, you are suppressing.  
So the demons are suppressed.  
But soon, they're just showing up in your children.  
Very rebellious and sometimes very wicked.  
And the demons can wait till the boy is 15 years old.  
They're nice, until they grow up.  
Then you just hear, I don't want to come to church anymore.  
 I just want to tell you, I'm not a Christian.  
You say, what?  
He is not scared of you.  
Why?  
Because demons are there talking.  
He's not talking by himself.  
He has grown with these demons.  
Hatred for Christ.  
Hatred for the church.  
Hatred!  
 And you might be making excuses for him.  
You know, the reason he hates the church is because, you know, the church has actually mistreated us.  
The church mistreated you.  
Your life changed when you came to the church.  
Now he said, the church mistreated you.  
You know, the reason my son doesn't want to come to church is because for the past three years ago, detours, my son has not forgotten.  
I can't even forget when the mother didn't forget.  


  
 So I'm saying to you, I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.  
Careful.  
Careful.  


  
Because when the enemy strikes, he's a strategist.  
He looks for the best way to destroy the most.  
He goes for the most number.  
 If he knows that he can wait a little and take a whole lot of people, he'll rather wait than destroy one person and get in trouble.  
So he just waits.  
But you see, if you're following Jesus, then his word and listening to the Holy Ghost, you will have a greater strategy than Satan could ever plan.

 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
You still with me?  
So back to that first verse, verse chapter 11.  
We're in verse 25 now, 25.  


  
 I have to say manner or so.  
He took the cup when he had stopped saying, this cup is a new testament in my blood.  
This do he is often as you drink it in remembrance of me.  
Next, for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death.  
Chill he cup.  
Next, where for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord on wathily?  
Read.  
Shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  
 So what, next?  
But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup, examine yourself.  
All right, so something we do solemnly, we don't misbehave and act as if the communion doesn't matter.  
All right?  
You do it reverently.  
Next verse.  
 For he that eat it and drink it unworthily, eat it and drink it damnation to himself, not disowning the Lord's body.  
He is dealing with an unworthy manner, irreverently.  
When you're eating the communion, when you're serving the communion, do it reverently.  
Do it what reverently?  
 Do it reverendly.  
Otherwise, you're eating and drinking damnation, condemnation to yourself.  
Not deserting the Lord's body.  
Well, a message titled for this course.  
You've got to listen to both teachings, the two parts.  
All right, now, notice that last line, not deserting the Lord's body.  
Next verse.  
For this course, that's what we've got a title from.  
 Many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep die.  
For these doors many are weak, weak and sickly.  
 There's some Christians that are sickly.  
They're coming in and out of one sickness or the other.  
They always have some complaints.  
Today is my back, tomorrow is my front, my shoulder, my leg, my hand.  
They always hold my head sickly.  
 Often coming from the hospital, oh, I'm just coming from the clinic.  
The next time you meet them, I'm on my way to the clinic.  
I just returned from the clinic.  
I was on leave.  
What sick leave?  
I just came back.  
I'm traveling.  
Medical examination.  
 I just arrived from London.  
I was there for three weeks.  
They, you know, their journey is just from hospital to hospital, medical attention all the time, secretly among you.  
And they don't know why.  
The Bible tells us that there's a course.  
They don't discern the body of Christ.  
Go on, listen to that message.  
 Says, many are weak.  
Weak.  
Weak.  
That was not strong.  
Weak.  
Can't stand do.  
Can't stand.  
We've not even started this standing.  
Can't stand do.  
Please, che, che, che.  
 They want to sit.  


  
They're too weak for anything that has to be sustained for a long time.  
They're too weak.  
And they think it's nice.  
They think it's fashionable.  
You know, and those are until they're angry.  
Then you know they're tigers.  
 But one comes with spiritual things.  
I love you love.  
And I leave my voice to worship you.  


  
 Their own fasting, it has to break at 11 a.m.  
Because tomorrow is fasting, tomorrow is fasting.  
I have to wake up to eat.  
I have to wake up to eat.  
And doctors said, I should not eat, I should not fast.  
Not to say you should not fast.  
Don't fast.  
 Listen, if you don't fast when you shoot, you might be faster than when you shoot.  
You know what it is to be faster than when you shoot it?  
You are unable to eat.  
No one will instruct you to fast then.  
You just can't eat, they'll bring from say, I can't take it.  
But if you fast when you shoot, brother...  


  
 For this causes as many a week and sickly, sickly and many sleep.  
All right, Acts 13, verse, from verse 36.  
 We're not going to the next two verses.  
For David, after he had served his own generation, oh, by the will of God, fell on sleep and was laid onto his father's and so corruption.  
But he will not raise the gains on no corruption.  
Beat none unto you, oh God, Hallelujah.  
Beat none unto you there for men and brethren, that through this man, Jesus, is preached unto you.  
 the forgiveness of sins, the word to read remission, the remission of sins.  
And by Him, all that believe are justified from all things from which it could not be justified by the law of Moses.  
Through this man is preached unto you, the remission of sins.  


  
 And by Him, all that belief are justified from all things.  
What a reason to preach the gospel.  
What a reason.  
What a reason to preach the gospel.  


  
Through this man is preached unto you the remission of sins, the removal,  
 of sense, the blood in out of sense.  
And by him, all that belief had justified from all things, from which even the law of Moses couldn't help you.  
You know, in understanding,  
 the message that he brought to us.  
He told us, do this in remembrance of me.  
This is my body, which is broken for you.  
And then we read, we are all one bread.  
And at the bread that we break is a communion of the body of Christ.  
So we are born with you, the cup that we drink,  
 It is a communion of the blood of Christ.  
But we know what this means.  
His body was put on that cross.  
He died.  
His blood was shed.  
He gave up his life for us.  
So every time we break bread,  
 He says, remembrance of me.  
Do this in remembrance of me.  
Every time we break bread, there's something about our fellowship of his body and his blood.  
Through this man is preached unto you, the remission of sins.  
Think about it.  
All your sins are gone because of this man, Jesus.  
All your sins,  
 paid for by his blood.  
Every time you do anything wrong, every time you say anything wrong, every time you think anything wrong, the blood of Jesus Christ is the answer.  
Through this man, he's preached unto you the remission of sins.  
Your life is purified by his blood.  
 Your walk is purified by his blood.  
Why wouldn't you take the communion so seriously?  
The remission of sins.  
How big is this?  
Without the remission of sins, righteousness would have never been possible.  
When he removed our sins, it became a righteous thing for God.  
 to declare us righteous and at once to be recreated in Christ Jesus because all sins were paid for by His blood.  
No one owed God anything anymore.  
What was needed now was the power of a sin.  
Remission of sins had been done by His blood.  
Now life to be sinless.  
 Life, more powerful than sin, needed to be given.  
And in Christ Jesus, that became assured.  
It says to us, do this in remembrance of me.  
That takes me to the next thing, which is His church.  
In Matthew chapter 16 verse 18, look at it quickly.  
 And I say also unto thee, that thou at who?  
Peter, and upon this rock, I will be with my church and the gates of hell.  
 shall not prevail against it.  
I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."  
How many of you believe that?  
Do you believe it?  
 I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
Jesus said, I will build my church.  
This church must be so important to Jesus.  
This is the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
It must be so important to him.  
St.  
John chapter 21.  
 from verse 15.  
So when they had died, Jesus said to Simon Peter, this was, oh, I love it.  
This was after the resurrection of Jesus.  
He had been seen by his disciples to have been crucified.  
And then he was buried.  
They saw all that happened.  
He was buried and God raised him from the dead.  
Now he's with them again after his resurrection.  
What a joy.  
 And he's been telling them, I'm going away again.  
Okay, but this time to the father.  
So he says, viruses, when they have done, Jesus said unto Simon, Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love us thou me more than these.  


  
He said unto him, hear Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.  
He said unto him, feed my lands.  
 Do you love me more than this?  
What happened?  
He found Simon Peter.  
He had gone back to fishing.  
Simon Peter went back to his business after Jesus had died.  
He was back to business.  
See, even after the resurrection of Jesus, they had seen Jesus, but you know, they don't know he just appears and then they don't see him again and disappears.  
So what are we gonna do?  
Man, I'm gonna back to business.  
You remember he was broke.  
 Remember, Peter was broke.  
At the crucifixion of Jesus, Peter was broke.  
He had no money.  
So much so, Jesus had to ask John to take care of his mother.  
He said, oh, Peter.  
Because Peter was broke.  
Don't forget, except the three.  
Silver and gold, he was with John.  
Silver and gold, ha ha, none.  
Here's broke.  
He didn't say, have we, none, no, because he didn't know if John had something and John had something.  
 Yeah, Peter was broke.  
So he wanted to go back to business.  
Go back to business.  
And Jesus found him back in business.  
He was back in business.  
And now Jesus showed that he could supernaturally produce fish.  
And he says, bring some of the fish that you caught.  
And he brought some of their fish and they found Jesus had his own fish.  
 But, you know, they'd been within three years and seen all kinds of miracles.  
They didn't have to ask him where'd you get yours from.  
So, he just wanted them to see that they're the same.  
You can eat anyone.  
Now, he says, do you love me more than these?  
Because Peter, you know, he loved all those things.  
Oh, fish and business.  
Oh, I love fish.  
Okay.  
Put it back.  
 Simon, Peter, Son of Jonas, love is down me more than these.  
He said unto him, hear, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.  
He said unto him, feed my lands.  
Next.  
He said to him again the second time, Simon, Son of Jonas, and love is down me.  
He said unto him, hear, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee.  
He said unto him, feed my sheep.  
I don't know whether that pastor was listening.  
 Do you love him more than all these things you're watching?  
Do you love him more than all these things you're doing?  
Do you love him more?  
Oh, you'd rather have a holiday.  


  
Oh, do you rather be doing?  
Feed my sheep.  
This was more important to Jesus.  
This, do you love me?  
It is, yes.  
This is all right.  
Now feed my lads.  
 Feed my sheep.  
Does do you love me more than these?  
Then I want you to feed my sheep.  


  
Okay, next.  
 He said unto him the third time, Simon Son of John is, love is thou me, Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, love is thou me.  
And he said unto him, Lord, thou newest, all things, thou newest that I love thee, Jesus said unto him, feed my she.  


  
I don't go into the details of that because Peter's answer.  
 Do you Bible score as if you can go check what I'm telling you?  
Peter's answer was slightly different from Jesus' question.  
He wasn't actually answering what he was being asked.  
He was responding to something else, but that's not today's talk.  
So Jesus is showing something here.  
The church is important to him.  
The church is, look why the church is so important.  
If he's in chapter five, verse number 30, you'd see it now.  
 See it now, for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.  
This is who we are.  


  
First Corinthians chapter 12, from verse 26.  


  
 And whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it, or one member be honored, or all the members rejoice with it.  
Now he has the body of Christ and members in particular.  


  
Ephesians chapter 1, from verse 19.  
 And what is the accident greatness of his power to us would believe according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavily places.  
Watch far above all, principality and power and might and dominion and every name but his name not only in this world but also in that which is to come.  
 and had put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body.  
The church is his body.  
He says, He are.  
 the body of Christ and members in particular.  
The church is his body.  
So when he says, I will build my church.  
He's talking about the body of Christ.  
That is you.  
That's me.  
That's all our brothers and sisters all around the world.  
We are the body of Christ.  
Now, guess what?  
How can he build his church?  
He's gone.  
He's in heaven.  
How's he going to do it?  
He's gone to heaven.  
 Ephesians chapter 4, from verse 11.  
And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying, or the meal of the body of Christ.  
That word edifying is yielding.  
 The same words when Jesus says, I will build my church.  
That word is for the building of the body of Christ.  
It's translated and defined here.  
But the word is building.  
Same word, Jesus, I will build my church.  
So here he says, for the building of the body of Christ.  
So we are building the body of Christ.  
He's building his body through us.  
 Every time you bring a soul, you are like that guy that's carrying another block for the building.  
 Every time you win a soul, you have brought another member of the house.  
And those of us who are ministering are putting the blocks in the right places and working and building.  
You are bringing the materials.  
This is you are the body of Christ and members in particular.  
You are particular specific members.  
That's what is telling you.  
You are particular members, specific members.  
 Maybe you are there as a mill.  
Maybe you are there as a whatever it is.  
Oh, the block, the wood, anything, but you are in the building.  
Part of the floor, part of the words, part of the sanctions, whatever it is, has been being sold.  
 We're putting them in the right places.  
We're building the body of Christ.  
And this edifice is going to be a powerful superstructure.  
We are building.  
It's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger, shall we mean somebody?  
 Solomon was building God a house.  
He sent a message to her.  
He said, please send me materials.  
I need timber.  
He said, the house that I want to build for God is a magnificent building.  
Hallelujah.  
A magnificent building.  
Wow.  
Look how beautiful you are.  
 This is getting to be a magnificent building.  
But we are not through yet who will give him no rest until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.  
Until the Church of Jesus Christ is shown to be the most beautiful thing, the most beautiful creature, the most beautiful living thing, living organism in the face of the earth.  
Somebody shout hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
 We're building the body of Christ.  
We're not destroying it.  
We're building it.  
Don't destroy the body.  
Don't do things that undermine the body of Christ.  
For these cars, many are weak and sickly because they do not discern the body.  
But we do discern the body.  
 And we will build it.  
I'm building the body of Christ with Jesus Christ.  
Hallelujah.  
He's building through me.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm winning the source.  
I'm bringing the messages in and I'm building the body of Christ.  
Somebody shout Hallelujah.  
We've got to do it.  
 It's the most exciting thing.  
He said, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail.  
Look what we are building.  
Before long, it doesn't matter where you are being.  
Very, very soon, Satan will not be able to stand before you because we're building your faith strong.  
Hallelujah.  
 You may have been beaten once, maybe twice, maybe even seven times, but you are getting stronger by the day.  
You're rid of God.  
Your faith is getting stronger because we are building your faith strong.  
And the devil cannot withstand you.  
I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
Hallelujah.  
Somebody stronger every day.  
 I'm getting stronger every day.  
I'm getting stronger, and stronger, and stronger, and wiser, and greater, greater, greater.  
So greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Hallelujah!
