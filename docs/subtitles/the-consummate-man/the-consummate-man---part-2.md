title: The Consummate Man - Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirit.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your secret.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 Are you ready?  
Where's your Bible?  
Alright, sing that song.  


  
 Thank you.  
Now, if you don't have a Bible here, I feel sorry for you.  


  
 Are we ready?  
We read some scriptures last night and I want us to begin from there.  
We will start with Colossians chapter 4 and verse 12.  
 Colossians chapter 4 and verse 12.  
I want to read to you and remind you of some thoughts we try to express  
 Last night, Epiphras, who is one of you, or servant of Christ, saluted you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God, that you may stand perfect and complete.  
And this man was praying  
 according to the Spirit.  
And that's the reason it's written here for us, which means this is God's dream for us.  
This is God's will that we stand perfect and complete.  
And I explained last night that those words are synonymous.  
Sometimes you find the word perfect in place of complete and complete in place of perfect, okay?  
 But then, especially if you study in the New Testament, you'd find these three words that are used for perfect or complete, or entire.  
Now, in verse 12, Colossians 4,  
 You have the word perfect there.  
I told you last night is Talios.  
It particularly refers to being full grown, full grown, maturity, full grown.  
God wants you to come to maturity.  
 He wants you to be a full-grown Christian.  
You know, it's like parents of children.  
When they bring up children, they don't want the children to remain children all the time.  
No, they want you to grow up and that's why they take care of you.  
That's why they train you, they raise you to become a man, to become a woman.  
And then you can help other people in change your society and become influential.  
 to be able to help others.  
Same thing with God.  
You want you to stand perfect, maturity.  
Become full grown, a full grown Christian.  
Now let me remind you of something.  
Every one of us was born into this world by somebody.  
Is that right?  
You came in as a baby.  
 When you were born, you were a full human being, a complete human being.  
Did you become more human every day?  
Talk to me.  
As you grew up, you became more human?  
No, you never became more human.  
You were perfectly human from day one when you were born.  
 perfect human being.  
You couldn't become any more human than you were the day you were born.  
Same thing.  
Same thing.  
But then you became, you grew up and became full grown.  
Right?  
 They said you are an adult.  
You had grown up, but you didn't become more human.  
But you became wiser.  
You see, mature.  
Now you can do human things better, even though you were always human.  
 Now that you're full-grown, you can do human things better than you could when you were immature.  
Is that right?  
It's the same thing in the Spirit.  
You're born with the nature of God when you're born again.  
You don't become more like God  
 You're born like him from day one when you're born again.  
You're born of the Word of God.  
You're born of the spirit of God.  
You have one nature with him.  
But then you have to grow up to be able to do the God thinks.  
 like you did human things when you grew up.  
You see, the more mature you are spiritually, the more you can actually do spiritual things, fulfill God's dream for your life.  
That's the reason you see, you know, when we studied the Bible, many times people want to put the word to work.  
But I don't understand that there are certain things that they require  
 to be allowed to do such in the spirit.  
The things you want to happen and then you're unable to get them to happen.  
Why?  
Because you need to grow up to make them happen.  
 You say, but I had some of them happen when I just got started.  
Of course you did.  
But they didn't come to stay.  
When you become mature, those things will come to stay.  
They'll come to stay.  
And when they come to stay, they become a ministry.  
So each one of us is called into the ministry.  
 and we carry out ministry everywhere.  
First, He gives you the gift, and the gift is regulated by the Holy Ghost.  
And when you are faithful, in that gift, it becomes a ministry.  
When it becomes a ministry, then  
 It means that God now has charged you with responsibility because of your maturity now to wrong things.  
Let me explain.  
I would use healing as an example.  
There is a gift of healing and there is a ministry of healing.  
Okay?  
Now,  


  
 When you're given a gift of healing, it's regulated by the Holy Ghost.  
You can't make it start and stop at will.  
You see it?  
You don't bring it up and take it away.  
But you can decide to let it work when it comes or not let it work.  
It's like the gift of prophecy.  
 You don't make prophecy come when you want it.  
The gift of prophecy comes as the spirit of God wills.  
But you may not speak forts.  
You may not bring it forts.  
Because it doesn't make you say it.  
But it stares that thing within you and you receive the message.  
You may or may not give it.  
But you don't make it come.  
 all the gifts of the Spirit are that way.  
The Holy Spirit prompts them within us according to His will.  
Now if you're faithful in carrying out, administering that gift as the Spirit wills, then  
 it becomes a ministry.  
You see that?  
Then it becomes a ministry.  
Now what do you mean that it becomes a ministry?  
Does it mean that that particular gift translates into a ministry?  
No.  
It means that that ability is now embedded within your spirit to stay.  
 You see, it now stays and God then gives you the rights to carry it out at will.  
That's what we mean by ministry.  


  
You see that?  
For example, if you study in the Old Testament and you find the prophets of God,  
 Whenever a demand was placed on them to bring forth the word, they brought it forth because it was a ministry.  
It was within them to bring forth the word.  
It's like the pastoral ministry.  
You see, it's within your spirit and you are able  
 to lead, to guide, to nurture, and carry out the ministry of a pastel.  
It's within your spirit.  
And you can do it all the time, even when you didn't like the fellow.  


  
That thing wears up within you, and you become of help,  
 You do everything you ought to do for him or her, and you're glad about it.  
Because it's ministry.  
So whatever God puts within you with faithful with it, because his plan is to have you carry out that service at will.  
It begins with God staring you when he wants to  
 making it happen when he chooses to.  
And so you just know that the gift, the spirit of God, came on you to get this thing done.  
And after that, it's gone.  
Until the next time the spirit will.  
But if you're faithful, now how are you going to be faithful?  
Number one is to use it right.  
You use it according to the Scriptures.  
 Use it not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.  
And number two is to learn the word of God, to know the word of God, because if you don't know the word, then you will add.  
He said you add because you know not the scriptures.  
So you will add.  
You'll make mistakes with the gift.  
There are people who have made mistakes with the gifts of God.  
 And the reason was, they were ignorant.  
They were ignorant.  
So they made mistakes with the gifts of God.  
Number three, of course, everything else after this number two, studying the word of God, knowing the word of God, everything else would be dependent on number two.  
For example, being humble, then carrying out the gifts of God, being humble.  
Well, if you know the word, the word teaches you to be humble.  
 And you know, there are a lot of people who don't know what pride is.  
You cannot define pride in human terms.  
Only the word of God can actually let you know what pride is.  
Otherwise, if we call people proud, when they're not, just because we don't like them in Arizona.  
You see it?  
And we think they're proud.  
 But God's word only can tell you what pride is.  
So the more you study the word, the more you understand what pride is, and you get it out of your life.  
See, so he always wants us to carry out whatever he tells us in humility.  
Become a humble man.  
Actually, the more you grow in Christ, the more humble you are.  
You can tell someone who's not growing into the things of God.  
 He's not humble.  
Now, just because somebody said, you're not humble, doesn't mean you're not humble.  
Because those who try to humiliate you, humiliation and humility are not the same.  
All right?  
Yeah.  
 So you should be humble in doing the things of God.  
And if you are and God sees it, and you're growing in the Word, learning the Word, maturing in the Word, now you can't maturing the Word by just cramming the thing into your head.  
You've got to do it.  
See, you're growing the Word by learning the Word of God and putting it to work.  
You see, you study it and you do it.  
It's the one you do that stays in you.  
You see it?  
 It's the one you do that stays.  
And you want it to stay.  
So you're going to put it to work.  
You put it to work.  
Hallelujah.  
You're still there?  
Great.  
So as you're maturing the things of God and come up to being full grown,  
 You become spiritual.  
Now let me explain that.  
God tells us about the natural man.  
The natural man is the one who was born into this world, like everybody else, and has never been born again.  
He's the natural man.  
 in the Bible says he doesn't understand spiritual things.  
And that spiritual things are foolish to him.  
They get relate with them.  
He tries to understand and he still can't.  
Because spiritual things are discerned spiritually.  
So you get the natural man.  
Now, outside of the natural man, when you come to Christ,  
 to receive salvation, like those who came out last night as natural men.  
When they received Christ and became born again, they became as babies in spiritual things.  
Now they got to learn the word.  
They got to participate in the things of God.  
They got to be trained.  
They must be in the church.  
 They must go to church.  
You know, when we lead people to Christ, without telling them about the church, it's like a woman who goes to the maternity ward, gives birth, and leaves the baby for the nurses, and goes home.  
You don't give birth and walk away.  
You take the baby with you.  
 You don't come out and say, please, are there mothers in this place?  
What would work my baby?  
You don't do that except you've got problems.  
You know, like some people lead others to Christ and they say, well, you can go to any nice church.  
It's like having a child and then you say, well, this child can actually go to any mother.  


  
 You know, we think, we think we don't want to talk about our church.  
I'm not preaching church to you.  
I'm preaching Jesus to you.  
You know, that's what we're thinking.  
And so we don't want to talk about the church because we don't want some controversy.  
We don't want some argument.  
Come on.  
Hey, come on.  
Where have you been?  
If the man believed what you said,  
 He ought to know you came from somewhere.  


  
What do you want him to think?  
That you're different from where you came from?  
The only place you can actually recommend is where you've been.  
That's what you do.  
 It's the smartest thing to do about it when you lead someone to Christ.  
Let him come to the church where you are.  
That's the only way you can guarantee his growth.  
Because you know what he's going to hear.  
You can't tell him look for a nice church.  
Join a good church.  
Look for a nice church.  
Join a good church.  
What's a good church?  
He doesn't know.  


  
 He doesn't know.  
And you're giving him the responsibility to make the decision.  
Then two years later, you find him again, and he hasn't grown.  
He was the cause.  
You gave him the wrong advice.  
You should tell him about the church, and you said, now what I'm going to do, I'm going to call a leader in the church whom I know.  
And if you know the pastor, I'm going to tell the pastor about you.  
 Say, make your evangelism conclusive.  
So I'm going to tell the pastor about you.  
He's going to call you.  
See, he'll call you.  
Or if there's a leader, you know, he'll say, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you, I  
 They'll talk to you.  
Let him know you're excited about his salvation.  
And that they're going to be excited about his salvation.  
He may be new to this kind of things.  
And he doesn't want more people get to know.  
So he says, oh, no, no, no.  
You don't have to tell anybody else.  
He says, then you let him know this is important.  
See, we've got to help you grow.  
We can't just leave you like this.  
We've got to help you grow.  
 And in the church, we are involved with one another, even though we don't necessarily become busy bodies in other men's matters.  
You know what I'm talking about.  
Praise God.  
So let your evangelism be conclusive.  
Because only the conclusive evangelism you can have record of.  


  
 praised the Lord.  
You know you led someone to Christ.  
You know he is in Christ.  
Five years later, you still remember.  
You are still in contact.  
 You can start keeping diaries of people you're leading to Christ.  
You'd be amazed how long it will soon become.  
Yeah.  
And then you tell them, when you lead someone to Christ, like I just did you, let me know.  
You can send me his name and his address.  
I'm going to be praying for him.  
You tell him, I'm going to be praying for him.  
He doesn't have to know me, but I'm going to be praying for him.  
You tell him.  
And then your list is getting longer and longer.  
 And from time to time, you bow your knees before the Father and pray for these people that you have led to Christ and who are leading others to Christ.  
You see, evangelism has to be a conscious effort.  
It has to be a sincere work.  
It has to be a personal ministry.  


  
 It's a ministry.  


  
Hello?  
Okay.  
So you see, this is how you grow in the things of God.  
No Christian who doesn't fellowship regularly with other believers grows.  
He doesn't grow?  
How could he?  
 How could he?  


  
Now sometimes there are people who get offended in the church.  
Like you might even be here now.  
You're happy to be here.  
But then when it comes to going back to church, you don't want to go to church.  
Say, I don't mind to go to the meeting to listen to Pastor Chris, but I'm not going to church.  
Something is wrong.  
And I want to talk to you.  
Something is wrong.  
 You are allowing the devil take advantage of you.  
And you've got to refuse to let the enemy dominate you.  
Go to church.  
Be in church.  
Be a part of the church.  
Never let someone offend you to the point that you walk away.  
You know, some people did the same thing at home.  
 They said, that spoke to them roughly, and the went away never came back.  
Mom spoke to them roughly, the went away never came back.  
And they have used the same attitude to come into the house of God.  
Nobody talks to them, nobody.  
They do what they want.  
They're not used to being told what to do.  
When you come to Christ, you learn to be told what to do.  
 Because you see, you don't get salvation until you make Jesus the Lord of your life.  
You probably never had a Lord consciously before.  
But when you come to Jesus, he becomes the Lord master of your life.  
Someone's taken over.  
You're no longer in charge of your life.  
You gotta understand it.  
You're no longer in charge of your life.  
Somebody has taken over.  
His name is Jesus.  
 And this Jesus has a structure in his church.  
This is how I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
And he sets home in the church, fests, apostles, secondary prophets, thirdly teachers, after that, miracles, gifts of healings, and so on and so forth.  
So he set the order in the church.  
See?  
So we follow the order.  
 Because he's the Lord.  
He's the Lord.  
And that's one of the things, that's one of the ways you know that you're growing.  
Because you're becoming, you're learning to listen.  
You're receiving instructions.  
You're giving spirit your guidance.  
These are things you wouldn't have cared about before.  
Yeah, because you were kind of, and you were the God of your life.  
 But now Jesus has taken over.  
And you don't just get up and say, I'm offended.  
Or I don't like the way to talk to me.  
Or I'll never sit in the front again.  
I'll see that the back from henceforth.  
He don't talk like that when you come into Christ.  
He becomes a lot of your life.  
Barbara says, when he put it for his own ship, he goes before them.  
And the ship follows him for the know his voice.  
See, he's in charge.  
You follow.  
He disciples you.  
 See that?  
That's important.  
So, when we lead people to Christ, we disciple them.  
That's the way not to be.  
That's the way not to be.  
So, you see, Apophras was praying for this church that they stand fast, stand perfect in Christ.  
 They come to maturity.  
They grow up in Christ.  
Then He says, stand perfect and complete.  
Did you see that word, complete?  
And I told you that was play rule, all right?  
Complete, play rule.  
It means to be full.  
It means to be loaded.  
See that?  
Loaded.  
Full, fully loaded.  
 I want you to come to maturity and I want you to be fully loaded.  
Hallelujah.  
Fully loaded.  
Loaded with what?  
Lot of stuff.  
Lot of stuff.  
Okay, time to fill him on verse six.  
Fill him on is not broken into chapters and verses.  
It's just only verses.  
 So you're gonna see verse six when you turn to filament.  
Are you there?  
Okay, will you read to me?  
One, two, go.  
That the communication of that faith, may what?  
May become effectual, uh-huh?  
 by the acknowledging of every good thing that is in you in Christ Jesus.  
This is marvelous.  
Why didn't he say, why didn't he say, by the acknowledging of everything that is in you?  
Could have said that.  
But I've still been nice.  
But he said, every good thing.  
 every good thing.  
Because you know, the people who like to think that he got some bad things in there.  
Like when Paul was talking about natural man in Romans 7 chapter, he said, I know that in me, that is in my flesh, there's nothing good.  
And some people have picked that out of context, and they're going around saying, you know, in us, there's nothing good.  
And they're wrong.  
 that the communication of your faith, the sharing of your faith, this Christianity that you've come into, he's saying that your life in it, the way you share it, the way you live it, how it goes with you, might become effectual.  
He wants you to have an effective life.  
 And how?  
He says, by the acknowledging of every good thing that is in you in Christ Jesus.  
Now, Apeaphras is praying for them to become what mature, perfect and complete, loaded with all these good things that we have in Christ Jesus.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 And as you study the word, you start discovering what these things are that are in you, in Christ Jesus.  
To begin with, I have eternal life.  
Eternal life is in me.  
The ability of God is in me.  
He says, our sufficiency, the word is he can notice.  
You see, our sufficiency is of God.  
It means our competence is of God.  
 I have divine competence.  
You see, I'm not incompetent.  
I'm divinely competent.  
It says our ability is of God, our sufficiency is of God.  
And you get to know this and then you wise up to it.  
Hallelujah.  
 See, the confession of the word is a false thing that you write about in your maturing life.  
I told you about studying the word, remember?  
Now, the confession of the word is so, so, so important.  
It can never be overemphasized.  
The confession of the word is what drives you toward your revelation.  
For example, here,  
 I just told you what it says.  
And when you study in the word, it gives you the idea that this competence, this ability that is from God has been given to you.  
You don't see it like that immediately.  
Okay?  
Because you know you.  
But what you know is physical.  
 Now that you're born again, you have a new spirit and you're yet to study and understand this spirit man that's born again.  
So God's got to talk to you about him.  
God's got to educate you about your nature.  
So he tells you that you have divine ability.  
It's the ability of God.  
But you see, just because I've heard it doesn't mean things are going to change.  
I've got to say it.  
 You've got to say it.  
Now when I say it, I endorse it.  
And then God and I can work together now.  
That's what makes it stay.  
So I've seen it in the world.  
Our sufficiency is of God.  
So I declare my sufficiency is of God.  
My competence is of God.  
Our incompetence.  
Now I'm just growing.  
 I'm just growing.  
Do I become confident tonight?  
Because of what I've said about everything in life, not necessarily, but he's boss.  
He's gonna lead me by the spirit, and he's gonna lead me in this journey to where I should go, and he will let the right things come to me as long as I'm on the right course.  
The Bible says when he brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, he let them not throw the way  
 of the Philistines, although that was near.  
It was the shortest distance they could get to the promised land in no time.  
But the Bible says God didn't lead them in that way because he said, lest the people see war and flee.  
So he let them about through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea.  
 It was a longer journey because they had not been trained for war yet.  
There were slaves in Egypt.  
 And so God will want to bring them through the way of the Philistines, because the Philistines will come out against them and destroy them.  
The people will be afraid.  
God's got to train them.  
God's got to let them know he is with them.  
So he takes them through the way of the wilderness, where there's these signs and wonders and the supply of God.  
He shows them he's that Jehovah Rafa.  
He's that Jehovah Rohi.  
He's only said what I'm talking about.  
And after they had come to know who he was.  
 He let them come into war.  
And when they came into war, they called him, Jehovah Nissi, the Lord, our banner, who fights our battles.  
Can you shout amen so much?  
So he leads you.  
So sometimes in your life, you're saying, well, I've been born again five years now.  
I can't understand why this has happened.  
Well, I can understand how pregnant this has happened.  
Nothing happened.  
I don't know why.  
 relax you see I'm learning and I'm growing you see I'm on my way  


  
 Many years ago, when I set out holding crusades, my first crusade was when I was 15 years old.  
And I wonder if I say that to go, ha, ha.  
What were you doing?  
Well, you were 15, what were you doing?  
Dancing.  
She used to be mine, yeah.  
That's what you were doing.  
Was that what you were doing?  


  
 What I was out preaching.  
Now, before the crusade, I'd been going from house to house.  
I was involved in street evangelism.  
I went from house to house.  
I went to where people were workers.  
You know, when they had their break time and they were taking their lunch, I came there and preached to them.  
For some listen and others didn't want to listen, but see, that didn't matter.  
Jesus said to preach.  
Then I went to preach.  
 I went to schools and preached to little kids and preached to those in my own generation as well.  
How was preaching?  
But you see, I saw good results, but not as much as I'm seeing today, because I had to grow.  
See, God didn't bring together 20,000 people for me to talk to, because I couldn't have handled that.  
 I would need a message that would touch 20,000 people.  
Because 20,000 people means 20,000 minds.  
You see that?  
And how are you going to handle that?  
Your message must be able to touch them everywhere.  
And that'll have to be by the Spirit.  
 And it has to be a ministry.  
And so I have to grow.  
But I didn't know.  
I wanted to think some move fast.  


  
In life, we're always wanting to think some move fast, right?  
 That's why we get faster vehicles.  
You know, everything's faster.  
Computers faster.  
Everything's faster and faster and faster.  
We want God to move fast too.  
But you know, he's the ancient of days.  
Hallelujah.  
You see, I had to grow.  
I had to grow.  
I had to grow.  
Now it's growing.  
And learning.  
Learning.  
 So that's the way it is.  
That's the way it is.  
But you become focused.  
And what God has called you to do, you stay with it.  
And if you stay with it, he'll take you to the next level.  
Now with God, if you don't qualify for the next level, you're moving.  
He'll leave you there.  
You must qualify for that next level before he moves you.  
 And there'll be tests.  
Things that test your faith.  
And when it tests your faith, they only strengthen your faith.  
There's strength in your resolve.  
So when you face triers, don't give up.  
Difficulties will come.  
You don't give up.  
 Sometimes it comes from people.  
Sometimes people around you, sometimes not very close.  
But no matter what happens, never repay them with the evil that they did you.  
You never do it.  
Otherwise, you will not cross to the next level.  
Because that's one of the tests.  
Can you take the heat?  
 Can you take the blows and turn to them like your Lord Jesus?  
Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.  
See, you've got to cross that.  
You must never entertain bitterness.  
Bitterness will stop you from making progress in the spirits.  
Doesn't matter who you'll be there against.  
Friend, neighbor, stranger, mother-in-law,  
 Oh, outlaw.  
So the same thing.  
It will stop you.  
Say, bitterness will stop you from moving to the next level.  
And then you find yourself moving around in circles, in life.  
You don't know why there's no progress.  
You're getting angry.  
 and upset with God and everybody else, because your life just looks like you're in one place.  
Yeah, because there are things to be fixed, and you're not fixing them.  
And God's waiting for you to fix them.  
Get rid of bitterness, get rid of anger.  
All those things must leave your life.  
See, once you learn how to walk in love, you're ready.  
You see, love is more than a smile.  
 Love is more than a kind exchange of words.  
It's a state of your heart that you live out.  
You see, first it's in your heart, then you live it out.  
See, you do it.  
You have genuine concern for others, genuine appreciation of others.  
You see God in them, cause they belong to God.  
 These things become real to you.  
Are you still there?  


  
Hallelujah.  
Blessed be God.  
Amen.  
Blessed be God.  
Now, one of the things that the word tells us  
 should be in us.  
I said, one of the things, I use the word things, and I want you to notice.  
But when we get there, you'd find this more than a thing, okay?  
But the fact that he tells us to acknowledge every good thing that is in us, in Christ Jesus.  
And he wants us to stand, play a role, okay?  
Perfect and complete, complete, fool.  
 Filled, beloved, with what?  
The best of all.  
I want to show you.  


  
If it couldn't be, he wouldn't tell us.  
Ephesians chapter three.  


  
 You found it?  
I want you to read verse 19.  
Divisions chapter number three.  
Divisions chapter three from verse 19.  


  
 You know, it's one of those verses.  
I'm trying to calm down.  
You see, it's one of those verses that you read and you just pass out first.  
You know, you just pass out first.  
And then you go, Lord, is that real?  
And you hear the echo of your voice?  
Hey, could this be real?  
Look at it again.  
I don't know.  
 The love of Christ.  
The love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge.  
That he might be what?  
Filled!  
That's Plaroo!  
Filled!  
With what?  
With some?  
 with all the fullness, the totality of these being.  
Do you understand?  
To be fair with the totality of divinity.  
This is an absolute comeback here.  
Read it for yourself.  
I want you to see it.  
That she might be what?  
Which what?  


  
 with all the fullness of God.  
Now you can understand why we are so bold.  
You can understand why we can't talk fear.  
I cannot have fear.  
Don't you understand what this just said?  
That she might be filled with all the fullness of God.  
Load it.  
With the full load of God.  
That's what the word is, Pleroma.  
It means the full load.  


  
 failed with the fullness of God.  
Wait, when we get to heaven?  
No, he... That means he wants us like Jesus.  
Jesus was full of God.  
 He said, the father had life in himself.  
So had he given to the son to have life in himself.  
That's what Jesus said.  
Jesus was loaded with God.  
He was loaded with God.  
He was the divine essence.  
 I wish, see, I wish would come to that level, to that place of understanding.  
When we get there as the Church of Jesus Christ, the Son of God will come for us.  
 That's what will lead to the rapture of the church.  
That's what the master is waiting for.  
For us to come to that point.  
See, he's not coming to take us away.  
Our flight is not a flight of fear and defeat.  
Escaping from this terrible world, like somebody said, the world is getting too bad.  
I just pray Jesus will come.  
He ain't coming because the world is getting too bad.  
 is coming for a church without sports, without wrinkle of any such thing.  
Can you shout amen sometimes?  
We would have dared so much with this word.  
Do you understand?  
We would have used the powers of heaven in this word that we will be ready.  
There will be no option than just to check out of this word.  
Hallelujah.  
 So when many of us, when enough of us, have this understanding of our work with God, then the trumpet will shout and will get out of here.  
Hallelujah.  
That's what the king is waiting for.  
I want you to understand it.  
That's what he's waiting for.  
He wants us at least to begin to demonstrate to some common level what he's come to do in our lives.  
 I can't come to make us religious freaks.  
That's not what he's asking for.  
Listen, the man died.  
Don't you get it?  
He gave his life for what?  
So we can bow down and beg for things and ask him for everything he wants.  
Lord, I need a house.  
Lord, I need a job.  
Lord, I need healing.  
After the man died?  
After he died?  
 You know, when I listen to some of the prayers that many Christians pray, I know they don't understand the death of Jesus Christ.  
The man gave his life for me.  
What do you expect?  
That I shall live a beg of my life.  
The man died for me.  
Do you know who he was?  
This man who died was the Son of God.  
He gave up everything to die for me.  
 Oh, I'll never be sick in my life.  
I'll never be broken my life.  
Oh, don't let her God.  


  
Listen, let me tell you more.  
He came to make me the righteousness of God.  
Do you know what that means?  
Oh, dear Lord Jesus.  


  
 I wish you all understand what this means.  


  
Let me just read you something.  
Turn to the book of Romans 6.  


  
Can I read for you?  
 is this knowing this, that our old man, that's our old nature, what we used to be.  
Before we were born again, what we used to be, knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him.  
That the body of sin might be destroyed, paralyzed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.  
 For he that is dead is freed from sin.  
Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, diet no more.  
Debt had no more dominion over him.  
For in that he died, he died unto sin once, but in that he lived it, he lived unto God likewise.  
 reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed on the sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
Can you shout amen so much?  
I'm alive to God.  
See, I'm alive to God.  
I'm alive to God.  
See, I'm not alive to sin.  
I'm alive to God.  
You see that?  
Let me read some more.  
It's gone.  
 What verse?  
Where are you?  
Verse 12.  
Okay.  
He says, Let not sin therefore reign in your model body.  
Did you hear that?  
 Let not send rain, rain in your mother body.  
That is your obeyed in the lost thereof.  
Need I yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead.  
You see the consciousness, the mentality.  
I'm a man come out of debt.  
You see that?  
We came out of debt.  
 out of spiritual death, we are alive to God.  
That means we are alive to life.  
There's no more death in us.  
There's no more death around us.  
There's no more death in anything that concerns us.  
No more failure associated with us.  
Do you understand what this means?  
Let me explain further so you can get it, so you understand what this man's talking about.  
We're dealing here now with righteousness, the righteousness of God.  
 The righteousness of God doesn't destroy things.  
It fixes things.  
The righteousness of God doesn't have failure.  
No, it's got life, success, glory.  
How are you following this?  
Now, when anything comes in contact with you, it doesn't go bad.  
It gets better.  
This is the righteousness of God.  
 You know some people, they use shoes, and once they're through with the shoes, nobody can use them anymore.  
Some people drive cars, and when they're through with the car for two years, nobody can use that car anymore.  
They move into a house.  
A few months later, you can recognize that house.  
Everything just seems to go wrong.  
No, the righteousness of God is different.  
The creation is delivered.  
 because of you.  
The creation is delivered from its bondage of corruption.  
Bondage of destruction.  
Do you understand?  
Everything in this world has death in it.  
So it dies because the spirit of corruption is in it.  
Once it is made, it starts decaying.  
It starts dying.  
Destruction is working in it.  
 So the Bible says, the whole creation groans in travail, wetting hallelujah, wetting for deliverance, wetting to be set free.  
But who's going to set them free?  
He says, wetting for the manifestation of the hewers of God.  
The hewers of God are the mature sons of God.  
It's the waiting for the techno of God, but for the hewers of God.  
 the sounds of God who have come to maturity.  
When you come to maturity, everything you touch is changed.  


  
Then you start talking the way I do.  
When something forces me pick it up, my things don't get destroyed.  
Don't worry, it's not broke, it's gonna be okay.  
You start talking like that.  
And you start receiving like that.  
I fix things, not destroy them.  
 Where is God?  
The creation is groaning in travail waiting to be set free.  
Oh, glory to God.  
If this flowers are put in your house, you won't come back the next day to find out now like this.  
Why?  
Because it's set free by its association with you.  
See what I mean?  
 including the things you wear, the things you use, they are set free because they are with you.  
This is what your life should be like.  
And when you come into this class, you'd find that God keeps renewing everything about your life.  
You get the attention of God because you're functioning in his ways of doing things.  


  
 Hello?  
How you getting this?  
Sure, sure, sure, sure.  
That's how the righteousness of God functions.  
You see it?  
That's how it functions.  
I'm an instrument of righteousness.  
He says, yield yourselves to God as instrument of righteousness.  
Say it again, I'm an instrument of righteousness.  
I'm an instrument of righteousness.  
 If I get to know you, you get better for it.  
That's the way it should be with everyone of us.  
Whoever you get to know gets better for it.  
Because you are an instrument of righteousness.  
Say amen.  
Say again everywhere I go.  
I'm an instrument of righteousness.  
Okay, write this down.  
Now, I gotta write this down.  
 Dear Lord Jesus, I like this.  
Do you love the word of God?  
Yes.  
You know, I told you, I'll tell you about God's purpose for your life, right?  
Okay, now you want to hear it.  
So I'll just run down through this and...  
 God's purpose for you.  
Number one, God made you to be like him.  
Simple, simple, but it's powerful.  
It made you to be like him in image and likeness.  
You remember what he said in Genesis chapter one when you read from verse 26 to 27?  
He says, let us make man in our image and in our likeness.  
This is, let them hop dominion over what?  
Everything.  
 And then, look at John, chapter 14, from verse seven.  
John, chapter 14, from verse seven.  
Read the words of the master, want to go.  


  
Did you hear that?  
Okay, I'll read more.  


  
 Jesus said, if you have seen me, you have seen the Father, cause I look like Him, and I do like Him.  
I function like Him.  
 Jesus was the consummate man.  
Did you hear that?  
This was the perfect man.  
He came to be exactly what the father wanted.  
He says, let us make man in our image and in our likeness.  
Let him look like us and let him function like us.  
And Jesus said, if you have seen me, you have seen the father.  
 He said, the works that I do are not mine, that the father's works.  
The words that I speak are not mine, that the father's words.  
Wow.  
That's Jesus.  
But you know, that's what he expects of us.  
Well, like him, well, like Jesus.  
We'll come to that.  
All right.  
You're still there?  
 Just keep your hand in that John because you're going to go back to it.  
All right.  
Number two, God made you to live in you in oneness with you.  
Now, you know what I'm doing?  
I'm giving you an outline and you're going to study this.  
 You gotta get more scriptures for all of this that I give you.  
I'm giving you three points and each one of them has many scriptures and you will go and make your research and put them scriptures there, right?  
Okay, so number two, God made you to living you in oneness with you.  
To living you, that's powerful, yes.  
 verse 10 now.  
He says, don't you believe that I'm in the Father and the Father in me?  
Wow.  
Hey, go to chapter 10.  
You see what happened in chapter 10, St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 10.  
We're going to read verses 38 and 39.  
Now he's talking to the Jews and they get mad at him.  
Verse 38, chapter 10.  
 St.  
John's Gospel, are you there?  
Okay, read verse 38.  


  
He was talking to these Jewish people, they got mad.  
That's even no one believed that the father's in me and I in here.  
They said, what?  
That's blasphemy.  
 and the picked up stones they wanted to kill him.  
Read the next verse.  


  
He escaped out of their hands.  
Did you notice he escaped?  
Why?  
He's trying to let us know when it's time to run.  
Do you know why he did it?  
 He didn't run because he was afraid of them.  
Don't forget, he faced death.  
He wasn't afraid of them.  
He didn't run because he was afraid.  
He ran because he didn't want the father to destroy them.  
Oh yeah.  
Remember that.  
Keep that in your mind.  
Keep that in your mind.  
Jesus never ran away because of fear.  
 No, he faced death.  
He had the chance to escape death.  
He refused.  
So when you see this, he escaped from their hands, because it was not time.  
He knew he had mirrors of angels with him, and they're all destroyed.  
You remember Elijah?  
And the young man who was with him?  
And when Elijah was surrounded  
 Branami that came to destroy, and the young man was afraid and said, Master, Lo, there'd be so much against us.  
He said, don't you be afraid?  
Those who are with us are more than those that are with them.  
And the young man was confused.  
And Elijah said, Lord, open his eyes.  
Open his eyes.  
Let him see.  
And he saw that the surrounding army had been surrounded already.  
 That was for Elisha.  
What do you think about the Son of God?  
That was for Elisha.  
He said relax.  
Those who are with us are more than those that are with them.  
He said, Father, open his eyes.  
His eyes.  
He didn't open our eyes.  
His open his eyes.  
Elisha had come to know.  
 There's no telling how many angels are in this place.  


  
I came with my angels.  
You came with your angels, and they came with their angels.  
Oh, Lord.  
This place has a convention of angels right now.  
And you better believe it.  
 This is real.  
But you know, when you don't know, you make your angels ineffective.  
Because many of us don't know how to cooperate with angels.  
That's a way to cooperate with angels.  
That's another day's talk.  
But you're still here, right?  
Okay.  
 So God made you to live in you in oneness with you.  
Hallelujah.  
I like this.  
Okay.  
You know, Jesus said, I mean, the father, the father is in me.  
So.  
 He's done the same for us.  
This was God's dream.  
So when God made man, he wasn't satisfied with the man who looked like him and functioned like him.  
That was not where God was going.  
That was just the beginning to be like him.  
He ain't that he'd have seen me as in the father.  
That's just one aspect of it.  
He made you so he can live in you in oneness with you for a peppers.  
 You see, you had to look like him and function like him for a reason, okay?  
Because he was going to live in you in oneness with you for a reason.  
Are you still there?  
He wasn't just looking for a house to live in as more to it.  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
So that leads us to number three, and this is the biggest of them.  
Number three, God made you to reveal his glory to the nations.  
Oh, glory to God.  
I am still here.  
This is a marvel.  
God made you to reveal his glory to the nations.  


  
 You know, when God talks about nations, He's not just looking at Ethiopia, Somalia, United Kingdom, Russia, Georgia, South Africa, Zimbabwe.  
You see, He's not just looking at that.  
The word translated nations, particularly in the New Testament.  
 is the Greek word, ethnos.  
Ethnos doesn't refer to states, refers to nations.  
And nations are a people that can be described by several factors.  
Whatever might be strongly common  
 with them in terms of function like they are all lawyers.  
You see that?  
This is an association of lawyers or they're related by language.  
You see that?  
 Okay, or a particular geographic location that makes them warn under certain rules and regulations.  
You see that?  
So, if I belong in an association of tailors, this is a tailor nation.  
 And what I'm saying even makes more sense now to many people.  
I've been saying this for years.  


  
I think it was with the youths.  
We had a youth conference.  
I was discussing with them the theory of nations.  
 OK?  
We talked about how that certain nations are mere states.  
And they don't understand the difference between being a state and being a nation.  
As long as their states have got trouble, they've got to be a nation.  
Even though they call them United Nations, they're actually United States.  
And I'm not talking about the country known as the US.  
You understand?  
OK.  
But the point of all that is this.  
 Ethnos systems are these various micronations.  
You can write that down, because you may not find that in the dictionary.  
Ethnos systems are micronations.  
They are the micronations within nations.  
You see, the  
 Nation of South Africa will be no nation without the ecosystems.  
It is the ecosystems that function within this South Africa that give life and oneness and direction to the megastate South Africa.  
 That's why you have the labor unions.  
That's why you have different associations, different groups, even up to political parties.  
These are ethnosystems.  
Ethnosystems can be a small, and we call them macronetians.  
Now, God cares about all these nations, large or small, wherever human beings come together.  
 His idea is that if I'm there, I must reveal his glory.  
So when we say to reveal his glory to the nations, he's dealing with all of these nations, all of them ranging from the ethnic systems of the world to the mega nations of the world.  
Are you following this now?  
 So recognize yourself as one saint by God.  
God made you for a purpose to reveal his glory to the nations.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm sent to the nations.  
And you know, if you function rightly in the nation, we are right now because every one of us belongs to an ecosystem somewhere.  
 And we must function, we must reveal His glory in that place.  
And when you do, He broadens your scope, your environment.  
Everything about you enlarges.  
You discover He's put you in a large nation and in another large nation.  
And you are growing and growing and becoming more influential, revealing His glory.  
Yes, that's your calling.  
Say amen.  
It's your calling.  
 So don't wait until God sends you to Russia.  
Don't wait.  
There are ECNO systems around you.  
Start now.  
Start now.  
Tell somebody the time is now.  
Change in my world.  
I'm changing my world.  
I'm full of glory.  
 He made you to reveal his glory to the nations.  
How could you reveal his glory if you didn't have it?  
John, John, chapter 17.  


  
I know who I am.  
Glory to God.  
I know who I am.  
Do you?  
I know who I am.  
 Yes, and be confident in life.  
Did you hear me?  
Because you're not a nobody, you're somebody special.  
Be confident everywhere you go.  
Be like Jesus.  
Even when he faced Pontius Pilate, he was not intimidated.  
Pilate asked him, are you a king?  
He said to this end, was I born.  
 He was not afraid.  
Don't be afraid.  
Be respectful.  
Be cautious.  
But don't be intimidated.  
When you speak, speak out.  
Let your voice come out.  
Let me tell you something I learned.  
But I learned it late.  
You see, I learned it late.  
I wish my parents had known that and had taught me.  
So I learned that late.  
 But since I learned it, I taught others.  
Because when I was in school, I was an intelligent little boy.  
But you see, I wasn't taught to be unafraid.  
And so in class, even though I knew the answer, when the teacher asked the question, I didn't raise my hand.  
And somebody else answered.  
And I thought, yeah, he got it.  
 But I found out that those who answered the questions more in class, the teachers began to like them.  
And those of us who didn't answer questions in class, became more and more timid.  
And we began to respect those who did.  
And we thought they were better than we were.  
And so when the teachers said, you answered.  
 I was afraid now, not enough confidence.  
And two times 10, 12.  
You see, my mind went to two plus 10.  
Two times 10, 12.  
How can you say 12?  
Who knows it?  
And the other guy, 20.  
So look at you.  
 Now he, he, he, he.  
But there was another guy.  
Three times ten.  
He said, that's him.  
He got up and said, and they said yes.  
He said, that's him.  
And the teacher was not as mad at him as he was at me.  
Who never got up?  
I began to learn the secrets.  
That when you speak boldly,  
 They think you know.  


  
Listen.  
Listen.  
Now I'm talking some of you as students.  
But this is not about being a student.  
It's about life.  
It's a principle.  
And I want you to listen.  
 I found out that sometimes some of them will get up, said a dumb thing, and I knew something better, but I was seated, and the teacher corrected them and said, okay, and sometimes the teacher wasn't sure.  
He didn't know that they were wrong.  
And I'd been to the library, I knew the guy was wrong, and the teacher wasn't sure.  
And the teacher said, okay, thank you, thank you for answering, okay.  
That's not what he's wrong.  
 But I'm sitting.  
I'm team-eat, and I'm not getting up.  
But the boy was bold.  
He spoke up and got the teacher's respect.  
Let me tell you.  
When I learned this, I began to try to use it.  
But you see, it was in the later levels.  
I could have done better.  
In the later levels, when nobody's really asking you questions anymore.  
 You know what I'm talking about.  
In school sometimes, some lecturers just don't care.  
If you know it, you know if you don't know that, you're business.  
They just don't know.  
Make your reception, submit your papers.  
And they go away.  
Nobody's asking any questions anymore.  
Learn to be booed.  
If you are wrong, you will be taught.  
 Don't sit down there and be timid.  
I tell my kids, answer questions in class.  
Don't care about being right.  
I tell them, don't care about being right.  
Just get up and speak.  
If you're wrong, that's why you came to school to be taught.  
The teacher will say, you are wrong and then he will teach you.  
I said, don't go back home with a wrong impression.  
Say what you think in class and say it out.  
 Yeah, I wish that told me that.  
Are you hearing what I'm telling you now?  
Don't you also see that even in politics, those who boldly speak even when they don't know squat?  
Everybody listen.  
And you, you, who knows how to run 10 countries?  
You don't say nothing?  
 And nobody's listening to you, because you're not talking anyway.  
All you say at home is, this people are stupid.  
What are they saying?  
You don't like the news.  
When they come up and make their statements, you say, what are they saying?  
I like it.  
You're grumbling, but only your kids are listening anyway.  
You know everybody else.  
You're not changing things.  
Be bold.  
Did you hear me?  
Be bold.  
Be bold.  
 If you're wrong, you will be corrected.  
Be bold and humble.  
You see, being bold doesn't mean you're braggadocious.  
Be bold and humble.  
Join them together.  
If you're bold, it'll work for you.  
But if you're humble and timid, no, you're not humble.  
Something is wrong with you.  
Bow and humble.  
Say I'm bold and humble.  
 I speak up.  
You know, some people say good money to you.  
You didn't hear them.  
Good money.  
And you turn around and you don't know what they're saying.  
And you don't want to answer in case that's not what he said.  
Good money.  
Come on in.  
Then you say, what did you say?  
I was, I was kidding you.  
I was, I was kidding you.  
I was, I was kidding you.  
It's a good money.  
Say it out.  
 Say it out.  
Hello.  
How you do it?  


  
Jesus is in me.  
He speaks up in me.  
Tell somebody to speak up.  
Speak up.  
Make your head like this and speak up.  
Say, come up.  
Yeah.  
Yeah.  
 Yes.  
Hallelujah.  
All right, I told you, Saint John chapter 17, let's pick that one.  
Glory to his name forever.  
Saint John chapter 17.  
See, he made us to reveal his glory to the nations of the world.  
Wow.  
 Chapter 17, we are reading from verse 22.  
Oh, God.  
Did Jesus say this?  
Oh, God.  
Let's read from verse 21.  
You'd like it from verse 21.  
It's amazing that Jesus will say this.  
Have you ever heard this?  
Have you ever heard this?  
Let no man take his glory.  
Have you ever heard it?  
 You know, some people prophesy around us, and we are all God's children in the place, and in their prophesy, they say, no one should take God's glory.  
And then we are saying, oh Lord, I'll never take your glory.  
Domest, Domest prayer.  
Take His glory.  


  
You know, they don't know what it is to be born again.  
 Let's read from verse 21, the words of Jesus.  
Jesus himself.  
Tell us somebody, this is the man himself.  
He's talking to us here.  
From verse 21, that they all, he's talking about us, that they all may be one as thou.  
This is his prayer to the Father.  
Jesus in St.  
John chapter 17 is brought into the Father.  
 Okay?  
Hear what he says to the father about us.  
That they all may be one, as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou has sent me peace.  
 Look at verse 22, this is, this is amazing.  
And the glory, which thou gave us me, I have given them.

 He says to the father, the glory, which thou gave us me.  
I have given them.  
He didn't say, I shall.  
He didn't say, I'm blood into.  
He didn't say, I'm hoping to.  
He has already done it!  
Oh!  
Hi, hi, hi!  
Tell somebody I'm living a life of glory.  


  
 Look at it again.  
Look at it again.  
This is lovely.  
In the glory which thou gave us me, I have given them that they may be one, even as we are one.  
I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.  


  
 I found out, sit down, I found out the Father loves me as much as he loves Jesus.  
This is wonderful.  
I'll never be afraid in my life.  
I'll never be intimidated.  
Oh, Paul, he loves me as much as he loves Jesus.  
It's in the book.  
 And you know what?  
He wants the world to know.  
He said so.  
He says that the world may know that you have loved them as you have loved me.  
He wants the world to know that he, the Father loves me as much as he loves Jesus.  
He wants the world to know.  
That means he's showing me off to the world.  


  
 You see that?  
Wow.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
 Hallelujah.  
Lift your hands to our heaven, worship Him.
