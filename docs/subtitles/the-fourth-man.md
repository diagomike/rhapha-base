title: The Fourth Man
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
The Fortman.  
What I want to discuss with you is the Fortman.  


  
 God had three men that He trusted.  
He trusted them with His Word.  
He trusted them with His Word.  


  
He trusted them with His Word.  
 and it trusted the fourth man the most.  
Because you see, the value of trust depends on what's committed or what's entrusted to the one that's trusted, what's committed into your hands.  
For example, if I trust you,  
 to a certain degree and I commit in monetary terms, let's say I commit $500,000 into your hands.  
I trust you that much.  
That's a lot of trust.  
Then I turn to another one and I say, I am committing $5 million into your hands.  
 The trust he is definitely much higher than the other one.  
Is that correct?  
Yes, very important.  
So let's read these verses.  
Wow, I kind of like this.  
Just thinking about it and I'm excited.  
Thank you, Lord.  
 You know, three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do you remember them?  
I told you, I'm going to think about them.  
Did you think, how many of you thought about them when I said the Fortnite?  
I told you, I knew it.  
All right, so you know the story and they refused to bow to Nebuchadnezzar's image of gold.  
And so he was furious.  
 And he said, make the fire seven times hotter and throw them into the fire for refusing to bow to the image.  
Well, they said, we will not bow.  
There's only one God.  
And he's able to deliver us.  
And if he doesn't deliver us, we still will not bow.  
God trusted them.  
 But then I said, he trusted the fourth one the most.  
So let's see what happened here.  
So these men, verse 21, Daniel chapter 3, from verse 21.  
Oh, I've got to calm down.  
Ready?  
Then these men were bound in their coach.  
 their hearts and their hearts and their other garments, and we're cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.  
 Therefore, because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  
Can you imagine?  
The fire was so hot and the command from the king was so urgent that the men that drew them in could not even escape the fire.  
They were burned.  


  
 the man who threw them into the furnace.  
They couldn't escape the heat.  
They were not in the fire.  
Do you understand?  
They didn't get into the furnace, but the heat from the furnace was so much.  
And because they came close, it got them.  
 but Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were thrown right into the furnace.  
Let's see what happens here.  
You're still there?  
Good.  
 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell down bound into the mists of the burning fiery furnace because they were bound, you know, so they fell down.  
 in the fire.  
Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste and specked and said unto his councillors, did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?  
They answered and said unto the king, true, O king.  
He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose.  
 walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt.  
And the form of the fault is like the Son of God.  
Hallelujah.  
He said, did we cast three men into the fire?  
They said, suddenly you came.  
He said, but I see four men loose walking in the fire, and they have no hurt.  
 And the form of the fourth man is what?  
Like the Son of God.  
So I said, he trusted these three men so much, but he trusted the fourth one the most.  
Why?  
Because the fourth one had charge of the other three.  
 Praise God.  
When He came in, the power of the fire was gone.  
Now, I find in Scripture something very interesting.  
Three men trusted by God, and the fourth one trusted the most.  
 You ready?  
Let's begin with a man named Joseph.  
Tell three people, Joseph.  
All right, Genesis chapter 45 and verse number seven.  


  
 Joseph said this, when he introduced himself to his brothers, you remember they didn't recognize him, when they came to Egypt to buy food.  
And you know the story, he eventually disclosed to them who he really was.  
I'm Joseph your brother.  
 And because they sold him into slavery, they felt so terrible because they thought he was dead, but he was alive.  
And when he noticed that the dejection on their face, they were so troubled and they thought he might slay them or something, they were sorry for what they did, but  
 He said something to them.  
He said, no, don't be sad.  
Hallelujah.  
Okay, let me read from verse 4.  
From verse 4, Genesis 45.  
And Joseph said unto his brethren, come near to me, I pray you.  


  
 And they came near, and he said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom he sold into Egypt.  
Now, therefore be not grieved, no angry with yourselves, that you sold me hither, for God did send me before you to preserve life.  
 For these two years had the famine been in the land, and yet there are five years in the which they shall neither be airing no harvests.  
And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.  
Who did God trust to preserve Israel and God's vision of Israel?  
Joseph.  
 Tell three people, Joseph.  


  
Do you like that name now?  
Some of you were given that name when you were born.  
You didn't like it.  
From today, you're going to like it.  
By the time I'm through with you, you will love it.  
God trusted Joseph.  
 to preserve Israel.  
He trusted Joseph to preserve Israel, the posterity in your hallelujah.  
All right.  
Then we find another beautiful story, the angel of God,  
 comes into Israel, visits a young lady by the name of Mary, who wants to get married to a man named what?  
And you know this beautiful story of Jesus.  
So I want to read to you from St.  
Matthew's Gospel chapter 2.  
Ready, ready, ready.  
 So, who is that reading?  
Ah, now when Jesus, verse one, now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, where is he that is born king of the Jews?  
For we have seen his star in the east, and I come to worship him.  
When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.  
 troubled about a little child has been born.  
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them when where Christ should be born.  


  
 and they said unto him, in Bethlehem of Judea.  
For thus it is written by the prophet, and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah.  
For out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel."  
That's prophecy.  
Then Herod, when he had previously called wise men, inquired of them diligently, what time the star appeared.  
 And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, go and search diligently for the young child.  
And when we have found him, bring me work again that I may come and worship him also.  
You know, a lot of times you find these pictures with these three wise men, all right?  
And the Bible doesn't really say that there were three wise men.  
It talks about three gifts, okay?  
They brought three gifts.  
 gifts, okay?  
So these wise men, you find them with this baby in a manger, with the mother.  
No, at the time that these wise men came, Jesus was no longer a baby.  
 Okay, I'm just going to give you some nice side, you know.  
Would you like that?  
Nice side information?  
Like this one.  
They think Jesus was a baby, you know, they came and the baby.  
He was not a baby when the wise man came.  
He was not a baby.  
And they did not find him in a manger.  
He was no longer there.  
 You would see it in a second.  
Tell somebody you would see it in a second.  
Okay.  
Okay.  
So, first aid again, and he sent them to Bethlehem and said, go on such diligently for the young child.  
And when you have found him, bring me word again.  
He's talking, Herod is talking to the wise man, okay?  
And he says,  
 that I may come and worship Him also.  
He's lying.  
He's not gonna worship Him.  
He wants him dead.  
Verse nine.  
When they had heard the king, they departed and Lord, the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was.  
When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exiting great joy.  
These men.  
Read verse 11, want to go.  
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  


  
 By now, Jesus was somewhere around two years or a little less.  
He was not a baby.  
About two years old or a little less.  
 That's why when the king was angry because the wise men didn't come back to him, he gave an instruction for all children from two years old down to be killed.  


  
And let me tell you another thing that's interesting.  
 what had happened as of this time.  
Several things had happened.  
Number one, Jesus had been moved to Jerusalem for his dedication.  
And then his mother would have also had to spend some 41 days for her purification.  
 before receiving such visitors like the Maggie.  
Are you still there?  
Very important.  
So by now, they were no longer there.  
For the Bible says they had gone to their house in Nazareth.  
Okay, are you there?  
Saint Luke's Gospel.  


  
 I read from verse 7 and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddening clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.  
 Now, you have the story about the shepherds.  
You remember that one?  
And all of that.  
Now, verse 21.  
And when eight days were completed for the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was considered a womb.  
Now, when the days of a purification according to the Lord Moses were completed, they brought him to Jerusalem.  
 The Maggie had not come.  
Jesus is out of Bethlehem.  
He arrives Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.  
Are you still there?  
He's already in Jerusalem.  
Does he go from Jerusalem back to Bethlehem?  
 Now we move on to the sword, let's just read the next two.  
As it is written in the law of the Lord, every male who opens a womb shall be called holy to the Lord and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of tunnel doves or two young pigeons, they offered all of that.  
And the story goes on what happened in the temple in Jerusalem.  
 And we arrive in verse 39.  
So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city, Nazareth.  
Did you see that?  
They go from the stable?  
 They move out, so we know they didn't remain there.  
Straight to Jerusalem.  
From Jerusalem, they go to a Galilee, Nazareth in Galilee.  
So he was in Galilee, Nazareth.  
That's interesting.  
Something else that you need to see.  
 something else.  
Can we go back to this nice story?  


  
You know, Herod thought he was very smart, but God was smarter than him, right?  
He said, go look for him.  
 go to Bethlehem, he's supposed to be born in Bethlehem, but they're no longer there.  
So what happened is the star comes out that they had seen in the East.  
They hadn't seen it all the time, they were initial.  
Now they see the star and they rejoice with great joy.  
Then the star leads them to where the child was.  
So they come into the house.  
 And from there, they're instructed.  
All right.  
Look at verse 11.  
And when they were coming to the house and matches gospel chapter 2, when they were coming to the house, they saw the young child with Mary's mother and fell down and worshiped him.  
And when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts, gold and frankincense and mer.  
That's where they got three from.  
Bible doesn't say the men were three.  
 is these three gifts.  
So people think each gift was brought by one wise man.  
But that's not what he says.  
Verse 12, and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.  
And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared, appeared to Joseph in a dream.  
 saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and be thou there until I bring thee word.  
For Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."  
God Almighty, I want us to think for a moment.  
We're not talking about just any other child.  
We're talking about Jesus.  
 Jesus as a baby, an angel of God comes to Joseph and says to him, take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt.  
You know, that was amazing to me.  
 Because this is Jesus.  


  
Shouldn't He be protected by all angels from wherever?  
Why flee?  
He says Herod will seek to destroy the young child.  
Was that possible?  
 Could Herod actually have destroyed the young child?  
If that couldn't happen, then God would have deceived Joseph by telling him to flee for something that was unreal.  
It was a real threat.  
Because you see, God respects laws.  
 He put the laws in place.  
This was man's word.  


  
God, this tells us it's one more, one more of those many things in Scripture that show us that God is not running everything like some people think.  
They think God is running everything.  
He is not running everything.  
If He were running everything,  
 It would mean he actually has everything in the mess because most parts of the world are in the mess today.  
God's not running everything.  


  
So he gives Joseph instructions.  
He says, take the young child and his mother and flee to Egypt because Herod will seek to destroy him.  
Now,  
 If Joseph hadn't done that, what God said would have happened.  
Herod would have found a young child and destroyed him.  
So God said, take the young child and flee to Egypt.  
He told him where to go, flee to Egypt.  
 It's important that we are where God wants us.  
God's protection is not everywhere.  
God's protection is where He puts you.  
He told the children of Israel, stay inside the house.  
The death angel is coming.  
 He said, mark your doorposts and linters with the blood of the animal.  
And when the death angel comes and sees the blood, you pass over you.  
The houses of the Egyptians were not marked.  
What did you know, apart from the Egyptians, there were other strangers in Egypt that were not Jews who knew about this from the Jews.  
 and marked their houses and they were protected.  
But they were not Jews.  
But they marked their houses and were protected.  
And when Israel went out of Egypt, the Bible terrorists, a mixed multitude went with them.  
They were not Jews.  
They went with them because they obeyed God's principles for protection.  
 He said, take the young child and flee to Egypt.  
Herod will seek to destroy him.  
You know, sometimes we think that we can do whatever we want and choose whatever way we want to go and then expect that God was that he's supposed to take care.  
He's supposed to.  
He will do what he says he will do if you will stay in his word.  
He gives instructions.  
He gives directions.  
 It tells you what to do.  
He said, flee to Egypt.  
He didn't say flee to Syria.  
If Joseph had gone to Syria instead of going to Egypt, he would have encountered another trouble.  
God said, take the child and flee.  
What was the word?  
Flea.  
Run away.  
Flea to Egypt until I bring you word again.  
 And this is so interesting because Jesus was a baby.  
A baby.  
Not really a baby like, you know, like a baby carrying your hand.  
I'm trying to say a child that's not making decisions for himself.  
Do you understand?  
Yeah, because like I told you, he was about two years old by now.  
 And so think about this child playing around the house, doesn't make decisions for himself.  
And God expects Joseph to protect him.  
God expects Joseph to protect him.  
Joseph has a responsibility.  
 to preserve this child.  
This is amazing.  
What responsibility Joseph had, the salvation of the whole world was in his hands.  
I want you to think about this.  
We just talked about the other one.  
Joseph, the first Joseph  
 The first man that got trusted like this would Israel and the vision for Israel.  
He sends him ahead to Egypt to preserve Israel.  


  
All of God's vision for Israel is in Joseph's hand.  
Joseph could destroy them.  
 He could have a revenge because they sold him into Egypt.  
He could order their debt.  
At this time he was prime minister of Egypt.  
Only Pharaoh was above him in Egypt.  
Pharaoh gave him the power and said, apart from myself that I have power over you, I give you authority over all of Egypt.  
 So all of Egypt was under Joseph.  
He was prime minister of Egypt.  
So he could destroy this man, his brothers.  
Their fate was in his hands.  
But he knew what God wanted.  
He said, God sent me here to preserve you, to preserve life, praise God.  
 And this is so important.  
Wow.  
What trust?  
What trust?  
God put in his son, Jesus, in the hands of a man named Joseph.  
First, Joseph.  
Now, here is second, Joseph.  
Did you notice that?  
I'm talking about three  
 Important mean and a fourth one.  
Now think about this.  
This Jesus grows, becomes a man.  
He dies.  
Listen, he is another very important thing.  
Did you know this?  
Your right to this earth is what?  
Your body.  
 Without your body, you have no right to be on earth.  
No spirit has rights in the earth without a body.  
Jesus dies.  
It dies on the cross.  
A man named Joseph comes and asks for the body of Jesus.  


  
 to preserve his rights to the earth.  


  
He takes custody of that body and puts it in his own cave, his own grave.  
Here's the third Joseph.  
 Joseph number one preserves Israel.  
You remember that?  
Joseph number two preserves the baby, Jesus.  
Joseph number three preserves the body of Jesus who dies.  
 And what does that body represent?  
First, He's right to the earth.  
Secondly, it signifies the body of Christ.  
It's a Joseph who takes care of the body of Christ.  


  
And I told you, the most important of all this is the fourth man that was in the fire.  


  
 because these are an allegory.  
And we find these thoughts, man.  
The Bible says Nebuchadnezzar said, the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.  
Some translations don't understand what that could be.  
So some of them say, oh, well, maybe he meant is like one of the gods.  
How could it be one of the gods?  
He hadn't seen any.  


  
 When he said, the Son of God is the expression.  
Because it is expression for saying, God, like a man, he says, the form.  
The form of the fourth is like the Son of God.  
 So Nebuchadnezzar was saying, the form of the fourth is like God in the flesh.  


  
But here is the beautiful thing.  
Did you know the meaning of the name Joseph?  


  
In the Old Testament,  
 The version was more clearly, Jehovah has added.  


  
For the thought of expecting a new son, another son, the Lord will add on to me another son.  
Over in the New Testament, the version  
 Twist a little to a more futuristic thing.  


  
Like he will add.  
But here is a point.  
As he is, so are we in this world.  
The fourth is like the Soul of God.  
 Here's where you come in, here's where I come in.  
Joseph number one was trusted by God to preserve life.  
Joseph number two, trusted to preserve the salvation that he brought.  
Joseph number three was trusted with the body of Christ.  
And now he will add a son  
 Adding sons is the meaning of the name Joseph, who will add more sons unto him.  
He expects you to do it.  
Preserving life is your work.  
Preserving souls is your work.  
Expanding the body of Christ is your work.  
Every soul that you bring into Christ becomes a member of the body of Christ.  
Can you see the responsibility that you have?  
 Can God trust you like he trusted Joseph?  
With that Joseph number one, Joseph number two, or Joseph number three?  
That's what his trust in you with.  
That's the message that you carry this Christmas.  
Saving souls, winning people, bringing them to God, having the vision of the first Joseph.  
 preserving life, a posterity in the earth.  
The body of Christ is a vision to you.  
Say amen.  
Yes, it's your job.  
Each one of us must do it.  
We must carry that message, burning in our hearts every day.  
Like this is the most important thing in all the earth.  
You know, it's Christmas time and for a lot of people, it's a happy holiday.  
 But we are never on holidays when it comes to so winning.  
Because Satan is not on a holiday in destroying men's lives.  
Right?  
Every opportunity that we have, we use it in winning souls and bringing people to Christ.  
Because God is trusting us.  
I want to recognize that.  
God is trusting you in your words.  
 Can you imagine that God trusted these men in such a way?  
Think about what He committed into their hands.  
Think about that.  
Why would God trust men so much?  
I told you, the value of trust is how much is put in your hands.  
Did you know we have today  
 the most important news on earth.  
We have today the most important message in all the world.  
For every generation, the gospel of Jesus Christ is the most important message in all the world and it's committed to us.  
Did you know that today we are the custodians of the eternal gospel?  
Did you know that?  
 In our generation, we are the ones trusted by God to take this message to everyone.  
We received it from others who will receive it from us.  


  
You have to make up your mind.  
No matter what it costs, you're going to do it.  
Even if it costs you your life.  
 You have to be so resolute.  
Did you hear me?  
You have to be so resolute.  
Listen, we say that those guys who are in maybe Boko Haram, Ashabab, these various groups, okay, who kill themselves and kill others, they're fighting for cause.  
 And many of us don't believe in their cause.  
We think that their cause is wrong.  
But they put their lives on it.  
If a man can take his life for a cause that we think is not right, what else do we think about our own lives for a cause that we believe is right?  
Is your life so dear?  
Are you still there?  
 This should go through your mind.  
Our cause is right.  
Our cause is right is right and it's worth everything.  
Our cause is right and it's worth everything.  
When I was a young guy in my early teenage years, I made up my mind.  
I knew the cause was right and I was gonna go for it.  
 I was told, you may have a terrible future, you may become poor, you may, this may happen to you, this may happen to you, and that may happen to you.  
What those who were talking to me didn't know, I had counted the cost, I had made a decision that nothing on earth was good enough to stop me.  
No off eyes on earth.  
 No offers on earth would help.  
Nothing could change my mind.  
It was a cause worth more than life.  
And I was going to go for it.  
It didn't matter to me.  
If I never had anything on my back, in other words, if I didn't have any clothes to wear, it would change nothing.  
 If I was never going to have any money, it would make no difference to me.  
I remember one day I was praying.  
I said, Lord, if I have to walk through the valleys and the hills and the mountains of this world, because I read about that in Hebrews chapter 11, I said, if I have to do that, I never have a home, never have a place to stay.  
I said, I don't care.  
It doesn't mean anything.  
 This gospel is worth everything.  
I was ready.  
I may never be known.  
I didn't care.  
If I have to preach the gospel to the poorest of the poor, and guess what?  
I had gone to see very poor people and preach the gospel to them.  
I went there, where the forgotten people are.  
I saw their poverty and preach Jesus to them.  
 If I would, if God wanted me to preach to them and live among them, I was ready.  
After all, I had studied about Albert Schweitzer, a medical doctor who came all the way to Africa and lived and walked among lepers until he became lepers himself and died a leper.  
I thought he was a hero.  
I thought he was a hero.  
 Because he didn't run away.  
He stayed.  


  
And that's what I'm saying to you.  
The other fourth man that God is trusting.  
And he's trusting you with everything.  
He's trusting you with everything.  
Everything.  
Everything now.  
 is at stake.  
The stakes have never been higher than they are today.  
And God is trusting us to save men's lives, save them from hell, and carry the blood-stained banner of Jesus Christ around the world.  
Are you hearing me?  
We've got to do it.  
 We have no other choice.  
We've got to do it.  
This is the only way.  
He says, well, there is no other name under heaven given among me and whereby we must be saved.  
There is no other name under heaven.  
Is that true?  
Do we believe that's true?  
You know, that verse, I accept the 4 of us 12, goes through my mind from time to time.  
 that there is no other name under heaven.  
If this is true, how much responsibility I have, we can't afford to fight for human recognition.  
We can afford that.  
There's too much at stake.  
Too much at stake.  
 It's about the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
And everything that we do and see should fill our minds, fill our hearts with passion for Christ, passion for Christ, passion for Christ, and have your dream alive.  
So every time you celebrate Christmas like this, let these things go through your mind.  
 Let them go through your mind.  
Let the responsibility go through your mind.  
That this is what it's all about.  
It's all about salvation.  
Salvation of souls.  
It's all about winning people to Christ.  
This is our responsibility.  
You're the fourth man.  
 Tell three people you're the fourth man.  
You're the one God's trusting.  
You're the one God's looking up to.  
I'll think about it.  
He said, Joseph, take the young child and flee, for Herod will seek to destroy him.  
For trust.  
 When Jesus was crucified, all the disciples fled.  
They fled.  
Only John was standing by the cross.  
Only John was there.  
And why?  
Because he was a relative of the high priest.  
That's why he was there.  
He was a relative.  
Young guy, he wasn't afraid.  
But everybody fled.  
 God was looking for someone to take care of Jesus' body.  
He found a man named Joseph.  
He said, could take the body.  
Take care of the body.  
Do you preserve the body of Christ or do you join the critics to talk against the body of Christ?  
 Never join the critics.  
Preserve the body of Christ.  
Never use your mouth against ministers and rebuke those who do.  
Because that's the body of Christ.  
You've got to preserve the body of Christ.  
It's in your hands.  
Don't help them tear down.  
Don't help them tear down.  
 If you work in the media house and they're telling you, write this nasty thing against the church, it doesn't have to be your local church.  
It may not be your local church, but you say, no, I don't write against the church.  
They say, you must do it.  
They say, I'll resign.  
I refuse to do it because God's trusting you with his body.  
The church is the body of Christ.  
He's trusting you.  
 Never join anybody to do something or say something against God's church.  
He's trusting you to preserve his church.  
There's some Christians who don't know as much as you right now.  
But one day they will, that's why we're preaching the gospel.  
One day they will.  
And just because they don't know as much as you doesn't mean condemn them.  
No, be praying for them.  
 Because one day they will get to know what you now know.  
And believe together with you.  
Because we are members of one body.  
So preserve the body of Christ.  
There is somebody preserve the body of Christ.  
It's your duty.  
It's your duty.  
It's your duty.  
You are the fourth man.  
Lift your hands and worship him and thank him.  
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
Oh, thank you Lord Jesus.
