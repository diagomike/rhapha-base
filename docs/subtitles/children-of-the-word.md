title: Children of the Word
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
What I want to talk to you about in God's Word is titled, Children of the Word.  
You get to understand it as we go right into it.  
In the beginning was the Word.  
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  
 He spoke words and creation came into being born of the word.  
Same word that became Jesus gave birth to me.  
And the Word of God must now control my perspective of life.  
It brings you to a position of advantage.

Oh!  
Oh!  


  
 This is wonderful.  
What I want to talk to you about in God's Word is titled Children of the Word.  
Children of the Word.  
And this is so, so powerful.  
You get to understand it as we go right into it.  
 And I'm gonna try to be slow enough so that you can pick everything that we've got to share.  
Wow.  
You would need to make sure you're right, not just in a piece of paper.  
Most of you don't use pieces of paper anymore, you use your devices, and I think it's better.  
So you can have it stored there, know exactly where it is so you can recall it anytime and look through again.  
 The word of God is so vital.  
You know, sometimes some people wonder, why do we talk the word so much?  
With these thoughts, you get to begin a journey of a higher understanding of what this really means.  
Firstly, St.  
John's Gospel, chapter one,  
 from verse 1, a familiar Scripture, what it be is repeating.  
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  
 The same, now what's it talking about?  
The word.  
The word.  
Verse two says, the same was in the beginning with God.  
All things were made by Him.  
And without Him was not anything made that was made.  
Starting about the Word of God.  
This is all things were made by the Word.  
 He says, in the beginning was the Word.  
And the Word was with God and the Word was God.  
Then he says, the same was in the beginning with God.  
All things were made by Him, by the Word.  
Now, so the Word of God, what we find in these first three verses that we just read is that the Word of God is God.  
 and that the Word of God made all things.  
Now let's go to Genesis chapter one.  
Book of Genesis chapter one.  
And I'm reading from verse one.  
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void  
 And darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  
And God said, now notice what he says, he's not telling us, and God stretched out his hand, he didn't say that.  
And God touched, he didn't say that.  
And tell us that God did anything, but God said,  
 Let there be light and there was light.  
And as you read on and on and on, you're going to find several God said, God said, God said.  
In other words, He spoke words and creation came into being.  
So God's word created all things.  
And the Bible says nothing exists that He didn't make.  
 Now, this is so, so important in so powerful.  
The word created the word.  
Now, that spoken word of God, when God said, God said, God said, the word, the logos of God, that's the Greek word, that's translated word.  
 It refers to all of the revelation of God.  
All of the revelation of God.  
In his opinions, his ideas, in whatever expression, whether he imparted it into the heart of a prophet, or he just gave an enlightenment of it, or he spoke it out,  
 In whatever form, God's mind, God's thoughts, God revealed to anyone, that revelation of God in His Word is the logos of God.  
And the Bible says, the logos of God became flesh.  
 Saint John chapter 1, go back to Saint John chapter 1.  


  
And look at verse 14.  
It says, and the word was made flesh.  
Better end that the word became flesh.  
 and were settled among us.  
The Word, the Logos of God, became flesh.  
He's talking about Jesus now.  
Jesus is the Logos of God made flesh.  
Jesus is the Word of God made flesh.  
Jesus is God's opinions, God's thoughts, God's ideas.  
 made flesh, encapsulated in a human being.  
That's Jesus.  
So when Jesus was born, that was the Word of God in flesh, an extraordinary miracle.  
So every step he took, it was the Word of God walking.  
Just imagine, you're in your street one day, there's a man coming down the street.  
 He's walking down the incline.  
And who is he?  
It's the Word.  
The Word of God.  
He was the totality of God's mind.  
God's will.  
He was God's will revealed to us.  
Hallelujah.  
If you ever wanted to know what God was like, you looked at Jesus.  
He said, if you have seen me, you have seen the Father.  
 For the Bible says, the word was God.  
And that word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
So Jesus was God's opinion.  
Jesus was God's will.  
Jesus was God's thoughts.  
God's ideas.  
That was Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
 I just want you to begin to understand something about the Word of God.  
Now, here's another thing.  
When we were born again, the Bible tells us that we were born of the Word.  
Same Word that became Jesus gave birth to us.  
We were born of the Word of God.  
 This is amazing.  
So being born again is not something religious.  
Being born again is not just going to church.  
Being born again is a scientific miracle, which means it can actually be explained through the Word of God.  
It can be understood.  
It can be related to.  
 It can be observed.  


  
2nd Peter chapter 1, and I'll be reading from verse 16.  


  
 He says, for we have not followed, I like this.  
I like this.  
He says, we have not followed cunningly devised fables.  
When we made none unto you, the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
But we're our witnesses of His majesty.  
Now, remember, Peter is the one writing this.  
Peter was the apostle of Jesus Christ.  
He was there in those three years, and Jesus ministered until he was crucified.  
Peter was there.  
 He was there.  
He saw those miracles.  
He heard his words.  
He heard Jesus teach.  
He saw Jesus.  
He was with him.  
Three and a half long years.  
And he tells us this.  
He says, when we shed the word with you, when we told you about Jesus, he says, weren't deceiving you.  
 to get it.  
It says, for we have not followed cunningly devised favors when we made none unto you the power in coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
But we are witnesses of His majesty, our witnesses, Hallelujah.  
I know what Peter's talking about here.  
 You sit in a moment, he says, for he received from God the Father, honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.  
He says, we were there.  
He says, I heard that voice when God spoke from heaven and testified of his son Jesus when he said, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.  
Oh boy.  
 Remember, he was on that mound of transfiguration when he saw Jesus transfigured before their eyes.  
Peter was there to get it.  
He says, and this voice, verse 18, and this voice, which came from heaven, we heard when we were with him in the Holy Mount.  
Oh boy.  
Wow.  
Then he says,  
 You know who are going here?  
Let me give you a little background here.  
Peter is laying a foundation for an extraordinary thought that he seeks to communicate.  
He's talking about what they experienced, what they saw, what they heard, this excellent glory.  
 that appeared to them on that holy mountain and where God spoke from heaven to Jesus.  
And he says, we were our witnesses, we were there.  
But he's taking the minds to something.  
He says here, verse 19, we have also a more sure word of prophecy.  
 A more sure word is saying in spite of our experiences, there's a more sure word.  
He's dealing with the scriptures now.  
You see that in the mind.  
He's telling us the scriptures are more dependable than all experiences.  
It's a more sure word.  
 He says, we were our witnesses.  
We saw, we heard, we experienced, but we got something more trustworthy.  
 Is this a martial word of prophecy?  
Why aren't you do well that you take heed as unto a light?  
Oh boy, that's shining in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
He says, you know, no matter what you're facing.  
He says, you can take the word of God, the scriptures written for us as a light that shines in a dark place.  
 No matter what's happening in your life, he says, take the Scriptures.  
It's a martial word of prophecy.  
He says, take the Word of God with you.  
It's a martial word.  
It's a more dependable thing than all experiences.  
He says, hold it as a light shining in a dark place until the day dawn.  
 and the day star rise in your hearts.  
You know what I'm talking about here.  
This is so beautiful.  
It's like this.  
Sometimes, you know, when you're going through challenges in your life, you may not even know what to do.  
You may not know what steps to take.  
You may not even feel or know or experience any inspiration of what to do.  
He says, you can take this scriptures.  
Take this scriptures as a light that shines in a dark place.  
 He says, all that time you may have no witness within you on what to do or what God's going to do.  
He says, but have your heart on the scriptures as a light shining in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts.  
 It's suddenly the light will shine brightly in your heart.  
And you'd know that you know that you know that miracle is yours.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Look at that.  
His eyes, let's read again.  
Oh boy.  
 We have also more sure word of prophecy.  
Weren't you do well that you take heed as unto a light that's shining in the dark place until the day dawn and the day star arrives in your hearts?  
Knowing this!  
 that no prophecy of the scripture.  
You see, I told you, he's talking about the scripture.  
You're just talking about somebody standing before you and prophesying.  
No, he's talking about the prophecy of the scripture.  
He says, knowing this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation, income from man that's what's telling you.  
For the prophecy came not in all time by the well of man, but the holy man of God, speck as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.  
 Now, maybe I should digress a little here.  
This is very important.  
Something's pointing out to us.  
He says, the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man, but holy man of God.  
What an expression.  
What an expression.  
You know, I made a reference to you.  
I said, I'm not a preacher, I'm a man of God.  
There's a difference.  
I want you to understand it.  
 In the Bible, Solomon said, I'm a preacher.  
And he was called the preacher, Solomon with all the wisdom that God gave him.  
Nobody was as wise as Solomon until Jesus showed up.  
And he was the wisest man that ever lived until Jesus.  
And yet he was called the preacher.  
 He was the preacher.  
And that's wonderful.  
But David was called David the Man of God.  
But he was not always a man of God.  
I want you to understand this.  
A man of God doesn't necessarily start in the beginning.  
Moses was a man of God, but Moses was first in Egypt.  
 He didn't even know what the call of God was.  
He didn't have any sense about how to bring the people of Asia out of Egypt, how to deliver them.  
He didn't know what to do.  
But he became a man of God.  
When did he become a man of God?  
When the revelation of Christ and His church was delivered to him on the mountain of God.  
 That's the difference between the man of God and the preacher.  
The man of God is given a revelation for men.  
And that revelation is of Christ and His church.  
And from then, that man of God is like the rod.  
Let me give this to you.  
It's important you get this.  
One day Moses was standing before God and he had a rod in his hand, a shepherd's rod.  
 And you'd read this from Exodus chapter three and into chapter four, okay?  
And while he was there, standing before the Lord in that fourth chapter, and God said to him, Moses, what do you have in your hand?  
He said, a rod.  
God said, put it on the ground.  
 Now, it was a shepherd's rod, Moses's rod.  
So he put it on the ground.  
And when he did, the presence of God came on it.  
And that rod turned first into a serpent.  
And the Bible says Moses fled from it.  
And God said, pick it up by the tail.  
And he picked it up by the tail, it turned again into a rod.  
A few verses later, God said to him,  
 You take that rod in your hand with which you will do miracles.  
And then the Bible says, and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.  
It ceased to be Moses' rod.  
It ceased to be a shepherd's rod.  
It became the rod of God.  
 Now, when that vision, when that revelation is delivered to a man, even though the man may have been a preacher for years, it alters his life completely.  
And it carries that thing like Paul said, necessity is laid upon me.  
He said, whoa is me if I preach not the gospel.  
He says, I'm bound to this thing.  
I can't free myself from it.  
 That rod became the rod of God.  
In Moses, when he went to the mountain of God and he was given this vision, this revelation that totally took over his life.  
 He could do nothing else but fulfill the will of God.  
He became Moses the man of God.  
There was Moses the prophet.  
There was Moses the preacher.  
There was Moses the leader.  
But now he was Moses the man of God.  
Same thing happened to David.  
David was a king.  
David was a man of war.  
He fought so many battles.  
But one day,  
 Many years later, now he was an old man.  
And at that time, the vision of the church, Christ and his church, was delivered to David.  
And David was completely changed.  
He was now another man.  
And David was not fighting wars now.  
David was looking at something different.  
And he was called David, the man of God.  
 There was a change.  
I just wanted to tell you, see, that's what they called holy men of God.  
Holy, meaning they're separated onto God.  
And that's why I tell you in this ministry, never speak against the man of God.  
You know, when you hear people talk against men of God, they're people who have never heard from us.  
 If you've never learned from us, you say things like that, you talk against men of God.  
But if you're in this ministry and you've been hearing from us, you've been taught by us, you don't speak against men of God.  
When you hear others talk against men of God, keep your mouth shut.  
Go away from there.  
Because to speak against men of God is to bring curses on yourself and on your children.  
You don't do that.  
Never participate in such things.  
One of the things that God saved me from in my growing years,  
 was to help me in such a way not to other words against men of God.  
Just stay away from it.  
God helped me with that and I've been grateful to God because that means you can always walk in God's blessings, in God's favor and in His grace in your life.  
 Look at it, he says, holy men of God, watch something.  
He says, holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.  
Men of God don't just talk.  
The Bible says God confirms the word of his seventh and performs the council of his messengers.  
You know what that means?  
He performs the council, which means that when they speak, God is cursed to move on their behalf and do those things.  
 He says, holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.  
That's amazing.  
That's a good blessing for you.  
You take that, learn from it.  
Glory to God.  
All right, now let's go straight to first Peter chapter one.  
And I want you to look at something so beautiful here from verse 22.  
 Is it saying you have purified your souls, you know, being the truth?  
You know, when I study those creatures, I don't just be reading and miss things.  
I like to see there's so much good in the Word of God.  
For example, saying this, it says, saying you have purified your souls, you know, being the truth, which means when I obey the truth of God's Word, because, you know, Jesus said that word is truth.  
When he was praying to the Father in St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 17 and verse 17, it says that word is truth, the Word of God is truth.  
Now when I  
 He says, when I obey the truth, obey the gospel, when I act on God's Word, he says, I purify my soul.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
Jesus said in St.  
John's Gospel, when you read chapter 15 and verse number three, he says, you are clean through the Word that I've spoken unto you.  
 His word purifies us.  
You want to purify your soul?  
You want to purify your spirit?  
Meditate on the scriptures.  
Read them.  
Meditate on them.  
Meditate.  
And you're like someone who's taking a bath.  
 You see, and this is why it's so important that you study the Scriptures, listen to the Word of God, because to purify you, all the time you go out and you hear all kinds of things and you participate in all kinds of things at work, on the street, sometimes in your house, and then when you're through, you feel dirty.  
 Because of the other guy you were talking to.  
Sometimes, because of what you were watching.  
Sometimes, because of what you were reading.  
Sometimes, because of some of the things you engaged in, the discussions you engaged in.  
It feels so dirty.  
Get to the Word and purify your soul.  
Get kindness with the Word.  
You know, like I'm sharing the Word of God with you right now.  
As you receive it, you see, it's purifying your spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
 Okay, now, let's finish reading that verse.  
He says, saying, he have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit onto unfainted love of the brethren.  
Oh boy, that's love without hypocrisy.  
See, if you're truly working in the light of God, he says, you come into the unfainted love of the brethren.  
You walk in love.  
 You walk in love, you say, see that you love one another with a pure heart, fervently, passionately.  
Being born again, like this, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveeth and abided forever.  
Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible.  
 By the word of God.  
I was born again by the word of God.  
I like this.  
Born of the word.  
Same word that became Jesus gave birth to me.  
I'm born of the word.  
Say that with me, I'm born of the word.  
Say again, I'm born of the word.  
I'm born of the word.  
I'm born of the word.  
I'm born of the word.  
 Yeah, being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which levered and abided forever.  
The word lives and abides forever.  
Look at the next verse.  
For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man has the flower of grass, the grass weathered and the flower of fallest away.  
 All flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass.  


  
Hmm.  
And wonderful that one day you're 15 years old and you look so beautiful and so handsome.  
It's your day, you know.  
 And you even get better and better as the years run by.  
Then, then, then suddenly, you start having some wrinkles you want to get rid of.  
And it doesn't get any better.  
And then your hair starts changing.  
And your eyes start changing.  
And then you're thinking, I'm not like I was when I was 25.  
 Was it telling you, all of that beauty is for a time.  
There's a greater beauty.  
It's the one inside.  
So work on that one.  
That's the one that God sees.  
That's the one that God sees.  


  
 This is in the glory of man as a flower of grass.  
The grass withereth and the flower thereof followed away.  
But the word of the Lord endured forever.  
And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.  
Oh boy, you know, I read this, I read this scriptures and he has come down my eyes.  
I just think how wonderful the Lord is.  
How marvelous.  
 Glory to God.  
So you see, the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
Now the Word has given birth to us.  
And Jesus, the living Word has gone back to heaven.  
He's ascended.  
But He left us here with the written Word so that we can meditate on it and become  
 the same thing in our daily lives, because we're born of the Word.  
That means we're offspring of the Word of God.  
And if we're the offspring of the Word of God, God expects us to live accordingly, live according to your nature.  
What's your nature?  
Who are you?  
What's your nature?  
What's your nature?  
What's your nature?  
Who are you?  
 I'm born of the word.  
Say that with me, I'm born of the word.  
Therefore, I live by the word.  
Now, you know what this means?  
It means that I must submit consciously my thoughts which I gathered from this word, my ideas, my opinions,  
 I must submit them to the Word of God.  
You see, and the Word of God must now control my perspective of life.  
I must see everything from God's perspective.  
Is that difficult?  
No!  
It brings it to a position of advantage.  
 When God actually expresses himself through you.  
Now, there are Christians, there are Christians who don't take the word of God seriously.  
And something's wrong with that.  
Let's read Proverbs chapter 13 and verse 13.  
That's easy to remember.  
It's 13, 13.  


  
 Have you found it?  
OK, I want you to read it.  
Want to go.  
Read that first part again.  


  
 He says, anybody who despises the word shall be destroyed.  
Now, he's not telling you God's going to be mad at you.  
He's going to destroy you.  
No!  
He's telling you you're walking the path of destruction.  
You're going to get destroyed.  
If you're going that way against the word, don't despise the word.  
Anyone who despises the word of God shall be destroyed.  
Not because God's angry.  
 But because that's the wrong way to go, that's a part of destruction.  


  
What am I supposed to do as a Christian?  
Romans chapter 12, let's read from verse one.  


  
Romans chapter 12, from verse one, want you to go.  
 Verse 2.  
Keep that scripture there for a second.  
This is so wonderful.  


  
 He says, be not conformed to this world.  
There are people who are more and more, even though they have become Christians, they're more and more conforming to the world.  
But the Bible says, don't be conformed to this world.  
Instead, be transformed by the renewing of your mind.  
Change your way of thinking.  
That's what he's saying.  
 Is this be transformed?  
And that transformation is talking about is not just turning over a new leaf.  
He's talking about a transfiguration.  
That's what it means.  
So the word actually means be it transfigured.  
 by the renewing of your mind.  
And it says that he may prove what is that good, unacceptable, and perfect will of God.  
Which means your life will begin to radiate and produce and show the perfect will of God.  
Shows us three levels of God's will.  
That's what you have there.  
The permissive will.  
 the good will and the perfect will.  
So you're going high and high in your life now can give vent to the perfect will of a father, Hallelujah.  
 I like it.  
It's be not confirmed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.  
It's change your way of thinking, change your way of thinking.  
Some people haven't changed in five years.  
The same way they were talking five years ago is the same way they're talking today.  
They just talk rough, they talk mad, get angry, see all kinds of nasty things.  
 and sometimes even in the house of God.  
They're uncontrollable in the house of God.  
You know, they can get mad at the usher and they say, I'm nobody's gonna, no one is gonna, no one's gonna.  
One of the key, one of the key, are key factors for spiritual growths.  
 is working in love.  
And it's one of the signs that you will know that you're growing, not that you're smiling better.  
No, no.  
In your heart, you can really notice you're more loving and you're more accommodating to others.  
 and more conciderate.  


  
And that shows you getting wiser.  
And your speech, the Bible says a mature man is known from his tongue.  
His speech, his speech, more godly, more godward.  
Your words reveal God.  
 Your words reveal the righteousness of God.  
You know, sometimes, let me say this.  
You've got to make a distinction between worldly wisdom and God's wisdom.  
There's a big difference between the two.  
There's worldly wisdom and there's God's wisdom.  
 In worldly wisdom, how you're going to know worldly wisdom is, when you express worldly wisdom, you express it with anger, you express it with resentment, you express it with bitterness, you express it with pride.  
Then you know that wisdom is not from God, is worldly wisdom.  
But the wisdom of God is loving and kind and humble.  
 Loving, kind, humble, easy to be entreated.  
That means easy to negotiate with.  
But when you don't like the other, no, I'm not going to listen.  
That's not the wisdom of God in action.  
The wisdom of God is patient and is kind and is not proud.  
 You know, the Bible talks about pride, and then he talks about a proud look.  
And he says, God hates a proud look.  
Can I give you a proud look?  
That's a proud look.  
You know?  
Yeah, you know, you can... Like, that's an... You're not talking, but what you're saying is, who are you anyway?  


  
 When you do that, the Bible says, God will elbow you.  
He says, God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.  
I kind of like that because you see, every one of us can multiply the grace of God in our lives through humility.  
The more humble you are, the more the grace of God rests on you.  
Doesn't matter who the other fellow is and what he thinks about you, he's no factor in your life.  
 That's important.  
Somebody may not like you, but he can't stop your progress.  
He can't change your greatness.  
You just keep going.  
One day they're looking at you like this.  
Then they look at you like this.  
Because you're going higher.  
Then they look at you like this.  
But you just keep going.  
Hallelujah.  
 So the Bible says, humble yourself, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exhort you into time.  
Be humble.  
Be humble.  
Put on humility as a cook.  
Wear it.  
So do yourself.  
We call it angratia.  
 Rain yourself in.  
Talk to yourself.  
Tell yourself, I'm not going to walk in pride.  
I will not talk in pride.  
I'm going to be humble before God and before man.  
I'll be humble.  
And then act like it.  
Be humble.  
And when you do that, God will uplift you.  
 You said, having revelation of God's words.  
You said, having better understanding.  
But if you're not humble, you read the word and not understand.  
You read it like this with that same pride.  
You don't get nothing.  
I mean, you look at it and you wonder why we are so excited about what we're talking about.  
What are they seeing?  
You can see what we see.  
 We read it and we're moved.  
We read it and we cry.  
We read it and we worship.  
We read it and we praise.  
But you read it and you go, you still can't see it?  
Because Jesus said, God's not your peers before swine.  
Neither give that which is holy unto the dogs.  
So Jesus is not going to give holy things to proud people.  
 No, revelation is holy.  
The Word of God is holy.  
The understanding of the Spirit is holy.  
So if you find that what I'm sharing with you is difficult for you to comprehend, what you do is say, Father, I reject pride from my life in the name of Jesus.  
You know, I get rid of pride.  
And once you get rid of pride, right away like you snap your finger and you understand and open.  
And you just have catch in what I'm sharing.  
 You know, there's a guy one time he said, he said, Pastor Chris, you know, I didn't like you.  
I didn't like you.  
So for a long time, I didn't like you.  
He said, but the truth was, I really didn't understand what you were talking about.  
He says, one day I decided to listen with all my heart.  
He says, I was amazed.  
 He said, no, I just love you so much.  
You see, he thought it was about me.  
It wasn't about me.  
It was about the word.  
See, because if you love God, you will love those that are born of Him.  
The Bible says, if you love Him, that begot, you must love Him that is begotten of Him.  
See, but when you find you're having a problem with another child of God,  
 and you relate with him or her with a pry.  
Something's wrong.  
It's not with him.  
It's with you.  
It's with you.  
You've got something to work on the inside of you.  
See, do it.  
We can't be like you.  
I mean, we all can be the same person.  
 I gotta be me, you gotta be you and you.  
And God likes the fact that we are every one of us, who we are.  
But then there's one Jesus.  
God wants to see what Christ is in carton.  
What Christ is in horror and in him and in me and in you.  
That's the difference.  
 And so I love who God has made you.  
I love what you are in Christ.  
You're the most beautiful thing in the world.  
Because there's none like you.  
And I've got to train myself to think that way.  
I've got to.  
And when you do that, you'd be amazed.  
The joy that you'll have in your heart.  
 the glory of God that you have in your heart.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Now, just a few more minutes and I'll beat you this.  
This part of it is so important.  
What are the children of the world?  
I want to show you something from the Bible because, you know, when we're in the house of God, sometimes we think everybody gets it.  
No, everybody doesn't get it until we help them get it.  
 Sometimes we may be ahead of others, and so we help the others to come on.  
See, we've got to teach others who are with us.  
The spiritual ones must recognize the carnal ones, the fleshly ones, and help them come out of that canality, of that fleshly way of behaving.  
Just because you've been a Christian long before myself doesn't mean you know better than I do.  
 And that's why sometimes, you know, in a home, you may be the firstborn and I'm the thirdborn.  
And then you've been a Christian and long before me.  
And then now I'm just beginning to learn about Jesus.  
And then I say, hey, what you're doing is not right.  
And you say, you that are just coming.  
I've been in this thing long before you.  
It's not about who ate at first.  
It's about the word.  
 The Word of God becomes master.  
The Word of God has to have the mastery in your life.  
It must have the ascendancy, take on the priority in your life.  
So it's really not us trying to rule others is the Word of God ruling our hearts.  
Look at what I'm sharing with you.  
This is not Pastor Chris.  
This is the Word of God.  
 All right, so let me show you this.  
Something that happens in the house of God.  
Galatians, hmm, boy.  
All right, I have to read this pretty quick.  
Galatians in chapter number four, from verse 22.  


  
 Freud is written that Abraham had two sons and one by bond made the other by a free woman.  
I wish I had time to talk about that.  
But he who was of the bond woman was born, notice, notice, notice.  
Now he says Abraham is talking about the man, the great man, Abraham.  
Abraham had two sons.  
One was by a bond made and the other by a free woman.  
 Notice the words, the terms, a bond made of free woman.  
But he who was of the bond woman was born after the flesh.  
But he of the free woman was by promise.  
He's reminding us of something here about Ishmael and Isaac.  
 Isaac was spoken thoughts by the Word of God when the woman Sarah could not have a child, naturally.  
But Hagar was able, naturally.  
So he says here that one was born of the flesh and the other one was born by promise.  
Promise, what means the Word of promise?  
That means was born by the Word.  
 Now look at this, which things are an allegory.  
This is an allegory.  
Are an advanced metaphor.  
In other words, he is telling us here that these two children and these two women represented a spiritual message.  
 He goes on to tell us, he says, which things are an allegory.  
For these are the two covenants, the one from Mount Sinai, which generate the bondage, which is Aiga.  
And this Aiga is Mount Sinai in Arabia, an answer to Jerusalem, which now is and is in bondage with our children.  
But Jerusalem, which is above is free, which is the mother of Azal.  
 Oh boy, for it's written, rejoice thou barren, that bear is not, break for it and cry thou that travel is not, for the desolate had many more children than she which had an husband.  
Oh boy, I wish I had time to talk about this.  
Now, look at verse 28, he says, now we brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.  
We are the children of the word.  
 Look at this next verse, but as then, he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit, even so it is now.  
Fleshly minded people always persecute spiritually minded people.  
He says, as it was then, so it is now.  
It hasn't changed.  
Don't be surprised if someone who loves you  
 fleshly, like your brother, your cousin, your friend, when it comes to spiritual things, now they don't want you.  
No?  
They don't like that thing.  
They want you to drop that and then you can become their friend.  
If you just stop this, then we can be friends.  
He says, as it was then, so it is now.  
 What was it then?  
He says, He that was born after the flesh, persecuted Him that was born after the Spirit.  
Even so it is now.  
When you experience such things, don't act as though something strange is happening to you.  
This is the Word of God.  
We must follow the Word.  
We must identify with the Word no matter what.  
Now, let me show you this.  
 In another platform, Romans 9.  
See, I'm a child of the word.  
Glory to God.  
I'm reading from verse 6.  
Romans 9 from verse 6.  
It is not as though the word of God had taken non-effect.  
For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel.  
Oh boy.  
 Oh, yeah, yeah.  
You know, these are some of those scriptures when you read.  
You know, I talk about shouting scriptures, but there are teary scriptures.  
Teary scriptures are those ones that you read that as you read them, tears that coming down your eyes.  
You know, as I meditated on these scriptures, tears in my eyes as a Lord Jesus, thank you for your grace.  
Thank you for your love.  
Because I'm thinking, look at this.  
 He says, for they had not all Israel, which are of Israel.  
He says, even though they are of Israel, you know, Israel was Jacob.  
I hear me.  
Israel was Jacob.  
He says, not everyone who is of Israel or who is of Israel is Israel.  
Like he says, even though Abraham had two sons, one was born after the flesh and the other one was born after promise.  
 Not all who are of Israel, is Israel.  
Look at verse seven, neither because they are the seed of Abraham and they are children.  


  
Oh, but in Isaac shall thy seed be called.  


  
 Oh God.  
He says, that is, look at verse eight.  
That is, there which are the children of the flesh.  
These are not the children of God.  
But the children of the promise accounted for deceit.  
Are you hearing me?  
That's why one day when Jesus comes back and the trumpet sounds, there are those  
 who have been walking in his light, they shall be caught up with you.  
And the children of the flesh are not the children of God, and they will not go.  
This is so important.  
He says, they which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God.  


  
 Do you know what is explaining to us here?  
He's helping us understand the two kinds in the house of God.  
He says, though they are of Israel, they are not all Israel.  
Though they are from Abraham, they are not all children.  
In Isaac, shall I see it be called?  
Who was Isaac?  
Isaac was the seed of promise.  
He was the seed of the Word.  
He was a child of the Word.  
 In your life, how are you living?  
Are you living by your opinions?  
Are you living by canal ideas?  
Are you living by the word?  
Are you giving attention to the word of God?  
Is the word of God controlling your thoughts, your views?  
Or do you argue against the word?  


  
Those who are the children of the flesh are not the children of God.  
 Finally, let me read this to you.  
Now you can understand why we keep teaching the word and preaching.  
That men may understand the word of the kingdom and have their lives transformed.  
Romans chapter 8.  


  
 Look at this, from verse one, there is there for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walked not after the flesh, but after the spirits.  
It is no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh.  
The flesh here refers to the senses, to their canal ideas, to man's ways of thinking,  


  
 No condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who worked not after the flesh but after the spirit.  
For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death.  
Hallelujah.  
For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh.  
God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who worked not after the flesh but after the spirit.  
 How do you walk after the Spirit?  
You follow the Word.  
You stay in the Word.  
What the Word of God says you accept and you live by it.  
Live by it.  
 you know, canal, fleshly minded people.  
They don't mind criticizing the things of God in the house of God.  
They're the ones that don't, oh, I don't like the way the fan is blowing in this church.  
I don't like the way the AC is in this church.  
I don't like the heat in this church, canal.  
You know what a spiritual man would do?  
He'll see the same thing and he'll be thinking, Lord, I'd like to contribute to this thing.  
 I want to change this thing.  
I want to change this thing.  
They want to affect the change.  
They want to be a part of positive change.  
They want to help.  
They don't come to church and say, well, this place is so dirty.  
 So dirty.  
No, that's the flesh.  
The spiritual man thinks differently.  
He looks at it.  
He's not saying, who is supposed to be cleaning this thing?  
No, he runs out and gets something.  
He comes to wipe it.  
He's a part of the change.  
Spiritually minded people.  
They think differently.  
They think differently.  
They're going late to church.  
They start hurrying.  
They start running.  
The kano one says, nobody will be there.  
I might even be depressed.  
You see, he thinks differently.  
 Cano people say, how many times do we give off frames?  
This is the second thought call.  
The spiritually minded people, they don't think like that.  
They're always happy about it.  
The Bible says, whatever the king David did, please the people.  
They were just so happy.  
Why?  
Because David, the man of God, he was giving them the word and they were just so excited.  
Cano ones would say, what are you excited about?  
 What's making you happy?  
Is it just what he said?  
Is that why you're excited?  
But the spiritual ones are always happy, glory to God.  
They're just happy about it.  
I mean, they're happy enough to just be in church.  
You know, David said, I was glad when they said, let us go to the house of God.  
I was glad just to call meeting God.  
Spiritually mind it.  
See, I refuse to be kinder.  
 I've refused to be fleshly minded.  
Look at this.  
Look at this.  
Verse 5.  
For then after the flesh, mind the things of the flesh.  
But there that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit.  
Those who are after the flesh are concerned about the things of the flesh.  
It's always about them and about their convenience and about their own happiness.  
 But those who are after the Spirit, mind the things of the Spirit, they're always thinking how to please God.  
They're always thinking, what to please the Holy Spirit?  
Will the Holy Spirit like this?  
The apostle said, it please God and us.  
It please the Holy Spirit and us.  
That's the way they thought.  
What you're saying, does it please God?  
 Or is this your sense?  
So do you have sense?  
No, it's the Word of God.  
I live by the Word.  
For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the Spirit mind the things of the Spirit.  
For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.  
And everybody said hallelujah.  
 talk to the Lord right now.  
Wash up here.  
Thank you.  
Oh, very good God, thank you.  
Jesus.  


  
 you
