title: March 2017 - The Month of Insight
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
How glory to God, glory to God, glory to God.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
 You know, last month of February, it wasn't prophecy.  
And I wonder if you had time to pay attention to what the Spirit of God was doing in your life.  
 Now this man, he takes us even higher.  
And every month, when he brings us a word like that, it's for our benefit.  
It's a kind of, you know, like he tells us that we're being built through the world.  
See, he's building our lives.  
And every day,  
 There's some new revelation, there's some new knowledge, some new information, and all of this is part of the building process.  
This month is very special.  
I want to read to you from the scriptures.  
Now, first, from divisions chapter 1 and from verse 17,  
 the amplified version.  
He says, for always pray to God, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation of insight into mysteries and secrets in the deep and intimate knowledge of Him.  
 By having the eyes of your heart flooded with light so that you can know and understand the hope to which he has called you and how rich is his glorious inheritance in the saints, his Set-apat once.  
Wonderful.  
Beautiful portion of the Bible.  
Let me read that 17th verse again, Ephesians chapter 1 verse 17.  
 It is for always pray to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that it may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation, of insight into mysteries and secrets.  
Insight into mysteries and secrets.  
Wonderful.  
 Let me read to you from the book of Daniel chapter 12 from verse 1 so that you can have the full context.  
I'll read from the King James version.  
And at that time shall Michael, now this is talking about the latter times, okay?  
He's looking into the future.  
 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince, who stands for the children of thy people.  
The angel of the Lord is revealing this to Daniel.  
And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was, since there was a nation even to that same time.  
And at that time, thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.  
 and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt.  
And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.  
But thou O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end,  
 Menish are on tour and fro and knowledge shall be increased.  
It says travel will increase.  
It says menish are on tour and fro.  
It's talking about the rowing, you know, because at that time the  
 The best means of transportation for distant lands was by sea.  
That's what they knew about.  
But the King James uses the term run to and fro.  
It's not thinking about somebody running.  
He's just talking about going from place to place.  
His travel will increase in the last days.  
And knowledge shall be increased.  
Knowledge shall be increased.  
 in the last days.  
Doesn't that mean that, because look at it, this is knowledge shall be increased?  
He told him to seal the book, to seal the book until the latter times, until the time of the end, until the last days.  
And in those days knowledge shall be increased.  
 And this is the day.  
And the word that's used here for knowledge, being increased, this word knowledge here, actually refers to skill, understanding, discernment.  
So, he's not just talking about merely knowing something, like, okay, you read the newspaper and you get some knowledge.  
No, he's talking about insightful knowledge.  
 insightful knowledge that gives you skill, understanding, wits.  
And so God would raise the level of knowledge.  
 what it permits men to know.  
For example, a moment ago when we were sharing during the question and answers a segment, we talked about how it looks gospel 24 chapter, for the 51st, how that Jesus opened their understanding.  
See, he opened their understanding.  
It was a sudden thing.  
He opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures.  
So suddenly,  
 Knowledge increased and he brought them information Scriptures that they had read and didn't understand now Jesus opens their understanding and gives them those same scriptures and they are enlightened Now you can open to second Timothy chapter 2 I will read to you from the amplified version of  
 Verse 7 is, think over these things I'm saying.  
Understand them and grasp their application for the Lord will grant you full insight and understanding in everything.  
The Lord will grant you full insight and understanding in everything.  
Something that is really God is doing this month in our lives.  
And I don't miss this.  
 See, take advantage of it, take a hold of it.  
This month is the month of insight.  
This is the month of insight.  
Now, just in case you want to know, I tried to write this for you that will help you so you can write down.  
Insights means clear, deep, and usually sudden understanding  
 usually sudden, like when Jesus opened their understanding, clear, deep and usually sudden understanding, perception and penetration of a situation, subject or mystery.  
I said again, clear inside is clear, deep and usually sudden understanding, perception and penetration  
 of a situation, subject or mystery.  
And these are the last days, it says knowledge has been increased, it's talking about insightful knowledge which gives you skill, understanding and wit, very important.  
See, he enlightens our spirits and it says, look at what we read earlier in that 17th verse,  
 of visions, chapter 1, the amplified version, where he says that he may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelations of insight into mysteries and secrets.  
So this moment, the Holy Ghost, is given you something, a very special blessing.  
This moment, insight into mysteries and secrets.  
 You're gonna have perception, penetration.  
You understand the inner workings of things.  
And the Spirit of God will lead you into victories.  
There are things that would have been difficult for you to understand, but because of this special breathing of the Holy Spirit in your life, this special ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life, this particular month, something is gonna happen.  
 Lord's given you supernatural insight.  


  
Glory to God, glory to God, glory to God.  
See you're about to move into some big things in your life.  
And this is because of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  
Glory to God.  
Knowledge shall be increased.  
 which means that there are times in the kingdom of God when he does certain things, even though they could have been generalized.  
These are specific administrations of God in our lives.  
Wonderful.  
This is your month.  
It is your month of insights into mysteries and secrets.  
Hallelujah.

That's what makes the difference between the leader and the lead.  
See, he already told you that you would be at the front.  
He said you'd be at the head and not the tail.  
Why?  
Because he gives you insights that others don't have.  
Glory to God.  
Skill.  
This insightful knowledge brings you skill.  
Bring to skill.  
Descendants.  
 Red understanding.  
Then others will say of you, that man, that woman has the spirit of excellence.

Give him praise.  
Worship him, honor him.
