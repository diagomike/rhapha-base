title: The Year of Triumph
---
 As the world experienced the last few hours of the year 2014, millions converged in all Christ's embassy churches and several other places and viewing centers around the world to participate in the December 31 global service with the great man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Millions around the world participated in this extraordinary once-in-a-year prophetic service, which was hosted at the Love World Convocation Arena in Lagos, Nigeria and was broadcast live via major satellite, terrestrial and cable television stations on radio stations on the internet and in several viewing centers around the world.  
Everyone came with an expectation.  
I'm so excited.  
 to know what the year 2015 will be.  
We are highly expectant and looking forward to what the large has for us.  
All the brethren of Christ Embassy United Emirates are excited to know what is them for this particular year.  
 We are reaching from Seoul, South Korea.  
We are highly expectant and look forward to what the Lord has for us.  
We can't wait to hear from our men of God, Pastor Chris.  
We are greeting you from Fantastic Norway Oslo and we are looking so much forward to what this evening has for us tonight.  
 Hi everybody, we are here in Germany and today is the 31st of December and we are about to celebrate the New Year's Eve together with our Man of God Pastor Chris and indeed the year of 2014 was already a year of greatness and now we are full of expectations and we can't wait to hear what our Man of God is about to share and we are looking forward to hear the word for the next year 2015.  
 the service commenced with the Compi√®res welcoming everyone to an extraordinary night of glory.  
I can see that you are also full of expectation concerning tonight's meeting.  
And so on that note, we want to welcome everyone here tonight and all around the world to the 2014 December 31st night service with a man of God, Reverend Chris Oyaquilum.  


  
 Stay glued to your seats, attentive, because the night has only just begun.  
God bless you.  
Every aspect of the service was orchestrated to inspire and stir faith in all who participated, getting them ready for the message that will usher them into the new year.  
The prayer sessions, talk show segments, special administrations by an anointed gospel artist.  
Chris Shalom, power belongs to you.  


  
 Even led the congregation in a time of rapturous worship.  


  
 Come around and I'll say it for you all.  


  
 Pastor Israel, life of a leader.  


  
 Frank Edwards, minstered a new beginning.  


  
 He lied to jail.  
Somebody knows when you're crying Does hurt and pain inside The questions that you need answers to Somebody knows  
 As we experience the last few minutes of the year 2014, go by.  
The man of God, Pastor Chris, exhorted us in the words, giving glory to the Lord for the victories in 2014.  
You need to listen to what he says in the implication of what he didn't say.  
Are you hearing me?  
You have to know what God tells you.  
 And then what he didn't tell you because of what he told you.  
Hallelujah.  
And I think that the year 2014 was a springboard  


  
 And when God said it was the year of greatness, now I look back and I can understand better.  
I look back at the year and I can understand better.  
Sometimes, you see, the greatness of a man's life is the quality of his personality.  


  
 It's not in what happens around him.  
It's not in what he has.  
It's not in the favors he gets.  
It is in his present.  
And so God makes the man great, not his things.  


  
 Because you see, think about it.  
This place where we have this facility here, there were some other people who were once here many years ago.  
They're not here now.  
So humans calm and go.  
They acquire and they leave behind.  
But the thing that you take with you,  
 is the quality of your person.  
When you talk about a great man, a great woman, it's not about how much money's got in the bank.  
It's not in how many people respect him.  
It is the quality of his person, the power of his influence.  
Understand the power of his influence.  
 the power of it, the effectiveness of it, what it produces, how it affects all the means and lives in the quality of their persons.  
What a year it was.  
What a year it was.  
And some of us had experiences.  
I, as an individual, had an extraordinary experience.  
 But we did came the extraordinary power of the Word of God that had been seasoned in my spirit.  
And that's what you need in your life.  
When you have the power of God's Word seasoned in your spirit, you are like that man who built his house on a rock.  
 And Jesus said, the floods came.  
The winds beat against it.  
The house remained standing because it was founded on a rock.  
And because my life has been founded on a rock throughout 2014, I was on top every day.  


  
 full of joy, joy unspeakable, full of glory.  
Always with the word of God in my spirit, in my mind.  
Always.  


  
And that's the reason you are still here.  
Hallelujah.  
 Absolutely.  
Otherwise, you'd not been here.  
That's why you're still here.  
If it had not been the Lord.  
Who was with us?  
Where would we have been?  
In the mind of Psalm, it was all over.  
In the mind of Psalm, we were history.  
But look what the Lord has done.  
 Hallelujah.  
Look what the Lord has done.  
That's what the Bible says.  
Count it all joy.  
When you go through dive us test.  
Count it all joy.  
Count it all joy.  
Count it all joy.  
Joy.  
Joy.  
Joy.  
Joy.  
Shout him in somebody.  
Count it all joy.  
 And yes, we were full of joy as we gave thanks to God with grateful hearts.  
Then the man of God invited Martin Peking to take the hit song of the year, Superman, a song of the gospel.  
I am Superman, yeah, yeah.  
Oh, I can't do anything.  


  
 You can call me Superman.  
The reason is for the spirit of God lives.  
That's right.  
He has given us the abilities, given us the ability.  
Now look to your neighbor and say, take a good look at me.

Yes.  
For we walk by faith and not by sight.  
Come on.  
I walk by faith and not.  
For our lives are not by power.

Oh yes!  
From the spirit of God, listen to me!

 finishing the song on a high note we crossed the line into 2015 rejoicing welcome to 2015  


  
 The new year was ushered in by the display of beautiful fireworks amidst great rejoicing and gratitude to God for the new year.  


  
The leading reached another crescendo when the man of God in the formus of the spirit delivered the message for the new year.  
 Sarah, when she gave birth, she said, God has cost me to laugh.  
And then, and then she said, and then she said, and all those who hear of this will laugh with me.  


  
Well, this year, 2015,  
 is the year of triumph.  


  
And all those who are winners will try our winners!  
What a will, what a message.  


  
 Go ahead and thank Him for it.  
As His customary and believers love world nation, we wanted to hear more about the message for the year.  
All over the world, we listened with rapt attention as the man of God delivered the message with power.  
Glory to His name forever.  
I would like you to turn into your Bible.  
2 Corinthians chapter 2 and verse number 14.  
 He says, now, thanks be unto God, which always corset us to triumph in Christ and make it manifest the several of his knowledge by us in every place.  
Did you see that?  
There are certain important points to note there.  
He says, now, thanks be unto God, which one always, always,  
 makes us to triumph in Christ.  
In 2015, God will divinely position you to triumph always.  
Not sometimes.  
He says what?  
 Always.  
And keep this in your heart no matter what you go through, from January to December 2015.  
You are made triumphant.  
No matter where you find yourself, no matter what happens to you or around you.  
Remember these words.  
It is my year of triumph.  
 Just for the records.  
Maybe I should give you the simple meaning of the word triumph.  
Triumph means a great or important victory.  
Not just victory, but a great and important victory.  
Another way to put it, a great or notable success or achievement.  
Did you see that?  
A great or notable success or achievement.  
 So this year, 2015, you will have what?  
Great and notable achievements.  
Hallelujah.  
Great and important success.  
Great and important victory.  
It also means to prevail.  
In 2015, you will prevail.  
 Say, man.  
You see, as I say these words, I'm speaking them into your spirit.  
You see, I'm speaking them into your spirit.  
I told you the important thing about a person is the quality of his personality.  
It's what's resident in your person, who you are.  
And that can never be taken away from you.  
Hallelujah.  
And that's why I say, put me any way out of your success.  
 Joseph was a success in prison.  
They couldn't take his dreams away.  
They couldn't take his gifts away.  
They sold him into slavery in the house of Potiphar.  
He was a success and he made his master Potiphar a success.  
Hallelujah.  
And then from prison, he became Prime Minister of Egypt.  
Think about it.  
 If you've got it in you, it'll take you to the top.  
Triumph also means the successful ending of a struggle or contest.  
The successful ending of a struggle or contest.  
Hallelujah.  
So this is so important.  
 He says, thanks beyond to God, which always cossed us, always cossed us.  
He makes us.  
He does it.  
We don't pray to be victorious.  
We don't pray to be triumphant.  
We've got it in us to be so.  
Just don't forget it.  
Remember who you are.  
I know who I am.  
 Now, thanks be on the God which always cast us to triumph in Christ and makes manifest the same other's knowledge by us, in some places, in favorable places.  
No, in every place.  
That means physical places.  
 geographical places, emotional places, spiritual places, makes no difference what place it is, but in every place, wherever I find myself, he will manifest the savour of his knowledge, the fragrance of his knowledge everywhere.  
Can you say, man,  
 So I told you, look at it, always and every.  
Did you notice those two words?  
Always and then every, always and every.  
He makes it happen, always and in every place.  
Another thing to understand, challenges of life or problems or crisis will come from three major sauces.  
 And these are the word, the flesh and the devil.  
Okay?  
The word, the flesh and the devil.  
But look at St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 16, from verse 31.  
Quickly, St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 16, from verse 31.  
 Jesus answered them.  
Do you believe now?  
Behold our cometh.  
Yes, now come that he shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone.  
And yet, I am not alone.  
Jesus is wonderful because the Father is with me.  
 Can you have that confidence when everybody goes?  
He says, but I'm not alone because the father is with me.  
He knew that they will come when all his friends, his disciples, will flee for fear.  
He says, don't worry.  
I'm not alone.  
The father is with me.  
Next verse.  
 And I like this.  
These things I've spoken unto you, that in me, he might have peace in the world.  
You shall have tribulation.  
But be of good cheer.  
I have overcome the world.  
Why did he do it?  
For me.  
He says, be of good cheer.  
I have overcome the world.  
 And he overcame the word for us.  
That makes me an overcomeer.  
So I am of good chair.  
I'm chair up all the time.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm chair up all the time.  
Is it be of good chair?  
I've overcome the world.  
So he overcame the world for me.  
Romans chapter 8 and verse 32.  
 He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all.  
How shall he not with him also freely give us all things?  
Go on, next verse.  
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?  
It is God that justified it.  
Next.  
Who is he that condemned it?  
It is Christ that died.  
Yeah, rather that is risen again.  
Who is even at the right hand of God, who also make it in a session for us.  
 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sod.  
As this written for thy sake were killed all the day long, we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.  
Look at the next verse, me.  
In all these things, we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us.  
 We are more than conquerors.  
First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse number 57.  
What does he say?  
But thanks be to God, which gives us, he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
He gives us the victory.  
He gives us the victory.  
I'm victorious.  
 I said, I'm victorious.  
So he can understand that we are triumphant over the world.  
It's systems and it's circumstances.  
Hallelujah.  
And we're triumphant over the flesh and it's arms and deceptions.  
You can't work against me from the am of flesh.  
Amen.  
All the weapons of the devil.  
 Or what is God?  
With everything He can't stand us.  
We are more than conquerors.  
Hallelujah.  
And that's amazing.  
How do we keep ourselves there?  
By walking in the Spirit and in the dominion of the world.  
By walking in the Spirit.  
 and in the dominion of the Word of God.  
No matter what has launched against us from the flesh, we will always win.  
Because every man who walks in the Spirit is superior to the flesh.  
So walk in the Spirit.  
 walk in the dominion of God's word.  
And lastly there, he says, the devil, all right?  
I told you the word, the flesh and the devil.  
So in 2015, you also be triumphant over the devil and his operations and maneuvers.  
And during the year, learn quickly  
 that Satan tries to carry out his activities against God's children and the house of God.  
You have to understand that Satan's operations and maneuvers against God's children and against the church are just his way of life.  
Don't see your brothers and sisters as your enemies.  
 No, human beings are not your enemies.  
When they fight against you and do things against you, you understand it's the enemy, the devil, that influences them to do such things.  
What do you do?  
You speak God's word and rebuke the adversary.  
You may not be able to deliver the human being.  
If he doesn't want to be delivered, you can't free him.  
 But you sure enough can stop the devil from running rampage around you and from influencing things that concern you.  
Do you understand that?  
Every human being has to run his life.  
You can't cast the devil out of someone who doesn't want the devil to go except the person places himself under your influence.  
 So if they are not on, they are in flames, it's not going to work.  
Did you know that Jesus cast out a devil one time and the devil didn't go?  
I'm not sure some of you read that properly in your Bible.  
You see, is that possible?  
Yes.  
There was a man, a demon-possessed man in G-dara.  
 Among tombs, he lived among tombs, caught himself with stones night and day.  
Nobody could bind him.  
Sometimes they bound him with chains and feathers and he broke them and remained there in the cemetery until only Jesus passed by that road.  
As he passed by, Jesus saw the men are far off.  
That's what the Bible tells us.  
Readiness and Luke's Gospel.  
He saw the men are far off.  
 And he began to tell the devil to come out of the man.  
The devil didn't leave.  
The man instead ran towards Jesus.  
And the devil was still in him.  
After Jesus told the devil to go, he didn't go.  
And so when he ran to Jesus, he asked the devil, what is your name?  
After he told the devil to go and the devil didn't go.  
 He said to the devil, what is your name?  
See, the devil couldn't stop the man from running through Jesus.  
If the man doesn't come under your influence, you can't help him, even though you command the devil to go.  
 So Jesus commanded the devil to go.  
He didn't go.  
The man ran to Jesus.  
Then he asked the devil, what is your name?  
He said, my name is Legion because we're many.  
And then Jesus commanded that Legion in zero crime.  
Don't send us out of the country.  
Send us into the swine.  
There's over 2,000 of them.  
 And Jesus gave them leave, and they all went into the swans, and they ran into the water and drowned.  
And that's how the man was set free.  
Praise God.  
You follow that?  
So this year, make sure you cast out devils.  
Yeah, if you're uncomfortable with anything, now that doesn't mean that everything that happens is a devil, but you will know, because the anointing is on you.  
 You will know when it's the devil.  
You will know.  
In your spirit, you will know.  
And you just address the devil.  
You don't have to come out of your room to do it.  
The devil, there's no distance in the realm of the spirit.  
Even from your dining table, you can tell the devil to leave.  
Doesn't matter where he is in this world.  
He'll hear you.  
Call him by his name.  
And tell him to stop his operation and his maneuvers.  
 And he will stop.  
This is 2015.  
And this is my year of triumph.  
The year of notable victories.  
Notable achievements.  
It is my year of notable advancements.  
Notable.  
Notable.  
I must success.  
 And this Spirit of God will take you from glory to glory.  
Make sure you meditate on God's words.  
Take the Word of God seriously to your heart.  
Don't let it go.  
Stay in it.  
Walk in it.  
Be bold about the Word of God.  
Hold it tenaciously.  
Don't let it go.  
 And you will be amazed at what the Lord would do through you.  
Glory to His name forever.  
At the conclusion of the message, we were full, full of the Spirit, ready to face the year.  
And once again, we rejoiced greatly, dancing and singing with melody in our hearts to the song Superman.  
I'm Superman!  
I'm Superman!
