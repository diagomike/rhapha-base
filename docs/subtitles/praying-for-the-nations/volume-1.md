 The Bible says in 1 Timothy chapter 2, verse 1 to 4.  
I exhort therefore that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, but made for all men, for kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead our quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.  
 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.  
Our world today has been devastated with fake news and attempts of the devil to bring in the new world order.  
The man of God, Hasterkris, in this audio leads us through several prayer sessions as we pray for the nations of the world  
 Lord of glorify You're greater than all Your kingdom is a never lasting kingdom It shall never pass away Thank You for giving us the name of the Lord Jesus  
 to live in that name and by that name.  
Thank you for the authority in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
He said that his name every knee has to bow.  


  
That is mighty name.  


  
 You've given him a name that is above every name.  
The name that is above every government, above every title, above every authority, above every seat.  


  
We have broken the power and influence of Satan and his demons over the nations.  
 Over the governments of the world, we declare authority over them.  
They will not dictate how we live, how we worship you, where we worship you.  
They will not.  
We have destroyed their influence.  
We have destroyed their authority.  
 the power of the Holy Ghost and the power of the Holy Ghost.  


  
As we proclaim your name over every nation, Satan powers.  
Satan has no authority  
 over any of these countries, over any of these cities.  
We proclaim the name of Jesus over them.  
We proclaim the name of the Lord Jesus over the nations of the world.  
And at His name, every knee boughs, every knee boughs, Satan boughs, they prokusata kavai kasi.  
 We cast out the spirits that are responsible for this deception.  
We cast them out of the nations, the mighty name of Jesus Christ.  
We cast them out.  


  
 We cast them out of the nations.  
There's demons of afflictions.  
We cast them out of the nations and by the name of Chiyasis.  


  
 devils of pestilences.  
We cast them out of the nations, and the parabola goes, in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
We cast them out.  
They will proceed no further.  
Their deception is known.  
Their deception is revealed.  
 and they are resisted completeness, resisted in every nation, in every nation.  
We dethrone their powers, the Holy Ghost, the Soul and the Ka'varaka, the Sotiki.  
We claim our cities back.  
 We claim our nations back.  
We claim our streets back.  
But of parabaholigos who destroyed the influence of Satan over them.

They shall not rule over the nations while working.

 In the name of Jesus Christ, every devil abars, making suggestions to leaders of missions.  
At this time,  


  
 concerning dominance, totalitarianism, which we are witnessing right now.  
What's coming in in these guys, what's in the disguise of dictatorships,  
 in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  
We come against you demons of darkness.

We caught you off.

We cast you out in the name of Jesus Christ.  
 We are not afraid of you devil.  
Far in the name of Jesus.  


  
 We change things.  
By the power of the Holy Ghost.  
We take authority in the realm of the spirits.  
We refuse to continue to allow this.  
The streets belong to us.  
The cities are ours.  
 You blessed us.  
The earth is the Lord and the food as they're off.  
The war and all that is in it.  
Power belongs to God.  
And so in the name of Jesus, we take back.  
We take back.  
We take back.  
We take back.  
We take back our cities, our streets, our churches, our schools, our offices.  
We take them back in the name of Jesus Christ.  
 In every nation, Marakapunta, Tarabagi de RÃ­as, Li Cravando, Rondegre, Garamazatia.  
We come against the spirit of fear and intimidation.  
You devil of fear.  
You devil of terror.  
 In the name of Jesus, we bind you.  
We command you to the path from the governments.  
We command you to the path from our streets.  
We command you to the path from our cities.  
In the name of Jesus Christ.  
Lose your grip on the cities.  
Lose your grip on the nations.  
Lose your hold in Jesus name.  
We cut you off.  
 Mount across the Rodriguez.  
Now we reassign the desolate streets, back to angels, in the name of Jesus, angels of God, to patrol the streets, angels of God in every nation, by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the name of Jesus Christ, the release of angels, to change everything for the glory of God.

 Ashuramanta Kalaman de Gradiz, we've delivered the nations from the influence of Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus.

And we stop Him in the name of Jesus.  
He cannot do it before the time.  
He can't dominate the churches of Christ.  
He can't dominate the world.  
He can't do it.
