 Lord, we have declared that this is a day of salvation and a day of grace.  
And because it is, Satan has no power over the nations.  
He has no claims.  
And therefore we break his hold.  
 He and his agents cannot have hold on the nations or on their leaders.  
We break their power over them.  
We break their influence over the nations in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
We exercise authority over them.  
Thank you Lord.  
And we pray that the Lord of the harvest, the Holy Spirit of God,  
 will send for the laborers into the harvest fields of world leaders, leaders of nations, cities, states, send laborers of the gospel to take your message to these unreached.  
Thank you, Lord.  
 because it shall be done.  
Lord, we pray.  
Exercise your influence over the minds of leaders of nations.  
Exercise your influence over them.  
According to your faithful word in Proverbs chapter 21 and verse 1,  
 of the heart of the king is in your hand, and that you can tone the heart in any direction that you choose.  
You have the power, you can do it.  
Lord, we pray, cost them to turn from foolishness and deception to wisdom and truth.  
 As you did for Cyrus, King of Persia, you cost him to recognize that he should build a house, a house of God in Jerusalem.  
And you prepared him to do it.  
Grant these leaders, wisdom, enlighten the eyes of their understanding.  
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.  
Father, thank you, the Spirit God's been poured out upon our flesh.  
Everyone can hear you.  
Everyone can receive your voice.  
Everyone can understand you because of the ministry of the Holy Ghost.  
 let this ministry break forth upon them everywhere in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
And Father, we all so pray, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, we bring down, condemn, and destroy the work of ungodly men and women  
 around the world who fill the earth with violence and poverty and wickedness and death, keeping the people from knowing and recognizing the goodness of God, for your word declares that the earth is full of your goodness.  
But many don't know it.  
And you said us to tell them,  
 to show it to them.  
 Let the gospel have free course in every nation alone.  
Let it have free course.  
In every city, in every tower, in every street, let the gospel have free course everywhere around the world for the salvation of souls.  
And Satan cannot stop them.  
 Lord we pray.  
Let this grace be extended to every nation, to every city,  


  
 that their eyes may be open, that their ears may be open, that their minds may be open for the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Cost them to understand and receive truth.  
 He said, with the heart man believes unto righteousness.  
Let their hearts be open for the gospel, open for the light, open for righteousness.  
We remove the blindness of the mind in the name of the Lord Jesus, the blindness of the heart.  
We remove it from them in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
We break the power of Satan.  
 and his influence over the nations, that the blindness that is caused by the devil is removed from them in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Good decree your peace upon every city, upon every country.  
We pray for their leaders,  
 the heads of state, their lawmakers, their law enforcement agents.  
We pray for them all around the world.  
Oh, that the wisdom of God will guide their minds, that the influence of Satan over them will cease in the name of the Lord Jesus.  


  
 Thank you for the power of righteousness.  
The power of righteousness that's brought out, that's extended to the power of salvation, the reins of the Spirit.  
 for every nation, for every city.  
Let the name of the Lord Jesus be glorified.  
Let the name of the Lord Jesus be magnified.  
Let the name of the Lord Jesus be heard on high everywhere.  
These nations are open to the gospel.  
Their doors are open to the gospel in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
 Thank you, Lord.  
Thank you, Lord.  
We overthrow the empires of evil that have tried to dominate the nations, that have run the financial systems of this world.  
We overthrow them.  
We destroy their works in every nation  
 In the name of the Lord Jesus, we break their power over the leaders.  
We destroy their influence.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
But they will proceed no further.  
But the name of the Lord Jesus shall be glorified.  
The gospel will have free course.  
 Everywhere, the gospel has free course.  
Koma hande glira gaskoja parate clade gla rovonske jobra mande gli de gracidis.  
Where our gospel is being received throughout the world today, it has been received and you told us that wherever the receive our gospel, wherever the receive our message,  
 Our peace will be upon that place, upon that house, upon that city, upon that nation.  
We proclaim peace into every city where our gospel is.  
Peace in every city where there's rhapsody of realities.  
Peace in every town, in every street, in every nation,  
 Peace in every community where our gospel is in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Lord, thank you.  
Thank you for your amazing grace and the ministry of angels.  
Angels that are dispatched to go forth in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
 and we decree that they go forth throughout the world to cause this peace to take place for the people in the name of the Lord Jesus, to guide men to receive the gospel as we proclaim it to the ends of the earth in Jesus' name, Hallelujah.  


  
 Thank you for the nations of the world.  
For they all belong to you.  
And we are speaking your world into the spirit, watering the clouds of this world.  
We're superimposing our clouds of grace, our clouds of blessings, and our clouds of righteousness, our clouds of salvation over the nations.  
 over the clouds of war and clouds of evil and clouds of wickedness that had covered nations for so long.  
We destroyed the evil works of darkness and these nations.  
We pour forth righteousness.  
We pour forth salvation through the power of the Spirit of God.  
 But everywhere your message goes, everywhere that this gospel goes, you don't have power in the hearts of men.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Satan cannot change it.  
He cannot overthrow it.  
We break his power and his influence over men's hearts  
 in the cities, all over the world where your children are right now and trained.  
We exercise dominion.  
We command the peace of God into them, in the name of the Lord Jesus, the righteousness we prevail over them.  
 that will witness your goodness and your grace and will rebuke spirits of foolishness from the minds of leaders in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Our clouds are dominating.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus, that which comes from us is dominating, is in whatsoever is born of God of a comes world, that which proceeds from us.  
 by your spirit proceeds from you and it overcomes the world.  
We prevail over all evil.  
We prevail over them in the name of the Lord Jesus, by the power of the Spirit of God.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah in the name of the Lord Jesus.  


  
 Haranungo Zoo, Gratika Lake, Gratika Scobra, Minahasites, La Cruz, Zapatika, Lirohogo, Skeshez, Ganga, Digavaso, from Aniz.  
In every nation where the Church of Christ is, that nation cannot be yoked.  
Transhumanism will not gain the dominion in the days of the Church.  
 And these are the days of the Church of Christ.  
Transhumanism will not gain the dominion.  
Eugenics will not gain the dominion.  
He said, he of God, little children, and have overcome them.  
Because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.  
The one in us is greater than he that is in the world.  
All the nations are yours.  
 All the cities are yours.  
The Bible says the Lord is the governor among the nations.  
It's all yours.  
It's all yours.  
Father, we have subdued the adversary.  
He has no power.  
Anywhere we are, we have subdued him.  
We've broken his influence on the governments.  
 We have broken his influence.  
He cannot control the countries.  
He has no control.  
We have put him in check.  
We've served him notice, but he cannot run the nations.  
 because we are still here, and we have the dominion.  
We have the authority, the authority in the blessed name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
We honor you.  
We honor you, Lord.  
There's none like you.  
There's none like you.  


  
 Our faith over comes the world.  
Our faith over comes the world.  


  
And in the name of the Lord Jesus, we declare that we have power  
 Over the nations, for they belong to Jesus Christ, Son of the living God.  
And we declare His name over the nations.  
We proclaim His name over the nations.  
We declare His glory over the nations.  


  
Le mancorra ceti calicra ceti la cruz.  
 We declare His Word over the nations of the world.  
Every country.  
Every country.  


  
The knowledge of the glory of the Lord shall cover these nations as the waters cover the sea.  
 It shall be so.  
It shall be so.  
It shall be so.  
It shall be so.  


  
And the open door of the gospel that has been given to us.  
No man shall shut it.  
No man shall shut it.  
 No man shall shut it.  
These doors shall remain open in the mighty name of Jesus.  
They shall remain open for the gospel.  
By the power of the Holy Ghost, by the power of the Holy Ghost, by the power of the Holy Ghost, the nations shall remain open to the gospel.  
 And those wounds that we as though they had been closed shall be open by the power of the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus.  
Jesus Christ shall be glorified in the earth.  
In the whole earth, His name shall be glorified in all the earth.  
 Hallelujah.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  


  
 We exercise our triumph and authority over demons of darkness, principalities of evil, and the rulers of the darkness of this world.  
Lord, we don't belong under them.  
We are children of light.  
We exercise dominion over the rulers of darkness.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus, we break their influence over the nations, over the cities,  
 And their failed projects of mandatory vaccines is doomed.  
The Lord, they have no ability to control the nations.  
Why the name of the Lord Jesus is in office.  
And according to your word, this is not the time.  
 Satan has no power at this time over the nations.  
And therefore we rule over him, in every city, in every town, in every state, in every nation of the world, all the countries and territories of the world.  
The gospel shall have free course.  
 in the name of the Lord Jesus and shall not be in that.  
And every power that has tried to forbid the gathering of God's people or such powers are broken in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Their influence is taken away from those nations.  
And the spirit that caused them to do it, we bind that spirit in the name of the Lord Jesus and break his influence over those leaders.  
 And every plan of Satan to close down churches is vanquished in the name of the Lord Jesus.

 All territories of the world be filled with the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.  
This is the day of harvest.  


  
 This is the day of grace.  
This is the day of salvation.  
Therefore let the angels of salvation go forth across the world to haul men into salvation.  
 Let them have an ear to hear the gospel, a heart to receive the gospel.  
As we proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ around the world, give them a listening ear and a hearing heart to God.  
We've removed the blindness from their hearts.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus, we break the power of blindness from their hearts.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus,  
 that the veil that Satan put on their hearts is torn in the name of Jesus Christ, unto a pokora satah, and the scales are of their eyes, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
But all around the world, men and women are coming to Christ, old and young are coming to Christ, in the name of the Lord Jesus, for this is the day of salvation.  
Mala, sochra, sebradilla, groski,  
 We minister hope in the name of Jesus.

Le roso kabarahal de clira castedir.

We come against the wicked spirits of darkness.  
And of course, men do steal from the poor to destroy that which the Lord has made.  
 Lord, your goodness is in every country, but many are unable to see it because of those who have oppressed them and stolen from them.  
O Lord God of Israel, God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Father of mercy, God of all comforts, the God of peace and love,  
 You are the only true God, the living God, the faithful God.  
Let your grace be poured out upon the nations that they may know, that you did bless them, that they may see your goodness.  
Let your grace be poured out upon them.  
 For it is written that you give more grace, give them more grace, grace to see, grace to understand, grace to hear the gospel, grace to believe in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus.  
 give them grace, more grace alone, more grace around the world, more grace.

In every city, in every state, in every country,  


  
 The name of the Lord Jesus is exalted.  
Like a mighty river, the Spirit is poured out into them.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus, la crucica, bada, bada, badis.

They can believe truths.

And let me pray.  
 but there will be an increased ministry of angels to guide men into truths, to guide men to where they can and how they can receive accurate information that they can believe in art, unfactual information on truths.
