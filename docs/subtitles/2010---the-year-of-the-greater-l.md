title: 2010 - The Year of the Greater Light
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 The message of the year is quite enlightening and these are the outbreathens of God's spirit.  
2010 is the year of the greater light.  


  
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Holy Spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory.  
Thank you, Lord.  
All right.  
Let's talk about it now.  
Yes, it is the year of the greater light.  
You know,  
 You know, there are dealings of the Spirit and dealings with the Spirit of God that we may never be able to bring to human discussion.  
Some things that we may not even have words to communicate to other people.  
Sometimes I wish I could just express certain things and not enough language in the earth to communicate certain things.  
 You know?  
But thank God for the ones that we can share.  
Hallelujah.  
And God made two great lights, verse 16, chapter 1, Book of Genesis.  
The greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night.  
He made the stars also.  
And God set them in the filament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night.  
 and to divide the light from the darkness in God's soul that it was good and the evening and the morning were the fourth day.  
Maybe I should read to you so you can just get a little more glimpse into this.  
Two verses prior to this verse 14.  
 And God said, let there be lights in the filament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the filament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so.  
So God said, let there be light and there was light.  
So there was already light.  
 And then he separated the light from the darkness, the light he called day.  


  
And the word translated day also means hot.  
And the darkness he called night.  
 Then he made two great lights, two great lights, and set one light to rule the day.  
The word is to have dominion, to exercise authority over the day, and one over the night.  
The one to rule the night,  
 was the lesser lights.  
So he made the lesser lights to rule the night and the greater light to rule the day.  
He's amazing the way God thinks.  
You would have thought he should make the greater light to rule the night and the lesser lights for the day since the day would need lesser light.  
But no,  
 because there are things that happen in the night and there are things that happen in the day.  
And so God said, the greater light to rule the day, the lesser light to rule the night.  
That's the way he saw it.  
That's the way he wanted it.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Now, in the Bible, there are certain expressions for the greater light.  
These two lights that he set over the earth that he just talked about are the moon and the sun, the moon to rule the night, the sun to rule the day.  
And the word translated sun  
 means brightness.  
Brightness.  
Hallelujah.  
Are you still there?  
Okay, turn to the book of Malachi.  
And we are reading from verse one chapter four.  
Are you there?  
 He says, Behold the day comets that shall burn as an oven.  
He says the day comets that shall burn as an oven.  
And all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble.  
That means they will be burnt because they will be stubble.  
 And the day that comets shall bond them up, say it to a lot of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.  
This is a terrible day that's coming.  
It's a day of hardship, a day of turmoil, a day of questions without answers.  
 and it shall leave them neither roots nor branch which means nothing to hold on to destroying the history destroying the extension terrible verse two  
 But unto you that fear my name, shall the Son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings, and he shall go forth and grow up as curves of the stall."  
Are you still there?  
This is beautiful.  
 Let me read to you that same verse, what we just read now.  
Let me read it to you from the amplified version.  
It says, but unto you, who revere and worshipfully fear my name shall those son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings,  


  
 And you shall go forth and gamble like curves released from the stall and leap for joy.  
You know what it is to gamble?  
It means to skip and jump joyfully.  
Have you ever released a calf or a young sheep or  
 Ram, to let it go.  
You see it, leaping, leaping for joy.  
That's what he's saying.  
So you will leap for joy.  
And ye shall tread down the wicked, for there shall be ashes on that the souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this day at the Lord of Hosts.  
 So while that day becomes hot and burning, he says, upon you shall arise the son of righteousness, the son.  
He's talking about the son that rules the day, the son of righteousness with healing in his wings.  
Are you getting it?  
 This is beautiful, but there's more.  
Let me read something to you from the Book of Isaiah chapter 33.  
Isaiah chapter 33.  
From verse 20.  


  
 He says, look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities, thine eyes shall see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down, not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed.  
Neither shall any of the cards thereof be broken.  
Hallelujah.  
 I hope you understand this.  
Look at verse 24.  
And the habitants shall not say, I am sick.  
The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.  
Hui, Zion!  
This is Zion, the city of our solemnities.  
What is this saying?  
He's talking about our meeting places like this one.  
 the city of our solemnities, our place of gathering.  
It says those of us who live in this place of gathering when we come together.  
It says that they shall not say, I am sick.  
In 2010, you want to make sure that health is not a problem for you?  
Being the house of God.  
Are you hearing me?  
 It's important, have fellowship with fellow believers.  
We'll come to church.  
There's a corporate auction, a corporate anointing that flows, that works in all of us, even when you are tired, come.  
Because it is better to be in the presence of God, nodding and tired than to be elsewhere.  
 He says, look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities.  
He's talking about our meetings.  
He says, Day that dwell therein shall not say I am sick.  
He's saying sickness will not be your posture.  
Imagine that growth that was taking its place in your body.  
You come into the house of God during worship, it dissolves.  
 A lot of times you will not even notice them.  
You will not even notice the problems that try to come into your body.  
You used to have asthma, but you've been coming to church.  
Now you can't remember the last time you had a crisis.  
This is Luke upon Zion, the city of our solemnities.  
Why is it so?  
Why?  
 Isaiah chapter 24.  
And I want you to go to verse 23.  
Then the moon shall be confounded and the sound of shame, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and before his ancients gloriously.  
Just in case that King James' language was too big for you, let me read it to you from  
 from the amplified version.  
Then the moon will be confounded and the sun will shame when they compare their ineffectual fire to the light of the lot of hosts who will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem.  
And before his elders will show forth his glory.  
He's saying that there is a light in Zion that shines brighter than the sun and the moon that you see out there.  
 What is he saying?  
He's beginning to spiritualize the light.  
He's beginning to let us understand that there's something better than the physical light that is out there.  
That when you talk about the greater light, the greater light is not just the sound that stands out there.  
There's a spiritual world that is greater than this material world.  
He says, in that light is the Lord's presence.  
Where in Zion?  
 In Zion.  
And where are we in Zion?  
He says, here come unto Mount Zion.  
When you were born again, you were born into Zion.  
That's what the Bible says.  
The people of the Old Testament were assembled to Mount Sinai.  
And the Bible says, there there was darkness and tempers.  
 the thunderings and the lightnings from the fierce anger of the Lord.  
He says, he had not come on to mount Zanei or to mount Zion.  
He didn't say he had come in.  
There's an old hymn some Christians used to sing many years ago.  
 Sometimes the sun get on wedding days.  
We are marching to Zion.  
Beautiful, beautiful Zion.  
We are marching upwards to Zion, the beautiful city of God.  
They didn't know they were marching away from Zion.  
 No, I like the song back then.  
I liked it.  
I was ignorant.  
I was younger than the son of the not old church.  
 especially on the wedding day as the groom stood out there and the bride was coming.  
We imagine desire and the choir was lovely.  
They had a wonderful voice and the bass and the barry tones.  
They were, oh my goodness, beautiful, beautiful.  
And they got desire.  
 But you see, no matter how beautiful you sing the song, the meaning matters.  
The Bible didn't say, he are coming to Mount Zion.  
The Bible didn't say much to Zion.  
The Bible says, he are come.  
He have arrived.  
When, when you were born again, you arrived in Zion.  
Can you shout him in somebody?  
 We are in Zion.  
We belong in Zion.  
Zion is the city of the great king.  
That's the city that Abraham the Bible says was looking for.  
The Bible says he was looking for a city whose builder and Mecca is God.  
Define it?  
Yeah.  
Zion.  
Zion.  
Say I'm from Zion.  
 Ha, ha, ha, ha.  
Sit again.  
I'm from Zion.  
I'm from Zion.  


  
Glory to God.  
Yeah.  
So, so what's going on here?  
This is a light of God.  
It's a light of God.  
 He says, Glorious things are spoken of thee, O City of God.  
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O City of God.  
Oh, let's talk it about me.  
He says, the Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.  
Glorious things are spoken of you.  
O City of God.  
Glorious things.  
 He calls you His justified wants.  
He calls you His righteousness.  
I!  
This is out of Zion.  
The perfection of beauty.  
God shines forth.  
This is out of Zion.  
God shines forth.  
 Out of Zion, God shines thoughts.  
Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty.  
King James puts it another way.  
He says, out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shines.  
God shines thoughts.  
You want to see the glory of God?  
Look at Zion.  
He said, look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities.  
 Day that dwell therein shall not say, I am sick.  
For they shall be forgiven their iniquities.  
Glory to God.  
Yeah.  
Zion, the something in Zion, is a Zion, the perfection of beauty.  
Zion, the perfection of beauty.  
The perfection of beauty.  
 You still in this place?  
Psalm 50.  


  
 From verse 1, the mighty God, even the Lord had spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.  
Verse 2, out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God had shined.  
Out of Zion, God shines forth.  
Out of Zion, God shines forth.  
That means from here.  
 from where we are at, from our gatherings, the city of our solemnities.  
This is Zion right here.  
And we have our brethren all over the world.  
Zion, out of Zion, God shines forth.  
You want to see the glory of God?  
Look at me.  
 Yes, yes, we are the bearers of His glory.  
We are the bearers of His splendor.  
Can you say hallelujah?  
The Bible says Jesus Christ was the effulgence of His glory.  
The express image of His person.  
And that's what we are today.  
We are the express image of His person.  
 We are the outshining of the Father's glory.  
This is Zion.  
Thanks beyond to God.  
Oh yes, I know.  
You see, this is the perfection of beauty.  
Zion is the perfection.  
Do you understand?  
This is the perfection.  
 This is the perfection.  
Here is the fullness of God.  
Here is the totality of his power, of his presence, of his glory.  
This is where God sits.  
You say, how is that possible?  
You go back into the book of Genesis, the Bible tells us that Jacob had a dream.  
 And so angels are sending and sending a ladder that was reaching up to heaven from the earth.  
And Jacob woke up and he said, God has been in this place and I didn't know it.  
It is possible to not know that God has been present.  
 For example, God has been here tonight.  
He's been in this place.  
But if you look around with your optical eyes, you may not see him.  
Because you don't see God with your optical eyes, you'll be holding with your spirit.  
For God is a spirit.  
You can touch him with your faith.  
 You fellowship Him with your spirits.  
Jesus, God is a spirit.  
And those who worship Him, who worship Him, in spirit and in reality, in spirit and in truth for the Father's seek at such.  
The Father's seek at such.  
Can you understand that?  
The Father's seek at such to worship Him.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh.  
 That's why he calls us Jerusalem that is from above.  
This is the perfection of beauty.  
I wish you could understand this.  
 That's how we sing that song.  
Complete, complete, complete in Him.  
We are complete in Him.  
Complete, complete, complete in Him.  
We are complete in Him.  
The fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelled in my Lord.  
That's my Lord Jesus.  
 The fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelled in my Lord.  
The fullness of the Godhead bodily dwelled in my Lord.  
And we are complete in here.  
It's not by works of righteousness, but by His grace alone.  
 It's not by works of righteousness, but by His grace alone.  
It's not by works of righteousness, but by His grace alone.  
And we are complete in Him.  
We are completing Him.  
I said, we are complete.  
Ah, yeah!  
Glory to God.  
Oh, glory to God.  
This is the perfection of beauty.  
Do you understand this?  
 Listen, that's who you are too beautiful to be sick.  
Do you understand what I'm telling you?  
Oh, we are completing Him.  
It says, and ye are completing Him.  
Who is the head of our principality and power?  
Complete.  
Say, I am complete.  
I am perfected in Him.  
 again I'm perfected in him brothers and sisters look at yourselves and say I'm perfected in him I know I know there are those who are finding themselves in certain situations and they are concerned maybe you took a Johnny out of Zion maybe you did  
 Maybe you john it out of Zion.  
Maybe because it's when you john it out of Zion, you find, oh, the cancer, oh, the failure, oh, the hopelessness, oh, the discouragement.  
If you find discouragement, you have gone out of Zion.  
 Find your place back to Zion.  
For in Zion, there is no fear.  
In Zion, there is no discouragement.  
In Zion, there is no sickness.  
Are you hearing me?  
When you read in Psalm 137,  
 And those Jewish people were taken in a captivity.  
They said, by the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.  
Yeah, we worked when we remembered Zion.  
 They said, they that carried us away captive, required of us a song.  
They that wasted us, required of us, words, saying to us, sing unto us one of the songs of Zion.  
And they said, how shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?  
 They said, we are in a strange land.  
We will not sing the songs of Zion in this strange land of pen, in this strange land of penury, in this strange land of discouragement.  
Oh, how shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?  
In Jeremiah chapter 51 and verse 50, he said, oh, remember God from afar.  
He said, let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
 Yes.  
Let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
Remember the life in Zion.  
Remember the glory of Zion and why you're in a strange land of pain.  
Sing the song of Zion.  
Why you're in a strange land of discouragement.  
Look up and sing the song of Zion.  
Can you hear what I'm saying tonight?  
Sing the song of Zion.  
Sing it and find your way in Zion.  
 He said, we hung our hearts upon the willows.  
Don't hang your harp.  
In that position of pain, don't say, how can I sing the song of praise in this situation?  
Don't hang your harps.  
Don't say, I've lost everything.  
How can I sing the Lord song?  
No.  
No.  
 He says, oh, remember God from afar.  
He says, you are in a far place.  
Remember God from afar and let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
Hallelujah.  
 Let it come to your mind.  
The city of lights.  
Let it come to your mind.  
The place of brightness.  
Let it come to your mind.  
Oh, and that takes us to the next part.  
You see, this is let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
Long grajigos so ta corona haste.  
Ligos go vermanda la gira auntersata.  
Shalla go verdira acoza.  
Lirondas gave dara acclirondas tais la hata.  
 My word builds faith and gives strength to all who receive it.  
To all who receive it.  
My word makes.  
My word creates.  
What is it that you desire?  
What is it that you have seen?  
The word will make it for you.  
That's what I said in other tongues.  
Praise God.  
 Thank you Lord Jesus, let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
Are you hearing this?  
But there's something even better.  
Moving Father, this is here come to Mount Zion.  
Jeremiah said, let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
Oh God, salamate ke bosa kalamahididis.  
 Zevron d'Olegrojos se plaredes.  
Are you in this place?  
Okay.  
Let's move on.  
Tell us about it.  
Let's move on.  
Say it again.  
Let's move on.  
Second Peter.  
Chapter 1.  
You ready for it?  
 I'm reading to you from verse 16.  
For we have not followed commonly devised favors when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we're our witnesses of this majesty.  
Peter is writing this.  
For he, Jesus, received from God the Father, honor and glory.  
 when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory.  
This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.  
Peter's telling them, what happened?  
And he says, and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mountain.  
He says, while we were with Jesus, you remember that occasion?  
 And this is how I was with Jesus when a voice spoke from heaven to Jesus and said, this is my beloved son.  
Thank you, Lord.  
In whom I'm well pleased, Peter says, this voice which came from heaven, we heard.  
We heard it.  
He's explaining his very experience.  
Then he says something significant here.  
 Verse 19.  
We have also a more sure word of prophecy.  
A more sure word.  
Something better than human experience.  
No matter what your vision was, there's something better.  
It is God's word.  
It is this a more sure word of prophecy.  
But I want you to see something here.  
I want you to see something here.  
This is powerful.  
 We have also a martial world of prophecy, where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that's shining in a dark place until the day dawn.  
And the day star arrives in your hearts.  
This is beautiful.  
This is marvelous.  
 He, He shows us something so powerful, the experience, the experience, then the martial word of prophecy, the martial word of prophecy is better than the experience.  
And when you have this martial word of prophecy, He says, you do well.  
 to hold onto it as onto a light that shines in a dark place.  
And you know that the light for the darkness is the lesser light.  
He says that prophecy is the lesser light.  
Are you still here?  
He says, hold on to the prophecy.  
Le Mungrozki-Brahata.  
Hold on to the prophecy as the light that shines in the dark place.  
 Hold it until the day dawn.  
I said until the day dawn.  
When the day dawns in your heart, he says you will know it.  
Hold on to that prophecy until the day dawns.  
He didn't say until the prophecy is fulfilled.  
 He says, hold on to what?  
That martial word of prophecy, until it is fulfilled?  
No, that's not what he said.  
Until the dead dawns.  
He says, because you need that prophecy in the dark place.  
Why are some people in the dark place?  
There's a reason they found themselves in the dark place.  
They are living in the night of their life.  
 He says, in that place of knights, in that place of darkness, you need prophecy.  
But you hold on to that prophecy until the dead dawns in your hearts.  
Until the dead dawns in your hearts.  
He didn't say until the prophecy is fulfilled.  
Many people are hoping, waiting for the prophecy to be fulfilled.  
You are wrong, my brother.  
You are wrong, my sister.  
He didn't say, hold on to the prophecy until it is fulfilled.  
He says, hold on to the prophecy until the dead dawn.  
 And the death star arise in your hearts.  
There are those who have been waiting for a prophecy to come to pass, and it's an I don't know why this prophecy has not come to pass.  
There is a reason it has not come to pass.  
You are living in the darkness, and the prophecy is to be held onto as a flicker of light in a dark place.  
The trouble is you are still in a dark place, and that darkness has overwhelmed your hearts.  
 He says, when the dead tones in your hearts, hey, when the dead tones in your hearts, you are using the lesser lights.  
And the lesser light is for the darkness.  
The lesser light is for the night.  
When you turn on the greater lights, the greater lights will tell you the now of your life.  
It will tell you who you are in Christ.  
It will tell you what belongs to you today.  
Can you show him in somebody?  
 There is a greater light than that prophecy.  
The prophecy might have said that God said you will get well.  
Yes, you can hold onto it as a light in a dark place until the dead dawn in your hearts.  
When the dead dawns, you know what, brother?  
It means that the greater light is ruling the greater lights because the greater light is not for the night.  
The prophecy is for the night.  
 the darkness let the dead dawn in your hearts when the dead dawns in your hearts and the death star arise in your hearts  
 You will know that there is a greater truth, that greater truth, that greater light is not that God said you are going to get well.  
But that, oh my God, listen, it means that the light of life that has been given to you is already shining.  
The Bible says the true light now shines.  
 That means this sickness from which the lesser truths said you will be healed does not exist at all.  
This is the greater light.  
Do you understand the greater lights?  
Those who function in the greater light will not know night in 2010.  
Are you still there?  


  
 The lesser light says you have lost money.  
The lesser light says your business is going down.  
The lesser light says you have been cheated.  
But the greater light tells you there is an abundance in your life.  
Can you shout him in somebody?  
How could you lose?  
When the Lord is your shepherd and you shall not want.  
He makes you lie down in green pastures.  
Come on, shout Hallelujah.  
 I dwell in the greater light.  
The Bible says we are children of the day, not of the nights.  
We are not of the nights.  
We are not of the nights.  
Can you shout Him in somebody?  
We are children of the day, not of the nights.  
Let the dead turn in your heart.  
Let the dead star rise in your heart.  
Can you shout hallelujah?  
 There is a greater light.  
Oh, glory to God.  
There is a greater light.  
The greater light rules the day.  
The greater light rules the day.  
Even the hotness of the day is tamed by the greater light.  
He says, the son of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings.  
Can you shout Hallelujah?  
Glory to God.  
In 2010, get ready to function in the greater light.  
 There is a greater light, my brother.  
There is a greater light, my sister.  
There's a greater light.  
Why do you let night rule in your heart?  
Why have you lived by the lesser light?  
Why have you allowed the darkness to function in you?  
Why have you allowed that mirage of a growth, that tumor to take a hold of your body?  
There's a greater light.  
 If any man be in Christ, he is a new creation.  
All things are passed away.  
 All things are passed away.  
Doesn't matter how you were born of your mother.  
All things are passed away.  
Doesn't matter what sickness you came out with the womb.  
All things are passed away.  
Are you hearing me?  
Doesn't matter what disease is found in your family.  
All things are passed away.  
There is a greater light.  
And in 2010, walk in the greater light.  
Can you shout him in somebody?  
 I told you there's something.  
You know what?  
Jeremiah said, let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
In other words, remember.  
Remember, he says, God from afar, from the distance where you've been taken.  
That was Jeremiah.  
But Jesus brought something better.  
 in describing the temple, in describing the church, the new Jerusalem.  
John said, I looked into the new Jerusalem.  
I found no temple there.  
There was no temple there.  
Why?  
We are the temple of the Holy Ghost.  
 There was no temple there.  
And then he says, and the gates will not be shot in the day.  
He didn't say, and the night, he said, because there will be no night there.  
No night!  
 What is it saying?  
We're carrying this thing in our hearts.  
The kingdom of God is not something I remember.  
The kingdom of God is not something I think about over there.  
The kingdom of God is within me.  
I carry Jerusalem in my heart.  
Can you shout Hallelujah?  
I carry that heavenly city in me.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
 Luke upon Zion, the city of our solemnities.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
Think about it.  
What life he has given us.  
Discolor the greater light.  
Live by the greater light.  
Walk by the greater light.  
When something happens, and I said, what are you going to do about it?  
I said, there's a greater light.  
There's a greater light.  
 There's a greater light.  
This is the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.  
There's a greater light.  
So what you are seeing is by the lesser light.  
Brother, there's a greater light.  
You know, when you go into your room, in your house, the light that you have in your room cannot show you the beautiful things you're wearing.  
 You can look at your skin, but if you go to a greater light, the x-rays, the look riding to your body, are you hearing me?  
Doesn't matter what has been happening, there's a greater light.  
And this greater light rules the day.  
And there is no night in my heart.  
 There is no night in my life.  
In Him, there is no darkness at all.  
Say, no darkness in my life.  
No night in my life.  
I'm not a child of the night.  
I'm a child of the day.  
And that's what the Bible says.  
That's what the Bible says.  
We are not of the night, but of the day.  
Hallelujah.  
 Greater light.  
Somebody understands greater light.  
Greater light.  
Greater light.  
Greater light.  
I'm seen by the greater light.  
I'm looking through the greater light.  


  
 They look at it and find that trouble in your body.  
You see, that's the lesser light.  
So there's a greater light.  
I got a greater light.  
Tell someone there's a greater light.  
There is a greater light.  
2010 is my year of the greater light.  


  
 Glory to God.  
Yeah.  
Right now, open your mouth and pray.  
Open your mouth and pray.  
There's a greater light.  
Praise the Lord Jesus.  
Glory to His name forever.  
Hallelujah.  
 This 2010 is a special year for you.
