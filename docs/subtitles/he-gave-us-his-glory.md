Be blessed as we bring you an excerpt of one of the teachings from the Healing Stream's live healing services with the man of God, Pastor Chris.  


  
 How many times have you heard someone say that God said he will not share his glory with another?  
How many times have we been told that God, that no man shall share his glory or take his glory?  
And we hear those things in churches, we hear them from, you know, a lot of people  
 So much so, we really think that what they're saying is real or spiritual.  
But first I want to show you where they got it from and what the Bible actually says.  
In Isaiah chapter 42, when we read from verse 8,  
 God said through the Prophet, I am the Lord.  
That is my name.  
And my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.  
So we know that God actually said so.  
He will not give his glory to another.  
But then he also clarified, if you understand Isaiah's prophetic ministry and his  
 expressions, you will understand the dual communication of the same truth that he portrays in most of his prophecies.  
In other words, when you study the writings of Isaiah the prophet, you would see that when he says,  
 I am the Lord, that is my name, my glory, will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.  
The one that he refers to as another is also spiritually what he refers to as graven images, which means when he said, I will not give my glory to another, he was talking about other gods.  
 And these are the gods where represented with graven images.  
And the Bible says there really are no other gods in that the idols that people worship are actually demons.  
Demons are behind those images, those idols.  
 And so when men sacrifice to these so-called gods, these idols, the Bible says the sacrifices that they offer to idols, they are offering to demons and not to God.  
So it's not God that's behind those idols.  
It's demon spirits that are behind idols.  
 And that's the reason God says to us, do not worship idols.  
No, you cannot represent God with any form.  
You can't do that.  
You cannot worship something that you made with your own hands.  
Neither should you worship another creature.  
 Only God deserves to be worshiped.  
But he said, God made us.  
And I want to show you something at the Bible, terraces.  
So when men are concerned about God not wanting to share his glory with another, they have to understand exactly what the scriptures tell us.  
What was God's intent?  
 In his communication, in fact, I'll read another portion to you in Isaiah, chapter 48 and verse number 11.  
Take a look at it.  
For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it?  
For how should my name be polluted?  
And I will not give my glory on to another.  
How do you pollute the name of God by mixing the worship of God with idolatry?  
 So every time he talks about not giving his glory to another, he's not referring to sharing his glory with human beings.  
It was always God's plan to share his glory with human beings.  
That was God's plan from the beginning.  
He always wanted to do it.  
Glory refers to excellence.  
 Excellence.  
Being top class.  
Greatness.  


  
Look at what the Bible tells us when man's saying that what happened to him.  
In Romans chapter 3 and verse number 23, look at what the Bible says.  
For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  
It was sinned that brought man out of the glory of God.  
 So when God made man, he glorified man.  
But when man sent, he fell short of the glory of God.  
So when Jesus came, Jesus came to restore glory to man in God.  
And I'll show that to you in a second.  
So you see that that's God's plan.  
God wants your life glorified.  
 You're not a weak element and weak creature of some big God somewhere who doesn't care.  
No, God made you for a purpose.  
Don't worry about how human beings describe you.  
Some people may find themselves in more fortunate positions than others and look down at you.  
But it doesn't matter.  
 because they didn't create you.  
They shouldn't determine what happens in your life.  
What you become is between you and God.  
And the first thing you have to do is discover God's plan for your life.  
Discover that God made you for His glory.  
I just showed you.  
It was sin that brought men short of the glory of God.  
 But let's see what Jesus said in his prayer to the Father.  
In St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 17, and I'm going to read to you from verse number 24, let's begin reading.  
He prays to the Father, he says, Father, I will, that they also whom thou has given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou has given me.  
 For thou lovest me before the foundation of the world."  
This is a prayer.  
He's praying to the Father here.  
He goes on praying, next verse, all righteous Father.  
The world had not known thee, but I've known thee.  
And these have known that thou hast sent me.  
He's referring to his disciples.  
 And I have declared unto them thy name.  
And I will declare it that the love where we thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them.  
Wow.  
That's wonderful.  
That's wonderful.  
Then I want you to go to verse 21.  
 that they all may be one, as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the word may believe that thou has sent me.  
This is extraordinary.  
I want you to think about what Jesus is saying here.  
This is extraordinary.  
 Look at the next verse.  
Watch now.  
And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them.  
That's wonderful.  
That's not a promise.  
That's a statement of fact.  
 That's not a promise.  
He's saying he's done it.  
Look at it.  
And the glory which thou gave us me, I have given them that they may be won even as we are won.  
This is extraordinary.  
Imagine if you never find this out, you will never live like God gave you glory.  
 when sickness comes to your body, you will accept it because the world tells you you are unfortunate.  
Something terrible has happened to you.  
They're so sorry for you and they'll try their best to see what they can do for you and then where they fail, that's the limit of your life.  
Remember, there was a day that tuberculosis was a killer disease and there was no medication.  
Many, many years ago,  
 There was a time that malaria was a killer disease and there was no answer, no medical solution.  
Now, in medicine, they can help you if you've got tuberculosis.  
They can help you if you've got malaria.  
But when they didn't have the solution, it was a death sentence.  
 These are still killer diseases.  
But because there's medication, people can be happy and say, well, I'll take medication, I'll be fine.  
But the day before they found out how to cure it, it was the end.  
If you suffer from it, that was the end of your life.  
Meaning that people live their lives according to the limitations of other men.  
Waiting for somebody to find out.  
 When you come to Christ, when you know Jesus Christ, you learn to use his name.  
He gave you glory.  
Glory means health.  
Let me show you something.  
Go to the thought of Saint John and let us read verse number two.  
Look at what he says, beloved, I wish above all things that thou may as prosper and be in health.  
 Even as I saw prosperity.  
Did you see that?  
He says, I wish above all things that you prosper and be healthy.  
That's better than even getting healed.  
He says, I don't want you sick.  
I want you healthy.  
Did you know that was God's plan?  
It was God's plan.  
Jesus has given you glory.  
 Let me show this to you.  
You go to Romans chapter eight and I'm going to read to you from verse 28.  
And we know this is after you've become a Christian and you have known Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit is in your life.  
Here's what it tells you what Jesus did for you.  
He says, we know.  
 All things work together for good, meaning that when you receive Christ, when you get to know Jesus Christ, there's no such thing as a disadvantage anymore in your life.  
Not even one, no more disadvantages in your life, no matter the situation, no matter the condition.  
Think about Jesus, what was he like?  
 When there was a storm and he was in the sea, what happened?  
He hushed the storm to sleep.  
He said, peace, be still.  
Think about it.  


  
He raised the dead.  
In fact, today I was reading another testimony.  
These are things that happened all the time.  
One of our pastors posted something who was carrying a little girl.  
 What happened to the little girl?  
The girl died.  
The doctors said, if I had dead, so she was dead.  
So what's next?  
Go bury your daughter.  
That's all.  
And the woman said, never.  
She said, never.  
She said, I'm not burying my daughter.  
No.  
Then she took the rhapsody of realities.  
 which had been given to her.  
And she opened to the page where the healing streams was advertised.  
She put it on her daughter.  
The girl shook and came back to life.  
Oh, this happens all the time.  
So many, so many such testimonies.  
How many can I tell you?  
That was just today that I saw that one.  
Think about it.  
 Because with God, the Bible says, and from the lips of Jesus, nothing is impossible.  
He says, anything is possible.  
He confirmed the words of the angel.  
The angel said, with God, nothing shall be impossible.  
Jesus said, if you believe, anything is possible.  
Anything.  
 anything.  
So, now that you're in Christ, now that you believe in Jesus Christ, there's no such thing as impossible to you.  
There's no such thing as a disadvantage to you.  
I'm not through reading, let's go back to that verse because I've got to show it to you.  
 In verse 28, Romans chapter 8, and we know that all things, they didn't notice the language.  
He says, we know, not we speculate, not we assume, not we think, we know.  
We know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.  
Do you realize that in Christ, you're called according to his purpose?  
 refused to be sick anymore.  
As a Christian, you used the name of Jesus.  
I already shared that with you day before yesterday.  
He says, use the name, whatever you do in word or deed.  
He says, do in the name of Jesus Christ.  
If symptoms come to your body, you say in the name of Jesus, I rebuke the pain.  
I rebuke the infirmity it will bow to your words.  
Let's keep reading.  
Verse 28.  
 Look at it.  
And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the call according to his purpose.  
For whom he did for no.  
I like this.  
For whom he did for no.  
Did God know you before you were born emphatically?  
Yes.  
If he is God, he should.  
 For whom he did for know, he also did predestinate to be confirmed to the image of his son.  
Oh, I read your scripture.  
Listen, you were predestinated in Christ Jesus to be confirmed to the image of his son.  
That means to become like Jesus.  
It's in the book.  
Go to 1st Epistle of St.  
John, chapter 4 and verse number 17.  
Look at it.  
 Hearing is a love made perfect, but we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world, in this world, not when we get to heaven.  
You know, when we talk about the day of judgment is coming, there are people who are scared because they live in sin, because they're not pleasing God.  
 But we, in Christ, we have boldness for the day of judgment.  
That's what he's saying.  
Hearing is a love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because, as he is, so are we in this world.  
We were confirmed to the image of his son.  
Go back to it, Romans 8.29.  
 For whom he did for know, he also did predestinate to be confirmed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  
Oh, that's so wonderful.  
He's saying, Jesus is your brother.  
Can you see that?  
So Jesus is the firstborn, and we are joint heirs together with him.  
Hallelujah.  
 Oh, this is remarkable, remarkable.  
Just an addition for you so you can, you can want to study later on for yourself.  
How did Jesus become God's firstborn?  
You see, when he died, he died because he had become sin for us.  
The Bible says our sins were laid on him.  
And so he was the representative of our sinness.  
 So He died and went to hell in our place.  
But when He fulfilled the righteous demands of justice, God raised Him from the dead.  
And when He was raised from the dead, God's prophetic words were, Thou at My Son, this day have I begotten thee.  
That was when Jesus was born again.  
 You see, he was born from death.  
That's what the Bible says.  
And that's why he says every one of us must be born again.  
Why?  
Because when you were born into this world, you were born in sin.  
The sin came from Adam back in the garden.  
Adam the first.  
That's where sin came from.  
And everybody that was born into this world from the fallen Adam was born in sin.  
So Jesus said, you must be born again.  
 And so when Jesus took our sins upon himself, he died in the Spirit.  
Spirit your death is suppression from God.  
That's why on the cross, he cried out, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  
The Bible says, because he was made sin in our behalf.  
So he went to hell.  
 But God raised him from the dead because he paid the full penalty for our sins.  
And when he was raised from the dead, the Bible says he was raised for our justification.  
That means we are now declared righteous because all your sins were paid for in Jesus Christ.  
That's extraordinary.  
But that's the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
That's what it means.  
He paid the full penalty for your sins.  
 For everything that was ever wrong with you, that could ever go wrong with you, he already paid.  
You don't need to pay anymore for your sins.  
He paid, and what he paid was enough.  
It was enough.  
It was adequate.  
And the Bible shows us how.  
I wish I had all the time to share so much more with you.  
But you know, this program is different.  
 And I'll say to you, when we have the love work programs, chill in, because they are teaching a lot of things from the Bible to help you learn the word of God.  
So you can know it for yourself.  
The beautiful thing today is that the Bible is accessible to anybody.  
So you can have it.  
And when I'm sharing it, you can look at it for yourself and find out if what I'm sharing with you is true or not.  
And the Holy Spirit will be there.  
 to open your mind and show it to you.  
What has happened to many Christians for many, many years is that most were never taught the Word of God.  
 They kept their Bible.  
They were waiting for the priest to explain to them.  
And they never went back to read and find out whether what they heard was actually so in the book.  
That's the reason I read the scripture to you and I display them so that you can see them for yourself and not the truth.  
Jesus said, and you shall not the truth and the truth shall make you free.  
That's important.  
We're not done yet.  
Go back to that verse 29.  
 For whom he did for now, he also did predestinate to be confirmed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.  
Look at verse 30.  
It's so beautiful.  
Look at it.  
Marva, whom he did predestinate, then he also cards.  
That's talking about us who believe in Jesus Christ.  
You read the whole context and whom he carded?  
Then he also justified.  
I just told you about justification.  
 We were justified when Jesus was raised from the dead.  
I can show that to you.  
You go to Romans chapter four.  
Let's begin reading from verse 24 so you can understand it.  
Romans chapter four from verse 24.  
But for us also whom it shall be imputed if we believe on Him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead.  
Who was delivered?  
That means delivered to death for our offenses.  
 Jesus was delivered to death because of our offenses and was raised again for our justification.  
You see, he was raised for our justification.  
Look at Romans chapter five verse one.  
Look at what he says.  
Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
Now that we are justified by faith, he says we are at peace with God.  
 We are in friendship with him now.  
God is no longer angry at us.  
He doesn't look at us as sinners.  
He looks at us through Jesus Christ.  
We are justified.  
Justified means declared righteous.  
Declared righteous.  
Oh, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  
So go back to Romans chapter 8 verse 30.  
 Look what he says.  
Moreover, whom he did predestinate them, he also called.  
And whom he called them, he also justified.  
So we are justified.  
Look at it.  
So we are predestinated.  
We are called.  
We are justified.  
Look at the next thing.  
And whom he justified them, he also glorified.  
Glorified.  
 You know, many, many, many Christians have believed that God called us.  
They have believed that they were justified, but not many read this place to know that not only were we justified, we were glorified.  
You are not trying to take glory from God.  
He gave you glory.  
He gave it to you.  
 And every day of your life, thank Him that you are back to glory.  
Remember, saying, brought men short of God's glory.  
Christ Jesus brought God's glory to you.  
Now you have it.  
So you are glorified in your life, in your health, in your job, in your finances, in your family, you're glorified.  
That's what He wants for you.  
And He's done it.  
 He's done it.  
Let your life give him praise all the time.  
Thanks all the time.  
No more stepping down.  
No, you stand straight and you thank God for your life.  
Every day when you wake up, you say, I thank God for my life.  
I am glorified.  
And the pains are living you right now.  
The dominion of sin and darkness and sickness is broken from your life.  
 The dominion of demons of our life has gone in the name of Jesus Christ.  
From today there's joined your home, there's joined your life in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
You are restored to God's glory.  
You are restored to God's glory.  
As He is so are we in this world, Hallelujah.  
 We trust that you have been blessed by this message.  
If you would like to invite Jesus Christ to be the Lord of your life, kindly say this prayer.  
O Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ, Son of the living God.  
I believe He died for me, and God raised Him from the dead.  
I believe He's alive today.  
 I confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day.  
Through Him and in His name, I have eternal life.  
I'm born again.  
Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul.  
I'm now a child of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 Congratulations!  
You are now a child of God.
