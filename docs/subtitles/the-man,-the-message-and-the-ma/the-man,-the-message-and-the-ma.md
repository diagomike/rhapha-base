title: The Man,  The Message and The Mandate Part 3
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 This poignant message is about the man Jesus, his passion and his compassion.  
Brothers and sisters, there's only one mediator between God and man.  
He's the man, Christ Jesus.  
Pastor Chris taught about the life of Jesus, his liquid love, the reality of forgiveness and the free gift of righteousness.  
It's about Jesus and his liquid love.  
 So that gives me confidence.  
Anyway, any day.  
I want God, Caesar.  
Now it will become clearer to you, the responsibility he has given to us all, the great commission he committed to us, which is to make all men see and come to the glorious light of the gospel.  
Live for Jesus, and be glad about it.  
 and be proud of your association with you.  
Don't hide your Bible.  
To be ashamed of Jesus.  


  
 As you listen to this teaching on the man, the message, the mandate, the love of the Father for all men will become palpable and you will be stimulated for greater exploits in the propagation of the gospel.  
The man, the message, and the mandate.  
Praise the Lord.  


  
 All glory to Jesus today.  
All glory to Jesus today.  
Jesus lives, hears, blesses and uses all glory to Jesus today.  
 Lord, glory to Jesus today.  
Lord, glory to Jesus today.  
Jesus says, here is lessons and uses of glory to Jesus today.  
Jesus says,  
 Jesus Christ Jesus Christ Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus  


  
 We thank you for your presence, sweetest.  
Thank you for the Holy Spirit who's here.  
Thank you for the power of your world.  
And now in our hearts and minds are open.  
To be taught by the Holy Ghost.  
To be inspired of you.  
 You may be seated.  
Glory to God.  


  
 On Thursday, Thursday night, we began discussing certain important things about the ministry.  
And I told you, who were looking through  
 three major areas, three important factors for us as leaders, ministers in the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
To understand things that we need to understand and have very clear in our spirits.  


  
To help us not only  
 half and walk in the mind of God, but to be successful in what is called us to do.  
When these things are clear to you, you will have no, you know, there are people who are unstable in their faith.  
A lot of times they are easily shaken in their faith.  
 But if these things are clear to you, you will be stable and unshakable, unmovable, like the Bible says, always abounding in the work of the Lord.  
Unshakable.  
A clear foundation for your faith.  
 from every day Christian life with confidence.  


  
You know, sometimes that people who believe in Jesus, but they have many questions in their hearts, many questions that trouble them, many questions.  
Some even don't know whether God  
 is really close to them.  
Does God really mean these things?  
They're wondering, are these things the paintable or are they not the paintable?  
Are we likely one day to discover this Bible who wasn't really meant for this?  
Is heaven real?  
 What if Jesus comes?  
Will I be taken with Him?  
They got questions.  
They don't know whether they will go to heaven or not.  
They're not sure.  
But once these three factors are clear to you, you'll be unshakeable.  
 So we started our discussion on the man, the man Jesus.  


  
It's important to know who Jesus is.  
Jesus, the Son of God.  
Hallelujah, the Son of God.  
 completely man and completely God.  
The most amazing personality that ever came to these shores.  


  
The greatest individual to ever walk the streets of these planets.  
 No one like Him.  
Hallelujah.  
Jesus Christ.  
Son of the living God.  
Something about Jesus.  
You know that?  
Let me read you a scripture, just to tell you who this Jesus is, okay?  
 We've talked about the man Jesus, but I want you to see him.  
He's beyond a man.  
I said, he is very God.  
Now, turn of Colossians chapter one and verse number 19.  
It pleased the Father that in him, he's talking about Jesus, that in him should all fullness dwell.  
 I'm not sure what I understand that yet.  
If pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell, just in case that is not clear.  
Turn to chapter 2 from verse 9.  
 for in him, dear God.  
This is all about Jesus.  
In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.  
That means the totality of deity as fully encapsulated in the body of the man of Galilee.  
Jesus is the embodiment  
 of deity.  
Jesus is the embodiment of the Godhead.  
In other words, when you saw Jesus, you saw God in bodily form.  


  
Amazing.  
Do you know what this begins to tell you?  


  
 the Bible says he is responsible for the breath of your life.  
So Jesus is not just a man that God has highly exalted and so we worship you even though he is until you see him beyond that.  


  
 He's more than one that God honored and exhorted.  
So like, you know, we all look at Jesus, one that's been exhorted by God and we love him and, oh, he's great king of glory.  
If you really understand even what that means, that expression.  
So, okay, there's Jesus.  
 born in Bethlehem, raised in Nazareth, in the body of a Jew.  
And we think like that.  
But Jesus is more than that.  
He says, in Him, dwelleth, all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,  
 it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell.  
Which means Jesus Christ is the completeness of God.  
Do you understand that?  
Jesus Christ is a completeness of God.  
So when you think about this man, Jesus, everything is in him.  
 and for him.  
Do you get it now?  
You're not dealing with an exalted man.  
You're dealing with God.  
Jesus is God.  
Now, that's what a lot of people don't understand.  
So how could he be?  
Didn't you just see it?  
If all of God is in him,  
 Don't you get it?  
He didn't say Jesus has the presence of God.  
He says, in Jesus dwells, lives, settles, in totality, all the fullness of the Godhead.  
 Did you get that expression?  
Meaning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are totally in the body of Jesus.  


  
You know what the Bible tells us in the book of Revelation?  
It says, on the throne of God,  
 On the throne of Almighty God, sits Jesus.  
Jesus Christ sits on the throne of Almighty God.  
He is the one on that throne.  
Jesus Christ.  


  
As the Bible says,  


  
 No wonder, when he shows up, he says fear not.  
He tells you there's nothing to be afraid of.  
He says fear not.  
Because he's the possessor of all things.  
So it's fear not.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm just owning you to understand who Jesus really is.  
 So we're not carrying around a religion.  
This is no religion.  
What we're preaching is no religion.  


  
Jesus is God in human flesh.  
 Did you get it?  
Jesus is God in human flesh.  
And now that Jesus has gone to heaven, the Bible says it has pleased the Father to dwell completely in Jesus such that the angels can only see God in Jesus.  
 Everyone who looks to God sees Jesus.  
That's wonderful.  
You just saw the Scriptures now.  
Right?  
They are written there for us.  
This is who Jesus is.  
 And so we talked about this man, Jesus, and we went on to discuss his message, the message that Jesus brought to the world, an extraordinary message.  
And in discussing the message, do you remember the things we talked about?  
What were they?  
Number one is message of what?  
 Liquid love, yes.  
What a description.  
What a description.  
Hallelujah.  
What a description.  
He said, greater love had no man in this, that a man should lead down his life for his friends.  
He said, there's no greater love than to give your life for another.  
And he gave his life for me.  
Praise God to let me know that I'm valuable to God.  
 Amen.  
Okay, liquid love, that's one.  
We'll talk about his life.  
Good.  
And then, forgiveness.  
Forgiveness.  
And what else?  
And righteousness.  
And we'll discuss the importance of forgiveness.  
How God would forgive you.  
 Jesus Christ expressing that forgiveness of God.  
It didn't matter who they were, they hated Him.  
The Bible says, they hated Him without cause.  
And yet, He loved them so.  


  
Forgiveness.  
Helping us to understand God's kind of forgiveness.  
 They don't have to deserve your forgiveness.  
They just forgive.  
They don't even have to ask for it.  
Isn't that amazing?  
He forgave them when they didn't ask for it.  
Can you forgive someone who didn't ask for it?  
Who didn't even care whether or not he offended you?  
Can you forgive that one?  
 That's the life that Jesus brought.  
Forgiveness, without demands, without strings attached, is His Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.  
It is the ignorance, forgive them.  
And then we'll discuss one more.  
What was that?  
Again,  
 righteousness, righteousness.  
And we looked at the three phases of righteousness.  
What were they?  
Very simple.  
Number one, He gave us the gift of righteousness.  
He gave us His righteousness as a gift.  
And when we embraced it, we became  
 righteous, legally righteous, inherently righteous, which means it became both legal and vital.  
It became our life.  
We would justify.  
Wonderful.  
 No wonder He calls us My Righteous Ones.  
That's wonderful.  
That's amazing.  
And then the third one was, we are now His righteousness, His proof of righteousness.  
His expression of righteousness.  
You want to know what the gods are good God.  
You look at me.  
 That's what he's saying.  
You want to know if God's a righteous God, you'll look at me.  
If God's a just God, you'll look at me.  
So he expresses his righteousness through me.  
That's amazing.  
What a calling.  
What a calling.  
So every day I walk as the expression of God's righteousness.  
What a calling.  
How great that is.  
What a calling.  
 So I can be impartial and just, like Jesus said, judge, righteous judgment.  
So when I judge, I judge with the eye of God's Word.  
I think His Word.  
I'm not looking at who's better than who, who did better than the other.  
I look at what does God say.  
That's wonderful.  
What does God say?  
What's on God's mind?  
What's on God's mind?  
 Humans would say, OK, you tell me first, and then you tell me the other.  
And then we think of, OK, who was right and who was wrong?  
But when we show up, we're not thinking who was right and who was wrong.  
What's in the mind of God?  
We provide the righteousness of God.  
We bring man into the righteousness of God.  
We get them to align with His will.  


  
 So Jesus brought to us the righteousness of God.  
Hallelujah.  
So now we express His righteousness.  
We live His righteousness.  
I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  
What a meditation.  
What a contemplation.  
I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  
Think about it.  
 Think about it.  
Imagine that you're meditating on that every day.  
Until you walk in that light, unconsciously.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 So that's what we were talking about when we were discussing his message, his message.  
So faith becomes real.  
See, when you understand that, faith becomes real.  
Prosperity becomes real.  
Abundance becomes, all of the beautiful things in Christ Jesus just suddenly become real.  
You don't have questions about that.  
You don't have trouble with that.  
 You don't have to wonder this faith message, this prosperity message, all those things will get you attention.  
Why?  
Because you're talking about the righteousness of God here.  
And that's the big thing.  
It's the expression of God.  
God stands up tall in you.  
If that's true,  
 How could you be defeated?  
How could you be poor?  
How could you be broke?  
How could you be sick?  
All of those things just melt away.  
It's not about the title of a message.  
It's not the topic, faith, giving and receiving.  
You see, giving and receiving become a natural expression of your life.  
 You see, because all of these things have been brought into the right perspective.  
No more arguments.  


  
Then the issues of, is this thing right?  
Is that wrong?  
Is this right?  
Is this wrong?  
No, your life just aligns with the nature of God.  
You see, the nature of God  
 Jesus said, you are the light of the world.  
You are the light of the world.  
He says, follow me.  
The one who follows me says, shall not walk in darkness.  
He shall have the light of life.  
And if you follow Jesus like that, you become one, the light of life.  
And in you, there will be no darkness.  
 So why would you live your life thinking, I don't know if I did this wrong.  
I don't know if I did that wrong.  
No, you set your focus on him.  
The Bible says, as we look at the glory of God in a mirror, we are metamorphosed.  
 We are changed.  
So you find you're growing, growing, getting better all the time.  
You're more and more like him.  
You're more and more like him.  
Better all the time.  
The more you look, the more you're changed.  
The more you look, the more you're changed.  
Transfigures to be and walk like him.  
 And you find your life is full of glory.  
You are full of joy.  
It's called joy unspeakable.  
That means joy indescribable.  
Joy beyond expression.  
You express it, but your body is not enough to express it.  
You don't have enough vocabulary to express it.  


  
 Oh God, you know sometimes when we worship God in reality.  


  
And we are absorbed into Him.  
At such times, the world just seems to melt away.  
Your eyes may be open, but you're not seeing them.  
And all you see is God.  
 And you're absorbed in his love.  
And can I tell you this, the most important thing in your life is to love Jesus.  


  
The man Jesus.  
Is to love him with all of your being.  
To become passionate  
 In fact, here is where you begin to understand the mandate.  
Here is where you begin to understand the mandate.  
Maybe we should take those scriptures and get this into it.  
I told you, it's all in that portion of the Bible.  
In 1st Timothy chapter 2, we started with verse 5.  
Can we start now?  
1st Timothy chapter 2 from verse number 5.  
 says, for there is one God and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
I love it.  
Verse six, who gave himself a ransom for all everybody, everyone is included there.  
So he gave himself, said again, he gave himself a ransom.  
 for me.  
Make it personal, a ransom for me.  
That's wonderful.  
So he says, talking about Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time.  
A message that should be preached at the proper time, in due time, in that time came.  
 when the Holy Spirit came to the church to enable, create the church and enable the church to do it.  
He gave Himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time, to be preached.  
So He could be a tester money of that ransom.  
 That's what he's saying.  
Now, look at the next verse.  
So that's his message.  
This is, we're on to, I am ordained.  
Look at that now, here's the mandate.  
We're on to, I am ordained, a preacher, a preacher, someone who announces to others, who heralds the message to others.  
We're on to, I am ordained, a preacher.  
 And an apostle, I speak the truth in Christ, and I lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.  
Come on.  
Now, that's Paul, you may say, but I'm glad he started with the word preacher.  
Okay?  
So, you may say, I don't know how to preach, but well, can you tell it?  
Then tell it.  
 Can you sing it?  
Then sing it.  
Where until I am ordained a singer?  
You say, well, I'm just a cell leader.  
Well, where until I'm ordained a cell leader?  
This is where unto that means it is unto the gospel, unto that message of his ransom that we read in verse 6.  
 It's about that message and the man behind the message.  


  
So here is my mandate.  
The mandate is the command, the authoritative command, to go and tell it.  
He authorized me to tell it.  
 He authorized me to tell it.  
He commanded me to preach it.  
Now, you know, years ago, I was driven by the command because he commanded me to do it.  
But the more I love Jesus and understood  
 His person and his message, the more I loved him, the more I was sunk into him.  
And I found out something beautiful.  
Let's read from St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 14, from verse 15.  
Let's begin at 15.  
 Look at it.  
If you love me, he says, keep my commandments.  
How simple.  
He didn't say, if you love me, sing it.  
Did he say that?  
If you love me, tell me.  
Is that what he said?  
If you love me, explain it.  
If you love me, hug me.  
Embrace me.  
If you love me, give me an offering.  
 That's not what he said.  
He said, if you love me, keep my commandments to what I tell you to do.  
So I found the love of Jesus became a driving force, a driving force.  
I can't keep his message to myself.  
I got to tell somebody else why I love Jesus.  
He told me to tell you.  
 of his liquid luck.  
He told me to tell the whole world of his saving message, of his gospel, to let them know he came to save them, to let them know he died in their place, that he was crucified.  
He died for them and was buried and God raised them up.  
 He said, tell them, because only if they know will they be saved.  
That's the message of salvation.  
There's no other way.  
And we read that the other day where he said, for there's none other name on the heaven given amongst men whereby he must be saved.  
How could you be quiet?  
 How could you love Jesus and be quiet about his gospel?  
Is it possible?  
No.  
If it can be quiet, you don't know him.  
You don't know him.  
You don't love him.  
You don't know him.  
And I say, to know him is to love him.  
And that's the truth.  
To know Jesus is to love Jesus.  
 Because the more you know Him, the more you are absorbed into His person, how could you ever say no?  
How could you?  
Is it possible?  
Is it possible to turn away from Jesus, not when you look at His eyes, not when you truly see Him?  
No, not when you encounter Jesus.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
How could a man turn away and walk away from God?  
How could you?  
Is it possible?  
How could you?  
If you love him, then you should be driven by your love for Jesus.  
 That love should compel you.  
That love.  
That love.  
This was what Paul found.  
Let me tell you a little bit about Paul.  
You know this man, Paul, he was called Saul of Tassus.  
And he was a Pharisee, one of those strictest religious sects.  
 And he thought that Christians, those who believe in Jesus, because he knew about Jesus, he knew about the man Jesus, and he thought Jesus was an ordinary man.  
He was just another Jew.  
They said that he was a deceiver.  
And so that was what Paul believed.  
And in his office,  
 He was authorized, given instructions of the government of his day to go and arrest every Christian that he could find and hold him in the prison.  
Well, that didn't mean anything to him.  
He was happy about the job and went from house to house, getting as many Christians as he could find and putting them in prison.  
 And he was enthusiastic about this, fanatical about it.  
He loved his job.  
He was going to serve the government and do it well, especially when he was of another religion.  
He was a Pharisee.  
 And then he was given letters to go beyond the borders now and journey to another city to Damascus and get the Christians in Damascus.  
And he went with some other officials.  
And the Bible tells us on his way to Damascus, a light shone on him.  
 brighter than the noon day's sun.  
Did you hear that?  
Did you ever see a light shining brighter than the noon day's sun?  
You looked into the sun and this light is brighter than that.  
The Bible says that's what poor saw.  
Immediately he looked at that light.  
He was blinded by the glory of the light.  
 And it fell down.  
And all those who were with him fell down.  
And the voice spoke from that light and said, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?  
And while he was on the ground, he said, who are thou Lord?  
It had to be a Lord because, you know, I mean, it knocked him down.  
Who are thou Lord?  
 And then he heard what he least expected.  
The voice said, I am Jesus.  
This is the one he said was an ordinary man.  
This is the one he said had been a deceiver in Israel.  
This is the one he said, the cypress told his body and light that he resurrected.  
Now, from heaven he speaks and says, I am Jesus.  
 whom thou persecuted.  


  
He says, but rise.  
I love that.  
He says, but, but get up.  
He says, I am Jesus whom you're persecuted, but get up.  
 Then he says, I have appeared to you for these purpose.  
I have appeared to you for these purpose to make you a minister.  
Hallelujah.  
And a witness of those things for which I will appear under you.  
 It is, I'm sending you to the Gentiles to turn them from darkness to lights and from the hands of Satan onto God that they may receive remission of sins.  
Oh God, if you were poor, what are you going to do?  
 Think about this.  
He says, those who john it with me, now stood speechless, hearing a voice, a voice they couldn't understand, and seeing no man.  
And when he left there and went into Damascus, you can tell he couldn't arrest nobody anymore.  
Now he's thinking he's alive.  
 He's alive.  
This man is alive.  
Why didn't they tell us more seriously?  
He's alive.  
Say, God, he gave me a chance.  
He's alive.  
Now you can keep Paul back.  
Everywhere he's telling people, he's alive.  
Jesus is alive.  
He's real.  
Yes.  
 And his love for Jesus was unquenchable.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Let me show you something.  
Galatians chapter 1, from verse 15.  


  
But when it pleased God,  
 who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by His grace, the one to reveal His Son in me.  
But I might preach Him among the heathen.  
Admittedly, I conferred not with flesh and blood.  
You see, the beautiful thing, when you believe in Jesus, He not only reveals Himself to you, He reveals Himself in you.  
 This was what Paul found.  
It pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by His grace to reveal His Son in me.  
It's a revelation of Christ in you to reveal His Son in me.  
You see, it's not enough to hear His voice.  
 He's got to have his revelation in you.  
Has he been revealed in you?  
Christ, has he been revealed in you?  


  
I said the greatest thing in all the world is your love for Jesus Christ.  
This is the most important thing in your life.  
Love in Jesus with a passion.  
 Love him with all your heart.  
Love him with a passion.  
And don't hide it.  
Love Jesus with a passion.  
Love Jesus boldly.  
Love Jesus completely.  


  
And consciously.  
Improve it by doing his word.  
 Prove it by doing what he told you to do, by doing his word.  
He says, if you love me, keep my commandments.  
If you love me, keep my commandments.  
He told you to preach the gospel.  
So go preach it.  
If you love him, do it.  
Do it with a passion.  
Do it with joy.  
Do it happily.  
There's nothing else in this word that's what living for.  
 How many friends do you have that don't know Jesus?  
And are you satisfied?  
Are you happy to know they don't know Jesus in your comfortable?  
Have they heard of Jesus from you?  
And remember this, without his salvation, there's no hope ever.  
 And then he would hold you responsible for not giving them the message because you had the opportunity to do so.  
He brought them in contact with you.  
Did you know that when people come in contact with you, that is their contact with heaven.  
Did you know that?  
That's their contact with heaven.  


  
 This is a reality.  
You are heaven's representative.  
That's who you are.  


  
That's who you are.  


  
 Now you can begin to understand why Christians shouldn't have any struggles and fighting among themselves.  
You see, because it takes being carnal to have a fight.  
It takes being carnal.  
 Because Christ has made you all you ever need to be.  
And all you will ever have, all you will ever require is inside you.  
It's in you.  
It's in you.  
It doesn't depend on somebody else.  
It's in you.  


  
 It's got nothing to do with another person.  
It's all in you.  
It's inside you.  
It's how to bring out what's in you that matters.  
How can I come out with what's inside me?  
You've got a glorious life locked up in you.  
All you need is to live from your inside.  
 is to become acquainted with the potentials of your spirit and live from your inside.  
It's difficult for a lot of people because they don't understand it.  
So they live kind of lives.  
They live from the outside.  
They are conditioned by the outside.  
They are moved by the things on the outside, their environment.  
So they're concerned about things that happen to them, by things that they see and experience.  
They are pained by what they go through.  
 But when you understand Christ, when you come in contact, glory to God, when you come in contact with the Holy Spirit and it opens your eyes and helps you understand the things of the Kingdom of God, things change.  
And then you say, Baba, I to the Word.  
You see things differently.  
I see life differently.  
I see things differently.  
Can you get it now?  
 Life takes on a new meaning.  
You're untouched from the outside because you live from the inside.  
And this is our responsibility to help people begin to understand that life.  
But you know, we can help anybody do that until we understand it ourselves.  
See,  
 The greatest things in life are inside you.  
They're inside you.  
Have you ever seen anybody who says, look, I'm very hot-tempered.  
There are some things I can't take.  
Have you ever met anybody like that?  
Oh, maybe you're even like that, you know.  
But I want to tell you something.  
So, why does he think so?  
Because that's the way he's been acting.  
Because that's the way his mind functions.  
That's the way he thinks.  
 They're even some who think like they are strict.  
They think I'm very strict.  
Maybe that's why some people can get along with me very well because I'm very straightforward.  
Isn't it wonderful how you respect yourself so much?  
I'm very straightforward.  
That's why a lot of people cannot, they're not comfortable with me because I tell it like it is.  
I'll tell you what your problem is.  
 You see, I've even spoiled it already by saying what your problem is.  
So he says, are you saying I got a problem?  
I don't have a problem.  
Is it a problem?  
It is a problem.  
It is a problem.  
It's a problem.  
Look at this.  
When that woman who was chased by the mob  
 was running for her life.  
Where did she go to Jesus?  
Think about it.  
Why didn't she run to the Pharisees?  
They were all around.  
Why didn't she go to the Sadducees?  
They were abundantly present.  
Why didn't she go to the scribes?  
Why to Jesus?  
He even seen us.  
 can go to Jesus' knowing.  
He will accept them.  
Think about it.  
She'll run to Jesus.  
Can someone who has done something wrong or wrong to you?  


  
Or you will maintain your... I'm very strict.  


  
 Can they come to you?  
She ran to Jesus.  
Do they run from you?  
They say He's coming.  
I bet.  
So straighten up.  
When you show up, they straighten up.  
You know the Bible says, the king drives away evil with his eyes.  
Are you that king?  


  
 Can someone who feels he's not good enough, who has made so many mistakes, come to you?  
I don't mean to get counsel.  
She didn't go to Jesus to get counsel.  
She ran to Jesus to be saved from the mob.  


  
 And what did she get from Jesus, I tell you?  
Jesus said, all of you, anyone who hasn't sinned, stats the stunning, stats.  
And who are waiting for one another, the man said the first person to stat should be the one who has never sinned.  
What about you?  
 And they are left.  
And Jesus says, neither do I condemn you.  
Somebody say, mm-hmm.  
That means that even Jesus was not going to shut up.  
That's not what he meant.  
Read it well.  
What he said was, woman had no man condemned thee.  
No one has condemned you.  
Because no one could condemn her.  
They are all gone.  
So Jesus says, no one has done so.  
 Then he says, neither do I condemn you.  
Because Jesus was on the other side.  
Then he said to her, go and sin no more.  
Can you notice?  
Jesus didn't say, go.  
You didn't sin.  
 No.  
He says, go and sin no more.  
And she went away free.  
Have a met Jesus.  
Did you know that's what Jesus sent us to do?  
I read to you yesterday, or the other day, Friday, a simple scripture.  
 that God, to wit that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their sins against them.  
That's what He sent us to do.  
He says, let's read it.  
St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 20, from verse 20.  


  
 And when he had so said, he showed on to them his hands and his side.  
Let's begin from 19.  
Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shot, whether the psych was were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the mist and said, on to them, peace be unto you.  
This is beautiful.  
Do you like this?  
It's wonderful.  
All right.  
 And when he had so said, he showed on to them his hands and his side, then whether the disciples got when they saw the Lord.  
Next verse, then said Jesus to them again, peace be unto you, as my father had sent me, even so sent are you.  
As my father had sent me, even so sent are you.  


  
 To do what?  
To reconcile man to God.  
We read it.  
There's one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.  
Now he sends me to reconcile man to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Verse 21 now, then said Jesus to them again, peace be unto you, as my Father has sent me, even so sent are you.  
Next verse.  
And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said unto them, receive you the Holy Ghost.  
 Wow.  
You know what the margin says there?  
He blew on them and said, receive you the Holy Ghost.  
Next verse.  
Read.  
Read it.  
You think?  
Again.  


  
 The same way he authorized me to go preach the message, he authorized me to do what?  
Remind their sins.  
So I say to them, in the name of Jesus, you are absorbed of your gifts.  
Oh, what an honor.  
 When we stretch our hands and say in the name of Jesus, you are forgiven of your sins.  
And when I say that, they are forgiven from heaven.  


  
Look at that power.  
How would you rather use yours?  
 You'd rather retain their sins.  
You have power to remit or retain.  


  
I have five things against you.  
Really.  


  
Better to choose the other one.  
 have their sins remitted in the name of Jesus as a priest of God.  
See, so you're a priest of God.  
You're a priest of God.  
A priest ordained in things pertaining to God.  


  
Hallelujah.  


  
 So that changes what you do with your hands, how you can be such an extraordinary blessing to others because you are a forgiver, a blesser.  
You know, when you put your hand on someone, it means a whole lot.  
It means a whole lot.  
The thing with a lot of Christians is they're not conscious of what they have.  
 And first, they're not even conscious of what they are, who they are.  


  
But you're somebody, somebody special.  
You just read some things.  
Very powerful.  
And the ability was given, he says, receive you the Holy Ghost.  
Receive you the Holy Ghost.  
So I'm special.  
 I'm special.  
So I know who I am.  
I'm special.  
Are you special?  
Yeah, shows you God thinks you're special.  
God thinks you're special.  
So act that way.  
Act like you're special.  
A man on a mandate.  
I got a message.  
I'm commissioned.  
I'm commissioned.  
 I'm authorized many years ago when I was going on crusades.  
I went from little towns, you know, to other little towns, from village to village.  
I preached in villages, small villages, in towns.  
I went.  
You see me in some cities now, but I did go to real remote places to preach the gospel.  
I did.  
And I remember without having these people, a lot of them, so poor.  
 So poor, so broken, you know?  
So dirty, delived in so much, they lived in squalor, they were so poor.  
And that whole place was stinking, smelling from clothes and bodies that had not been washed for days.  
You could tell, they're smelling and stinking, and some of them covered with sickness and disease.  
 And I'm preaching.  
And then imagine this, they embrace the gospel in their poverty.  
And I come in among them, haven't said to them, I'm authorized to tell you that you are forgiven of your sins, of your witchcraft, forgiven of your wickedness, and then they're looking at me.  
 And I say, I'm authorized by Jesus to tell you that your sins are not counted against you.  
And I come down, platform, and I can embrace these ones, even though they were stinking, covered with disease, smelling, some of them were lepros.  
Couldn't tell the difference.  


  
 Let me show you some of the second Corinthians chapter five.  
I want you to go to verse 14.  


  
Oh dear Lord, look at this, it's so powerful.  
For the love of Christ can't join it us.  
What he's talking about is not Christ loving me, he's talking about my love for Jesus, my love for Christ.  
 It's my love for Christ.  
He says, constrains me.  
I'm constrained.  
That means I'm compared.  
That's what he's talking about.  
The love of Christ compares us.  
Our love for Him compares us.  
He says, because we thus judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead.  
If Jesus died for everybody, so everyone died.  
 So we are entitled to a new life.  
We're all entitled to a new life.  
Because when he died, we all died.  
What a message.  
Imagine you beginning a conversation by telling somebody, did you know you already died?  
And is it all?  
 I used to say things like that.  
I'll say to someone, did you know you already paid for all your sins?  
And he thought, me?  
I said, yeah.  
You already paid for all your sins.  
I said, I'm not aware of that.  
I said, that's what I'm telling you.  
You already paid.  
Now, the one who here, I'm like, I've got some strange, mysterious information.  
I can tell you.  
 When Jesus paid for your sins, you paid.  
Because it did it for you.  
And then they start getting serious.  
They didn't know the man actually did it.  
They thought it was a Christmas story.  
You know, they didn't know the man really lived.  
I think it was a story for children.  
No!  
 He was born.  
He lived and died and resurrected and ascended and is coming back.  
The love of Christ comes, train it us, put it back up there.  
Because with us, judge, that if one died for all, then we're all dead.  
 Oh, you love this one.  
Let's move to the next verse.  
This is powerful.  
And that he died for all, that there which live should not hence what live unto themselves.  
You see, you can live for yourself anymore.  
 And that he died for all, that there which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again.  
See, what you have to do now is to live for Jesus.  
You can't live for yourself anymore.  
If you truly love Jesus, then you must live for him.  
Now he must live for you.  
You can live for yourself anymore.  
 You can live to please yourself anymore.  
Did you ever hear that fellow who says, I can please you and displease myself?  
When you know Jesus, such things don't come out of your mouth.  
You don't think like that.  
You don't live to please yourself.  


  
I'm sharing scriptures with you.  
These are my contemplations.  
 See, these are the thoughts of my spirit.  
These are my cogitations.  
You understand?  
Yes.  


  
And you read this and you think he died for me.  
So now I've got to live for him.  
I've got to live for him.  
 And he's the Lord, I'm going to be a success for you.  
I'm going to be a success for you.  
You see, you're not trying to succeed for your friends.  
You're not trying to succeed for yourself.  
You're not trying to succeed for your family.  
You're trying to succeed for Jesus.  
There's a big difference.  
Did you know some people are trying to be successful for their family?  
I'm doing this for my family.  
I'm doing this for my friends.  
I'm doing this for my nation.  
Well, I'm doing mine for Jesus.  


  
 Because it died for me.  
Now, I must live for Him.  
I must live for Him.  
Who do you want to live for?  
For yourself?  
Who do you want to live for?  
It's a question you will have to answer.  
Whether you're going to answer it today or however you're going to answer, you will have to answer that question.  
 somehow, someday with your life, you have to answer it.  
It's a question that if you don't answer it and act accordingly, God will have to ask you, who did you live for?  
 because he told you.  
He has a legal right to demand that you live for him because he died for you.  
He gave you his life.  
He purchased you to be clear.  
He purchased you with the price of his own blood.  
And then he doesn't demand it legally first.  
He extends the information to you in love.  
 He wants you to do it out of love.  
No, he has a legal right to your life.  
Can you see the difference?  
You belong to him, yet he calls you.  
Give me your heart.  
Hallelujah.  
So that's what you're going to do.  
Live for Jesus and be glad about it.  
Live for him.  
 and be proud of your association with Him.  
Don't hide your Bible.  
To be ashamed of Jesus.  
To be ashamed to identify with Jesus Christ.  
To be ashamed.  
Of course, there will always be those who try to make us, they want us to be ashamed of our identity with Jesus Christ.  
But ask yourself a question, who are they anyway?  


  
 Glory to God.  
So when you say you've given your heart to Christ, it's not a religious expression.  
I've given my life to Christ.  
When you say I've given my life to Christ, it means I am not my own anymore.  
I have no ambitions of my own.  
 My goodness, have you come to that point?  
Have you come to that place?  
Where your ambitions are lost in his dream for you?  
You know, in life, we say to ourselves, I want to be a driver.  
I want to be a politician.  
I want to be a carpenter.  
I want to be a fisherman.  
I want to be maybe  
 government, administrator, also executive.  
I want to run a company, an entrepreneur.  
I want to be a banker.  
I want to, whatever you want to be, a sportsman, whatever it is you want to be.  
Have you thought about what did he make you for?  


  
 Did you know many have lived their whole life?  
Never fulfilling God's plan for their lives.  
Never, in fact, some never even entered.  
All that lived was someone's dream.  


  
You know, that's a part sometimes that some people think is difficult.  
 Because they think that asking God such questions might take a whole long time to ever hear Him.  
I'll have a secret for you to explain to you about God and hearing God.  
Nothing that you ask God, that He doesn't give you the answer before you ask.  
Believe me, that's what the word says.  
 Nothing that you ask him, that he does not give you the answer before you ask.  
You say, why did I fast for seven days' day?  
And he didn't answer me.  
There's some things you have to learn.  
To learn before he speaks, no.  
To know about hearing him, taking his word.  
 and acting upon it.  
If you ask him a question, at the time of your question, the answer is present because it was sent before you asked.  
Now, if you don't understand that, you know, it will not work.  
See, God's word is so important that you understand  
 the motor's operandi of the kingdom.  
The Bible says the children of Israel knew the acts of God, but Moses knew the ways of God, the ways of God.  
So when you pray, don't act or pray like someone who's trying to get something out from God.  
 Ask with appreciation like someone whose question only let him know the answers that God has given.  
Did you hear it?  


  
Okay.  
Now, if you didn't catch that, don't worry.  
In another meeting.  
But if you got it, great.  
 Hallelujah.  
And if you're thinking through it, don't be bothered.  
Don't try to get confused.  
Just take it like, I don't know it.  
I don't know it.  
Take my attitude.  
I had an attitude about the Holy Spirit many years ago as a kid in that old church where we used to be as children.  
And sometimes I heard some kids like myself speaking in tongues.  
 And I heard a dog spruing tongues.  
But I had this attitude that this thing is from God.  
I would have it.  
I just knew I would have it.  
There was no stress.  
I wasn't trying to seek it.  
I knew I would have it.  
The day came when I came out among some others to be prayed for to receive the Holy Spirit.  
So I stood there with the  
 And the parade, some of them that are speaking in tongues, speaking in tongues, speaking in tongues, I didn't know how to do it.  
Should I speak?  
Should I open my mouth?  
What should I do?  
And they were encouraging us, speak, just say whatever is coming.  
And nothing was coming.  
If anything was coming, I didn't know it.  
So I kept thanking God.  
They said, don't speak English, just speak in tongues.  
But nothing came.  
So after the prayer,  
 We all left.  
Well, a few days later, I was praying on my own.  
And as I opened my mouth, I said things that I didn't understand.  
I wasn't talking loud, just under my voice.  
I said things I didn't understand, so I stopped.  
I thought my sleeping is something wrong.  
So I rearranged myself.  
 and got down on my knees again to pray.  
The moment I opened my mouth to speak, you know, this formation came out of my mouth.  
Then as I tried to stop myself, I remembered.  
Tongues, I remembered.  
Hallelujah, I remembered.  
And then I just let myself go.  
And I've been at it ever since.  
 Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
You know, even as I share with you, the fire of God's Spirit is working in us, staring a passion and a love for the Master.  
Hallelujah.  
Yes.  
And that love, that passion will transport you.  
 It'll take you from one level of glory to another.  
You know, I love it when, you know, in Jeremiah's prayer, it says, let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
It says, let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
And that's so touching because it didn't have to come to their minds.  
They could think of everything else, but it says, let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
Oh.  
 Then he says, pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  
Now, that's the soundness now.  
He says, they shall prosper that love thing.  
But your mind says, let Jerusalem come to your mind.  
So that you will pray in the same way.  
I'll say, let Jesus come to your mind.  
Have that consciousness of the master.  
Let him come to your mind.  
That you can think about him.  
 Are you hearing me?  
Have that consciousness that you walk with Him.  
It's got to live in with the King.  
Live in with the King.  
Of course, you know, your life will be a mystery.  
 You would think if you were walking like this and all those things were real in your life on a daily basis, everybody's just going to be nice to you.  
And everybody's, no, it doesn't work that way.  
Jesus attracted persecution.  
Jesus attracted even hatred.  
Anger from others.  


  
 Not because of you, but because of that thing in you.  
Can we see it?  
So, don't say when it starts happening, I didn't expect this.  
 Well, Jesus says, if they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also.  
If they hated me, they will hate you, what are you?  
It is all this they will do because they didn't know me or the Father.  
Glory to God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Glory, glory, glory, glory.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory.  
Hallelujah.  
 Lift your hands toward heaven, worship Him and thank Him.  
He's glorious.  


  
He's glorious.  


  
 you
