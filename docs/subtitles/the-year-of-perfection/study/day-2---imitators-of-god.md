title: Day 2 - Imitators of God
---
 There's a nature that is given to us.  
I want you to understand this.  
Let's begin with you, how you were born.  
Oh yeah, you were born of a mother and a father, right?  
At a certain time in your life, you were very little and all you could do was just lie down.  
You couldn't even turn yourself.  
Somebody had to turn you.  
 After a while, you began to sit.  
All right?  
Some time in your life, you began to creep.  
All this time, you couldn't get up like your parents.  
You could walk around like them, but you were a perfect human being as your mother and father.  
You couldn't live like them, but you were perfect of human being as much as they were.  
Am I right?  
 Imagine that you looked at that child and you said, oh, this child is creeping.  
It is not perfect.  
No.  
First is the nature.  
The Bible says, whatsoever God do it.  
Oh, boy, I need to show you this.  
Ecclesiastes chapter 3.  
Good verse 14.  


  
Can you see it?  
 I know that whatsoever God do it, it shall be forever."  
You know what that means?  
It says, whatever God does, continues endlessly.  
That means God does eternal things, everlasting things.  
When God does something, it's unfailing.  
It says, nothing can be put to it.  
Nothing can be taken out of it.  
You can't destroy it.  
You can damage it.  
 Something has to happen to its nature.  
For it to fail.  
Whatever God does, his eyes, it's forever.  
It continues endlessly.  
For example, here God made you, all right?  
You could have made yourself.  
Inside you, you got a heart, you got lungs, you got kidneys.  
How long should a function?  
 How long?  
How long?  
What's the durability?  
How durable are the systems of your body?  


  
Is the human life long-lasting?  
How long can we expect a function perfectly?  
Let's begin with the nature.  
 Because unless you understand God's purpose, God's plan, God's dream, God's work, you can't walk in the light of it.  
Jesus said, and you shall know the truth.  
And the truth shall make you free.  
I'll give you an example.  
Two nice examples.  
All right, you heard me talk about this.  
I'm a blind man.  
And he was totally blind.  
 So I preached the gospel and prayed for the sick.  
I prayed en masse.  
And so after I prayed, I said, how many of you have been healed?  
I didn't get any hands.  
Now we'll conclude in the meeting and I'm sitting somewhere at the back  
 why they're making the announcements and closing up.  
And I said, Lord, what happened?  
And the Spirit of God wished but within my spirit.  
And he says, but they were healed.  
He said, the blind man you prayed for was healed.  
I said, he was healed.  
So I walked straight to him.  
I said, sir, can you see me?  
He said, no.  
 His son was with him.  
It was his son who held him by the hand to bring him in.  
I said, but the spirit of God just told me he healed you when I prayed.  
He said, but I can't see anything.  
I said, but God doesn't lie.  
If he healed you, then he healed you.  
He said, but I can't see anything.  
So I took him by the hand.  
I said, follow me.  
And he and his son followed me.  
I brought him to the middle of the crowd.  
 And they are looking at me.  
I said, this man came here to leave blind.  
I said, but God just told me he's healed him.  
And yet he says he can't see.  
And the man interrupted.  
He said, but I can't see.  
 I said, but God has healed you.  
So we both were arguing in front of the crowd.  
And they were laughing and laughing.  
Now, were they laughing at me or laughing at him?  
I'm not quite sure, but they were laughing in a way.  
They thought it was funny.  
I'm arguing with a man that's totally blind and telling him God healed him.  
Then I said, stop.  
Stop saying.  
You can't see.  
Stop it.  
So I said, follow me.  
He followed me two, three steps.  
I said, look.  
 Then he said, well, I can't see anything.  
I said, don't say it again.  
I said, don't say it again.  
So I said again, look!  
He didn't know what to say, because he couldn't see.  
I said, God has healed you.  
Look!  
Then he did like this.  
 He could see.  
He said, I can see.  
I can see.  
His son was startled.  
He had been blind for a long, long time.  
So his son was startled.  
 He looked around.  
He saw everybody.  
He became the rejoice.  
He was jumping.  
He could demonstrate everything anybody did.  
He was just so excited.  
He could see.  
See, I could have let him go home, still blind.  
He never would have known that God had healed him.  
Jesus said, you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  
Truth and fact are two different things.  
Truth is reality.  
Praise God.  
 Not many are living the shoots.  
They are living with facts of life, but facts are less than shoots.  
I need you for the second example.  
 The beautiful moment for me was when they were leaving the man and his son, and I was watching them several meters away, and I didn't know what they were saying to each other, but I noticed the man did like this for the son to walk in front of him, and he followed.  
A year later, I sent people there for a follow-up.  
The man had been going from house to house preaching about Jesus Christ who opened his blind eyes.  
 I'll tell you this other story.  
A couple came from their country for healing several years ago.  
And she was in the line while I was praying.  
And when I got to her, she had a card stated that she had a heart condition and she wanted to be healed of a heart condition.  
So I prayed for her.  
 The next day, they should be leaving for their country.  
So I went to say hello and bye-bye.  
When I got to them, she didn't look very excited as I expected.  
So I said to the husband, your wife isn't looking excited today.  
Is there a problem?  
 Oh, she said, well, that's no problem.  
I thought, if she got healed last night, she ought to be happy, you know?  
She had a heart condition and she came with the x-rays.  
So the husband explained, he said, she's been blind in her left eye for 60 years.  
She's 61 when she was one year old.  
 She became blind in her left eye.  
Oh, I said, I understand the problem.  
I said, woman, you didn't tell us about the blind eye.  
You only talked about your heart condition.  
You must have said to God, if you will heal my eye, then I will believe my heart has been healed.  
She said, yes.  
I said, well, when I prayed for you, God healed your heart and healed your eye.  
 She said, but I can't see from it.  
I said, I know.  
That's why you're not happy.  
I said, but I can prove it to you.  
I said, when I laid hands on you, the power of God was transmitted into your body because that's what the Word of God says.  
So that healing power is still inside your body since the last night when I prayed for you.  
 I said, you can activate it here, or you can activate it on a plane.  
Or when you get to your country, you can activate it anytime you like.  
What would you like to do?  
She said to me, I'd like to activate it here.  
I said here now, she said, yes.  
I said, great.  
I said, well, close the right eye.  
And she did.  
Her husband standing beside her.  
 I said, so you can see from the blind eye now.  
She looked and she said, no, she's trying to act like that man.  
She said, no, I said, no, no, no, no, no, don't say anything.  
Just see, that's all you do because I prayed for you last night.  
The power already is in you working.  
So see now.  
So I'm waiting.  
 And she doesn't know what to do, because it's the eye.  
You know, if it's your leg, you probably would make an effort.  
If it's your hand, you would make an effort.  
With the eye, what do you do?  
It's blind already.  
Well, while we're there, and I'm saying to her, see to the eye now.  
And I'm not praying because I prayed last night.  
Suddenly, she said,  
 I think I can see.  
I can see.  
So she covered this one.  
She said, honey, I can see.  
I can see.  
The husband almost went crazy.  
Then he said, can you see me?  
She said, I can see you.  
And both of them were jumping like kids in the room.  
She began to see from the blind eye.  
Now here's another good part of it.  
When they went back to their country,  
 She was doing her normal shots and collapsed as she normally will do when that trouble hit her from her heart.  
They rushed out to the hospital.  
While she was in the hospital bed, the doctors did all the checks and came back to her and they said to her, where have you been?  
She said, what do you mean?  
They said, someone  
 has performed an operation on you.  
Where did you go to?  
She said, Doctor, what do you mean?  
They said, you have a heart of a young girl.  
She's 61.  
She had a brand new heart in her body.  
Come on, shout, hallelujah.  
 Thank you.  
I said that to say this.  
Jesus said, you shall know the truth.  
And the truth shall make you free.  
The truth.  
The truth of God's perfection in your spirit is a hidden reality.  
And the moment you bring it forth, you begin to walk in the light of it like you never thought possible.  
Say, I'm a perfect being of a perfect God.  
 One more time.  
I'm a perfect being of a perfect God.
