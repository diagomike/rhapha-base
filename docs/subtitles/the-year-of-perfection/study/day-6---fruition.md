title: Day 6 - Fruition
---
 The fourth one is from the Greek, Telesphorio.  
Telesphorio is a compound word.  
Now, and it shows in only one verse of the Bible is therely.  
Quite interesting.  
Let's read it so you understand it.  
It's a Luke's gospel.  
 Chapter 8 verse 14.  


  
And that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard, go for it.  
 Read it out.  
I choked it what?  
Cares, uh-huh.  
Regis and pleasures of this life.  
And what?  
Bring no fruit to what?  
To perfection.  
The word translated perfection there.  
Is that for you?  
It means to bring to fruition.  
 to come to a ripened state, to come to a mature state where it triggers a result.  
So in 2020, you're going to come to that place.  
Your project will come to that state where it produces results.  
 The knowledge of God's word in you will come to that state where it produces results.  
You will produce results to perfection in the name of Jesus.  
Yes.  
It is specially used.  
That is very especially used when a woman carries pregnancy.  
 They said, she's bearing a child.  
So she carries the pregnancy to full term.  
And now she gives birth.  
Let's tell this for you.  
So in the name of Jesus Christ, no aborting of your ideas, no aborting of children,  
 Hallelujah.  
You will produce results of perfection in the name of Jesus.  
No miscarriage.  
I said, no miscarriage.  
So what God gives you, you will carry the fruition in the name of Jesus.  
Lift your hands and thank you.
