 Don't train yourself to do things in the wrong direction.  
Train yourself.  
You understand?  
Train yourself to do what is right.  
Train yourself to do what you were taught to do.  
Train yourself to do it.  
Make an effort to overpower the desire to not go in the right direction.  
Sometimes there's a wrong desire  
 Taking us in the wrong direction, refuse to let it lead you.  
Let the spirit of God lead you in the direction that you have been taught.  
Walk in the way you've been taught.  
In the first three months of practicing, what you have been taught in the wisdom of God and in the instruction of God.  
First three months.
