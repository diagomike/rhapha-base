 Now, four things that are necessary this year.  
I'll give them to you and then we'll exposhe it on them another time.  
Just listen and get them, get them, get them.  
Oh, glory to God.  
You know, there are different kinds.  
You know, the Bible uses different terms for the word perfection.  
 Number one, there's gonna be an alignment.  
This alignment is about preparation.  
Catathesis is a preparation.  
It's a re-engineering of how you operate.  
It's a training, a training.  
 Because God's going to prepare you through His Word.  
There'll be an alignment of your will to God's will.  
Can you say amen?  
Of your purposes, with His purposes.  
Can you say amen?  
Yes.  
God's Word can bring you into the place of His dream for you.  
 So get ready for that.  
Tell somebody to get ready for that.
