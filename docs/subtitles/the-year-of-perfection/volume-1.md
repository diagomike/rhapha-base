 2020 is the year of perfection.  
Welcome to 2020.  
It's a great year.  
 The December 31st New Year's Eve service with the Man of God, Pastor Chris O'Yacolome is one of the most televised events in the world, reaching millions with a prophetic word of blessing each year.  
The addition that led into the first day of January 2020 was quite remarkable, with a reach of half the world's population.  
Over 3.5 billion people had access via satellite.  
 terrestrial and internet networks to God's thoughts of good as communicated by Pastor Chris.  
From the Love World Convocation Arena in Lagos, Nigeria, several auditoria, stadia, viewing centers and homes around the world were connected to an uncommon atmosphere of the miraculous and blessings.  
 Many from around the world shared their expectations in much anticipation.  
Hi, my name is Genese Abdul Hussein of Christ Embassy Philippines, Cavite Port Harcourt Zone 3.  
My name is Sister Laura and I am here in Ottawa, Canada and I am so happy, so excited to be celebrating New Year's Eve with Pastor Chris Live.  
I am expected, I am anxious, I am waiting to hear the rebel word for the year so that I can take it into 2020 and just  
 I'm ready, ready, ready.  
We're praying and fasting, reading the word, meditating on the word, getting in our closet, praying and preparing our hearts and our minds.  
But that word is going to come forth.  
There's going to try and catapult us into the year 2020.  
And I'm expected, excitedly expected of that word of prophecy.  
 If the prophecy for last is for 2019, it got us to achieve all that we achieved.  
I know that this year's prophecy, 2020 prophecy, is going to take us even higher.  
We are so expectant.  
We are waiting for the release, for the release of the word from our men of God, Master Chris.  
 And I'm expecting today to receive the word from our man of God because it will launch me to a victorious ear, to a glorious ear for the glory of God in my life.  
We are very, very ready to receive the word from God and as well we are very expectant because we know this night will be a special night.  
We have large expectations.  
 The more it said, that is the sooner the righteous does not go so.  
This year we are prepared for the biggest program ever here for the greater house.  
I'm looking forward to the message we're going to receive from pastor tonight.  
As I know it's going to launch us into a better 2020.  
I'm very expired and looking forward to it.  
 We are so looking forward to the Roma world and the prophetic message that our men of God has for the world and I'm sure that it will get up all and transform my life and my family into a whole new level.  
 We are ready, the PG is ready, and the world is ready.  
And I know that the world will be released, the world of prophecy for the coming year, and put it to work in a greater measure.  
I'm looking forward to the world of God on a Saturday first night, because for me the first night is a launch part to the next decade, and so I'm anticipating the best.  
 expected to receive this word that will promote me in my life, that will bring me to the new levels of glory.  
Hallelujah.  
I am very expected my spirit is tied up and full of joy ready to take that one and slowly beat  
 I look forward to the 31st service to Ashas in 2020.  
I am expecting, because my man of God, my prophet, is coming with the word for me for the now, the word that will take me to the next level.  
 This December 31st with our New Year's Eve service, I am expected to have an amazing message from Pastor Chris for him to guide us into the new year and to teach us in ways that we've never been taught before.  
We are provoked and we are ready to receive the message for the new year.  
Thank you, Pastor Chris!  
 And the service commenced with the compares welcoming the global congregations of the sublime service.  
Your excellencies, brothers and sisters, welcome to the live broadcast of the December 31st Global New Year's Eve Service with Pastor Chris.  
Wow, wow, wow.  
You know, this is the night of night.  
 January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December!  
And now it's December 31, 2019!  
The Love World Anthem was taken as hands interlocked in solemn commitment to a united body for the advancement of the gospel.  


  
 You're my sister You're my brother  


  
 There were beautiful renditions of songs of worship and praise, which ushered attendees into an atmosphere of thanksgiving to the Lord for His grace and kindness in the unforgettable luminous 2019.  


  
 I've done my God, Jesus, I will need my glory.  
Oh, my worship, oh, my praise, belong to you, my God.  
 And all my words say, all my praise, belong to you, my God.  
Holy, holy God.  
It's the perfect place to prophesy of your 2020 right now.  


  
 Oh God, your word was dependable You weren't reliable  


  
 Your word has integrity, God.  
You will never fail now.  
Your word remains the same.  


  
 Other forms of divinely orchestrated presentations in spoken word, dance, and more created a unique ambience that stirred anticipation for the word of the spirit.  
But to seize the day, you have to take it from your spirit, and how can you seize what you cannot see?  
You have to train your mind not to rely on these eyes, because God has given you sight. 2019.  
 A year that we shined in a way that Satan had never seen before.  
Making 2018 look like Charles Flair as we've done so much more as we were ushered into a dispensation of the church at this world I've never seen.  
With angels on the earth that I never before, being 2019 was indeed a year of lights.  
But here we are, setting our sail for 2020 a year far greater than anything we've ever seen.  
The spirit's taken me high.  


  
 Wave your hands from the new level!  
Wherever you are!  


  
So!  


  
 We are winning on the way.  
It's a victory song.  
In the name of Allah.  


  
 A lot is dancing, celebrate.  
Ooh, yeah.  
Then I'll celebrate.  
Go away.  
I have to fly.

 How many of you believe for increase 2020?  


  
 But motion is already done How many of you believe for promotion?  


  
 The event also included the 7th Future Africa Leaders Awards, Fala Ceremony, a special initiative of the Chris Oyakalome Foundation International and the Future Africa Leaders Foundation.  
Our young people have done tremendously well.  
From around the world so much is heard about Africa, that's not positive.  
Not a bad news all the time.  
To the point that many get discouraged and wonder,  
 If there's hope for Africa, there's hope for Africa.  
When I look at what the young people are doing, I know there's hope for Africa.  
And we're really excited about this.  
In the last few months, we've followed their activities closely.  
And our purpose is to encourage the young ones  
 Let them know there's hope in doing right.  
We try to encourage our young people to always be on the right and ensure that what they learn, maybe in their schools, maybe at home, even from their peers, what they learn that's good can be put to work.  
 for building a better nation, a better continent, and a better world.  
Present at the occasion to announce the Star Prize winners was the former president of Liberia and Africa's first democratically elected female president, Madam President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who delivered an emotional and inspiring speech.  
As we stand, we can look at what's someone  
 my past of Christmas, John.  


  
How does one person, one man of God, be able to change so many lives?  


  
It can only be because of the spirit  
 of caring and sharing.  
The spirit that is embodied in someone who feels that life is not complete until that life is changing the lives of others.  
Pastor Chris, I want to praise God for you.  


  
 I want to praise you for all that you've done as I looked at all of the acclamations that you've received from all over the world that can only come from a true belief in someone who deserves so much.  


  
We've come a long way.  
 But Africa, indeed, has made progress.  
Today, despite all of the changes that we now see as we go into the new world, into the new year, not knowing what we will face, we know that today we can say that Africa has taken a charge  
 of his own destiny.  


  
And why others may say that we need to move at a faster pace.  
Yes, we do need to move at a faster pace.  
But I say to the young people, that's why you are now the future of Africa.  


  
 It's you that we now look to.  
To take the responsibility.  
Ten young African leaders that distinguished themselves with exceptional and commendable work in realizing the dream of a glorious Africa will recognize that night.  


  
 And the winner is... Fabian Helena Awini from Cameroon.  
Young Fabian Helen Awini distinguished herself as the star prize winner, bringing tears to many eyes with her resilience and courage in the face of staggering danger while carrying out humanitarian service in her nation, Cameroon.  


  
 As the curtain is drew on the year 2019, Pastor Chris invited Pastor Saki for a special rendition.  


  
 Those who turn they need to righteousness They are wise, oh yeah And they shine, oh yeah Like the stars, like the stars I'm the city on the hill I cannot be hidden No, no, no And I let my light  
 It's so shiny I am the light I light up the whole world Illuminating and innovating I am for signs and for seasons I'm imparting you Yes, I'm the light of the world  


  
 Darkness shall cover fear and upon the people.  
Oh, yeah.  
But his glory, oh, man, it's sing on me, on me.  
Kings come to my light and to my writer.  
Oh, yeah, yeah.  
 I'm on fire, on fire, until it comes Hey, I am the light  


  
 Light up the whole world, illuminating and innovating.  
I am for signs and for seasons.  
I'm empowered to lead.  
Yes, I'm the light of the world.  
Oh, thank you.  
Woo!  
All right.  
Guess what has come to me?  


  
 Yes, I am ruling.  
Oh, that's what has come to us.  
And we are shining.  
Yes, that is what's in our hearts.  
And we are burning.  


  
 I wish I were the whole world to see.  
Oh, world to see.  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  
 We're lights up the whole world.  
And you've been dating.  
And in no way do we offer signs and for seasons.  
We are empowered to live.  
We are the lights of the world.  
Come on, everybody, join us in.  
We are lights up the world.  
Come on, everybody, join us in.  
We are lights up the world.  
 We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides We are both sides  


  
 Whoa!  
Happy New Year!  
Happy New Year everybody!  
Welcome to 2020!  
It's a great  


  
 Congratulations!  
Welcome to 2020!  
A new decay has just begun!  


  
 The time that everyone had been eagerly anticipating came and Pastor Chris ministered the word with great power, grace, and an effusive expression of God's love.  
You expecting something?  
What are you waiting for?  


  
Sit down for a second.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
You know, you only really begin to live when your life counts for other people.  
You never have fulfillment until you're living for others.  
 and you live beyond yourself.  
And tonight, as I was listening to Pastor Titio, he was calling the falloweeners.  
And the various things they did in their countries and beyond  
 I was thinking of that song I used to sing.  
I still sing it today, of course.  
But I remember walking down that dusty road from my canvas every day as I walked to the hostel.  
And I'm thinking, when I see  
 A life that's broken Give me words that should be spoken For I will remember the pains When I see dear drops falling Lord remind me of my calling  
 Help me restore their faith again I'm walking on the road I want to spend my life Lending broken people I want to spend my life  
 Removing pains Lord, let my words heal the heart that hurts I want to spend my whole life Lending broken people  
 I don't know what those who were watching thought about it.  
Had my bag on my shoulder, walking, singing that song every day.  
I want to spend my life Mending broken people  
 I want to spend my life Removing pains Get out free Lord, let my words Heal the heart that hurts  
 I wonder, Spain, my life.  
Mending broken people.  
Wonder what I was singing that song.  
I met an old woman.  
She was tired, weary.  
Just sitting on the ground by the roadside.  
 She had a little pack of things beside her.  
Keep playing.  
And I went to her.  
I said, woman, why are you sitting here?  
She looked up at me and she said, I'm coming from a far place to not anymore strength.  
I'm tired.  
 So I thought, how long are you going to be here?  
She said, when I have strength, then I put my hand on her shoulder as a woman in the name of Jesus, receive strength for your body.  
She smiled and looked up at me like some new strength sawed into her being.  
 While I'm still looking at her, she packed her things.  
She said, I think I can continue now.  
I can go on now.  
And I left there thinking, Lord, let my words heal the heart that hurts.  
 I'm gonna spend my life Mending broken people I wanna live my whole life Mending broken people  
 And that's when you really live when your life counts and saving lives.  
Praise God.  
Tonight, you're waiting for the message of the year.  
What is 2020?  
 It's very simple.  
I actually told some of you the other day, it's so simple, you could touch it.  
And I sent out a post today.  
By the way, those of you in Abuja, we saw Abuja a moment ago, we saw Benin, Benin City.  
We saw Potharka, we saw you with your lights.  
Thank you, thank you, God bless you.  
Give them a big hand.  
 So a large crowd in each of those places.  
Did we see a crowd today?  
I'm not sure if we've seen them.  
But you're free to just go over to any of them, any of the groups that want us to see what they're doing.  
So this 2020 is a very special year, not because it's 2.0 to 0.  
 That's not the reason.  
Oh, there they are.  
That's Abuja.  
Reverend Tom, how you doing?  
Praise God.  
So I said, it's not because it's 2020, 2020, it's not even because we're starting a new decade.  
 Now, it's because of God's plan.  
God's plan, you know, God lives in eternity.  
We live here in time, and time is just a segment of eternity.  
But God sees everything and knows everything.  
And through His Spirit, He reveals to us His plans.  
 The Bible says the Lord God will do nothing, but he reveals his secrets to his servants, the prophets.  
So he reveals his plans.  
He never leaves us in darkness, like many people think.  
He's not forgotten the word.  
No, but always he calls out to us to listen to him.  
 The Bible says, if we'll listen to Him and heed His voice, we'll live our days in prosperity.  
That's what it says.  
 So I sent out a post today, how many of you got it?  
Some of you did.  
And I was asking, what do you suppose?  
Can you guess?  
Can you fill in the blanks?  
What is the message for 2020?  
I got some responses.  
Many said it's the year of got all kinds of things.  
 They were so many.  
So many.  
Now you're saying, Pashikr, say it.  
Say it.  
I've been waiting all day.  
Say it.  
I even fasted.  
Did you fast for it?  
I know.  
You fasted.  
You're waiting for it.  
Don't worry.  
When you hear it, you love it.  
Oh, blessed be the Lord.  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
All right.  
Let's read from the Bible Genesis chapter six.  


  
If I read these two verses and you still don't know,  


  
 From verse nine, Genesis chapter six, these are the generations of Noah.  
Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.  


  
I don't know why you're laughing.  


  
 Okay, I'll read another one.  
Genesis chapter 17.  


  
From verse one.  
And when Abraham was 90 years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him, I am the Almighty God.  
Walk before me.  
And without perfect.  
 Okay, now from your shouting, I'm thinking you.  


  
What is it?  
How could you miss that?  
Well, 2020 is the year of perfection.  


  
 Glory to God.  


  
Lift your hand and take him for his word.  
Hallelujah.  
All right.  
 So can I... Can I say a few things to you now?  


  
You know, perfection is a word that terrifies a lot of people.  
It terrifies many.  
Almost all your life.  
 You were told, no one is perfect.  
Nobody is perfect.  
No one could be perfect.  
We are not perfect.  
And you hear it.  
They think it's a sign or symbol of humility.  
 They tell us and train us to accept our imperfections.  
You raised all your life to accept it, to believe in it.  
When I was growing up, I tried to find out if it was in the scriptures,  
 Did God say we could not be perfect?  
Did God say so?  
I wanted to know.  
What did Jesus teach?  
What did God say in the Holy Scriptures?  
Why is it so common?  
Why does everybody say it?  
 Why are we raised to acknowledge the wonderful amazing virtue of imperfection?  
It's taught as a virtue to accept imperfection.  
As I studied the Bible, I was amazed at what I saw.  
I was shocked at what I saw.  
 the direct opposite, the direct opposite.  
So I found out in a scripture, God actually said something completely different.  
God never said perfection is impossible.  
 He never said, only God is perfect.  
You know, people say that.  
They say, only God is perfect.  
Nobody is perfect.  
We are not perfect.  
Then they say, I'm not.  
You couldn't be.  


  
How many of you ever heard that saying, no one is perfect?  
We can't be perfect.  
I mean, you heard it all your life.  
In fact, the moment I even said, 2020, the year of perfection, some people got uncomfortable.  
 Because they've been raised all their lives to believe in imperfection.  
Hear me.  
Perfection is what God desires in demands.  
Perfection is at different levels in your life.  
All right?  
If you don't believe in it, you'll never have it.  
 If you believe no one is perfect, no one could be, imagine this, imagine this, imagine this, this contradiction, imagine this.  
Imagine that you got on a plane tonight and you were about to fly and the pilot said, as you all know, nobody's perfect.  


  
 Would you still want to fly?  
You want to come out of that thing.  
So we demand perfection in certain things of life.  
We want the guy to say, well,  
 It's pretty good.  
I can tell you, we're going to have a perfect flight.  
Would you say, how can he say we're going to have a perfect flight?  
He can tell.  
We don't know what's going to happen.  
If you say that, the guy next to you will say, could you sit somewhere else?  
Because now he's about to fly.  
He wants all the faith he can get.  


  
Listen.  
 It may be coming to you like late in your life because you believe this so long, but the Holy Spirit is able to impart your spirit with his word, with his truths and help you journey in the direction of his purpose for your life.  
Perfection is possible.  
 Not only possible, it is demanded.  
Not only demanded, I will show you in the scripture that this is the nature that God has actually given you.  
The moment you set yourself to perfection, you will have it.  
Somebody said, as long as we're in this earth, we will never be perfect.  
That's a lie of the devil.  
That's a lie.  
That's not true.  
Come on here.  
 You wanna see the Bible?  
Okay.  
What did we just read in Genesis chapter six and verse number nine?  
What did we read?  
It tells us about Noah.  


  
Genesis six and verse nine.  
These are the generations of Noah.  
Noah was a just man.  
Now these are the decorations of God.  
He says Noah was a just man.  
 and perfect in his generations.  
And Noah worked with God.  
He was perfect.  
The Hebrew is tamiene.  
It means to be perfect.  
It means to be flawless, flawless, without defect.  
This is a man who was described so to be in the earth, by scripture inspired of God.  
 He was flawless.  
He was complete.  


  
Hallelujah.  
And the Bible says he walked with God.  
Then I read you the next verse in Genesis chapter 17, verse 1.  
 What God said to this man here, by the name of Abraham, who was later changed to Abraham.  
And when Abraham was 90 years old and nine, 99 years old, the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him, I am the Almighty God.  
Walk before me and be thou perfect.  
God said, walk before me and be perfect.  
God said, be perfect.  
Be flawless.  


  
 Think about that.  
Who decides what's perfect?  
God Almighty!  


  
You are so quiet.  
So quiet.  
Are you still here?  
Or are you gone home?  
 Yeah, I know.  
Of course, we're talking about being perfect.  
So you're not very quiet now.  
Oh, Lord, did He get me?  
Look at that.  
It says, work before me and be thou perfect.  
Be perfect.  
Say, be perfect.  
Say again, be perfect.  
 Listen, the only reason you've grown up imperfect in your ways of doing things, the only reason is you were trained to not be perfect.  
You were trained.  
And then we co-reditizers in schools, in the laboratories of the world, trying to make things perfect.  
While trying them in their minds to not think perfectly,  
 And yet we produce perfect devices.  
Perfect devices.  
We produce perfect equipment.  
How could such things come out of us if we have no perfection in us?  
How could it happen?  


  
Perfect machines we do.  


  
Think about it.  
 We're on engines that run for days, made by men.  
Until you believe in perfection, you will never live it.  
But from 2020, you believe in it, you practice it, you walk in it.  
Amen.  
Amen.  


  
 Here's another man.  
Job, chapter 1, hear God's declaration.  
The Book of Job, chapter 1.  


  
 There was a man, verse one, there was a man in the land of verse whose name was Job.  
And that man was perfect and upright and warned that he had God and issued evil.  
Did you see that?  
That's God's declaration.  
Then down to verse,  
 Verse 8, God speaks to Satan.  
And hear what God says about Job.  
God speaks to Satan, the devil.  
Look at verse 8.  
And the Lord said unto Satan, has now considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, warned that fear at God, an astute evil.  
 Talk to me now.  
God said so.  
All right.  
Now let's hear Jesus.  
You want to hear Jesus?  
Somebody's gospel.  
Because you say, well, you know that.  
Old Testament.  
All right.  
Let me give you a new Testament.  
 Say, Matthew's Gospel, chapter 5, verse 48.  


  
Jesus said this, read it for me like you can see it.  


  
Did you see it?  
 Be there for perfect.  
The Greek is Talios.  
It's a king to Tamil.  
Tamil in Hebrew.  
Be there for perfect, even as your father, which is in heaven, is perfect.  
Jesus said so.  
So what are we supposed to say to him?  
Oh dear Jesus, you know this is not possible.  
 We say that to him?  
No.  
No.  
There's a nature that is given to us.  
I want you to understand this.  
Let's begin with you, how you were born.  
 Oh yeah, you were born of a mother and a father, right?  
At a certain time in your life, you were very little, and all you could do was just lie down.  
You couldn't even turn yourself.  
Somebody had to turn you.  
After a while, you began to sit, all right?  
Sometime in your life, you began to creep.  
 All this time, you couldn't get up like your parents.  
You could walk around like them, but you were a perfect human being as your mother and father.  
You couldn't live like them, but you were perfect of human being as much as they were.  
Am I right?  
Imagine that you looked at that child and you said, oh, this child is creeping, it's not perfect.  
No.  
 First is the nature.  
The Bible says what so ever God do it.  
Oh boy, I need to show you this.  
Ecclesiastes chapter three.  
Good verse 14.  


  
Can you see it?  
I know that whatsoever God do it.  
It shall be forever.  
You know what that means?  
 It says, whatever God does, continues endlessly.  
That means God does eternal things, everlasting things.  
When God does something, it's unfailing.  
It says, nothing can be put to it.  
Nothing can be taken out of it.  
You can't destroy it.  
You can damage it.  
Something has to happen to its nature.  
 for it to fail.  
Whatever God does, his eyes, it's forever.  
It continues endlessly.  
For example, here God made you, all right?  
You could have made yourself.  
Inside you got a heart, you got lungs, you got kidneys.  
How long should a function?  
How long?  
How long?  
What's the?  
 Durability.  
How durable are the systems of your body?  


  
Is the human life long-lasting?  
How long can we expect to function perfectly?  
Let's begin with the nature.  
 Because unless you understand God's purpose, God's plan, God's dream, God's work, you can't walk in the light of it.  
Jesus said, and you shall know the truth.  
And the truth shall make you free.  
I'll give you an example.  
Two nice examples.  
All right, you've heard me talk about this.  
I'm a blind man.  
And he was totally blind.  
 So I preached the gospel and prayed for the sick.  
I prayed en masse.  
And so after I prayed, I said, how many of you have been healed?  
I didn't get any hands.  
Now we'll conclude in the meeting and I'm sitting somewhere at the back.  
 why they're making the announcements and closing up.  
And I said, Lord, what happened?  
And the Spirit of God wished but within my spirit.  
And he says, but they were healed.  
He said, the blind man you prayed for was healed.  
I said, he was healed.  
So I walked straight to him.  
I said, sir, can you see me?  
He said, no.  
 His son was with him.  
It was his son who held him by the hand to bring him in.  
I said, but the spirit of God just told me he healed you when I prayed.  
He said, but I can't see anything.  
I said, but God doesn't lie.  
If he healed you, then he healed you.  
He said, but I can't see anything.  
So I took him by the hand.  
I said, follow me.  
And he and his son followed me.  
I brought him to the middle of the crowd.  
 And they are looking at me.  
I said, this man came here to leave blind.  
I said, but God just told me he's healed him.  
And yet he says he can't see.  
And the man interrupted.  
He said, but I can't see.  
 I said, but God has healed you.  
So we both were arguing in front of the crowd.  
And they were laughing and laughing.  
Now, were they laughing at me or laughing at him?  
I'm not quite sure, but they were laughing in a way.  
They thought it was funny.  
I'm arguing with a man that's totally blind and telling him God healed him.  
Then I said, stop.  
Stop saying.  
You can't see.  
Stop it.  
So I said, follow me.  
He followed me two, three steps.  
I said, look.  
 Then he said, well, I can't see anything.  
I said, don't say it again.  
I said, don't say it again.  
So I said again, look!  
He didn't know what to say.  
Because he couldn't see.  
I said, God has healed you.  
Look!  
Then he did like this.  
He could see.  
 He said, I can see.  
I can see.  
His song was startled.  
He had been blind for a long, long time.  
So, his song was startled.  
 He looked around.  
He saw everybody.  
He became the rejoice.  
He was jumping.  
He could demonstrate everything anybody did.  
He was just so excited.  
He could see.  
See, I could have let him go home, still blind.  
He never would have known that God had healed him.  
Jesus said, you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  
Truth and fact are two different things.  
Truth is reality.  
Praise God.  
 Not many are living the shoots.  
They are living with facts of life, but facts are less than shoots.  
I need you for the second example.  
 The beautiful moment for me was when they were leaving the man and his son, and I was watching them several meters away, and I didn't know what they were saying to each other, but I noticed the man did like this for the son to walk in front of him, and he followed.  
A year later, I sent people there for a follow-up.  
The man had been going from house to house preaching about Jesus Christ who opened his blind eyes.  
 I'll tell you these are the story.  
A couple came from their country for healing several years ago.  
And she was in the line while I was praying.  
When I got to her, she had a, her card stated that she had a heart condition and she wanted to be healed of a heart condition.  
So I prayed for her.  
 The next day, they should be leaving for their country.  
So I went to say hello and bye-bye.  
When I got to them, she didn't look very excited as I expected.  
So I said to the husband, your wife isn't looking excited today.  
Is there a problem?  
 Oh, she said, well, that's no problem.  
I thought, if she got healed last night, she ought to be happy, you know?  
She had a heart condition and she came with the x-rays.  
So the husband explained, he said, she's been blind in her left eye for 60 years.  
 She's 61.  
When she was one year old, she became blind in her left eye.  
Oh, I said, I understand the problem.  
I said, woman, you didn't tell us about the blind eye.  
You only talked about your heart condition.  
You must have said to God, if you will heal my eye, then I will believe my heart has been healed.  
She said, yes.  
 I said, well, when I prayed for you, God healed your heart and healed your eye.  
She said, but I can't see from it.  
I said, I know.  
That's why you're not happy.  
I said, but I can prove it to you.  
I said, when I laid hands on you, the power of God was transmitted into your body because that's what the Word of God says.  
So that healing power is still inside your body since last night when I prayed for you.  
 I said, you can activate it here, or you can activate it on a plane.  
Or when you get to your country, you can activate it anytime you like.  
What would you like to do?  
She said to me, I'd like to activate it here.  
I said here now, she said, yes.  
I said, great.  
I said, well, close the right eye.  
And she did.  
Her husband standing beside her.  
 I said, so you can see from the blind eye now.  
She looked and she said, no, she's trying to act like that man.  
She said, no, I said, no, no, no, no, no, don't say anything.  
Just see, that's all you do because I prayed for you last night.  
The power already is in you working.  
So see now.  
So I'm waiting.  
 And she doesn't know what to do, because it's the eye.  
You know, if it's your leg, you probably would make an effort.  
If it's your hand, you would make an effort.  
With the eye, what do you do?  
It's blind already.  
Well, while we're there, and I'm saying to her, see to the eye now.  
And I'm not praying because I prayed last night.  
Suddenly, she said,  
 I think I can see.  
I can see.  
So she covered this one.  
She said, honey, I can see.  
I can see.  
The husband almost went crazy.  
Then he said, can you see me?  
She said, I can see you.  
And both of them were jumping like kids in the room.  
She began to see from the blind eye.  
Now here's another good part of it.  
When they went back to their country,  
 She was doing her normal shots and collapsed as she normally will do when that trouble hit her from her heart.  
They rushed out to the hospital.  
While she was in the hospital bed, doctors did all the checks and came back to her and they said to her, where have you been?  
She said, what do you mean?  
They said, someone  
 has performed an operation on you.  
Where did you go to?  
She said, Doctor, what do you mean?  
They said, you have a heart of a young girl.  
She's 61.  
She had a brand new heart in her body.  
Come on, shout, hallelujah.  
 Thank you.  
I said that to say this.  
Jesus said, you shall know the truth.  
And the truth shall make you free.  
The truth.  
The truth of God's perfection in your spirit is a hidden reality.  
And the moment you bring it forth, you begin to walk in the light of it like you never thought possible.  
Say, I'm a perfect being of a perfect God.  
 One more time.  
I'm a perfect being of a perfect God.  
Now, four things that are necessary this year.  
I'll give them to you and then we'll expand shit on them another time.  
Just listen and get them, get them, get them.  
Oh, glory to God.  
You know, they're different kinds.  
You know, the Bible uses different terms for  
 the word perfection.  
Number one, there's going to be an alignment.  
This alignment is about preparation.  
Catathesis is a preparation.  
It's a re-engineering of how you operate.  
 It's a training, a training, because God's going to prepare you through His Word.  
There'll be an alignment of your will to God's will.  
Can you say amen?  
Of your purposes, with His purposes, can you say amen?  
Yes.  
God's Word can bring you into the place of His dream for you.  
 So get ready for that.  
Tell somebody to get ready for that.  
Number two, the word is completeness.  
Play raw is Greek for a fullness.  
It means to be made full, all right?  
To be replaced.  
The Word of God is going to be lodged in your system.  
 You're going to be so full of God's Word in a brand new way because there will be a desire in your heart for the knowledge of God.  
And you know what?  
When that knowledge fills your spirit, you'll be amazed what it will produce.  
When the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth.  
 You're going to be so full of God's word in 2020.  
You're going to desire after God's word in 2020.  
Can you say, man, until you are totally replete with information?  
Yes, the Bible says, let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.  
Ready for the next one?  
 The next one is excellence.  
A completeness.  
To bring you into that consummate's position.  


  
Excellence.  
Excellence is not something you struggle for.  
And that's why many never attain it.  
Excellence is the product of your spirit.  
 When you let your nature, your spirits with the nature of God produce works of righteousness, you walk in excellence.  
You know, sometimes I hear people talk about this striving for excellence.  
And I say, that's why it's difficult for you.  
A dog never strives to be a dog.  
A cat never strives to be a cat.  
I have an excellent spirit.  
 Say, I have an excellent spirit.  
See, I have an excellent mind.  
OK, I'm not confessing.  
I'm telling you.  
I have an excellent mind.  
I don't have negative thoughts.  
Don't come through my mind.  
No.  
No.  
They have no place in my mind.  
No negative thoughts, no thoughts of fear and thoughts of evil and wickedness.  
And no, no such thoughts.  
 No.  
Have an excellent mind.  
My mind is full of love and joy and peace and righteousness and grace.  
That's what Jesus gave to me.  
And that's what he gave to you.  
Say, have an excellent mind.  
I think excellent thoughts.  
Excellent thoughts.  
Thoughts of joy.  
 love, righteousness, grace, kindness.  
Oh, think about it.  
Imagine if you live your life every day and that's the way you think.  
That's the way not to be.  
That's the life Jesus gave us.  
That's the life he gave us.  
 He gave us a mind.  
Your mind is a tool.  
But that tool should take from the deposits of your spirit, because God's word resides in your spirit.  
And if you can peek from what God has put within your spirit and pass them through your mind, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness?  
Isn't that what the scripture says?  
 That's what it says.  
Imagine every day you have no thoughts of anger towards anybody.  
Think about that.  
What a life you'd live.  
Before they ask for forgiveness, you've forgiven them.  
That's the way to live.  
 That's the life Jesus came to give us.  
You don't struggle to have it.  
You just live it.  
It's your nature now.  
The Bible says being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God, which lived and abided forever.  
That's the life he gave you.  
So in 2020, you're going to live it.  
You're going to walk it.  
Can you say, man,  
 Yes, you think like God.  
Oh boy.  
You think like God.  
The Bible says, be there for what?  
Imitators of God.  
Imitators of God.  
Really for yourself.  
Vision's chapter five.  
Vision's chapter five.  
Read from verse one.  
 Can you see it?  
Be, therefore, followers of God.  
The word is imitators of God.  
Ask beloved children.  
Use the NIV for a second.  
Can you see that?  
In the NIV, he says, what?  
Be imitators of God, therefore, ask dearly loved children.  
Copy him.  
 How can you copy him if you don't know his word?  
You can only copy him if you know the word.  
Yeah, excellence, completeness, wow, excellence, say excellence.  
The fourth one is from the Greek Telesphorio.  
 Tell us for you is a compound word.  
Now, and it shows in only one verse of the Bible is therely.  
Quite interesting.  
Let's read it so you understand it.  
So Luke's Gospel chapter  


  
 Verse 14.  


  
And that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard, go for it.  
Read it out.  
And choke to it what cares.  
 Regis and pleasures of this life.  
And what?  
Bring no fruit to what?  
To perfection.  
The word translated perfection there.  
It's the least for you.  
It means to bring to fruition.  
To come to a ripened state.  
 to come to mature states where it triggers a result.  
So in 2020, you're going to come to that place.  
Your project will come to that state where it produces results.  
The knowledge of God's word in you will come to that state where it produces results.  
You will produce results to perfection in the name of Jesus.  
 Yes, it is specially used, that is very especially used, when a woman carries pregnancy, she's bearing a child.  
So she carries the pregnancy to full term, and now she gives birth.  
That's that is for you.  
So in the name of Jesus Christ,  
 No aborting of your ideas.  
No aborting of children.  
Hallelujah.  
You will produce results to perfection in the name of Jesus.  
No miscarriage.  
I said no miscarriage.  
 So what God gives you, you are character fruition.  
In the name of Jesus, lift your hands and thank Him.  
Oh, give me the highest praise.  
Give me the highest praise.  
Give me the highest praise.  
Oh Lord, it only do.  
You're the Lamb that was slain.  
 To the love that was slain.  
To the love that was slain.  
And washed away for me.  
Nothing's left.  
Nothing's left.  
And being here.  
And being here before.  
There's no peace.  
 Don't place no place in being alone.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
 I'm in awe, I'm in awe, I'm in awe, I do.  
We're getting the highest praise.  
We're getting the highest praise.  
I'm getting the highest praise.  
Oh Lord, and only You're the land.  
You're the land.  
You're the precious land that was made.  
 And washed away We give you We give you God We give you the highest praise  


  
 Praise the Lord.  
Praise God of his sanctuary.  
Praise him in the fulfillment of his power.  
Praise him for his mighty ex.  
Praise him according to his excellent greatness.  
Praise him with the sound of the soul.  
 Praise him with the tingling dance.  
Praise him with the stringed instruments and organs.  
Praise him upon the loud cymbals.  
Praise him upon the high sounding cymbals and everything that has breath.  
Praise the Lord.  
Jesus.  
Oh Jesus, I talk about mostly.

When I'm awesome, when I'm with you.  
Oh, I'll give you the praise.  
The highest praise.  
It's hard to do.  


  
 Unforgettable, how God's word came to us powerfully, giving us clear directions for the year.  
Don't train yourself to do things.  
 in the wrong direction.  
Train yourself.  
You understand?  
Train yourself to do what is right.  
Train yourself to do what you were taught to do.  
Train yourself to do it.  
Make an effort to overpower the desire to not go in the right direction.  
Sometimes there's a wrong desire.  
Taking us in the wrong direction refused to let it lead you.  
 Let the Spirit of God lead you in the direction that you have been taught.  
Walk in the way you've been taught.  
In the first three months of practicing, what you have been taught in the wisdom of God and in the instruction of God.  
First three months.  
January, February, March.  
You would think you have done one year.  


  
 You be amazed.  
He would say, it's just much.  
I've done all this already, it's just much.  
It's just much.  
It's gonna be so easy for you.  
The grace of the Lord Jesus at work in your life will surprise you.  
This year,  
 with good things amazing things this year this year what blessings what blessings what blessings what blessings the spirit of God will cause men to seek you do you know what that means?  
do you know what that means?  
 to be looking for you, seeking you, precious Jesus.  
In this 2020, the way things are going to... You ought to have to tell you, it's about the reality  
 that is placed before us.  
He's placed it before us.  
We won't look back.  
We won't look back.  
The king has said, do it.  
To go forth.  
And so we've heard him.  
We've heard him inside us.  
We've heard him.  
 and he is taking us beyond our dreams.  
Everything he did before now was just to give us a sign.  
It was a sign.  
What we have seen so far is not it.  
All that was a sign of what he's going to do.  
 by the Holy Spirit that dwells in us.  


  
 you
