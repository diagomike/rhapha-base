title: Volume 10

 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 Tell somebody there's a higher life in Christ.  
It's a life beyond the ordinary.  
Yes, there's a higher life.  
I was explaining something about using the Word of God.  
 learning to use the Word of God.  
The Word of God was given to us not only to inform us, not only to educate us about spiritual things, but for us to use, to live the supernatural life that He has called us to live.  
I want you to go to Daniel, chapter 10, on this occasion, Daniel the prophet,  
 had been fasting for three weeks, three weeks of fasting because he wanted an answer from God about something.  
He really wanted to hear from God.  
And it was now 21 days of fasting.  
Imagine  
 He must have been physically weak.  
So are you in Daniel chapter 10?  
And you will be looking at verse 14.  
Let's read from verse 14.  
The angel  
 The angel of God has been sent to him to bring him the message.  
And so he begins to address Daniel.  
He says, now I am come to make thee understand what shall be for thy people in the latter days, for yet the vision is for many days.  
So he's come with the answer.  
Verse 15.  
 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward the ground and became done, 16.  
And behold, one like the similarity of the sounds of man touched my lips.  
Then I opened my mouth and spoke and said unto him that stood before me, O my Lord,  
 By the vision, my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.  


  
For how can the seven of this my Lord talk with this my Lord?  
For as for me, straight away, there remained no strength in me.  
 Neither is their breath left in me.  
You understand what this man is saying?  
This is Daniel.  
His sinner, I'm so weak.  
Not only weak from the fasting, but now even weak from the message you brought to me.  
He says, there's no straight left in me.  
I'm just so weak.  
This information has paralyzed me. 18.  


  
 Then there came again and touched me, one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.  
How did he do it?  
Next verse, and said, oh man, greatly beloved.  
Fear not, peace be unto thee.  
 Be strong, yay, be strong.  
And when he had spoken unto me, I want you to notice that, when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened and said, let my Lord speak for thou has strengthened me.  
Can you see this prophet of God?  
He knew how to use the word.  
 The angel of the Lord said to him, that's the way, he said the angel came to strengthen him in the 18th verse.  
And in the 19th verse he told us how the angel did it.  
Now you know strength must be tested before you can say there's strength.  
You can't just sit on your chair and say, I'm strong.  
 You've got to want to get up to know whether you're stronger or not.  
It's when you're trying to get up that you know, oh, I couldn't get up.  
I wanted to get up and I couldn't get up.  
I wanted to move fast and I couldn't.  
I wanted to run and I couldn't.  
You know what I'm talking about?  
Yeah.  
So this man didn't have to wait to do something to find out whether or not he's been strengthened.  
 How do the angels strengthen him?  
The angel said, be strong, yay, be strong.  
And he could have said, thank you and waited.  
No, he spoke, he responded.  
Listen, you've got to respond to God.  
Are you hearing what I'm telling you?  
Your response to God is so important.  
 Now, I'm gonna give you another very simple example.  
One day, and this should be common knowledge to many of you.  
You must have studied this in your kindergarten.  
Okay, remember this.  
One day, a young boy by the name Samuel, the temple of God, working, serving the priest Eli.  
 The voice of God comes into the womb and he says, Samuel, Samuel runs to Eli the priest and says, you called me, son.  
And Eli said, I didn't call you.  
I didn't call you.  
The boy went back to sleep.  
The voice came again, Samuel, he'd get up and ran to the priest.  
And the priest said a second time, I didn't call you.  
Go back to sleep.  
 He went back to sleep, saw time the voice spoke, saw him, and he ran again to the priest.  
Now this guy's no fool.  
If the voice didn't sound like the priest, Eli's voice, he wouldn't have gone to Eli thrice.  
God's voice sometimes would sound like a familiar voice.  
And it's very important.  
 Often he will use the voice of the men of God that he has sent into your life to talk to you.  
And that's what he did to suffer.  
But because God got no response, there was no message.  
And so Eli had to teach the boy.  
He said, you've got to respond to God.  
 If you don't respond to him, you can hear nothing else.  
The barber says, Eli perceived that the Lord had called the boy.  
This is the priest of God.  
He perceived that the Lord had called the boy.  
He had to teach him.  
He said, the next time you hear that voice, you say, speak, Lord, for thy servant here is.  
 He said, respond to God.  
Say, speak, Lord, for thy servant, hear it.  
And so God, seeing everything, knowing that he'd been instructed, speaks again.  
Samuel, and now Samuel goes, speak, Lord, for thy servant, hear it.  
And guess what?  
God spoke.  
 You gotta respond to God.  
Respond to God.  
All right, you're still there?  
Okay.  
We've got some beautiful things to look through tonight.  


  
Yesterday, we got to discuss and several things.  
And I began to talk about  
 Jesus, reigning through us.  
Hallelujah.  
He's setting up His kingdom in His earth.  
And after His set of His kingdom in His earths and ruled in reign in the spirits, there will come the judgment of a great white throne.  
 where He sits and judges all who ever came to this world.  
They will be judged.  
And the Bible says that we will sit with Jesus Christ on thrones to judge the nations of the world.  
But before that happens,  
 You're going to have to do what He called you to do.  
Fulfill the call of God.  
Amen?  
And that call is for us to establish His kingdom here in those earths for your information.  
The reason you're here.  
 is to establish His righteousness, His kingdom of righteousness in dispense.  
Otherwise, right after you were born again, you should have been taken to heaven.  
But He left you here so you can do what He called you to do.  
There's a job to be done.  
There's no Christian who's been called to just lazy through life and do nothing.  
We are  
 An army.  
Amen.  
We are in God's army.  
Are you hearing me?  
And so when they say, let's pray instead.  
He doesn't want that.  
Wake up, stand straight and pray.  
This is an army.  
But you call that prayer?  
You're not ready.  


  
 Listen, there's some training you've got to have if you're going to be serious.  
God's people must be trained.  
There's a lot of people who just think that all you have to do is have some gifts of the Spirit, learn the Bible and go preach.  
No, there's a training.  
There's a training.  
 There's a training.  
There's a training.  
There's certain energies you must acquire.  
They wouldn't come just by being born again.  
You learn them, you train to become a soldier.  
 The Bible says, end your hardness as a soldier.  
End your hardness.  


  
Allelu.  
Anyway, this particular conference is not the one to train you on that.  
You don't get trained in the classroom.  
 There are instructions and information that will be given to you in the classroom, but that's not the training.  
The training is in those meetings.  
When you're told, stand up everybody, let's pray.  
When you're made to sit down for hours and you're beginning to, this chair is not comfortable.  
You are still remembering your only chair.  
When you are forgotten, that's when you will start.  
You know what I'm talking about?  
They haven't sat down for 20 minutes and they're like, what kind of chair is this?  
Didn't you go to school?  


  
 Didn't you sit down for hours?  
Okay, you say, I didn't.  
Then you were not trained.  
Then get ready to be trained.  
Glory to God.  
He says, and your hardness.  
There are tough times.  
And I'm not talking about when the devil is beating you around.  
No, no, I'm talking about tough times.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 Glory.  
Let's look at Isaiah chapter 53 from verse number 10.  
Book of Isaiah chapter 53 from verse 10.  
He says, now this is prophetic of the Lord Jesus Christ before he came.  
Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him.  
He had put him to grief  
 When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed.  
He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his head."  
Did you notice that?  
He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days.  
He's talking about Jesus Christ, Messiah prolonging his days through his seed.  
 Okay, go to the next verse 11.  
He shall see of the travail of his soul.  
See that?  
And shall be satisfied.  
We are the result of that travail.  
That soul travail that he went through, we are the results.  
 The Bible says when he saw the glory of God ahead of him, he endured the cross, despising the shame.  
He saw what we would be and went on and gave his life to save us.  
And now here we are, glorifying his name.  
We are his seed prolonging his days.  
They thought they were through with him.  
 When he died, they thought it was over.  
But these apostles and the disciples of the Lord went preaching the gospel.  
And the leaders of Israel were troubled.  
They said to the apostles, you intend to bring this man's blood upon us.  
You have failed Jerusalem with your doctrine.  
Please stop preaching his name.  
And they said, never, never.  
 We cannot but speak of the things that we have seen and heard.  
Hallelujah.  
They wouldn't stop preaching His name.  
And they said, that is spread no farther.  
They threatened the apostles, but they would not stop.  
They continued preaching.  
And let me tell you, it's still going on today.  
We're still preaching it.  
It doesn't matter who tries to stop us.  
 They never stopped.  
They couldn't stop the apostles.  
They can't stop us.  
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, the day and forever.  
We will preach it on the house top, on the mountain tops, and the valleys everywhere, not in south and west.  
We will preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
Doesn't matter who.  
 Those sediments of the poor, we will preach it.  
In the palaces of the monarchs, we will preach it.  


  
We'll take it everywhere.  
Since my heart is burning, my mouth is full, and burning, I can't hold back.  
I've got to preach it.  


  
 He says, this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world as a witness to our nations and then shall the end come.  
We're going to preach it until the end comes.  


  
Thanks be unto God.  
Hallelujah.  
Yeah.  
Let me show you another thing.  
 You would love this.  
First Corinthians chapter 15.  
First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse number 25.  
Glory to God.  
Oh, look at this.  
This is talking about Jesus.  
For he most reigns.  
 Till he had put all enemies on his feet.  
How would us to examine this?  
This is powerful.  
He says he must reign.  
Now, he didn't say.  
Notice what he didn't say.  
He didn't say he must reign when he had put all enemies on his feet.  
Did you notice there's a difference between that and what you seen up there?  
 He must rain till he had put all enemies on there.  
He said, not when he had done it.  
The Lord is my shepherd.  
I shall not walk.  
He says, it makes me lie down in green pastures.  
He leads me beside the stew waters.  
He restored my soul.  
You know the part I like?  
He says, thou prepared a table before me in the presence of my enemies.  


  
 Thou preparest a table before me, in the presence of my enemies.  
The more that try to dishonor me, the more I am honored.  


  
Thou preparest a table before me, not in the absence of my enemies, but in the presence of my enemies.  
1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse number 25.  


  
 For he must reign, till he hath put our enemies under his feet.  
That means he's running in the midst of his enemies.  
He's raining, you know what it is, the rain?  
It's a verb.  
It's an interesting verb, it's an interesting construction.  
 The best way to show it to you is, you know, I tell people, if you just studied the Bible, you'll be educated.  
Go to Romans 5 verse 17.  
Let's show you something.  
We'll come back here.  
 Free by one man's offense, death reigned by one, much more there which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ.  
Now, the brick construction there says something very beautiful.  
He says, they shall kings in life.  
 You know what that means?  
To king.  
So there's a noun.  
King.  
But to king.  
I'm king king.  
Can you get it now?  
I shall king over them.  
 Now, I didn't say I shall be king.  
I said I shall king over them.  
I understand the construction.  
How you getting it?  
It means to king.  
They shall reign.  
So to reign is the nice English construction of that verb to king.  
So he says, we are supposed to king.  
We should be kinging.  


  
 How you following it now?  
So that's the verb.  
So go back to 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 25.  
For he must reign, this is Jesus, must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.  
He must reign.  
 till he had put all enemies on his feet.  
Now this Jesus that must be reigning is in heaven.  
So how is he going to reign?  


  
Now he says he must do it till all his enemies are placed on the hill.  
That means this reigning is not in heaven because there are no enemies in heaven.  
 He must reign till he had put all enemies under his feet.  
Look at verse 26, next verse.  
The last enemy.  
So all enemies.  
And this is the last one so that we are in no doubt as to what these enemies are and when we finish with them.  
He tells us which is the last one.  
 The last enemy that shall be destroyed, I want you to notice the word destroyed, he doesn't say defeated, because the enemies have been defeated.  
But here he says he's destroyed, the word means to paralyze, render useless, are you hearing this?  
He's been defeated already, but he's going to be annihilated, taken off the scene.  
 The last enemy that shall be annihilated is death.  
Now that tells you something, death is an enemy.  
You've heard it many times, the praying of us some dead one and the corpse has been, the coffin has been lowered into the grave and that minister with his collar turned backward says,  
 The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away.  
Blessed be the name of the Lord who has given and taken away.  
He didn't take away.  
That was not the Lord.  
The man who said that was Joe.  
And we found out it wasn't God who took away from him.  
He was the devil, but he didn't know it.  
 The Lord doesn't give and take away the Bible says the gifts, right?  
All of his blessings that he pours into your life, the gifts and callings of God are without repentance.  
He doesn't give you and take away.  
 And now we find death is an enemy.  
So death is not an instrument of God.  
You know, some people say, oh, death is also God's instrument.  
It's not God's instrument.  
The Bible says death is an enemy of God.  
Look at it right there.  
Don't say you didn't see it.  
It's death.  
The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.  
It's being defeated already, but it will be destroyed.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
But he must wane.  
Go back to verse 25.  
For he must wane till he put all enemies on his feet.  
Remember something he told us in John's gospel, chapter 16 and verse number 33, St.  
John chapter 16 verse 33.  
 These things I have spoken on to you that in me he might have peace.  
In the world he shall have tribulation, but be of good care.  
I have overcome the world."  
Jesus said that.  
He overcame the world and gave us the victory over the world.  
 That word is I have conquered the word.  
Make no mistakes about it.  
Jesus conquered the word.  
That's the meaning I have overcome, overcome.  
I have overpowered.  
I have overcome, conquered the word.  
I've stripped it of all its powers to intimidate you.  
Hallelujah.  
 So no matter where I go, I'll never be intimidated.  
No matter what happened, I'll never be intimidated.  
Why?  
Jesus overcame the word for me.  
He defeated the devil and put his foot on his head.  
 and asked me to come put mine there, too.  
Hallelujah.  
First, why are you looking at this?  
First, a piece of John, chapter five, and verse number four.  
 For whatsoever is born of God, overcome it the world.  
And I told you last night, that is life.  
It's going on now.  
whatsoever is born of God, overcome it the world.  
 You see, Jesus overcame the word, and now that you're born again, you are an overcomer, and you are at it now.  
It's going on now.  
Whatsoever is born and gone over comes the word.  
And this is the victory that overcomers the word, even our faith.  
See the importance of your faith?  
 The ability to see things before you touch them.  
Can you imagine that?  
To see the reality beyond the shadows.  
Fate is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  
We see with the eyes of our spirit through the Word of God.  
 Whatever God's word says, we are, we are.  
What the word says, we have, we have.  
Where he says, we are, we are at.  
Can you shout amen, somebody?  
That's what it is.  
Hallelujah.  
So we are overcomers.  
He says, whatsoever is born of God, conquests the world.  


  
 Glory to God.  
I have overcome the world.  
With all its negativisms, I have overcome this world and all the economies, all the economies of the world, I have overcome the world.  
No matter where I find myself,  
 No matter which nation I find myself, I have over-combinations.  
Hey, where are the nations?  
They're in the world.  
I've over-combinations of the world.  
Think about it.  
Think about it.  
Think about it.  
Think about it.  
I've over-combinations of the world.  
Let it get into your spirits.  
Let it get into your spirits.  
 Are you hearing what I'm telling you?  
Because you're none of these words.  
I've overcome the nations of the world.  
Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.  


  
I've overcome the powers of this world.  
I've overcome the governments of this world.  
Maybe you don't understand it.  
 Let me tell you, there's some things I read in the Bible.  
I was a little startled.  
I hear me and I thought, hey, how dare you?  
How could you?  
But you see, I write it.  
He wrote it.  
He already said it.  
And he expects a response from me.  


  
 I've overcome the world and its economics.  
Do you understand what that means?  
It doesn't matter how they use the Japanese calculator to calculate what they think my profits are.  
I am a wall of a comma.  


  
I've overcome this one.  
 You see, we're talking about living beyond the limits.  
You're living beyond the world's limits.  
They've got their limits.  
There's how far they can go.  
If you're British, there's just how far you can go because you are British.  
You can go that far.  
The Russian may not come that far.  
Just because he's Russian, he can go that far.  
 Because you're Ghanaian, you just can't go that far because you're Ghanaian.  
This is how far you can go until you stop because of your identity as Ghanaian.  
Because you're American, it's just how far you can go.  
Are you listening to me?  
It's all yes because you're an American in this country.  
It's just how far you can go because you're American.  


  
 But I will overcome the world.  


  
There are no barriers.  
There are no limits.  
Are you hearing me?  


  
Because I'm identified.  
Do you know who I'm identifying with?  
 I will soon introduce him to you.  


  
 No wonder he says, count it all joy.  
When you go through divas tests, he says, count it all joy.  
Count it all joy.  
No matter what's happening, count it all joy.  
It is for your good, count it all joy.  
It is for your good, count it all joy.  
Shout out to all of you.  


  
 Glory to God.  
There's no disadvantage to the child of God.  
Disadvantage?  
Do you know who I am?  
Disadvantage?  
How could I have a disadvantage?  
It's not possible.  
Do you know where I come from?  
 First John chapter four, verse four.  
Let's look at the upper part of it.  
First John chapter four, verse four.  
That first part, ye are of God.  
You know what that means?  
He's not saying that you're on God's side.  
He's not talking about association here.  
He's talking about origin.  
 He's telling you where you hail from, where you are from.  
You are of God.  
You hail from God.  
Your origin is in God.  
We are of God, little children, and have, have already overcome them.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 You have overcome them.  
Don't pray to overcome them.  
Don't prophesy that you are going to overcome.  
There's no need for that.  
Don't say we shall overcome.  
No, we have overcome them.  
No, it is not.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
We have overcome them.

 I know who I am.  
I know who I am.  
See, when you don't know who you are, you will act differently.  
See, when you know who you are, you become humble because men of power are humble.  
Men of authority are humble.  
 Because you know, you know, you can always get your way.  
You can always get your way.  
So you don't kill it.  
So you're humble.  
Don't worry.  
No matter what they say, you're going to have the last word.  


  
 He just smiled nicely and be kind, no arguments.  
Kings don't argue, do they?  


  
Don't get rough with anybody.  
You know what to do.  
Hallelujah.  
Do you remember Joshua?  
Who said, son stands to him?  
He said, moon, relax.  
 until I'm through with the enemies.  


  
And the Bible says, God had never responded to the voice of a man like he did to Joshua that day, not even to Moses.  
Look at this.  
God said to Moses, stretch your hand over the water and divide it.  
He didn't give Joshua this instruction.  
 He didn't tell Joshua to stop the sun in the moon.  
He was Joshua who did it.  
He said, song relax, tell ya!  


  
No wonder the scientists said four days were lost.  
In their calculations, nice, add to some of them, go find out from Joshua.  
 Hallelujah.  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
See, you are learning.  
You understand?  
You are learning.  
Sometimes some people say, I said this should happen and it didn't happen.  
Why?  
I say to them, don't you understand?  
You got to learn authority?  
Authority is to the extent of responsibility.  
If you don't have responsibility, your authority will not work.  
 Your authority covers your responsibility.  
That means become responsible.  
You want to have authority without responsibility?  
That's why I was teaching about training.  
You got to be trained.  
Get a pass through some stuff.  
Okay?  
 Do the right things.  
You're giving instructions, get them done.  
You're giving a job to do, do it, and do it right.  
If you wouldn't do such things, how you're going to handle authority?  
It will not work.  
It will fail.  
Discipline is important for kingship.  
You're gonna have discipline.  
Discipline.  
That's the first part.  
 Once you can be disciplined, aha, then you're getting ready.  
You know what the Bible says?  
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  
Did you hear it?  
Beginning.  
The fear of the Lord.  
The fear of the Lord.  
I wouldn't do that.  
God wouldn't want me to do that.  
That's the fear of the Lord.  
 How can I talk like that?  
God doesn't like it.  
I'm not going to talk like that.  
That's the fear of God.  
That means you're just beginning to be wise.  
That's the beginning.  
There are higher realms of wisdom.  
The very beginning is the fear of God.  
But if you don't have the fear of God in your heart, you haven't started at all.  
The fear of God.  
Service in church starts at nine.  
 At 9.30 you are strolling down.  
You don't have the fear of God.  
You should be running.  
No, be running.  
Repenting on the way.  
Father, I'm so sorry.  
How could I be late like this?  
I'm so sorry.  
Yeah.  
That's the fear of God.  
It is the beginning of wisdom.  
That is the beginning.  
 The fear of God must be in your heart.  
There are things you will not do because the Word of God forbids you.  


  
That's the beginning of wisdom.  
Then you start getting ready for the higher realms of wisdom.  
That is another message.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
You're still there?  
 Aha, mama, mama, mama.  
He must reign.  
There we receive abonance of grace.  
Romans 5, 17.  
Romans 5, 17, 4, 8, by one man's of fiends.  
He's talking about Adam's of fiends.  
There it reign by one.  
Much more there we receive abonance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life.  
Kings in life.  
 They shall king.  
At least you wouldn't forget that I'm king.  
Yeah.  
In life.  
Actually, it's in this life.  
That's what it's saying.  
By Jesus Christ.  
Glory to God.  
Revelation chapter 11 from verse 15.  
 and a seventh angel sounded.  
And there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world, brothers and sisters.  
He said, he must reign till all his enemies have made his footstool.  
He's running through us.  
He's running through me.  
He's running through you.  
And he will continue running until all his enemies have made his footstool.  
 He's doing that through us.  
He shall see His seed.  
He shall prolong His days.  
Amen?  
So He's prolonging His days through us.  
Glory to God.  
The kingdoms, this is the angel sounding, and there were great voices in heaven.  
Who is in heaven?  
Saying, the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ.  
 Yes, because we made it so.  
Do you understand what's happening here?  
We so took over the world that there was a shake-up in all nations.  
I said the church in many nations may be called a sleeping giant, but very soon that sleeping giant will wake up.  
As the dead has woken up in many nations,  
 Great things are happening.  
The church has risen up.  
We are doing wonders.  
We are doing great things all around the world.  
Hallelujah.  
Big things are happening by the church.  
He says, there were voices in heaven saying, the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.  
 Watch, it's not over, you catch it now.  
Next verse.  
And the foreign 20 elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces and worshiped God, 17.  
Saying, we give thee thanks O Lord, God almighty, which art and was, and art to come, because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, in hast laid.  
 And has reigned.  
He's done it.  
He said he shall reign till he have made all his enemies his footstool.  
He has reigned.  
Are you saying that?  
We're in the earth.  
How?  
Through us.  
Before the next phase begins.  
 Look at that.  
He has rained.  
It has happened.  
We've done it.  
We've done it.  
We've done it.  
We've done it.  
Brothers and sisters, this thing is real.  
Are you hearing me?  
Let's read.  
See, yes, now has rained.  
Now, next verse 18, and the nations were angry.  
Can you see that?  
As we were doing it, they were angry.  
Listen, watch this fellows.  
 There's Christians, they say, all the Christians, there's a certain group of Christians.  
There are some Christians.  
They're not afraid of every Christian.  
There are some Christians.  
There are some.  
The nations were angry.  
But they couldn't do nothing.  
They couldn't do the squat about it.  
 And the Herodis come, the nations were angry, but God also got angry.  
Hallelujah!  
And the Herodis come and the time of the dead that they should be judged.  
 And that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets unto the saints.  
And name that fear thy name, small and great.  
And shouldest destroy them which destroyed the earth.  
They're talking to God.  
The 24 elders are talking to God.  
They said, it's time.  
You have reigns.  
The nations were angry.  
But now it's time for you to pour out your rot against them who destroyed the earth and reward your servants the prophets and the saints, glory to God.  
 Whoa, hallelujah!  
Oh, you haven't seen this yet.  
Some of you are just beginning to... Let me show you some more.  
You ready for this?  
Okay.  
Mmm.  
Kucho will be simpler for you now.  
Okay.  
You're the chapter 17.  
Revelation chapter 17.  
No, let me take you to  


  
 All right, let's begin with verse nine of chapter 19.  
Take you some nice things there.  
 And He said unto me, right, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.  
You know, those 24 elders, they prayed to God, they talked to the Lord and said, it's time, it's time for you to judge the nations and reward your servants.  
And it's time, see, and something begins happening here.  
He said unto me, right, blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.  
Notice, they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.  
 Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb.  
What does that tell you?  
These are invitees to the marriage supper of the Lamb.  
That means they are not the bride.  
They are the invitees.  
They are called to the marriage supper.  


  
 That suggests that all the great men and women, which we generally call the Church of all generations, all Testament Church and new, that there are different classes.  


  
There is the bride of Christ.  
 Are you hearing me?  
But blessed are they that are called unto the marriage of the Lamb.  
And He said unto me, these are the true sayings of God.  
Move to the next verse.  
And I fell at His feet to worship Him.  
And He said unto me, see thou do it not.  
I am thy fellow servant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus, worship God.  
For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.  
Say amen.  
Next verse.  
 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse.  
This is another white horse.  
There's another white horse.  
That's the Antichrist.  
But this one, there's the good white horse.  
Okay.  
Now, he says, and behold a white horse.  
And he that sat upon him was called Fettful and True, hallelujah.  
And in righteousness, he doth judge and make war.  
 Verse 12, his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns.  
Glory to God.  
And he had a name written that no man knew, but he himself.  
How would you like to have a name that nobody knows?  
I mean, nobody's gonna call that name.  
Only you, and you wouldn't call yourself.  
Do you know what he's telling us?  
 He's dealing with a realm of authority that Jesus has that no one yet understands.  
You see it?  
And when he's unveiled at the realm and level of that authority, my goodness.  
But let's see.  
I told you I was going to introduce him to you.  
That's what I'm doing now.  
And he had a name written that no man knew, but he himself, verse 13,  
 And he was called with a vesture dipped in blood.  
And his name is called the Word of God.  
Say amen.  
14.  
And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white hoses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.  
Oh, the armies which were in heaven followed him.  
What is going on?  
I'll tell you.  
Next verse.  
 and out of his mouth go at a sharp sword, that when he, he should smite the nations, and he shall rule them with a rod of isle, and he threaded the winepress of the firstness and rod of Almighty God.  
Hi, next one.  
And he had on his vesture, and on his thigh, the name written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.  
Oh my goodness.  
 Do you know what's going on?  
He says he descends with amis from heaven.  
I want to give you the picture.  
Just hold on.  
You like this.  
Oh, well, there's a script you're bobbling in my spirit.  
Let me show it to you.  
Revelation chapter 1, verse number 7, you like it.  
He says, behold, he come at with clouds.  
Hallelujah.  
 Behold, he come and with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him, and our kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him, even so a man."  
You know what I'm telling you?  
Jesus is coming back.  
He's coming back to this earth to set up his kingdom.  
Jesus is coming back.  
 We're preaching, we're telling everybody, get ready, because Jesus is coming back.  
He said, they've been saying it for a long time.  
Yes, but He's closed at the day than ever before.  
He is coming back.  
He's coming back.  
 Hallelujah.  
He's coming back.  
He comes with cows.  
We just read something that he came.  
He says, he was coming with armies of heaven.  
Now he says, with cows.  
I'm trying to tell you something.  
The reason for the emphasis is this.  
We are actually coming with him.  
What he's talking about here is what we call the second advent of Jesus.  
He's coming again.  
But before he comes again, there will be a rapture.  
 There will be the taking away, the catching away of the church.  
I know that in the church of Jesus Christ, there are many who are saying different things.  
Some are saying post tribulation, para tribulation, pre tribulation, all the pre or para or whatever it is.  
But one thing is certain.  
 Jesus Christ will sound the trumpets when he doesn't come to the earth, but that sounding of the trumpet will cause the dead in Christ to rise first.  
And we that are alive and remain shall be colored up to meet the Lord in the air, and we will go away from there and not come to the earth, and we'll be away with the Lord for some time, probably about seven years counting on earth before we come back with the king.  
That's what the Bible says.  


  
 And so we come with him.  
He's coming to the earth to establish his kingdom.  
Let me tell you, these nations of the world as they are today, the day is coming and it's not far away where they were seen with their eyes.  
Jesus Christ come to this earth to establish his kingdom.  
I would like to remind you of the words of the prophet, Daniel chapter two.  
Let me show you something.  
 Daniel chapter 2, let's read from verse 31.  
Now let me give you the background.  
In Daniel chapter 2, you find a king named Nebuchadnezzar, a great great king.  
 One day he had a dream that troubles him.  
And he know what to do.  
The Bible says he called all the wise men of his realm.  
And the astrologists and the guardians who were the most erudites of the kingdom.  
He called a man and he said to them, gentlemen, I had a dream.  
 He said, and I want the interpretation of the dream.  
And he said, oh King, live forever.  
Now you read it, it's all there.  
Okay, oh King, live forever.  
Go ahead, tell us the dream.  
He said, no, I forgot the dream.  
So they said, in that case, we can't help you.  
He said, listen, you're going to know who's King around here.  
 You must tell me the dream that I had.  
And the interpretation, they said, King, we've never heard of such a thing.  
You have to tell us what your dream is, and we will tell you the interpretation.  
And the king said never.  
He said, I know you all.  
If I tell you the dream, you would tell me lies about the interpretation.  
He said, so the only way I'm going to know that your interpretation is true is for you to tell me the dream, because I've forgotten.  
 He said, if you tell me the dream, I will remember.  
And then I will believe your interpretation.  
Then the Calleons, the wisest of them moved forward.  
And they said, Oh King, it's unheard of.  
 You have to tell us the dream, or we cannot help you.  
Nebuchadnezzar said, all right, let me tell you something.  
If you don't tell me my dream and the interpretation, I'll kill every one of you and not stop there, I'll destroy all your families.  
Get out of my sights.  
Come back in a few days and tell me my dream and the interpretation.  
Get out.  
And they realized the king was right.  
And then he waited for a while.  
 And he called one of his Amaberos.  
He said, go and kill all of them.  
And so they thought, oh, what is happening?  
The king is so urgent.  
And then he said, Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach, Misha, and Abednego.  
They are monk wise men.  
After all, they were trained in the kingdom to become wise men.  
They should be killed as well.  
So somebody came to them and he said, hello?  
 File out, file out, file out.  
It's a file out to work.  
That's it.  
Why?  
It said the king wants to have your neck.  
Why?  
What have we done?  
Have you not heard it?  
Then the Bible says the man has the matter to Daniel.  
And Daniel said, is that it?  
He said, please tell the king to hold on for a while.  
I promise.  
 to tell him his dream and the interpretation.  
They said, you?  
He said, yes.  
And it took the message to the king.  
And the king said, OK.  
All right.  
Oh, by his dead body.  
And Daniel called his friends.  
Shadrach, Meshach, and the bednagle.  
Let us pray to the God of heaven.  
 He revealed secrets.  
And the Bible says they pray to the God of heaven.  
And the Almighty God showed Daniel the dream and the interpretation of the dream.  
And so now we are in verse 31.  
Daniel chapter 2, so I just gave you all those 30 verses.  
Thou, O King, now he stands before the King.  
 and is telling him the dream.  
Thou, O King, sowest and behold, a great image.  
This great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee, and the form thereof was terrible.  
This image's head was a fine gold.  
Watch it now.  
The head of fine gold.  
OK, I need somebody now.  
I need a big one.  
Come.  
Thank you.  
Glory to God.  
 Your size has paid off today.  
Handsome guy.  
Yeah.  
This image head was of fine gold, the head.  
And this is so nice.  
You don't have to ask me, where's the neck?  


  
 All right.  
It's just, it's just perfect.  
It's just perfect.  
Because when I was studying those things, I used to think, Lord, which side was the neck?  
And I got my answer now.  
This image's head was a fine gold, right away from here up.  
Gold, fine gold.  
His breasts and his arms of silver.  
His belly, which is coming out now, right?  
 His belly and his thighs of brass.  
Next verse.  
His legs of iron.  
His feet, parts of iron and parts of clay.  
Daniel is then in the king.  
You saw an image and describe the image of the king so in his dream.  
Verse 34.  
Thou soest.  
 He said, you kept seeing, looking, beholden, till the stone was cut out without hands.  
Which slots the image upon his feet.  
Power!  
Heat the image on his feet.  
The feet that were of iron and clay and break them in pieces. 35.  
 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broke into pieces together and became like the shaft of the somatration floors.  
And the wind carried them away that no place was found for them.  
And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled with the whole earth.  
 36, this is the dream, and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.  
7, thou king at the king of kings, for the God of heaven had given thee a kingdom, power and strength and glory. 38,  
 And where some of the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the powers of the heaven have He given into thine hand and have made the ruler over them all, thou at this head of gold."  
He says, Nebuchadnezzar, you are that head of gold.  
The head of gold represents you.  
39.  
And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee.  
Remember, that was silver.  
 inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earths, forty.  
And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, for as much as iron brick it in pieces, and so do it all things, and as iron that brick it all these shall it brick in pieces and brews, forty-one.  
 And whereas thou soest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay and part of iron, that kingdom is is shall be divided, but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou soest the iron mixed with Mary clay.  
42.  
And as the toes of the feet were, part of iron and part of clay, so the kingdom, that particular kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken.  
 And whereas thou saw us iron mixed with Mary Clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of man, but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.  
No matter how they try to be together, it says it will still not happen.  
And in the days of these kings.  
Oh, Rabbi Sinteke.  
Are you listening?  
 in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people."  
That means it will not be replaced.  
For it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever.  


  
 for as much as thou soest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, in that it break in pieces, the iron, the brass, the clay, the cellar, and the gold.  
The great God hath made known to the king what shall come the past hereafter, and the dream is settled and the interpretation thereof sure.  
 verse 46, then the King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and washed Daniel and commanded that they should offer a libration and sweet odors unto him.  
Are you there?  
Let me explain a little bit to you.  
Listen to this.  
He said,  
 Nebuchadnezzar was that head of Google.  
That was the Babylonian kingdom that was there at the time.  
Replaced by the middle-pasion kingdom.  
That was the silver.  
After that came the kingdom of brass.  
 That was the Greek Empire.  
You see, how do you know all this?  
I will show you something, just relax.  
After that was a kingdom of iron.  
That was the Roman Empire.  
And at the last, he says, a kingdom of iron and clay.  
That means  
 the relationship between that ion kingdom, the SY ion kingdom.  
And this next one, except that there are others that are of clay, that are now mixed with it.  
And that in the days of those kings, did you notice?  
In the days of those kings, the Almighty God was set up a kingdom.  
 That means not in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, not in the days of the meal of patience, not in the days of the Greeks, not in the days of the Romans, but in the days of the iron mixed with clay kingdom.  
So all those who left during that period, if they were waiting for the end of time because they heard the Prophet's speech,  
 Daniel has revealed not in their days, but in the days of the feet, king, iron and clay.  
There's time in improvising.  
Iron.  
There's time in improvising.  
Let me take you to another posture that will help.  
Revelation chapter 17 from verse 7.  
 And the angel said unto me, Huifon is thou marvel.  
Why?  
Because he marveled at the, there's a woman riding on a beast that he saw.  
It was a frightful sight.  
And John marveled at what he saw.  
And the angel said, why do you look so surprised?  
Why are you astonished?  
 The angel surrounded me wherefore the thou marvel, I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carried her, which had the seven heads and ten homes.  
 The beast that thou saw as was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition.  
The beast that thou saw as was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition.  
And they that dwell on the earth shall wander whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is.  
 was and is not and yet is.  
Wonderful.  
Relax.  
Verse 9.  
And here is the mind which had wisdom.  
The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman seated.  
Now, that's on the part I'm going to explain to you today.  
Now, it says, there are seven kings.  
Here is what I want you to begin to see.  
There are seven kings.  
Five are fallen.  
And one is and the other is not yet come.  
 There are seven kings, five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come.  
And when he cometh, he must continue a short space, space of time.  
And the beast that was and is not even he is the eight and is of the seven and go it into position.  
Do you know what he's talking about?  
He's dealing with kingdoms.  
 Okay?  
He's in with kingdoms.  
It's just like when he said to, when the prophet said to Nebuchadnezzar, dawat the head of gold, after we shall another kingdom.  
You remember?  
He says, you.  
So he represented a kingdom therefore.  
He says, after you, there will be another kingdom.  
He didn't at that point say, there will be another kingdom.  
He says, another kingdom shall arise inferior to thee.  
 So Nebuchadnezzar represented there, his king, okay?  
All right.  
In this case, he tells us about these kings.  
He said, there are seven.  
Five are fallen.  
One is.  
Let's go back there.  
He says, there are seven kings.  
Five are fallen.  
And one is, and the other is not yet come.  
And then he goes on to tell us that there's an eight one, but that eight one is of the seven.  
 Are you still here?  
Okay, what's going on here?  
What dealing with prophecy now?  
There are seven kings, five are fallen, one is.  
 When you understand Bible prophecy like this, you read from here, in Revelation study from Daniel, study from Ezekiel, okay?  
And you begin to understand what he is dealing with here.  
He is dealing with those kingdoms that ruled over Israel and over the then known world.  
And he says, there's seven of them.  
And there will be 18 of them.  
 But it says there are seven, five are fallen, one is.  
At the time of John, five were already fallen.  
Let's count backwards.  
Those that ruled over Israel.  
Count backwards.  
At the time of John, which kingdom was in existence, ruling over Israel, which one?  
 Rome.  
Rome was the one east, right?  
So he says five are fallen.  
So which are these five?  
Number one will be the one before Rome.  
Which one is that?  
Greece.  
Is that correct?  
Number two, the one before Greece?  
Come on.  
Middle Persian.  
 Number three, which one?  
Before Middle Persian?  
Come on.  
Babylon.  
Number one, Greece.  
Number two, Middle Persia.  
Number three, Babylon.  
Number four, I didn't give you that.  
That'll be the one before Babylon, Assyria.  
Before the Assyrians, Egypt.  
 And Egypt was the first to rule over Israel.  
So their five.  
So history is proved.  
Can you see that?  
The five.  
He says, five are fallen.  
One is, wrong is.  
Then he says, and the order is not yet come.  
That follows what  
 Daniel saw.  
In Daniel's time, it was Babylon that was on.  
Two were already gone.  
There were others to come.  
And now, years after Daniel, here comes John in the time of the feet of iron room.  


  
 And then the one that is not yet come.  
And when he come, he must continue a short time.  
He must continue a short time.  
Let's read verse 11.  
And the beast that was, and is not, even he is dead.  
And is of the seven.  
And goeth into position.  
He is of the seven.  
 He's the eight, but he's of the seven, which means that all the characteristics of those seven will be present in this eight one.  
If they ever persecuted Israel, if any of those ones ever persecuted Israel, this one will multiply seven times.  
If any of those ones ever hated the God of Israel, this one will hate him seven times.  
 Are you following what's going on here?  
He says, this is the eight one.  
And there's a reason why he's the eight one.  
He will replace the kingdom of iron and clay.  
And I'll explain that to you.  
Daniel doesn't talk about him.  
But he talks about him in another portion.  
So he's not in Nebuchadnezzar's dream.  
He talks about the little horn and his great words of evil.  
I'll show that to you in a second.  
 All right, now look at this.  
Verse 12.  
And the 10 horns which thou saw as are 10 kings, which have received no kingdom as yet.  
Yeah, this in the days of John, these 10 kingdoms, that means the 10 nations.  
Okay, kingdoms.  
So he says they have received no power as yet.  
So in the days of John, they were in existence.  
 They have received no kingdom as yet, but receive power as kings.  
One hour with the beast.  
What does that tell you?  
He says there are 10 of them.  
Now I know that the people who are looking around to find 10, 10 confidresses, they haven't found them.  
And so they say, oh, listen, hear what the Bible says.  
They receive power as kings, one hour with the beasts.  
That means they're going to come in at about the same time.  
 at about the same time.  
The structure will be formed at about the same time.  
Then the Bible says they have one hour.  
Now one hour in Scripture means a short time.  
They're not going to run for long.  
And God's not going to spare them for long.  
Okay.  
Now verse 13, these have one mind and shall give their power.  
Now, now, now, now.  
 Now, look at this.  
These have one mind and shall give their power and strength onto the beasts.  
Those who be the kingdoms of iron and clay.  
Can you see it now?  
They are the wounds of iron and clay, those nations of iron and clay, and they will give their authority to the beasts.  


  
Dear Lord,  
 I wish I could tell you some details, but not in this meeting.  
These have won mine and shall give their power and strength unto the beasts, 14.  
These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, for his Lord of Lords and King of Kings, and they that are with him, Hallelujah!  
 Talking about us, they are with Him, are called and chosen and faithful.  
Shower Him in somebody.  
Verse 15, and He said unto me, the waters which thou saw us, who were the hosts seated, are peoples, and martyrgues, and nations, and tongues.  
Oh, dear.  
You see that now?  
It's coming, I told you.  
It's coming.  
 Jesus will set up his kingdom here.  
He got to wake up.  
The time is short.  
Glory to God.  
The time is short.  
Don't think the world will continue as it is today, forever like this.  
No, it will not.  
It will not.  
 Verse 16, and the 10 horns which thou saw us upon the beast, these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire.  
Starting about the destruction of the war, religion system that will be on at that time.  
There will be one war religion that will be created and that one war religion will be destroyed.  
 You know what?  
Destroyed.  
Thank God, thank God.  
He aimed at another subject here, actually.  
See, because the Antichrist will set up his own structure.  
That's what he would do.  
The organized religion of today, which  
 You know, did you ever hear the term mystery Babylon?  
Many have said it's this group or it's that group or it's this nation or it's that city and so on and so forth.  
That's part of the reason I wouldn't talk much about that here.  
But the truth is, all of that will be destroyed.  
They will destroy themselves and then set up a new one.  
 But in the days of Christ, when He shows up, all of that structure will be destroyed.  
In fact, the Bible says it will be destroyed in an hour.  
That the whole world will wander and say, what?  
Just in one hour?  
Yes, praise God.  
It will be destroyed.  
 But look at this.  
Are you getting ready for Jesus to come?  
When some people hear that Jesus is coming soon, they don't like it.  
They become very sad for the rest of the night.  
You know, afraid to sleep in case he shows up in the night.  
Just straighten up your life.  
That's what you do.  
Just straighten up your life and be ready for in such an hour as you think not the Son of Man coming.  
Hallelujah.  
 Look at the book of Abadiah.  
Now you want to do that?  
You've never read from that book.  
Say what?  
Abadiah.  
Chapter 1 verse 21.  


  
 And Savior shall come up on Mount Zion to judge the Mount of Esau, and the kingdom shall be the Lord's."  
Did you see that?  
Savior shall come up on Mount Zion to judge the Mount of Esau.  
Esau represents the fleshly canon people in the house of God.  
 And the spiritual ones shall rise and they shall judge the Mount of Israel.  
But here's the path that I like.  
He calls them saviors.  
Did you see?  
He didn't say a Savior shall come.  
He says, Savior shall come.  
We have been saved by Jesus Christ and have become saviors.  
He's made us saviors.  
 So He looks up to us to save this world.  
We're saviors.  
Is that to be for you?  
Come on, talk to me.  
Is it too big to accept?  
That you are a savior?  
But He said so.  
On Mount Zion, the Bible says He had come onto Mount Zion.  
See?  
That's the city of the Great King.  
 You are not called to Mount Sinai, where there was judgment and fear, you're called to Mount Sinai.  
And it says, Savior shall come on to Mount Sinai.  
It's you.  
Say, I'm a Savior.  
I was saved to save you.  
Say again, I'm a Savior.  
I was saved to save.  
 Yes.  
God saved you to make you a savior so that you can save others.  
I was safe to save.  
Imagine if you had that mentality 10 years ago.  
Imagine if you had that mentality 20 years ago.  
Imagine if you realized that you were a savior 30 years ago.  
What your life would have been.  
 You're a savior.  
You have a different way of thinking.  
You're a savior.  
How's it all called to you that you are a savior?  
 Does it occur to you that thou art come into the kingdom for such a time as this?  
Are you aware that God raised you up for this moment?  
This is your hour.  
This is your time.  
Don't run away.  
Are you hearing me?  
Don't check responsibilities.  
This is your moment.  
No matter how tough it gets, you are a Savior.  
God has raised you for this hour.  
God has raised you for this time.  
You are a Savior.  
What are you going to do about it?  
 What are you going to do about it?  
I'm a savior.  
 I'm a savior.  
I'm a savior.  
I'm a savior.  
And I tell people, you know, a lot of times the people who are wondering, where do I start from?  
What do I do?  
Number one, look out for a human need and reach out to meet that need.  
That's the way.  
Every savior must do that.  
Every savior thinks, number one, you look out for a human need and you reach out to meet that need.  
That's the number one principle on your journey of success.  
 To become a success for God, that's where you begin.  
Look out for a human need and reach out to meet that need, with the mentality of a Savior.  
There's a difference between being a Savior and being a Messiah.  
 Can I explain the difference?  
There's a difference.  
See, I didn't call you the Messiah because there is one Messiah, okay?  
That Messiah is translated to the Christ.  
They are anointed one.  
But we are part of Him.  
Are you hearing this?  
We are part of Him, yet we recognize who He is.  
He is the Messiah.  
He is the Christ.  
And we are members together with Him.  
He is the head, we are His body.  
 and He has made us saviors, representing Him to the nations of the earth.  
Go ye therefore and teach all nations, hallelujah.  
Are you on the go?  
Are you on the go?  
Are you on the go?  
Yes, think again, think again, think again, think again.  
We had a thing, every tree, a forest.  
 You remember that?  
Every tree a forest.  
Yes, each one of us is a tree of righteousness.  
And each one of us must become a forest.  
They used to say a tree cannot make a forest.  
They were wrong.  
We found out from the Bible they were wrong.  
Why?  
Because what trees of righteousness?  
 and every tree becomes a forest through the anointing.  
Glory to God.  
And God has anointed you.  
Everything you put your hands upon to do must prosper because He has anointed you.  
You are not an ordinary person.  
There's an anointing on your life.  
 When you move, God moves.  
When you move, heaven moves.  
You represent the kingdom of heaven in this world.  
You are not an ordinary person.  
There's an anointing on your life.  
You are filled with the Holy Spirit.  
Come on, shout amen to somebody.  
You're not ordinary.  
 God, I'm anointed.  
I'm anointed to produce results.  
I'm anointed.  
This tree is becoming a forest.  
This tree is becoming a forest.  
This tree is becoming a forest.  
Behold, you are expanding.  
Behold, you are expanding.  
Behold, you are producing results on the left, on the right.  
You are producing results everywhere.  
You are expanding by the anointing of the Spirit of God.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
 Oh, glory to God.  
Don't dare have a sakarabadi.  
Yes, we are strengthened by the Holy Ghost.  
We are strengthened by the Holy Ghost.  
We are strengthened by the Holy Ghost.  
I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 I can do all things.  
I can do all things.  
I'm producing resource for the king in the name of Jesus.  
I'm producing resource.  
I'm producing the works of righteousness.  
Producing the fruits of righteousness.  
Glory to God.  
O hallelujah.  
Coraba sanderamadehi.
