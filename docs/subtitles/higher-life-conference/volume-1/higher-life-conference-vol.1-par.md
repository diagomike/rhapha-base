title: Higher Life Conference Vol.1 Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your secret.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 Hallelujah.  


  
 Imagine it was inside of me worship you When magnifying me You were with your own Don't like it or not so sure I love you as soon as you're near me  
 Praise God.  
How many of you were here last night?  
All right.  
Well, if you weren't here,  


  
 You're here now.  
So get yourself ready.  
You got something good waiting for you.  


  
I told you last night, Christianity is no religion.  
Too many people in the world think it's a religion and you know, they're wrong.  
It's no religion.  
 It's no religion at all.  


  
It's not a way of life.  
You know, some people say it's a nice way of life.  
It's not a way of life.  
Christianity is not a way of life.  
Study your Bible.  
It's not a way of life at all.  
 But it does teach you a way of life.  


  
For itself, it's not a way of life.  
The terrorism was in close to you.  
Christianity is not a way of life.  
It is the life of God in the man.  
In the human being, all right?  
Because when we say in the man, what about the woman?  
 So it is the life of God, you know, human being.  
Thank God, thank God.  
You know, in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 17, the Bible says, if any man, oh glory to God, if any man, anybody, anybody be in Christ,  
 He is, I want you to notice the tenses.  
He is a new creation.  
He is not going to be.  
He is, this is God's declaration.  
This is the sovereign declaration of Almighty God.  
If anyone is in Christ,  
 He is a new creation.  
All things are passed away and all things are become new.  
In fact, it says it in a better way.  
It actually says all things are passed away.  
 Behold, all things have become new.  
And that word, behold, is very important in that verse.  
Maybe we should look at it.  
Can you go into your Bible now?  
Second Corinthians chapter five.  
You know, we're celebrating the Word of God today.  
Amen.  
Hallelujah.  
 We spat to somebody say, I'm a victim in life.  
The word of God has made me a victim.  
Yeah, you gotta have that mentality.  
The word gives us that mentality.  
It's important.  
All right, are you there now?  
Second Corinthians chapter five and verse 17?  
Read it for me.  
One, two, go.  


  
 Did you notice that word behold?  
He means see.  


  
He says, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation.  
All things are passed away.  
See,  
 All things have become new because some don't see it.  
So he says, behold, see, you gotta see it.  
All things have become new.  
He says, see, the cancer is not there anymore.  
See, the sin is not there anymore.  
See, the weakness is not there anymore.  
See, the bondage is not there anymore.  
See, all things have become new.  
See,  
 Some people give their hearts to Christ and go back the same way they came.  
Because they think the problems of yesterday are still there.  
They're looking at the wrong thing.  
They're looking at the wrong thing.  
For example, some of you give your hearts to Christ last night here.  
You're not what you used to be anymore.  
It's got nothing to do with  
 are things I used to do, I do them no more.  
That's not it.  
That's not the point.  
Understand this, there's a difference between righteousness and right living.  
Righteousness and right living, right living, meaning living right.  
 Righteousness and right living are not the same.  
Go to 2nd Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21.  
He had made him to be sinned for us.  
Who knew no sin?  
That's Jesus.  
That we might be made the righteousness of God in him.  
That's wonderful.  
Go to Romans chapter 5.  


  
 Romans 5, verse 1.  
No, no, no, no.  
Hey, are you still there?  
This is important.  
This is important.  
You know, we call them shouting scriptures.  
This is one of those.  
Romans 5, verse 1.  
 Therefore, being what?  
Justified by faith.  
We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
This is a marble.  
He's as being justified by faith.  
Do you know what he's saying?  


  
Let me explain.  
 Before I explain it, let me give you another scripture.  
Go to Romans chapter 4.  
Read from verse 24.  
1, 2, go.  
Mm-hmm.  
25.  
Who was what?  


  
 He was delivered, that means deliver to debts on account of our offenses.  
And what?  
Raised for what?  
Our justification.  
Okay, now with that scripture and the one you read earlier, Romans chapter 5 and 1, let me explain to you what he's talking about.  
Christianity, I told you Christianity is no religion.  
 What we got from Christ is no little thing.  
He says, therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God.  
That means we are at one with God.  
It's like peace between nations that have been reconciled together.  
He says, therefore, being justified by faith, justified.  
What's the mean of justification?  
 It means acquitted.  
It means declared righteous.  
This is not the same thing as forgiveness.  
This is not a pardon.  


  
Declared righteous, justified,  
 You don't really understand Christianity.  
They think that when we say, look at this.  
Come.  
Imagine this man stand here.  
All right?  
Okay, both of you come.  
Assume she was owing him money.  
And so  
 He is demanding payment.  
Then she comes along to pay.  
Come, let's go over there.  
Yeah.  
She pays for her.  
Okay?  
Now, go that way.  
She's not owing anymore.  
All right?  
Why?  
Because she paid for her.  
Is that right?  
 Okay.  
Okay.  
Now, is she justified?  
No.  
No.  
She paid.  
She paid her debt.  
So someone else paid.  
That's not justification.  
She is not acquitted.  
She was guilty.  
Someone else just paid for our offenses.  
That's all.  
That's not justification.  
But that's what many think we got from Jesus.  
 Thank you.  
Let me explain to you now.  
Because the gospel needs to be taught.  
It needs to be explained.  
And also it needs to be preached.  
We preach it to sinners.  
So they hear it, receive faith, and receive salvation.  
But we've got to teach it to the Christian.  
 so he can understand what he has received, what it's all about, and how to live the life that he has now received in Christ Jesus.  
Justification is different.  
What did Jesus accomplish for us?  
Understand this, he says he was delivered to death on account of our offenses and raised from the dead  
 for our justification.  
Oh, that means we didn't get justified from the cross.  
You see now, we were not justified by the payment.  
The payment was on the cross.  
You get it now?  
Christianity didn't come from the cross.  
Hello?  
We are not a result of the cross.  
 This is very important.  
We didn't come from the cross.  
The cross is important.  
There's way the sacrifice was made, but that's not where Christianity comes from.  
The whole world was paid for by Jesus on the cross, but that would have been enough.  
He paid to save us the whole world.  
 That's why he died.  
He died to say the word.  
He died to wash away our sins.  
But you know what?  
That would have not solved the problem.  
We would only have continued sinning.  
He had to do something else.  
Apart from dying, to pay for man sin.  
 The cross was a means to an end.  
The death of Jesus was a means to an end.  
He died to wash away our sins, to make it possible for us to receive eternal life.  
You see it now?  
 So all the time, the death was not what he was pursuing.  
He was looking for something else.  
He was looking for something more lasting than forgiveness of sins, than remission of sins.  
He wanted to make it possible for men to receive eternal life.  
 Now, when Jesus died on the cross, because He was dying for us, we all died on the cross.  
Hey, come on.  
You understand that?  
If He died for us, then we all died.  
So we were on the cross when Jesus was on the cross.  
So when He died, we died.  
When He was buried, we were buried.  
Now, here's the big thing.  
 The Bible declares that God raised him from the dead to declare his righteousness.  
And when he was raised from the dead, we were in him.  
We were raised from the dead together with him, with a new life.  
 And so he says, anyone who is in Christ is a new creation.  
Because you're a new creation, you have no past.  
Can you see it now?  
So you are not the man that was forgiven.  
You were forgiven before death.  
 Can you see that?  
His blood was sacrificed for us on the cross.  
And then he said, it is finished.  
Then he died.  
You see that?  
And that was the end of that phase.  
Our sins were paid for.  
As far as God was concerned,  
 None of us could be held guilty of our sins anymore because the man Jesus paid for everybody.  
And his blood was enough.  
In Acts 13, when you read from verse 38,  
 He says, through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins.  
And by him, all I believe are justified from all things from which it could not be justified by the law of Moses.  
So his blood was adequate.  
It was enough.  
Praise God.  
 But now, he says, anybody who is in Christ is a new creation.  
He's a new creation.  
That's God's declaration.  
He's a new creation.  
When you come to Christ and receive Him as Lord of your life, believing that God raised Him from the dead, you're born again.  
You are now in Christ.  
You're a new man in Christ.  
He says, you're a new creation.  
Listen, you're justified.  
Why?  
 Why justification?  
Because you have no past.  
You are a new creation.  
There's no sin.  
You are acquitted, declared righteous, no sin.  
Because you are a new person.  
This is God's declaration.  
He said so.  
You came from death with Christ when He was raised back to life.  
 When he was raised up, we were raised together with him with this new life.  
Hallelujah.  
Christianity came from the resurrection.  
Didn't you notice how to be saved?  
Listen, Romans 10, verse 9, that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth, the Lord Jesus, believing in your heart that God raised him from the dead, not that he died on the cross.  


  
 See that?  
And of course, how could he have been raised from the dead if he didn't die?  
He had to die to be raised from the dead.  
So if you believe in the resurrection, you automatically must have believed in the dead.  
Hallelujah.  
So the lesser is included in the greater.  
Praise God.  
So we are justified.  
Justified.  
 Wow, justified.  
Justified.  
Justified.  
That makes us, and this is too big for religion, that makes us as righteous as Jesus is righteous.  
Oh yeah, because, hey, the righteousness we have is His righteousness.  
He declared us righteous.  
All right, now that takes me to  
 what I wanted to explain to you.  
When I said, there's a difference between righteousness and right living.  
Now many are struggling to live right.  
And when it's not working, let's say, I don't understand Christianity.  
Yeah, you don't understand Christianity because you're trying to work from outside in.  
You get a word from inside out.  


  
You are made righteous first.  
 And it's not a process.  
You were declared righteous the day you were born again.  
You came into your righteousness when you were born again.  
And that hour you became as righteous as Jesus is.  
And you will never be more righteous than you became the day you were born again.  
You don't grow in righteousness.  
 You have the same righteousness.  
You can grow in the grace of God.  
And in the understanding of that grace, you can grow in the knowledge of God.  
But you can't grow in righteousness because He made you as righteous as Himself.  
Can you see it now?  
Only a righteous man can be expected to live right.  
 Oh, come on, you didn't get that.  
I'm helping you understand the difference between living right and righteousness.  
God will be remiss to expect you to live right if you were not righteous.  
You'd have to be righteous for God to expect you to live right.  
You see, that's why the Old Testament didn't work.  
 because righteous laws of God were given to men who were on righteous.  
And it didn't work.  
So God said, now I'm going to make me a new one and I'm going to put my word in your hearts.  
And that's what it's done.  
So we have His word in our hearts.  
Glory to God.  
 Say this with me.  
Now, if you're born again, this is wonderful.  
You can say it anytime.  
I'm as righteous as Jesus is righteous.  
Because I have His righteousness.  
So I can live right.  
Because right living is the outworking of the inner righteousness.  
That's what it's all about.  
 That's what it is.  
Glory to God.  
All right.  
Moving right along.  
You're still there.  
Glory to God.  
You know how to raise your hand like this and worship the Lord?  
You know how to do that?  
It's very important.  
When we raise our hands like this, it means a lot to God.  
Many don't know it.  
It means a lot to God.  
 It's a celebration of His glory.  
Yeah?  
When you raise your hand to God.  
Hallelujah.  
It means a lot.  
You know, every time you are stared in your spirit, you hear the word God in your spirit.  
And you do that?  
Our hands are so important.  
We think He gave them to us to carry load.  
 and the fixed things.  
So, when we say, you know, a lot of us sing that old song, my hands are blessed.  
There's anything I could... Charlie... It doesn't look like touching things.  
There's more to that.  
My hands are blessed.  
Glory to God.  
No, no, no, look, look at your head.  
Look at it.  
This is an ordinary thing.  
 This is what you raise to the Father.  
Hallelujah.  
Learn to do it.  
Learn to do it.  
You're stared in your spirits.  
You let your hand go up to God.  
You know, in the Old Testament, they offered sacrifices and then they had this incense that they burned to God.  
 And in the book of Revelation talks about the prayers of the saints coming up to God as incense.  
But what in policy?  
How will that all men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands?  
Hallelujah.  
It's better than the Old Testament priest's incense when you raise your hand to God.  
He just raised it?  
 And said, blessed, Lord, I just love you today.  
Do that in your home.  
You'll be amazed at the anointing that you will experience.  
Many don't know how to flow in the supernatural, in the anointing of God, in a consistent manner.  
God doesn't want us moving in and out of it.  
He wants us to be in it and keep experiencing it and growing in it.  
 That's what he wants.  
You know, but for many, they just step into it and come out.  
Every now and then, they step into their knowledge and come out.  
No, we ought to be living in it.  
Hallelujah.  
But learn to do this.  
Do it at home.  
Do it in your office.  
Every now and then, blessed Lord Jesus, I thank you.  
I thank you.  
I thank you.  
I thank you.  
 You would find yourself functioning at another level.  
Another level.  
Something as simple as that.  
As simple as that.  
In Christianity, there are things we do that stay the function.  
Are you listening to this?  
There are things we do that stay the function.  
 Many don't know.  
I told you just now, in Christianity, there is a way of life.  
Christianity itself is not a way of life.  
But in Christianity, there is a way of life.  
It teaches a way of life.  
It shows us how to function in spiritual things.  
Because you see, we belong in a spiritual kingdom.  
So our lives of necessity must therefore be spiritually irrelevant.  
 Glory to God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Why do we speak in other tongues?  
I know there are some Christians who say we shouldn't speak in tongues.  
Some say, well, it's not for everybody.  
There are many Christians who are still asking most every Christian speaking tongues.  
Do you realize no Christian who speaks in tongues ever asks such a question?  
 It's always, it's always the one who doesn't.  
And the only reason he's asking that question is because he's not sure he can.  
If he knew he could, he would ask that question.  
He would rather be asking, how am I gonna do it?  
How can I do it?  
See, most several Christians speaking tongues, let me tell you why, speaking in tongues is important.  
It's not for denominations, it's for Christians.  
 See, there are no words from you as a human being that are holy enough to communicate with the Holy God.  
What do you want to tell someone who knows everything?  
What do you want to tell him?  
No, no, no.  
The Bible says before you open your mouth, God knows your hearts.  
What do you want to tell him?  
 What are you going to say to someone who knows everything?  
And then the words of this word to communicate with a holy God, going through your mind, that mind that has conceived all kinds of evil,  
 You know, when you speak to God like that, you've got a reason what you're going to say to him.  
Mix in all those words that you're presenting to God with this mind of yours that has seen all kinds of wrong things, all the wrong imaginations.  
And are you pretending to God and trying to talk to him and talking to him and doing something for you?  
Who do you really think he is?  
You're getting it now.  
 That's why He gave us divine vocabulary.  
See, the Bible says the one who speaks in an unknown tongue doesn't speak to men but to God.  
And that those words in other tongues don't go through the mind.  
They go from the Spirit  
 The mind doesn't understand them.  
They go straight from the spirits.  
You utter them without reasoning them out.  
They are the cleanest, holiest and most beautiful words to be presented to God.  
Unctioned by the Holy Spirit.  
See why you should speak in tongues?  
 So did you notice when Paul talked about it in 1st Corinthians chapter 14, when you read from verse 13 down to verse 15, he says something, he says, I'll pray with the spirit and I'll pray with the understanding also.  
He didn't say I will pray with the understanding and I'll pray with the spirit also.  
That's the way most of us have it.  
We pray first, O Lord, we thank thee for a beautiful year.  
 Thank you for taking care of our family.  
We just honor you today.  
Then we add a little tongue to it.  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,  
 He says, I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also.  
You see, it's the understanding, not the also.  
Which means praying in your understanding is the lesser type of prayer.  
So you start out your prayer to God, not, oh Lord, no you go, he goes, Cardinal de la Messiah.  
You're with the God.  
 How did I know what I was going to say by listening for my spirit and letting my spirit gain the dominion?  
See it?  
The more you do it, the easier it'll be for you.  
It may stop like that, but don't remain there.  
I mean, five years, you're like, it's not enough.  
 Somebody said, the only way I speak in tongues is, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa  


  
 That's such a thing as the ministry of the Word of God.  
Now, the ministry of the Word of God is not someone ministering the Word like I'm doing now.  
I'm ministering the Word to you, but the Word is ministering right now.  
He sent His Word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction.  
 The word is working in you right now.  
It's working right now.  
And the Bible, Joseph, the word is Shapa, the any doctor's knife.  
Yeah.  


  
 Yeah, since the logos of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword.  
You know what I told you that?  
Maybe you're here and you needed an operation.  
You needed surgery.  
Maybe they needed to cut something out.  
The word of God is cutting it right now.  


  
 It's happening right now.  
Glory to God.  
It's happening right now.  
Che up.  
The word works.  
Yeah.  
It's happening right now.  
See, the word is living and active.  
 Living an active hallelujah.  
It's living an active.  
Caught in out that sign now.  
Glory.  
 So the Word is ministering to you right now.  
Wherever you are, you're listening as I'm sharing with you.  
And the Word is going into your heart.  
And then from there, it locates, oh, the Bible says, all things are open to Him with whom we have to do.  
That is the Word of God.  
All things are revealed to the Word.  
It sees everything.  
Nothing is heat from God.  
Nothing.  
 That's from the Word.  
I tell you, you have to practice enjoying the Word of God.  
Practice it.  
Love it.  
Give yourself to it.  
It will promote you.  
It will keep you in health.  
It will strengthen you.  
It will deliver you into your inheritance.  
That's what the Word will do for you.  
 It'll look at you into that place that God has chosen for you.  
The world will do that for you.  
Guide you.  
Hallelujah.  
To guide you through life.  
This thou will show me the path of life.  
In your presence is foolish.  
At your right hand are pleasures evermore.  
 Glory to God.  
Then you become a wonder to your generation.  
They can't understand why you're the way you are.  
They can't understand it.  
Because the word of God has built you.  
The word has built you.  
The build is strong.  
 And if somebody asks me a question, Pastor Chris, what do we do about the economic problems?  
I said, you should have done something about it before it came.  
See, if you built your faith strong, this wouldn't have shaken you.  
See, shook a lot of people.  
I thought to myself, what were they expecting?  
Were they expecting the world to be a little heaven?  
 No, we make it what we want it to be.  
You make the world a way you want it to be.  
And your life shall not be the pinnacle on what somebody somewhere has decided.  
No, no.  
Your life should be tops in the midst of trouble.  
 You remain untouched.  
Didn't you read the Genoveseo when they came out of Egypt?  
They carried their own atmosphere.  
They did.  
They carried their own atmosphere with them.  
That's why we show you atmosphere for miracles.  
They carried their own atmosphere.  
In the daytime,  
 The presence of God was unto them a pillar of cloud.  
In the night, it was a pillar of fire.  
They were covered.  
The Bible says, the name of the Lord is a strong tower.  
The righteous run it into it and is safe.  
 that thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by knights, nor for the arrow that fly by thee.  
A thousand shall fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand, but it shall not come neither."  
Go to it.  
That's what it says.  
That's what it says.  
Doesn't matter what's happening around you.  
You're different.  
Yeah, yeah.  
Different.  
 Say I'm different.  
Say it again, I'm different.  
Thank you Lord, I'm different.  
Amen.  
All right, so what did we say yesterday?  
You remember?  
The first one was what?  
I said what?  
Contemplate.  
And number two, comprehend.  
In number three,  
 Appreciate in number four.  
Appreciate.  
Oh wow.  
Appreciate.  
Value this thing.  
All right.  
So number five.  
Communicate.  
 Share it!  
Share it!  
Share it!  
You don't believe the gospel until you share it.  
You don't believe it.  
How could you believe it and not talk about it?  
It's not possible.  
You don't believe it until you tell somebody else.  


  
 I've got to share it.  
Don't be looking for somebody to tell.  
How did I get here?  
I'll tell you how I got here.  
Should I tell you how I got here?  
Years ago, I was born again before I was nine years old, all right?  
And listening to the gospel and getting stared in my spirit about this wonderful message of Christ  
 I wanted to tell everybody.  
I went from house to house, preaching the word, talking to people.  
Some opened their doors and I preached to them.  
Some said, get out of here.  
And I got out.  
So I kept preaching it.  
And I wondered, how could I get to everybody?  
Then I, at least there's some of my frames.  
Let's go together so they join me.  
 And some of us went this way and the others the other way.  
And at the close of the day, we got together to share testimonies.  
It was still not enough.  
I went to the hospitals to preach to the sick and pray for them.  
It was still not enough.  
I thought, there's many more.  
I went to the schools.  
 I preached to them in the secondary schools.  
I preached to them.  
I preached to little children.  
Little kids, eight-year-olds, nine-year-olds.  
I'll never forget one meeting I heard.  
A child evangelist was there.  
I was much younger.  
And he was an evangelist, a grown man.  
And he was trained in preaching to children.  
 That's what he schooled for.  
So he invited me to talk to the little kids.  
I came, a large class of little children, eight years and so on.  
And he stood beside me just listening as I talked to the children.  
I shared the word with his little children until the anointing came on them, on the children.  
 the power of God was so strong.  
Little children, when they started worshiping, I turned and evangelist was crying.  
Oh, the Lord was on them.  
I prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit that was speaking in tongues.  
By the time I was through,  
 He hugged me.  
He said, I thought I was an evangelist for children.  
But you are more of that than I am.  
I said, no, it's a power of the Holy Spirit.  
That's what is needed.  
It's a power of the Holy Spirit.  
You want to communicate with any kind of person?  
What you need is the power of the Holy Spirit.  
That's what you need.  
Hallelujah.  
So I kept preaching.  
 And I preached to the older ones while I was a student.  
Preaching to them.  
It was still not enough.  
So I organized crusades.  
I preached in different churches.  
I was invited to preach in different churches.  
And I went preach to them.  
And I said, holding these crusades.  
Evangelical outreaches.  
It was still not enough.  
Not enough.  
 We need to do more.  
We need to do more.  
And then the crowds got larger.  
They're not an increased.  
More had to be done.  
It was still not enough.  
We released books and tapes, not enough.  
So we got on television.  
That's how we got to you.  
On television.  
 Because we had to do it.  


  
And now on the internet as well, and we're on several television stations around the world.  
But you see, there's more to this thing.  
As we preach, you know, we've recorded millions of people live in single meetings.  
 Have you ever seen one million people in one place?  
You know what that means?  
It's an amazing thing.  
Yeah?  
This is by the Holy Ghost.  
But looking around the world and what's happening, we can't just preach  
 and share the message with them on TV, and on the internet, they've got to be discipled.  
You can't bring up a child on the screen, do you understand?  
And that's why churches are necessary.  
That's why meetings like this are necessary.  
A lot has been done.  
 So much has been done, but we've got to disciple them now.  
We've got to bring them in and teach them how to live for Christ 24 hours a day.  


  
So I'm here.  
 in the power of the Holy Ghost, locating those that God's going to use this time.  
And it's going to be you, same man.  
Yeah.  
Because so much needs to be done.  
He says, a quick work will the Lord do, and he'll cut it shut and write just this.  
This is the moment in God's calling you.  
God's calling you.  
 How much does it take?  
How much does it take?  
All he's asking you to do is to make yourself available.  
So Lord, you want to use me.  
I'm ready.  
I'm ready.  
I'm ready.  
I'm ready.  
 I told you, communicate.  
Hey, you gotta share it.  
Tell somebody else.  
That's what we're talking about.  
But you see, for all of these to work, we come to number six, be filled with the spirits.  
Be filled with the spirits.  
 Oh, glory to God.  
Be filled with the spirits.  
I can't overemphasize that.  
It needs to be spoken about all the time.  
Be filled with the spirits.  
Turn the visions chapter five.  


  
Have you seen it?  
Verse 18.  
I want you to read it together.  
One, two, go.  


  
 No, no, no.  
After the word spirit, what punctuation do you have?  
Full stop?  
No.  
Which means it's not over?  
The filled with the spirit?  
What?  
Speaking.  
Speaking.  
Say speaking.  
Right, number one, speaking.  
 Speaking, uh-huh, to your zeros.  
In what?  
Sounds and hems and spiritual sounds, uh-huh.  
Sing in.  
Okay, that's another one.  
Sing in, number two.  
Sing in.  
Number one, speaking.  
Number two, singing.  
Sing in what?  
And making melody in your heart to the Lord, uh-huh.  
Giving thanks.  
Oh, that's number three.  
Write it down.  
 So we got number one, speaking number two, singing number three, giving thanks.  
Giving thanks what?  
Always, uh-huh.  
For all things, the God, uh-huh.  
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, uh-huh.  
Soft meeting, ooh, that's number four.  
Write it down.  
Soft meeting.  
 Submitting, so we got number one, speaking, number two, singing, number three, giving thanks, number four, submitting.  
And then he explains about this submission all the way to the end of the chapter.  
So the four things we do to be filled with the Spirit, number one is speaking.  
He says, speaking to yourselves,  
 The rendering, I know that a few translations have got that scripture a little wrong.  
They said, speaking to one another.  
It's not speaking to one another.  
It's speaking to yourself.  
That means I'm talking to me and you're talking to you.  
That's actually what it's talking about.  
I'm talking to me and you are talking to you.  
Speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,  
 I'm talking to myself.  
The Lord is my light and my salvation.  
Who can shall I fear?  
The Lord is the strength of my life.  
I'm whom shall I be afraid?  
Glory to God.  
See, I'm talking to me.  
He's made me glad.  
He's trained in my life.  
I'm a success.  
I'm talking to me.  
And you better be talking to you.  
 I walk in the light of God, and therefore am I the light of God."  
You see, I'm talking to me, speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.  
See, that's all by myself.  


  
 Singing and making melody in your heart.  
It doesn't have to be melodias to anybody else.  
You just go, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
All by yourself, making melody in your heart.  
Somebody says, what are you singing?  
I'm not singing to you.  


  
 So what are you singing?  
How am I singing to you?  
I'm singing to you.  
I'm singing to you.  
Sing it to me.  
Singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.  
It failed with the Spirit.  
Speaking.  
Singing.  
Giving thanks.  
Giving thanks.  
 Lord, I bless your holy name.  
I give you praise.  
I thank you for your kindness.  
I thank you for promoting me in life.  
I thank you for my health.  
I thank you.  
My Lord, you bless me everywhere.  
Glory to God.  
Isn't that better than blood?  
 Why am I like this?  
Why me?  
Why am I going through the years?  
That's not what he said.  
He says speak unto yourselves in shams and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart.  
Hallelujah.  
 Giving tanks.  
Not complaining.  
Giving tanks.  
Not complaining.  
Giving tanks.  
You will not be failed at the Spirit's complaining.  
Don't complain.  
Oh God, what about my job?  
You're complaining.  
He said, give tanks.  
You want to be failed at the Spirit?  
Give tanks.  
Don't complain.  
I've been asking you.  


  
 No more complaining.  
Hallelujah.  
No more complaining.  
Giving thanks.  
He said, giving thanks always.  
Always.  
Giving thanks.  
And you know when you have a life like this, how many you are born?  
You are fixed for life.  
You have this kind of triumphant life.  
 You could be, you could be, um, pompous.  
And so he says, instead of being pompous, he says, submitting.  
That's number four.  
So you get all this speaking and singing and giving thanks, submitting.  
You get it?  
Uh-huh.  
Submitting.  
 So you, though you are so, so blessed and so blessed, so blessed.  
You come in the church, the archer says, that way, you say, thank you.  
And you go that way, don't say, you know who I am?  
Hallelujah.  
You know, some people don't like it when you say sit over here, then they sit over here and then you come back and say, I'm sorry, can you move back?  
 then they're counting it for you.  
That's two.  
So they move over there.  
They come again and say, I'm very sorry.  
I know I moved you from here to here, but would you mind just moving in there?  
And he says, okay, that's a third one.  
I'm out of here.  
Ellie's out the door.  
No, he says, submitting.  
So you submit.  
That's part of being fair with the spirit.  
You learn to submit.  
You submit.  
 Submission is a joy if you understand the move of the spirits.  
Hallelujah.  
You learn to submit.  
Yeah, it doesn't take anything from you.  
It takes the glory of God to be submissive.  
 Look at Jesus, by the way, he humbled himself unto death, even the death of the cross.  
Wherefore, God also had highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name.  
Why?  
Because he's submitted.  
He's submitted.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
You ready to fly for the Lord?  
We're going to teach the gospel.  
 Preach it and teach it.  
There's a place of preaching it.  
All right?  
Preaching is announcement.  
You announce the gospel.  
There's a place for that.  
And it's important.  
You announce it.  
Well, you know, you gotta understand the gospel to announce it.  
So you know what you announce into them.  
For example, there's some of you, you've been sick for a long time.  
There's really no reason why you're sick.  
 There are medical reasons.  
You know your medical history.  
So you know why you're sick.  
But really, there's nothing wrong with you.  
I'm serious.  
But you don't know it.  
Because nature is like you, environment is like you, the expats are like you.  
So you are there sick.  
Because you believe you're sick.  
When you understand what I'm sharing with you, you will get up.  
Yeah.  
 When you understand, you will work out of that wheelchair.  
You will get out of that bed.  
I'm telling you.  
When you understand what I'm telling you tonight, nothing will hold you back.  
This is a special kind of meeting.  
I told you.  
I told you.  
So you may just be there.  
Same problem that's been holding you bound for years.  
 The bondage has been broken.  
You don't need any prayer.  
This is real.  
You don't need any prayer.  
Just tell yourself in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  
I am free.  
Nothing will stop you.  
Not demon is strong enough to hold you back.  
 When you choose to be well, believe me.  
Believe me.  
Believe me.  
No, a gentleman said to me some time ago, when I said to him, I said, he was talking about demons, troubling him and all of that.  
So I said, are you born again?  
He said, yes.  
Have you received the Holy Spirit?  
He said, yes.  
I said, so what is all this about demons troubling me?  
 So he said, but I can't deliver myself.  
I said, that's your problem.  
He said, Pastor Chris, nobody ever delivered himself.  
Someone else had to deliver him.  
I looked at him.  
I thought, where's your Bible?  
What he said makes sense, but not God's sense.  
 Human sense.  
You don't understand what the gospel is?  
The gospel is no matter how bound you have been.  
Just walk out.  
Walk out of the bones.  
The bones will not hold you back.  
The demons will not stop you.  
The gospel is, here is the emancipation proclamation.  
Come out.  


  
 I'll give you simple examples from the Bible in the 14th chapter of the Book of Acts.  
Paul was preaching at a city called Lystra.  
There was a man on the ground who had never worked, never worked.  
And the Bible says he was listening to Paul as he was preaching the gospel.  
And Paul looked at him and perceived that the man had faith to be healed.  
That means the man gave him attention and was listening to what he was saying.  
What did he do?  
Did he pray for him?  
No.  
He said, man, get up.  
 The man got up no prayer.  
Peter was visiting the brethren and came to the quarters here and found a Christian, a man by the name of Aneas, who had been sick for eight long years.  
In that condition of paralysis, he heard the gospel and believed it, but he was still sick.  
 He was still on the bed until Peter came.  
When Peter got there, he said, Aneas, Jesus Christ makes you well.  
There was no prayer.  
In other words, if you know Jesus, if you believe in Jesus, he makes you well.  
Get up.  
Jesus makes you well.  
He said, get up.  
The Bible says, Aneas, get up.  
 and dressed himself.  
Nobody ever told him that.  
Everybody was saying, oh, we know what you're going through.  
It's been eight long years now.  
Oh, not bitter.  
He said, and they asked, what are you doing here?  
Jesus makes you well.  
Get up and dress your bed.  
Hahaha.  
Alleluia.  
That's what it's all about.  
That's the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
You believe it?  
Get up.  
 Don't be intimidated by the growth of the cancer.  
Don't say, I know it's big.  
The doctor said, I've got one month.  
You've seen the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  
You say, cancer, die.  
And the cancer will die.  
You say, cancer, die.  
Get out of my body.  
Die, bitches, get out.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 Doesn't matter what you're sick of.  
Call it by name and tell it to get out of your body.  
If you brought someone that's sick, this is your moment.  
Tell that sickness to get out.  
Tell it to get out.  
Tell it to get out.  
Tell it to get out.  
Glory to God.  
 You know somebody says, I claim my healing.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
You see, we've been taught wrong.  
I claim my healing, claim my healing from where?  
From who?  
No, sometimes we get these things wrong.  
We don't realize why it's not working.  
I claim my healing from where?  
No, when you want to make a claim, there must be a place where you're making the claim, or from someone.  
So I claim my healing from who?  
 No, who are you claiming it from?  
From the devil?  
He doesn't have it.  
From God?  
He doesn't have it.  
So where?  
I claim my... They are quiet on me now.  
I said, ha ha.  
I claim, claim from where?  
Now I got you where I want you.  
Where are you claiming it from?  
 You don't need to say I claim my healing because you have it.  
You see that?  
It's a devil that's trying to tell you you don't have it.  
Don't tell the devil out.  
Don't try to get your healing.  
You have it.  
It's in you.  
Didn't go out.  
It's there in you.  
The healing power is in you.  
 So you don't claim it from anywhere.  
It's yours.  
You don't need to claim something that belongs to you that's with you.  


  
Tell the devil, match out.  
Ow.  
Ow.  
Hallelujah.  
Never be afraid of the devil.  
Hallelujah.  
 Never be afraid of the devil.  
We are victorious.  
Can you say me?
