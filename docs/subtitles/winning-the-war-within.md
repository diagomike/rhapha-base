title: Winning the War Within
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and he left us with a message to tell the untobes.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and his unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
It's fresh.  
It brings illumination and it's new every day.  
It's the Word of God.  
Build and upgrade your life with the Word of God as you listen to this extraordinary expos√© by Pastor Chris.  
There's a war within and we're not willing  
 and we ought to win the war we think.  
And the simple way to begin that is number one, to act on God's word.  
Study the Bible.  
If you ignore the Bible, you're ignoring solutions.  
This is Pastor Chris Teaching.  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
I want to share something with you that is very important.  
I want to talk to you about  
 winning the war within winning the war within a lot of times there's a battle raging within many times the things that we have to confront are external yes but the also internal  
 challenges that many people face and sometimes pastors and leaders face those challenges.  
How do you deal with these internal battles?  
Yes, you can win the war with him at the times where you find yourself  
 in a kind of conflict, a contradiction between what you read in the Bible, what you've heard preached or taught all your life, and some of the experiences that you have.  
And many times, those who wonder, have I believed the wrong thing, or have I stretched myself  
 too far?  
Is there something wrong with what I have accepted?  
Some other times they think, I believe the right thing.  
I see it in the Bible, but why isn't it going in that direction for me?  
The times it can be financial and within you you're struggling inside, struggling inside.  
 with what you believe versus your experience.  
The first set of things that we are confronted with are fears, doubts and unbelief.  
We find that within us are some fears, sometimes doubts, sometimes unbelief.  
There are times that we are able to recognize unbelief  
 Some other times, we don't even recognize it.  
We don't even know that it's unbelief.  
But there it is working, working against us.  
Have you found yourself in a situation where you were talking bold and nursing fears?  
Ever found yourself in a situation where you doubted yourself, where you doubted your abilities, where you doubted whether God was with you or not,  
 where you doubted your own relationship with God, where you doubted your own knowledge of the Word of God.  
Many times these are things that many of God's children, including leaders, are confronted with.  
There's struggle to be what they think they ought to be.  
Especially when you look at other people and you think, that's fellow's doing fine.  
Why can't I just have fate like this?  
 Why can't I just have a testimony like this?  
Why can't my life just be this way?  
For some, it's easy for other people to notice that you have some internal struggles and they try to talk with you.  
For some others, nobody knows that you're going through such a difficult time.  
 You know, the interesting thing about walking with God is that He has made everything easy.  
The answers to the most complex questions in the world are so easy we ignore them.  
That's the problem.  
We sometimes expect that the complexity of our experience will demand a complicated response.  
Often times it's not so.  
 Often times it's not so.  
It's as easy as calling your name.  
You say, is that possible?  
Emphatically, yes.  
Many times through the years, I've encountered people who had problems, who had challenges, and they wanted a solution.  
 And when I said, the solution is what God's word says.  
Oh, that's not what you wanted.  
Have you ever been there in your life and you wanted God to talk to you?  
You felt that today you want to hear the voice of God.  
God must speak to you today because what you're going through requires that if He loves you, He should show up.  
And then the day passed and He didn't show up.  
Why?  
Because the answer, the voice,  
 The word that you were waiting for was already in the Bible.  
It's amazing how many times we prefer something extraordinary to be God's response to our situation.  
Let me read you the scriptures.  
I'll begin with  
 the very simple teachings of Jesus.  
St.  
Matthew's gospel.  
St.  
Matthew chapter 6, I'm reading to you from verse 25.  
You ready?  
From verse 25.  
He says, therefore I say unto you, now who's talking?  
Jesus.  
And imagine this Jesus presenting very simple answers  
 yet very profound.  
Listen, therefore I say only you take no thought for your life.  
Can you do this?  
Take no thought for your life.  
What you shall eat or what you shall drink, no yet for your body, what you shall put on is not the life more than meat, that is more than food in the body than remit.  
 Behold of fours of the air, for there is so not, neither do they reap no guerain or bands, yet your heavenly Father feed it them, are ye not much better than they?  
Which of you, by taking thought, can add one qubit onto his statue?  
 and why take key thought for amen.  
Consider the lilies of the field.  
How they grow, they toil not, neither do they spin.  
And yet I say only you that even Solomon in all his glory was not a raid like one of his.  
Wherefore, if God so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  
Right there!  
 He hinges that teaching on the subject of faith.  
Why do they care?  
He says, because of their little faith.  
Why are they concerned about everyday things?  
He says, because of their little faith.  
Verse 31, therefore take no thought saying, what shall we eat or what shall we drink?  
Or where we though shall we be clothed?  
Verse 32.  
 for all these things to the Gentiles seek, for your Heavenly Father knoweth that he have need of all these things, but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."  
Look at what he says here.  
Seek ye first the kingdom of God in his righteousness and his righteousness.  
 Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Notice what he just said.  
Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.  
And what will happen?  
All these things shall be added.  
Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.  
How do you seek the kingdom of God?  
 And what did he mean by seeking his righteousness?  
Now, remember, he said one time to them, if they tell you the kingdom of God is coming, it's over there, or it's over there, he says, don't go around.  
For the kingdom of God is within you.  
So he's saying, look inwards.  
Did you get it?  
The kingdom of God is within you.  
So look inwards.  
That's number one.  
 Number two, he says, to seek his righteousness.  
Jesus would never tell you to seek the righteousness of God knowing that it was the gift he made.  
The righteousness that he was going to make us, then he wouldn't tell you  
 to seek it.  
What's Jesus telling you?  
Seek you first, the King of God.  
I just explained that to you.  
In his righteousness, and all other things shall be added on to you.  
Seeking the righteousness of God.  
You know, in our lives, many times we imagine all of us here have become judges.  
Are you aware?  
 We're all judges.  
Yes, positively, because the nodding of God's spirit, coming on you, gives you the ability to judge.  
He's not asking you to judge people, even though he tells us that we have a right in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 to judge matters.  
And we can judge between people.  
But he gives us  
 the ability to judge right from wrong.  
So in this regard, we are judges.  
So is that okay for you now?  
Okay, great.  
But here's the point.  
In judging, what are you looking for?  
And I explain something to them.  
When I have issues between people, I don't look for who's right and who's wrong.  
I learned a long time ago that that's not what God's looking for.  
 And you know, sometimes when we deal with issues like that, not many people are happy because they expected us to siding with them and we didn't.  
And they wanted this other way and we didn't go in that way.  
So they're not happy, they're offended.  
If they're offended like that, they're going to be offended at God also.  
We're not looking for who's right and who's wrong.  
We're looking for the righteousness of God.  
 You see, when you come up to that level in your life and start thinking that way, you believe in a different life, a higher life, where is God?  
Now we see there's a higher life in Christ.  
Why?  
There's a higher life, there's a life that's beyond the ordinary.  
Most people live the ordinary life, and they don't realize there's a higher life in Christ.  
 So you are seeking the righteousness of God in a matter.  
And your responsibility is to establish the righteousness of God everywhere you go.  
It's our job.  
It covers us to do that.  
We seek the righteousness of God anyway and establish the righteousness of God.  
Understand this, the judgments of God are the revelation of His righteousness.  
 Jesus and all these things shall be added onto you.  
What is the righteousness of God?  
The righteousness of God is His position.  
So we take sides with God and we don't take sides with others.  
We take sides with God.  
We take His position.  
We stand in His position.  
We take His position.  
 The righteousness of God is his position.  
What is God's position in the matter?  
What is God's thinking?  
You know, when we talk about someone is a man of God, a man of God doesn't mean a preacher.  
Many times, you know, the people who get this thing wrong.  
A man of God doesn't mean a preacher.  
A man of God is one who establishes the righteousness of God.  
He's one that is called to take sides with God  
 and he declares God's position.  
When you live your life or even walk outside of God's position, there are fears, there are doubts.  
There's where people experience fear.  
Fear cannot take a hold of your spirit until you're outside God's position.  
 What does God think?  
What does He stand?  
See, when you want something, there can be a selfishness to it, right?  
It doesn't matter what you want, whether you want to build a house or you want to go to school or you want to have a kid, whatever it is that you're thinking about, that you want.  
There can be a selfishness to it.  
But have you come to that point in your life  
 where what you want is his position.  
That's the righteousness of God.  
That's what he wants us to seek.  
He says, seek the righteousness of God.  
And you'd be amazed at the quality of your life when that becomes your guiding principle.  
You'd be amazed at the quality of your life.  
It changes you.  
It changes your perception.  
 And you find it's easy to walk by faith because you're functioning from God's position.  
Hallelujah.  
All right, there's another verse for us to read.  
Philippians chapter four, Philippians chapter four, and verse six.  
Verse six, one to go.  


  
 He says, be unsure for nothing, have no anxiety about anything.  
I'll read it to you from the Amplified Translation.  
He says, do not fret or have any anxiety about anything.  
Hallelujah.  
 Do not fret, have no anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance and in everything by prayer and partition, definite request.  
Did you hear that?  
Definite request.  
There are people who make requests, but their requests are not definite.  
Help me Lord.  
Help me Lord.  
Oh Lord, help me.  
Help me.  
How long am I going to be like?  
Help me.  
Help me.  
They're not definite.  
 And you can pray like that for the next 10 years and nothing is going to change.  
Definite requests.  
Definite.  
Definite requests.  
With Thanksgiving.  
 Continue to make your wants known to God in God's peace shall be yours that chunkers state of a So a short of its salvation through Christ and so fearing nothing From God and being content with it's that Lee lot of whatever sought that he is now.  
It's a long verse, huh?  
And not enough punctuitions  
 to make sense of it.  
And so fearing nothing from God and being content with it, et lily lot of whatever thought that is, that peace.  
Speaking Greek now, which transcends all understanding shall garrison in mount guard over your hearts and minds.  
Did you hear what is it?  
God's peace.  
 He says, shall be yours.  
That drunkard state of it, of his soul assured of its salvation through Christ.  
Hallelujah.  
Be careful for nothing, careful for nothing, fretful for nothing, have no anxiety about anything.  
But in everything, did you see that?  
In everything, by prayer and supplication we thanksgiving.  
 Make your request known.  
Make your definite request known.  
Hallelujah.  
I want to ask a question.  
What changes have you made in your personality in the last one year?  
Even if we take in the last two years.  
What changes can you testify to have made in your personality?  
 Is there something positive and definite that you have built into your character or that you got rid of from your character?  
Is it?  
What is it?  
What is that change?  
What definite alteration has taken place in your spirit or in your soul?  
The one in your body is easy.  
It's the one inside that I want to focus on.  
 Tell me something.  
Do you realize you have a responsibility to build in your life?  
Do you know there are people who have not changed in 10 years?  
The same things that offended them then are still offending them now.  
The same people that didn't like in 10 years, that didn't like 10 years ago, they still don't like.  
The same issues they have had in five years are still there.  
They haven't changed.  
They haven't grown.  
 Have they heard more?  
Of course they have.  
They've heard a lot more.  
They have acquired more information, but they haven't acted on the information.  
There's a lot of people who have information.  
I mean, they gather information all the time.  
They write down scriptures.  
They're in the service.  
They're in church.  
They write down everything.  
They get the tapes.  
They listen.  
But they're so used to the voice that it doesn't mean anything to them.  
 doesn't change a thing, doesn't change a thing.  
When the crowd starts Jesus, everybody was touching him, and then until someone touched him with faith.  
And he said, who touched me?  
And the Sabbath said, everyone's touching you.  
They were so used to touching him.  
It made no difference.  
They knew nothing was supposed to happen when they touched him.  
They are touched in many times.  
And the disciples were surprised.  
Why is the master talking about somebody touching him?  
Who'd been touching him?  
Nothing happened.  
And Jesus said, somebody touched me.  
 There was a touch of faith that made the difference.  
You see, one of the reasons that many people don't change is they don't expect to change.  
They don't change because they don't expect to change.  
There's several things that I've done in my life as an individual and one of them is making definite changes.  
I believe in making changes.  
 I believe that I can, I can introduce something into my life and make a definite change.  
I believe that God's word was given to me to effect changes.  
So I apply the word for changes.  
I make changes.  
I'm not talking about a change for a week and you go back.  
I'm talking about permanent changes, changes.  
 To affect one's personality, that has been my approach to the Word of God.  
I believe I can acquire faith with the Word.  
I believe that I can replace unbelief, fear and doubt with faith and confidence and fearlessness.  
 And so, when I study the word, I do that.  
This is something that it's my way of life.  
I see that God's word was given to us as a creative material.  
What do you want?  
You can use the word of God to make it happen.  
You can use the word of God to make it happen.  
Make it happen.  
Use the word to make it happen.  
He told us.  
 in very simple terms.  
He said, faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.  
So we know faith can come to us by hearing the Word.  
If that's true, how then do you increase your faith?  
The disciples said to the Lord, Master, increase our faith.  
He taught them about forgiveness.  
He taught them about forgiveness.  
 and that troubled them.  
And they said, Master, increase our faith.  
And then he said, you got all the faith you need.  
He said, if you have faith as a grain of what's that seed?  
He said, you will say to this sicker man tree, be plucked up from the roots, plucked up from the roots and casts into the sea.  
He said, it should obey you.  
It should obey you.  
And it's interesting that Jesus said, it should obey you.  
He didn't say it will obey you.  
He said, it should obey you.  
 Because sometimes some people find it didn't happen.  
He's saying, this is the normal thing that should happen.  
It should happen.  
So if it doesn't happen, find out why.  
He said it should obey you.  
Which means the law of the spirit is that it should happen.  
Now if it doesn't happen, find out where you breached the law.  
Did you breach it?  
You probably did.  
You probably did.  
 He said, all the faith you need is that seed of faith as a grain, as a grain of mustard seed.  
And that means the very faith that he dealt to us at salvation, that God had dealt to every one of us, the measure of faith.  
That's the faith that you need.  
So you have the faith that you require.  
OK.  
Maybe it's not the second century you want to cast out.  
You want to cast out your own country.  
 You see, your problem is a big one.  
He said, you will say to this mountain, move from here to there.  
Praise God.  
But you see, what we do with the seed of faith that it gives to us is what matters.  
What do you do to that seed of faith?  
 You know, one time I was thinking, I need to increase my faith.  
Then I said, increasing my faith is studying more of the word and putting the word to work.  
So I said, that's easy for me.  
I'm gonna do that.  
I said, but if I increase it, I have to put it to work.  
Then I said, okay, I went back to reading how to make your faith work.  
Ready, ready, ready.  
Then I'm making my faith work.  
Glory to God, I'm making my faith work.  
Because I gotta make my faith work.  
 It's not enough to have faith.  
I've got to make my faith work.  
What life do you want to live?  
You don't make your faith work?  
He said, faith comes by hearing.  
Faith comes by hearing.  
Since you need more faith,  
 for what you want to do.  
Why don't you make fate come?  
He told you how to simply make fate come.  
Is this by hearing?  
So make the fate come.  
How?  
By hearing.  
You are not hearing.  
If you just put the tape on there or the CD there or the DVD on and you're running around everything else, doing everything else, you are not ready.  
That's, you know, that's just creating a nice atmosphere.  
 In an atmosphere of miracles, it doesn't mean everybody gets it.  
So you can create a nice atmosphere by playing Christian music, by playing a message.  
That's good.  
It's nice.  
You're creating a faith atmosphere.  
It doesn't mean that anything is happening with you.  
If you are going to get faith into your spirit, you're going to have to have a hunger for it.  
You're going to have to listen with your spirit.  
 You're going to listen with your spirits.  
You're going to subdue yourself to listen.  
Someone said, I was going through some difficulties.  
I listened to tips.  
I listened to you were not listening.  
You can't listen and come back and say, I listen and listen.  
And so actually, I don't know if there's anything more I'm supposed to do.  
You're not ready.  
I've been listening.  
You're listening.  
 Didn't you hear what God said?  
Faith comes by hearing.  
If you were hearing, faith would come.  
It isn't if it comes by listening.  
It's by hearing.  
Did you hear it?  
No, you didn't hear it.  
Because if you heard it, faith would come.  
You were listening, but you didn't hear it.  
You didn't hear it.  
If you heard it, faith would come.  
I can tell, I can tell, I can tell the life that people live by the outcome.  
It's very simple.  
 The life that God's given to us is not mysterious.  
He gave us in his word what he expects.  
He let us know what our responsibilities are, our roles, and what his own role is.  
And then he also let us know what to expect.  
So if you're seeing something different, chances are you're doing something else.  
It's pretty easy.  
 So you look at one's life and you can tell by the outcome.  
Hey, do you find con, con seeds in a mango tree?  
You don't.  
You don't find, you don't find oranges on a tree that's supposed to produce beer.  
You don't.  
Wherefore, by their fruits is your note, by the outcome.  
 by the outcome, by the outcome.  
So in the last one year, what has changed about you?  
What has changed?  
What has changed?  
Are you growing?  
Oh, is life just moving you?  
You know, there are people who  
 They grow by just merely eating.  
They don't eat constructively.  
You understand?  
They just eat anything.  
And so the body just keeps growing, okay?  
So they keep growing.  
So they just discover that they are now like this, okay?  
Whatever size they are now at, they found out there wasn't any plan to it.  
They just got there.  
So spiritually, the same thing.  
You have people who just got to where they are without any design.  
There's no design.  
 So they are where they are without a design.  
And so the next few years, they're going to just go without a design.  
So their life is undesired.  
And they wonder why things go the way they do when your life has no plan.  
Hallelujah.  
You know, I can imagine.  
 I can imagine what kind of a house you're going to build if you got all the materials to the site and just got to work as working.  
So build a house, come on quick, start, start, start.  
OK, you start digging foundation.  
Start now.  
Start building pillars.  
Quick, quick, quick, quick.  
What about you?  
Start with the doors.  
Right?  
What kind of a house?  
That's going to be all of you there.  
You're working on the roof.  
Start now.  
 It will never be a house.  
If it turns out to be a house, it's gonna be a terrible one.  
Your life is a house.  
Your life is a building.  
What kind of a house is your life?  
What kind of a house is your life?  
What kind of a house is your life?  
Jesus is in my father's house on many mansions, many dwelling places.  
 Which means that each one of us really can build a house.  
Our life is a house.  
You see that?  
Think about it like this.  
Leadership is influence.  
Okay?  
Leadership is influence.  
It's influencing the decisions of other people.  
That's leadership.  
Influence in the decisions of other people.  
 you influence decisions of other people, you influence their actions.  
That's leadership.  
Imagine that you are influencing the decisions of other people and your life has no design.  
You know, that's why a lot of people have their lives messed up because they're influenced by others whose lives had no design.  
Then there are those who have their lives designed  
 for the wrong time, in the wrong direction.  
Because you have the designed life, and then you have a life, even with the designed life, one is designed rightly for something good, one is a bad one, designed for something terrible, then the one without a design.  
I always wanted my life to have a meaning.  
To have a meaning, did you get it?  
To have a meaning, not just live, but to have a meaning.  
 God said to Abraham, very simple.  
He said to Abraham, I'll bless you and I'll make you a blessing.  
And through you shall all the families of the earth be blessed.  
God was going to give this man's life a meaning and he in turn was going to give the lives of others a meaning.  
They're not going to live for nothing.  
They're going to live  
 a life of influence.  
They're going to influence the actions of other people to do what is right.  
They're going to influence the judgments of other people, and they're going to influence those people to live according to God's design.  
Now, the design manual is right here.  
This is the Bible.  
He says something very beautiful.  
I'd like to read it to you.  
 You ready for it?  
Second Timothy chapter number three, and I want to read to you from verse 16.  
This is wonderful.  
Oh, I like it.  
Ready?  
Our Scripture is given by inspiration of God.  
 And it's profitable.  
That means it gives you the advantage.  
It's profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness.  
It doesn't matter how poor somebody is.  
If you listen to me for long enough, you become rich.  
Yeah.  
It doesn't matter how wayward someone is.  
If you listen to me for long enough, he'll straighten out.  
 And he become excellent.  
If I sat with a dummy, with a fool, and the fool listened to me, he become wise.  
Why?  
Not because I got the material here, because it's in here.  
Spirit talks to Spirit.  
You see it?  
If you listen.  
 There are too many people living their lives without direction.  
Just going even in ministry.  
Even pastors.  
They're pastors who are in ministry.  
No direction.  
They're just going.  
No, don't let it happen to you.  
It may have happened for a long while.  
You can change it.  
You can change it.  
Stop in your tracks.  
Ask yourself, hey, where are you going?  
 Where?  
Where are you going?  
Where are you going?  
Well, I was still a student in school.  
I was saying, I'm going to change this word.  
I didn't know how big the word was.  
But I was talking like that.  
What many years have come and gone, I still think the same way.  
I still think like that.  
I look back and I say, wow, it was not a mistake.  
 He was in your spirit.  
He says, the scripture or scripture is given by inspiration of God in his profitable for doctrine, for doctrine.  
What is the doctrine for?  
What is the doctrine for?  
To change your opinions.  
Inductory needs you to change your opinions, to change your thinking.  
 Can you see it?  
God wants to change your opinions.  
He wants to change your thinking.  
 Listen, and this is so important.  
God wants to change your opinion about himself, about other people, about the word, and about the word around you, about everything, about life.  
He wants to change your opinion.  
He wants to give you a way of thinking.  
The question is, have you imbibed that way of thinking that God has given to you?  
 If you had fears in your life, God wants to change your fears.  
You see that?  
He wants to change your fears.  
He says, it's profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction.  
If you were gone in the wrong direction, he has given the scripture.  
He says, our scripture is given by inspiration of God.  
That means God, God breathes it.  
It's coming from him.  
It's coming from God.  
It's inspirational.  
 And it has the ability.  
It's profitable.  
It works.  
It works for doctrine, for reproof, for correction.  
So he seeks to change your mind.  
He seeks to change the way you reason.  
He seeks to change it.  
 That's why I said to you, one whole year, can you point at something in your life, a change that you have made?  
Can you look at your life and say, this one year, I agree like this, I added this to my life, I put this quality into my life, or you can tell, you can tell anything, whether you've adjusted in your life,  
 Other things you can pick in your life and say, I used to be like this and I'm not like this anymore.  
I do like this now.  
This used to happen to me.  
It don't happen anymore.  
What change have you brought into your life?  
Or the same things I used to press you in the night when you were in your sleep five years ago.  
I didn't see pressing you.  
Or the infirmity that you were suffering three years ago.  
Is it still there?  
 It's amazing how we carry some things on in life and just act like they're not there, but they are there and they trouble us.  
Then we just go on, we just go on.  
Realizing that we're not living a life of victory, but a life of defeat.  
So, or shamed, we think there's a war we think that we're not winning.  
 and we ought to win the war we think.  
And the simple way to begin that is number one, to act on God's word.  
Study the Bible, study the Bible.  
If you ignore the Bible, you are ignoring solutions.  
You are ignoring answers.  
Understand it.  
If you ignore the Bible, you are ignoring the solutions that God has given you.  
You are ignoring the answers that God has given you.  
You are ignoring ability.  
You are ignoring empowerment.  
 Knowledge empowers you.  
And what is going to happen to you in the evil day?  
What will happen when that evil day comes?  
The Bible tells you about the evil day.  
It's not every day that that evil day is.  
The Bible does say that the days are evil, but that's not what he was describing when he talked about the evil day.  
It just means the influence  
 of each day in the world is satanic and God expects us to master every day.  
But then he talks about the evil day.  
And that evil day that he talks to us about, in the vision of the sixth chapter, for which reason he tells us to put on the whole armor of God, the whole armor.  
He didn't say when something happens quickly, collect the armor on words.  
No, you put on the whole armor of God.  
Always, always.  
 so that when that evil day comes, you will win.  
You know, that evil day came for some people and they lost.  
And when something happens, we start asking our zeroes, we don't understand.  
How could that have happened?  
How did that happen to so-and-so?  
How could it have happened?  
Well, the evil day came and it was not prepared.  
But we were warned about it in the Bible.  
Maybe we should read it.  
Ephesians chapter 6.  
 You know, we can sing Abraham's blessings, am I?  
I'm blessed in morning, blessed in evening.  
But there's an evil day.  
Hallelujah.  
And when that evil day comes, it doesn't change the blessing, does it?  
No, it doesn't change it.  
It's how we respond.  
 Okay, he says, finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.  
Put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand against the wires, the stratagems of the devil.  
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world.  
Think about that.  
Against the rulers of the darkness of this world.  
 mama mama he didn't say against spirits of darkness of this world even though they are spirits of darkness of this world he's telling you the the rank the class of spirits the class of spirits he says against the rulers of the darkness of this world they listen to the next term  
 against spiritual wickedness in the heavenly realms.  
In the earth realm, we are dealing with the rulers of the darkness of this world.  
In the heavenly realms, we are dealing with spiritual wickedness, only to be restrained by the power of God.  
These are the forces.  
 that we are really against.  
And with all these forces, you are standing there talking about your brother wrongly.  
Your badmouting, your brother, your badmouting, your sister in Christ.  
Badmouting another pastor, or badmouting the dickiness.  
You don't have time for that.  
Look at your adversaries.  
See how desperate your adversaries are.  
If you heard something about a pastor, a brother, or a sister, what would you do?  
 He does see it.  
Because look at what they are read against.  
He says, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood.  
Hallelujah.  
 Okay, back to Ephesians chapter number six.  
Verse 11, put on the whole armor of God that he may be able to stand against the wires of the devil, for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.  
We are full.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
We are full.  
 Take on to you the whole armor of God that she may be able to withstand.  
That she may be able to withstand.  
Hi.  
That means to resist, to resist, to stand your ground.  
If something happens, will you so come to fear?  
 Will you so come to fear?  
Listen, I want you to listen to the word again.  
Oh, Sakela, I'm God, I'll skip ahead.  
Listen.  
We therefore take on to you the whole armor of God, and we stand.  
We therefore take on to you the whole armor of God.  
Try and we stand.  
 He says, take on to you the whole armor of God that he may be able.  


  
You know, he is saying to you, do something that will produce the results.  
He's saying take on the whole armor of God.  
He didn't say when you take on the armor, then you will stand.  
He didn't say make an effort.  
He says, the ability will come.  
 when you take on the whole ammo, that he may be able.  
Without that, you are unable.  
Now, you want to be able.  
He says, this is what you do to be able.  
This is what you do to be able.  
Oh, I want to jump, and I try.  
I didn't go high enough.  
They said, that's the bar.  
You're going to have to jump, and I'm going to try again.  
Oh, it didn't work.  
So somebody comes and says, pasto.  
 wear these spring shoes, wear them.  
When you wear them, you will be able to jump very high.  
The shoes will make you able to jump very high.  
Then I wear the spring shoes and I find myself going like that.  
Oh, my goodness, without even an effort.  
Then I go, whoops.  
And I'm going, oh, the shoes, the spring shoes make me able.  
 He knew I couldn't do it.  
So he said, where these shoes?  
They will make you able.  
Are you getting it now?  
That she may be able to withstand Ayaka Pacifici rather by my body.  
What will you do in the evil day?  


  
 in the evil day.  
Ah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah.  
What will you do?  
Will it be a testimony?  
Cabarabas, se kite le mama, maya.  
What will you do?  
Evil day is not just one particular calendar day in the whole life.  
No.  
 It comes at different points in life.  
It comes at different points in life.  
You have already met some in which you want.  
Yes.  
You already met some in which you want.  
Let me read it.  
He says, wait for take on to you the whole armor of God that he may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all.  
 Having done all to stand.  
And then your story, it came to pass.  
It came to pass.  
Enrich the body of Christ.  
That's what your life should do.  
Your life enriched the body of Christ.  
When we read, we read of Moses.  
We read of Joshua.  
We read of these great men of God.  
But the testimonies are not ended.  
 Now the church is enriched, having done all to stand.  
He says that he may be able, that he may be able.  
I'm convinced that the Word of God has everything that we need to put us over in life.  
It doesn't matter what we face.  
I hear him.  
 It doesn't matter what we face.  
The Word of God has everything that we require to put us over in life.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
We'll read another scripture.  
You ready?  
I want you to go to the book of James.  
Hallelujah.  
 In James chapter 1, when we read from the 12th verse, it tells us something.  
I want us to take a look at it.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Blessed is the man that endured temptation.  
Say hallelujah.  
He didn't say blessed is a man that does not have any temptation.  
No.  
 Blessed is the man that endures temptation, for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.  
Say it with me, blessed is the man that endures temptation.  
Listen, if you've been pushed against the wall, you are blessed.  
 When temptation comes to try you.  
Don't think that some evil thing has happened to you.  
Your situation is not unique.  
No.  
It's what we're all exposed to in the body of Christ.  
Now he says it's a blessing.  
Blessed is the man that endured temptation.  
 And direct, that means it's going on over a period of time.  
It can come in different ways.  
Blessed is the man that endured temptation for when he's tried, he shall receive the crown of life.  
When he's tried like gold, when he's poofed, he shall receive a crown of life.  
Hallelujah.  
 which the Lord had promised to thank him, but love him, let no man say when he is tempted.  
I am tempted of God.  
For God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempted he any man, but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lost and enticed.  
Then when lost that conceives, he bring it for sin, and sin when it is finished, bring it for debt.  
Do not A my beloved brethren.  
Can you see that?  
Do not A my beloved brethren.  
 He says, every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own laws and enticed.  
How many people who were called into the ministry were enticed by worldly things and didn't fulfill the ministry and went away?  
There are different kinds of things that people crave for.  
And there are cravings cost them to make a detour.  
 and go after the wrong things in life.  
Have you been tempted to find alternatives to your faith?  
Have you been tempted to look for another way out?  
I'm talking about the war within.  
Sometimes you're going through pressures and you're thinking in your life, could this other thing be a solution?  
 Could this other way be a solution?  
And at that time, use that same people who tried all the alternatives that produce one result or the other.  
Now they're all bringing their stories to you.  
And you're wondering, what shall I do?  
What shall I do?  


  
 Blessed is the man that endurance tempts him for when he is tried, when he is proved, he shall receive the crown of life.  
Hallelujah.  
Let me read you another scripture.  
First Corinthians.  


  
Chapter 10.  
 Have you found it?  
Read verse 13.  
They had no temptation taken you, but such as his command to man.  
Hallelujah.  
As a geo-condition is not unique.  
It has happened before.  
Are you hearing me kabar abandeges?  
Ah!  
Glory to God!  
 Your situation is not unique.  
God is not facing a new thing.  
Are you hearing me?  
God has not found himself in your case in a new situation that he doesn't know what to do.  
No.  
They had no temptation taken you, but such as his common demand.  
But God is faithful.  
 who will not suffer you permit you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape.  
Brother, there's a way of escape.  
There's a way of escape.  
There's a testimony waiting for you.  


  
 But will weak the temptation also make a way to escape that he may be able to beat?  
That means to endure it.  
So no matter what you're experiencing, no matter what you're going through, make up your mind.  
You're going to go to the testimony way.  
You're coming through this thing.  
 in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
You're coming through this day by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You're coming through this day.  
It doesn't matter for how long it's been.  
That's why you listen to messages like this, because this tear your face against hope, I believe in hope.  
The Bible says of Abraham, he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith.  
 Giving glory to them.  
Hallelujah.  
Say, I'm going to give glory to God in my life.  
My life is for the glory of God.  
I'm making progress.  
I'm moving forward from glory to glory.  
My path has a shining light.  
Shining brighter and brighter.  
On to the perfect day.  
I'm getting greater by the day.  
 More influential by the day.  
Hallelujah.  
More glorious.  
Hallelujah.  
Speaking at the top.  
Bring the Holy Ghost.  
Speaking at the top.  
Go ahead and bring the Holy Ghost.
