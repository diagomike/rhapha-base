title: Prayer of Intercession Part 2
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
I have with me on the set today, Pastor K. Additional, who is the Secretary General of Believers' Love World.  
As a K.O.  
Welcome.  
Good to have you here on the set.  
 This is a month of prayer, and why must we pray for Christians?  
After all, the Bible says that God is with them already.  
So why do we have to pray for them?  
Yes, sir.  
Thank you for your opportunity, sir.  
Thank you.  
The process that they call to prayer is what Jesus Christ himself showed us by example.  
 He said, men ought always to pray and not to give up.  
And so you have taught us that the real sense of prayer is fellowship.  
And that's what Jesus came to accomplish, to bring us into union, into fellowship with the Father.  
A lot of people always, when they think about prayer, they always look at it as if it's really quest.  
 It's not really a request.  
It's actually what is in the heart of the father to our fellowship with us.  
So when we understand that that's going on our knees, having a fellowship with the father is the best thing that can happen to a man.  
Then we're taking it further.  
God always also wants us to stand in God for  
 for our nation, for the people that are around us, for law source.  
And that's what you've been taking notes through this this month.  
It's been really, very exciting.  
I participated this morning.  
When I saw the prayer post, that's what we're praying about, about people dying difficulties.  
Your core to me are importantities when you say we should pray.  
 You know, sometimes it is not even people that are directly connected to us.  
But our prayers really make a lot of power available.  
So I was glad when I saw that, and I saw that we were praying for people that had difficulty, people that faced the challenges.  
And so God called us to pray us.  
And it's our duty as believers to year to the core.  
Wonderful.  
Thank you, sir.  
Thank you, thank you.  
 Markable in it.  
If you look at the theme scripture that we used in Ephesians chapter 6 from verse 18,  


  
 He says, Prayin always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching their own two with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.  
And we said, all he is referring to different kinds of prayer.  
He says, Prayin always with all manner of prayer, all kinds of prayer.  
King James says, all prayer.  
He's referring to all manner  
 and the teachings of the scripture show us that there are different kinds of pride and we listed some of them in our last discussion.  
Now, one of these we said is the prayer of inner session and we're breaking these into different parts.  
The first one we began to take, like I said, we're praying for our nation because Paul the apostle in writing to Timothy said, first of all,  
 pray for kings, leaders, for those in authority.  
So, that's the way you begin praying for your nation.  
You're not just praying for the land.  
It's not the land mass.  
Say, it's not the location.  
The leaders to begin with.  
And leaders are at different levels of society.  
 And then we said the other one, spraying for the saints.  
And the best outline for that you'd find in Scripture.  
Now let's look at these verses.  
Ephesians chapter 1 from verse 15.  
I want to read from verse 15 to 20.  
 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love on all the sins, cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers.  
Now notice this is you and what I mean you, if you read from the first verse of this first chapter,  
 Read from verse one, you'd notice his writing to the brethren, the saints at Ephesus.  
So he's talking about the saints.  
So that's referring to us.  
So he says, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, this is the content of his prayer, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory may give on to you, grant you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.  
 See, that's in knowing God.  
Now, let me read that to you from the Amplified Translation.  
He says, and there's something in parentheses here that's quite instructive.  
He says, for I always pray to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, I always pray.  
If you notice in many languages, the continuous term,  
 seems to indicate an always particle.  
See, when you say, I do this, the always particle seems to suggest  
 that this is something you do all the time.  
Like every time you're going to do it, you're going to do it this way.  
So he says, for I always pray to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that he may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation.  
 Then he breaks that down here to say of insight into mysteries and secrets.  
When you're praying for Christians, you're praying that the Lord will grant them insight into mysteries and secrets.  
There's so many Christians that have no understanding of spiritual realities.  
Their minds have not been opened to that.  
A lot of times because of the environment, whether we're brought up, the churches that they have been in, possibly the leaders, the pastors don't even know  
 So they're ignorant.  
And so we've got to be in a seat for them that the Lord will grant them this.  
Now, notice he guides us to pray.  
Remember, you know, I'll ask you the question, why do we have to pray for Christians?  
Even though everything belongs to them.  
It's important for us to understand.  
Like Master K said, Jesus gave us an example of prayer.  
He prayed.  
Why did Jesus have to pray?  
He said, men are always to pray.  
 Men are always to pray.  
The Bible says that Jesus found himself in fashion as a man.  
And so he humbled himself, even unto death.  
See, being found in fashion as a man.  
In other words, since he found himself in the nature of a man.  
So Jesus knew that he was in that nature of a man, even though he was himself God.  
So he prayed because he was a man.  
 Even though he was God, he was born into this world as a man.  
And he says, men are always to pray.  
So men must pray, because true prayer, they are in that fellowship, in that relationship, in that communication with God.  
And that's the actual definition of prayer.  
It's a communication.  
Every communication with God is a prayer.  
So prayer is not just a request.  
Requesting prayer is just one type of prayer.  
 prayer of worship is no request.  
So here he tells us, I always pray, this is part of the apostle, I always pray to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that he may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation, because they are men, say human beings, these people that's praying for, they are in a state  
 of immaturity at this time of their lives.  
And so he's asking that the Lord will grant them a spirit of wisdom.  
Did you notice he didn't say, I always pray that God will grant us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him?  
He didn't say us.  
He said, I'm praying for you.  
I'm praying for you.  
So one is supposed to continually pray this prayer for us.  
 No, no, no.  
We're praying for other Christians.  
We're praying for other Christians until they come to that stage of maturity.  
Now, look at it.  
See, I always pray to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation, which means insight into mysteries and secrets, in the deep and intimate knowledge of Him, in the deep and intimate knowledge, which means there is a certain kind of knowledge  
 that God's people should have, a deep and intimate knowledge.  
You have to be brought to that level.  
All that God will grant you a spirit of insight into mysteries and secrets.  
What a day that would be.  
For so many Christians, when you come to understand that,  
 And I shared this with you.  
But many years ago, I needed this.  
I needed an understanding of this.  
I needed to be brought into this level.  
And now I understand much more than I did back then.  
Say, which means that I'm coming into that knowledge in a greater, in greater way?  
Because we get to know Him more and more and more.  
And you can look God much more than where you are today.  
 And think about all those other questions around you and those who may be far away from you, but they haven't received this knowledge.  
And he tells us to pray for them.  
 that the Lord would grant them a spirit of wisdom, of insight into mysteries and secrets, in the deep and intimate knowledge of you, in the deep and intimate knowledge of you.  
Then he goes on in the 18th verse, the King James Version says, the eyes of your understanding, being enlightened, meaning flooded with light, that you may know  
 This is beautiful.  
What is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints?  
And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward?  
Who believed according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places?  
Amazing.  
Really amazing.  
 Look at it.  
I'm going to read that to you from, again, the Amplified Translation.  
He says,  


  
 you can know and understand the hope to which has caused you.  
And our rich is as glorious inheritance in the saints.  
Look at it.  
You're praying for other Christians.  
And you're praying like this, that the Lord will grant them.  
He's showing you how to pray.  
You know, some Christians, you know, when we say pray for other Christians, they say, Father bless them in the name of Jesus.  
That's not the way to pray.  
 That's not the way to pray for other Christians.  
Oh God, bless them.  
Oh God, bless them.  
That's not the way to pray.  
This is the best kind of prayer.  
This is the way to pray for them.  
There are standards in the things of God.  
There are standards in the Word of God.  
And that's exactly what we're sharing with you.  
So you study this part and you have a beautiful outline of prayer.  
You can just put their names in there when you pray.  
 You pray for these Christians, whether it's a holy church, it's a group of friends, some of your friends who just care less about the things of God, sometimes so carnal.  
They just don't care about things of God.  
You pray for them like this.  
And the Lord will grant them the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of God.  
That their eyes, the eyes of their understanding will be enlightened.  
 say that they'll be brought into our knowledge.  
Look at this, that they may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.  
And then he's praying that he'll come to a knowledge of the power of God that's directed to it us.  
Because some Christians don't know that God's power is directed to it us.  
They're still living in fear.  
They're still intimidated.  
So many things happen in their lives.  
They're scared.  
Look at this.  
 And what is the exceeding greatness?  
He wants him to know the exceeding greatness of God's power to usward who believe.  
According, it tells you that this power is according to the working of God's mighty power, which he demonstrated when he raised Christ Jesus from the dead.  
How powerful that was.  
No demon of darkness could stop.  
All the devils of hell couldn't stop it.  
Jesus was raised from the dead.  
Amazing.  
 Now, here's another part.  
And if you'd go to chapter three, book of the visions, Stephen Simbuk, chapter three, verse 14.  
 For this course, I bow my knees onto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant to you.  
They get it again.  
He didn't say that he would grant us because he's granted us.  
Look, some of us have come to that knowledge.  
For example, the Bible says that Jesus Christ has been made unto us wisdom from God.  
 And yet, James says, if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, why would anybody lack something that God's granted every one of us?  
He's looking at their stage, their level of development.  
They're still at the level, they haven't understood how to walk in the wisdom that Christ is to.  
 Let's not remember what Peter said.  
That everything that is good for life and godliness has been granted as in Christ.  
It's all things that pertain unto life and godliness.  
Granted to us, policies, all things are yours.  
That's amazing.  
And then the Bible says what John airs with Christ, which means at the higher levels of Christianity,  
 You discover there's nothing in the world that you already need of.  
You got everything.  
Nothing you like.  
Nothing, absolutely nothing.  
In Christ Jesus, all that belongs to God belongs to you.  
Really.  
But you see, in our daily life, there's so many who are not experiencing that.  
There's so many who don't understand that.  
 There's so many who are unable to apply that to themselves.  
It's still a mystery to them.  
They're saying, how can I understand this?  
So he's saying that we pray for them, that God will grant them insight into mysteries and secrets.  
And open the eyes of their understanding, spiritual understanding.  
All right, so I'm going to read this opportunity.  
 So go again, verse 14, for this course I bow my knees unto the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he'll grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in a man.  
 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.  
Did you notice that?  
That Christ may dwell in your heart by faith.  
Doesn't he already live in you?  
He sure does.  
But not many Christians realize that Christ actually is at home in them.  
They don't know that.  
They think it's a religious talk.  
From day one, when you came to Christ, you said you received Jesus.  
If I said to you, have you received Christ?  
Oh, you'd say yes.  
 Does it live in you?  
Do you see?  
Yes.  
But do you have the consciousness that he's alive and functioning in every fiber of your being, every bone of your body, every cell of your blood?  
Do you realize that?  
He's in your spirit, soul and body?  
The Bible tells us that the body, our body is the temple of the Holy Ghost.  
Did you know that?  
Now, not many Christians walk in that consciousness.  
They're not in consciousness of it.  
 And if you're not in consciousness of it, you can't apply it in your life.  
You can apply that divine life.  
Look at it this way.  
The many of you who speak more than one language, you speak English language, then you speak another dialect, maybe some native dialect, maybe Nigerian language, maybe some French language or something, whatever it is.  
You have some other language that you may be speaking.  
 and you speak English.  
So every time you're talking to somebody who who understands English, you speak English with you.  
And then some of the times you want to talk to someone who understands another language.  
And all you do is you just switch in your mind.  
You still want to say the same message.  
But now you're talking in a different language to you.  
A completely different language.  
And sometimes some of the terminologies applied in expressing yourself are in reverse.  
 with respect to one language, or the other.  
You have to translate that message in reverse to mean the same thing for the other fellow.  
It's like if you were using the German language,  
 That language got a little twist to it.  
You make some statements, you can use some phrases in English.  
But in a German language, you can't continue because you need a verb to connect.  
Without the verb, you can't connect it.  
Different from the English language, where you can pick a phrase without a verb.  
See, in that case, it will not make any sense.  
 So, languages are different.  
Now, when you come to Christ, you have different levels and your language changes with understanding.  
Your communication changes with understanding.  
 All right.  
So here, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.  
So he's talking to these Christians who are still at this level.  
They're not necessarily babes.  
They have a higher level of understanding here than the church in Corinth.  
The efficient church at this stage of the lies had a higher level of understanding than the church in Corinth.  
But yet, look what he prays for.  
 that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that he being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend.  
Did you notice that?  
With all saints, may be able to comprehend with all saints.  
So these are the saints have now comprehended these truths.  
So he says, I want you to be able to comprehend with all saints.  
He's not talking about saints in heaven, he's talking about saints in the earth.  
Wonderful.  
 that Christ may dwell in your hearts about faith, that he being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints, what is the breath and length and depth and height, and to know the love of Christ, which pass it, or surpass it, knowledge, that he might be filled with all the fullness of God.  
Wonderful.  
 Wonderful.  
See, you don't have to pray this for yourself.  
If you pray this for yourself, you've got to put it in the affirmative.  
That's the difference.  
This is a prayer for someone else.  
This is a prayer for other Christians.  
Now, when you want to pray this prayer for yourself, you've got to pray in the affirmative.  
What I mean?  
You say something like this.  
 Thank you, Lord, and I begin from verse 16.  
Lord, thank you, because you've granted me, according to the riches of your glory, to be strengthened with might, but your spirit in my inner man.  
Christ dwells in my heart by faith.  
You see, you're speaking in the affirmative.  
Christ dwells in my heart by faith.  
And I comprehend with all the saints.  
See, that's the way you pray in the affirmative.  
 you pray for the other Christians that they may come to that knowledge of the truth.  
All right, so very important.  
We go to another one.  
Okay, other collusions, chapter four.  
So I can connect something for you.  
You know, if you look at the other books, these are the Epistles and Philippians and collusions, you'd find prayers for the saints.  
They're all there.  
But go to chapter four.  
I won't read from verse  
 13.  
Maybe from 12, we'll be all right, so you catch the full thing.  
Epiphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ saluted you.  
Always laboring fervently for you in prayers.  
Did you see that?  
Here's one Christian praying for other Christians.  
A beautiful example.  
 And he says, it's a label, prayer is a work.  
Why?  
Because it's a manifestation of a concern for other people.  
And you are carrying that burden to pray for them.  
So he says, Epiphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, I looked at you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers.  
That you missed and perfect.  
Look at the way it's prayed.  
He doesn't say, no, God bless them.  
 Look at it, that he may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.  
He says, for I bear him record that he had a great zeal for you and them that are in Laudetia and them in Herapolis.  
Wonderful.  
Wonderful.  
This is really touching.  
Epochres, who is one of you?  
 See, it's not about some saints in heaven praying for you.  
No, it's one of you, a servant of Christ, always laboring, fervently for you in prayers, that ye misunderstand perfect and complete.  
Praying for them.  
Now, this is the content of the prayer.  
This is it.  
I want you to go to Colossians  
 God of Colossians chapter 1, I'm going to read quickly from verse 9.  
This is for this cause we also seen today, we heard it.  
Do not cease to pray for you and to desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understand.  
Same thing.  
Notice, he prays this prayer for the Ephesian brethren.  
He prays a similar prayer.  
 for the Colossian brethren.  
That he might walk worthy of the Lord unto all please and be in foot full in every good work.  
It's praying that they may be foot full in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.  
Pray that they might increase in the knowledge of God.  
Strengthen with all might, there it is again.  
Same thing we just read in Ephesians.  
According to his glorious pound, all patience and long suffering with joyfulness.  
Wonderful.  
Amazing prayer.  
Amazing prayer.  
And then  
 in praying for the saints.  
You understand, you pray for ministers in a different way.  
Because you assume, rightly so, that someone who is a minister should have been brought up in the things of God.  
Even though in practice, it's not always so.  
 But before you go into ministry, you need to learn some things.  
But when we pray for ministers, how do we pray for them?  
Let's see.  
We go first to Colossians chapter 4 and we're reading from verse 1.  


  
 I think we just go straight into verse 2, so we shouldn't.  
Continue in prayer.  
See, don't stop.  
Continue in prayer.  
The Amplified says, Be honest and unwaryed and steadfast in your prayer life.  
I like it.  
Be in both a large and intent in your brain with thanksgiving.  
Wonderful.  
 Now, so back to King James, continuing to pray and watching the same with Thanksgiving.  
With a praying also for us now, you're praying for ministers.  
This is for us, us ministers.  
Praying also for us that God will open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds, that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.  
 blessed Jesus.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Wonderful.  
Let me read it to you from the new national version.  
It says, verse three, and pray for us too.  
Pray for us too.  
That God may open a door for our message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ for which I am in chains.  
 at this time he had been bound.  
He was imprisoned for preaching the gospel.  
So he says, pray for us too, that God may open a door for our message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ for which I am in chains.  
Pray that I may proclaim it clearly as I shoot.  
That's the way you pray for men's death.  
That's the way you pray for them.  
Now you're going to find a consistency in this  
 You go to Ephesians chapter 6, Ephesians chapter 6, Ephesians chapter 18, but we'll move a step further into verse 19.  
So we're going to read 19, because it says, pray, okay?  
And for me,  
 I read it from the NIV.  
Pray also for me that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel.  
Hallelujah.  
That whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel.  
 Pray, you say, it's that I may declare it fearlessly as I shoot.  
They're not wonderful.  
That's the way you pray for ministers.  
There's more.  
There's more.  
Now, I want you to look at 1 Corinthians chapter 16, verse 9.  
So you see, why this is so important?  
 He says, for a great door and effectual, he's opened on to me and there are many adversaries.  
What's he talking about here?  
Because when you pray, the Lord opens doors.  
He says, pray that a door of what runs be opened on to me.  
Pray that I have a message, there'll be more opportunities for a message.  
Which means that God opens the doors.  
 So we can pray that the Lord will open more doors for us to preach the gospel, for us to make the message known.  
If we keep it to ourselves, it's not good.  
Jesus asked us to preach to the ends of the earth.  
Let everybody know it's good news for them.  
Jesus came for their sake and he wants him to know the whole truth.  
So we've got to pray like this.  
That the door will open.  
 whether in a city, in a town, in a family, anywhere.  
At war praying, the God will grant us more opportunities to preach the gospel and the boldness to make the word known.  
Now, look at 2nd Corinthians chapter 2 verse 12.  
2nd Corinthians chapter 2 and verse number 12.  
It says,  
 When I came to Troy as to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord.  
So who opened the door?  
The Lord.  
That's why you pray that the Lord will open these doors.  
And Himself said, listen to the Lord here, in Revelation 3, verse number 8.  
He says, I know that works.  
Behold, I have said before the unopened door.  
 He opened the door.  
He says, I've said before, the opened door, and no man can shut it.  
When God opens the door, they can't shut it.  
So we pray like this.  
This is the way you pray for ministers, and there's one more.  
In praying for ministers, you go to 2 Thessalonians chapter three, verse number two.  
 He says, I read from verse 1, so it would be better that way.  
Finally, brethren, pray for us that the world of the Lord may have free course.  
See, there it is again, free course that the Lord would grant us the opportunity to preach the gospel on Him there.  
 that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you.  
Pray that we then say in verse two, and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men, for all men have no faith.  
Pray that we, that's the way you pray for minister, that they be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men.  
There are people who want to hinder the gospel, and sometimes they're in the government.  
Sometimes they are  
 they can be leaders of the community and they try to hinder the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
And when they try to do that, what do you think they have to do?  
They have to go after the preachers, go after the ministers, go after pastors so that they can hinder the gospel.  
So you pray that many sets of the gospel be delivered from unreasonable  
 and wicked men.  
Look at the description, unreasonable, because most of them are really unreasonable and wicked.  
So pray that we will be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men.  
He says, because not everybody has faith.  
When we preach the gospel, there are a lot of people who don't love Jesus Christ.  
They don't have faith.  
They don't think about God.  
They don't think about themselves.  
And they want to hinder the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
So we're going to pray.  
And lastly,  
 In connection with this, you'd go to Romans 15.  
I'm reading to you from verse 30.  
Chapter 15, Romans, from verse 30.  
Now I beset you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and for the love of the Spirit that is strived together.  
Notice this is a strive.  
 You've got to put some effort into this.  
It's not something you're not necessarily going to enjoy it because it's of God.  
You've got to have some discipline to it.  
You've got to force yourself to do it because it's the right thing to do.  
So he says, now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and for the love of the Spirit that is trying to gather with me in your prayers to God for me.  
That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea, he says.  
 And that my service, which I have for Jerusalem, may be accepted of the saints.  
Pray that when we preach the gospel, when we go on to preach the gospel, that those whom we're coming to preach to may receive the message.  
You pray like that.  
And pray that we believe it from those who do not believe.  
That's what I say.  
So, the Word of God has given us guidance about prayer.  
 And it is always important that we follow the teachings of the Scriptures.  
We're always better off that way.  
We're always better off that way because we follow what God has taught us in His Word and we get the best results.  
 No, many people are praying.  
Most people pray.  
But not many get results.  
Not many get answers.  
Why?  
Because they don't pray correctly.  
James says, why do many pray and have no answers?  
Is it because they pray or miss?  
They pray wrongly.  
They're asking wrongly.  
So there's a right way to pray.  
And this is what we're sharing with you today.  
I want you to pray right now.  
 and apply any of these in praying for other believers, other Christians, maybe your friend, maybe your neighbors, maybe someone you've invited to church and is finding some difficulty serving the Lord, someone you led to the Lord.  
 then that one's not been growing in the things of God.  
Pick up that name now and pray for that particular person.  
Maybe some members of your family pray for them and pray for ministers of the gospel.  
See, pray that we maybe deliver from unreasonable and wicked men from those who do not believe and have the Lord open under us more doors to preach the gospel.  
Glory to God.
