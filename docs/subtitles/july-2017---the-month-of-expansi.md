title: July 2017 - The Month of Expansion
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
This month of July is a special month.  
And I want to read to you, I want to read to you some portions of the Bible.  
And when I start reading, you know what the message is.  
You just know what the message of the month is.  
 I'm sure you'd know.  
So, I'm going to Isaiah chapter 54.  
And I'm reading from verse 2.  


  
And large, the place of thy tent.  
 and let them stretch forth the cuttings of thine habitations.  
Spare not lengthening thy cards and strengthening thy stakes.  
For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left.  
And thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.  
 Fear not, for thou shall not be ashamed.  
Neither be thou confounded, for thou shall not be put to shame, for thou shall forget the shame of thy youth."  
 I will read that verse two of my time.  
It says enlarged the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the cuttings of thine habitations.  
Spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes.  
For thou shall break forth on the right hand and on the left.  
 and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.  
Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed, neither be thou confounded, for thou shalt not be put to shame, for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth.  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
 He says, enlarge the place of that thing.  
This month of July is the month of expansion.  
That's what the Spirit God said.  
It is the month of expansion.  
You are expanding.  
You're expanding.  
 Marvelous things are about to happen.  
Raise your faith.  
He says, Spare not!  
Spare not lengthen thy cards and strengthen thy stakes because you're about to take more.  
Strengthen your stakes.  
You're about to carry more.  
You're about to take more.  
You're about to receive more.  
 You know, when the Lord wants to do something, He always uses His Word.  
God never does anything without His Word.  
He never does anything without His Word.  
He does everything with His Word.  
He does everything with His Word.  
 And you can trust him.  
And when he brings his word like this, it comes with power.  
His word is full of power.  
Let me read something to you.  
Oh, glory to God forevermore.  
This is in Luke's Gospel, chapter 1.  


  
 And verse 37, now the King James translation doesn't quite get it right.  
It doesn't.  
Because when you study the Greek, what is written in the King James here is not it.  
For with God, nothing shall be impossible.  
But that's not what the word really says in the Greek.  
 In the American Standard Version, you can find the correct translation.  
It says, no word from God shall be void of power.  
Now you wonder, how did they get to translate it the way they did in the King James?  
You don't even find Rema there, word because of one thing.  
 word is a thing.  
And they translated it because the Greek has the negative to it.  
You see, it has the negative to it.  
So it says, no thing, no thing from God.  
You understand?  
But the thing there is the Rhema.  
Do you get it?  
So that's why the King James went that way because Rhema is a thing.  
 You see, like when you say, that person told me something.  
You don't say, he told me words.  
You say, he told me something.  
And what he told you is Rema.  
See, he gave me Rema.  
He told me something.  
You see.  
What did you say?  
What did you say?  
In the Greek would be like, what thing did you say?  
 You get it?  
So that's the reason for some of the problems they got in the translations.  
So the real translation is, no word from God shall be void of power.  
I like it because it means every time the God speaks, it is full of power.  
That's why when God's word comes to you, take a hold of it because it's full of power.  
It's never empty.  
It is no word from God shall be void of power.  
 Power to make it happen.  
Power to translate it into reality, which means every time that God speaks, the power to make it so is embedded within it.  
It never comes empty.  
His word never comes empty.  
Oh, why?  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
So when God says to you, this month is a month of expansion.  
 The word has gone out in the spirit realm.  
And then you take a hold of it.  
Like what Mary did, she said, let it be on to me according to thy word.  
She trusted it.  
She trusted the message that the angel brought to her.  
She believed it.  
She trusted it and it worked.  
 You trust this is your mind of expansion.  
Act on it.  
Have that mentality.  
I'm expanding this month.  
I'm expanding on every side and be very definite.  
Okay.  
Okay.  
Lord.  
Now here we go.  
 What are the steps I'm going to take?  
That's where the Holy Ghost comes in.  
Because the Holy Ghost helps you actualize God's visions for your life.  
God's work for your life.  
The Holy Spirit helps you to actualize them.  
See, you ever want those things to come to pass?  
Work with the Holy Ghost.  
He'll teach you.  
He'll explain to you.  
He'll guide you.  
He'll unveil the mind of the Father to you.  
 the Holy Spirit can be trusted.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
No word from God shall be void of power.  
It's your month of expansion.  
And let me read some more to you along these lines.  
Isaiah chapter 55,  
 from verse 9.  
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways in my thoughts than your thoughts.  
For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and return it not to the.  
But what are the earth?  
And make it bring forth and but that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater.  
So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth.  
It shall not return unto me void.  
 But it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing, in the thing where to I send it.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, thank you Lord Jesus is my month of expansion.  
Hallelujah.  
And think about this.  
I've been expanding all this time.  
I've been expanding every month.  
So what's going to happen when the month is specially blessed of God for my expansion?  
There's no stopping me.  
 Oh, glory to God.  
Glory to God.  
I'm expanding financially.  
I'm expanding my visions.  
I'm expanding my capacity.  
I can do much more.  
Hallelujah.  
For you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace.  
Look at this.  
This is the 12th verse now.  
Same book, same chapter.  
 For you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace, the mountains, and the hills shall break forth before you into singing.  
And all the trees of the field shall clap their hands, hallelujah.  
Think about it.  
You shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace, the mountains and the hills, the authority shall break forth before you in the sea.  
And the trees of the field, people,  
 That's what's meant by trees of the field.  
The field is the world.  
Trees are people.  
And the trees of the field shall clap their hands as you pass by.  
Hallelujah.  
What a joy.  
So God's words for you this month is your month of expansion.  
Isn't that amazing?  
But this is coming at this time where we're launching Vision 400.  
Wow.  


  
 Oh, blessed be the Lord, Mustai.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
We glorify you.  
We glorify you.  
We magnify your holy name.  
Blessed be the Lord forever.  
Blessed be the Lord forever.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Amen, praise God.
