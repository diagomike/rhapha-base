title: Volume 1
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Everything has a source.  
The original source material for everything is God's womb.  
And from the beginning, it has been the principle of creation and recreation.  
This is what modern physics is based on.  
 They didn't know it was in the book already.  
We use things which are not.  
But there exists in the realm of faith to bring to nothing things that are.  
Get ready to tap into the wealth of God's word and frame the circumstances of your life in line with God's plan and purposes for you.  
His word is absolute truths.  
You can depend on it.  
 The Word will produce faith, and our faith is always connected to our needs.  
If there is no need for it, there will be no faith to it.  
And in this expose on sound, matter and faith, let God's Word direct you in His path and pattern for your future.  
Glory to God.  


  
 There are several scriptures that we're going to be looking at from the night.  
And the first one is in Hebrews chapter 11.  
And verse number three.  
But let's take it from verse one, because you all love verse one.  
It says, now faith  
 Oh, thank God for faith.  
Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  
We get it again.  
Faith is the substance of things hoped for.  
The evidence of things not seen.  
 We'll come back to this, but let's move on.  
Next verse two.  
For by it, by faith, the elders obtained a good report.  
By faith is saying because of faith, through actions of faith, the elders,  
 What errors?  
The errors in our spiritual family.  
For might the errors obtain to go and report?  
Hmm.  
Next verse.  
How many of you like to have a good report from God?  
Yeah.  
That can only happen through faith.  
Now look at this verse is powerful.  
Never forget it.  
 Through faith we understand that the world, the words were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  


  
 Sometimes I tell those in the field of modern physics.  
The Bible already told us everything you're trying to think.  
It's already in the book.  
This is what modern physics is based on.  
 They didn't know it was in the book already.  
Did you see it?  
Okay, now, if you don't understand modern physics, don't bother about it.  
I mean, some of you never care about physics, so don't worry about it.  
True fate, we understand that the words were framed by the word of God.  
All right, goodness.  
The words were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen  
 We're not made of things which do appear.  
Do you get it?  
It says things which are seen by the optical eyes, we're not made of things which do appear.  
Right away he's talking about subatomic particles.  
Things that cannot be seen with the natural eyes.  
 That's what he's talking about.  
But what we see didn't come from visible things, but it called them things.  
They were not made of things which do appear.  
So they're things, but they do not appear.  
So there are invisible things.  
 By which God created the visible things of this world.  


  
This is really powerful.  
One of the most interesting parts of modern physics, by the way, I am neither a physicist  
 a chemist, an alchemist, nor any of that, I am Pastor Chris.  
Yeah, so don't listen to me like you're listening to a science professor because I'm not.  
One of the major fundamentals on which modern physics is based  
 is what they call the wave particle duality.  
Let me explain a little bit.  
It is the confusion as to whether subatomic particles, if they should be called particles,  
 electrons, photons, whether they are waves or particles because of a mysterious result in their experiments.  
They demonstrated with the electron  
 And found out it had waves, characteristics.  
When you were not looking, follow this.  
If you weren't looking at it, it produced characteristics of waves.  
 meaning that if you were not looking at the electron, if the observer, the one who carried out the experiment, or the detector that was used, if it wasn't looking at the electron, it produced waves.  
Characteristics of waves.  
So they said that means the electron is a wave.  
 But then the moment you turn to look at it, it seemed to know you were looking.  
And before you could see it, it was a particle.  
How could it produce such patterns and characteristics of waves  
 And then when you try to measure it, tone during the measure, it tone into a particle.  
How could it be that intelligent?  
Now, those creatures tell you something.  
How is it that you look at these things from which physical materials came to be  
 How could there are very basic fundamental elements not be matter at once?  
That means they materialize and dematerialize, depending on who's looking.  


  
 Now that's something very interesting.  
So if it's a wave, if it's a wave, it's got energy.  
Can I see it?  
If it's a wave, it's got energy.  
And energy  
 And it's not matter.  
So it's not a particle.  
If it's a particle, then they say, that means it's not a wave.  
It's one of both.  
But it turns out to be both.  
So it's the most mind-blowing  
 experiments that they've carried out for so many years now, and they have no explanation for it, but all the explanation is in the back.  
All the explanation is in the book.  
It's so simple.  
Think about it.  
When you're not looking, it's energy.  
When you turn to see it, it's matter.  
 Faith, go back to verse 1.  
I want you to see it.  
Now faith is the substance of things in hope.  
Why are you not looking with your eyes?  
Are you still there?  
And it's inside the eyes of your spirits.  
It's substance.  
It's inside.  
 In what form?  
Word, fun, is in the Word of God.  
Because faith comes by hearing.  
Hearing by the Word of God remains chapter 10, verse 17.  
Faith comes, faith comes to your heart.  
And faith builds a picture of faith.  
And faith is the substance of my hope.  
 It is a substance.  
It's got energy.  
It's based on the Word of God.  
Are you hearing this?  
Because the Word of God is sound.  
He spoke and creation came to be sound waves where the energy is.  
Can you see that?  
 So if they want to understand this stuff, they need to get out of New Age, get out of all that stuff, and get to the Bible.  
The buck explains it all.  
Hallelujah.  
It explains it all.  
Faith comes by hearing, hearing by the Word of God.  
 When you hear the word of God, faith is imparted to your spirits.  
It says faith is the substance of things hoped for.  
They proof.  
Proof.  


  
Proof.  
Faith is proof.  
Hallelujah.  
Tell somebody faith is proof.  
 So again, faith is proof.  
Faith is the evidence, the proof, the cogency of evidence.  
Do you understand?  


  
 Fair is proof of things not sin.  
Things not sin.  
See, what I want you to begin to look at here, that's gonna take you to another level in your life, is learn to see the way God sees.  
Because we're children of God, we've gotta see the way God sees.  
You gotta look beyond what is manifest.  
Look beyond what is manifest.  
 You'd be amazed at what you're gonna do to your life.  
You know, many times when we talk about influencing, changing our lives and making our lives wonderful, sometimes there are those who think that we should use our faith to control other people.  
No, you don't use your faith to control other people.  
Your fulfillment is not dependent on another person's life.  
 No, you're not going to use your faith to control anybody else.  
You have to stand before God for yourself.  
See, you're going to answer to God for yourself.  
And you can be happy.  
So you don't have to blame your next door neighbor.  
You don't have to blame anyone else for not being fulfilled.  
 God is not asking us to be made happy by others.  
He's asking us to help others be happy.  
Hallelujah.  
So you're not a victim.  
You're a victim.  
Hallelujah.  
So think like this.  
See the unseen.  
 It's a lie that God's given us.  
Hey, hello?  
Okay, I'll show you something here.  
In Romans 12, oh, you love this one.  
We are reading from verse two, Romans 12, from verse number two.  
 Dear Lord Jesus, this isn't be not confirmed to this world.  
See, you're a child of God.  
Just don't be like the rest of the world.  
Look at it.  
Be transfigured, transformed by the renewing of your mind.  
By the renewing of your mind, that means don't think the way you've always thought.  
Take God's thinking.  
 exchange your thinking for God's thoughts, and your life will be transfigured.  
There will be a metamorphosis from one level of glory to another.  
Hallelujah.  
Look at it.  
Be not confirmed this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.  
This is the part I want you to see, the next part of it, that he may prove  
 Court is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God?  
Was it telling you?  
Okay.  
Now, the English doesn't give you the best expression of that verse.  
It was one of the verses that I wanted to study for many years.  
 and I'll read it and meditate on it and read it, you know?  
Because I knew there was something locked up in there by the English version.  
He says, be not conformed to this world, be transformed by the renewing of your mind, be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that something will happen, right?  
 that he may prove, that's where the problem is, that he may prove, or is that given an acceptable and perfect will of God.  
The word that's translated proof there is a difficult word.  
It's a Greek docimazole.  
What it actually means, I'll give you the picture first.  
 How many of you ever traveled to another country and you had to go through the customs section and they passed you through or passed your things through some machine to look through whatever you were going to be sure you didn't have contraband, right?  
 Sometimes you even want to go to the plane, they take you through this security system, and they check you.  
You know what they're doing?  
That's DocuMazzo.  
What they're doing is, they ask, colonizing you to decide to allow you.  
If you are allowable,  
 That's talking muzzle.  
Is he it?  
That he may prove you are that God's man or woman, a child of God, who decides you prove things of the good, acceptable and perfect will of the Father to come into this world.  
 You didn't get it yet.  
Follow me here.  
I want you to understand what this is all about.  
In 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 21,  
 The Bible says, Him who knew no sin was made to be sin for us, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.  
We are the righteousness of God.  
We are His righteous ones.  
We are the, we give vent to His glory.  
We give vent to His will.  
Are you catching that now?  
 We allow the good things of God to come into this world.  
We are the ones who prove that this is good.  
This is acceptable to God.  
This is the perfect one of God.  
And we bring that into this earth.  
It's our calling.  
 And until we know our calling, the Bible says that in His expectation of the creation, we're tied for the manifestation of the sounds of God.  
And that the whole creation is in pain, groaning and waiting for the manifestation of the sounds of God.  
And what are the sounds of God supposed to do to prove?  
 That which is the good, the acceptable and the perfect will of the Father.  
Hallelujah.  
It's our job.  
We're coming to that place.  
 We're coming to that place.  
When we begin to understand what Jesus said, whatsoever you shall be pounding heaven, whatsoever you shall lose an earth shall be loosed in heaven.  
That's what he's talking about.  
What you forbid on earth is forbidden in heaven.  
What you permit on earth is permitted in heaven.  


  
 Are you following this now?  
So no room for frustration in our lives.  
No room.  
I refuse to give thanks to frustration.  
Are you following this now?  
No sadness comes through me.  
No bitterness comes through me.  
No anger comes through me.  
Only the joy of the Lord.  
Oh, I love you.  
Oh, really God.  
 So when you see me, you see joy, joy unspeakable and full of glory, shouting in somebody.  
Hallelujah.  
What are you going to let into the world as far as you are concerned?  
What's coming through you is it's been not confirmed to this world.  
 But be transfigured.  
Hallelujah.  
Brother renewing of your mind.  
You renew your mind through the Word.  
You think God's thoughts.  


  
I'm full of joy.  
I'm full of joy.  
I'm full of joy.  
I'm full of joy.  
I'm full of joy.  
 Joy.  
I'm full of joy.  
In the morning I'm full of joy.  
In the noon time I'm full of joy.  
In the evening time I'm full of joy.  
In the night time I'm full of joy.  
Joy.  
Hallelujah.  
Joy.  
Hallelujah.  
Joy.  
 I'm full of joy.  
I give vent to His righteousness.  
I give vent to love, to joy, peace.  
When I come in, there's love, there's kindness, there's appreciation.  
 When I come, you're gonna hear, thank you.  
Yes, yes, yes.  
I tell people, never forget to say thank you for the smallest things.  
Say thank you.  
Let good things come through you.  
Yeah.  
Glory to Jesus.  
 You still here?  
Yes, Master.  
All right, let's take some more.  
Can you take some more?  
Yes, Master.  
Okay.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Things we just seen were not made of things which do appear.  
Saint Luke's Gospel, chapter 17.  
Take a look at verse 6.  


  
 So it looks Gospel, chapter 17, verse number six.  
And the Lord said, if he had faith, as a grain of mustard seed.  
In that day, they knew those whom Jesus was talking to, they knew the mustard seed to be the smallest seed.  
 So, he was appealing to their understanding.  
If he had faith as a grain of mustard seed, he might say on the next second mind tree, be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the seed, and it should be.  
He says, the little face, small face, that your hair can do big things.  
 If you are thinking, I don't have faith.  
Well, Romans chapter 10 verse 17 tells us how to get it.  
His faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.  
So whenever you think you don't have enough faith, get to hearing the Word.  
The Word will produce faith.  
 and in fact, fate to your spirits.  
It will.  
It cannot fail.  
It's a principle of the kingdom of God.  
It'll bring you faith.  
If you feel like your faith is not there, oh, I don't know.  
I don't have enough faith to face this thing.  
It means you're not hearing the word of God.  
You're not listening to the word of God.  
 You're not paying attention to the word of God.  
Because if you will pay attention to the word, it'll give you faith.  
It'll do it.  
You don't have to struggle for it.  
You don't have to try to get it.  
Just hear the word.  
Faith comes by hearing.  
Look at it, it's there.  
So then, faith comes.  
You can't stop it.  
If you will hear the word, faith will come to you.  
 You know, there's a guy who walked into the church years ago.  
He came in saying he didn't believe.  
He wasn't going to believe.  
But his friends tried to convince him to come nonetheless.  
And he came in and he was trying not to believe.  
But he was hearing.  
Well, later on when I had a chat with you, he said, somehow, I believe what you said.  
 They can escape it.  
Say, I believe what you say.  
Faith comes.  
Say, faith comes.  
They're like this.  
Say, faith comes.  
So then, faith comes.  
Say again, faith comes.  
Faith comes to me.  
When I hear the word, faith comes to me.  
 Now, you know, when faith comes, you got to take it.  
You got to receive it.  
It's not enough for it to come.  
You got to take it.  
So, faith comes to me.  
When I hear the word, I receive faith in my spirits.  
Hallelujah.  
 Our faith is always connected to our needs.  
 hear what I just said.  
If there is no need for it, there will be no faith to it.  
So you may find yourself trying to make something happen that will not happen because there is no need to activate faith.  
Your life is not decided by the happenings.  
No, you are in charge.  
You will change whatever situation to fit the call and purpose of God for your life.  


  
 Glory to God.  
Okay, now let's look at another thing here.  
It's in Mark's Gospel chapter 11.  
It's looking at faith here.  
Word to the Master Jesus Christ.  
It's in Mark's Gospel chapter 11 from verse 22.  
You know, many Christians struggle and struggle and struggle for so many things.  
They've troubled about so many things.  
You know, because of their experiences,  
 And suddenly, he's happy.  
And when he's happy, because everything's going all right.  
And soon as some things go the other way, oh dear, I don't know what to do.  
What's the matter?  
Oh well.  
 I don't know what's happening in my life.  
See, it's happy when things, things are all right, things are all right.  
Circumstances, things happening around him are all right.  
Then when they're not happening right, he goes, oh.  
No child is joined now.  
Oh.  
 Did you ever see that worry looking face?  
Some people look over there because of that.  
They're like this all the time.  
Always looking worried.  


  
 They feel like if they don't look worried, you're not gonna know what they're going through.  
So they want you to know what they're going through.  
You know what that's called?  
Witchcraft.  
It's called manipulation.  
Because you know, if they don't see that you are worried, they're not going to care.  
So you wanna get their attention  
 Hmm.  
I mean, they don't say anything when you pass by.  
You're gonna come back.  
Then you go, hmm.  
Like they didn't hear you.  
Hmm.  
That's witchcraft.  


  
 Listen, don't give yourself over to the negative side of life.  
Don't do it.  
Don't do it.  
It's so important that you realize that life is what God introduced into you when He gave you His Word.  
All right, is the Word of God so important.  
 Why is it?  
The Word of God is how do you quantify or qualify something of this nature?  
Something that... Can you imagine?  
He says he has set eternity in their hearts.  
 Your heart has the capacity to contain God.  
It's amazing.  
 This is why, you know, people of the New Age and some of the religions think about, they say that God is all and all is God, and that we are all inside God.  
They say we are inseparable from the  
 this mass mind or mass soul of which we are all apart.  
And we might one day discover that it was all again, and we were all in there for the pleasure of this infinite intelligence.  
 which means there's really no God.  
It's just a mind and all our minds coming together as one mass mind.  
That's crazy.  
You see, the reason for so many such explanations is Satan not wanting me to understand accountability.  
Because if there's no God, then  
 There is no sin.  
Can you see it?  
If there's no God, then there's no face.  
So that means I'm not accountable to anyone.  
So I should think that I happened in this world if I happened at all.  
Maybe I didn't happen and I don't know it.  
 I'm trying to show you the confusion that they're out there.  
These guys are so confused.  
So they're doing something.  
They say, I may not be doing it.  
I'm doing it.  
I think I'm doing it.  
I'm thinking I'm doing it.  
If just my mind, I may not be doing what I think I'm doing.  
Who could be more confused than that?  
 But listen to Jesus, he was so deaf in it.  
He was so glad.  
He called God his father.  
He told us where his father was.  
He didn't say, well, my father is in the spirit realm.  
He didn't talk like that.  
He said, my father is in heaven.  
And then to know where that heaven was, he said, above.  
 Then you start looking around what that above is, not in southwest, geographical location.  
He was talking about spiritual location.  
He said, above a spiritual location, and he proved it by his ascension.  
When he ascended, they saw him with their optical eyes.  
They saw him ascend and go beyond the clouds.  
That's part of history.  
Never forget it.  
 Hallelujah.  
And one of these days was coming again.  
That's the reason for all this.  
That's why we're here, because Jesus is coming again.  
And we want him to find us busy doing what he told us to do.  
It's coming again.  
 He said, if you love me, keep my commandments.  
Do what I told you.  
I want you to come and find that I'm doing what he told me to do.  
I want Jesus to come and I'm happy to medium.  
I want Jesus to come and I'm thinking, oh God, is he coming?  
Is it real?  
Is it coming?  
No.  
When that trumpet sounds,  
 I'll check out of here.  
I'm looking forward to that.  
Is it possible, Chris, is that really going to happen?  
Why do you think I'm standing here?  
That's why I'm here.  
It's part of my preparation.  
How soon is it very soon?  
Is it days, weeks, months, years?  
That don't matter?  
Come on.  
 If you're working in the light as he is in the light, you've got fellowship with him.  
And so it doesn't matter which day.  
You're already in fellowship with him.  
When he shows up, all right, job's done.  
We're finished.  
We'll get out of here.  
Master says he's over.  
And you might just have been winning souls on that day.  
You might have just been distributing rhapsody on that day.  
 And then that trumpet goes with the Archangel, the voice of the Archangel.  
And we are gone.  
The barris says we shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye.  
That quick.  
And we're gone.  
And there are those who are going to be looking for us.  
You see how?  
It can't be real.  


  
 Then they hear people crying in the street.  
Oh, God, did I miss the rapture?  
Oh, God, oh, God, did I miss it?  
You don't want to miss that, right?  
Will you go?  
How are you gonna know?  
Jesus said, if you love me, keep my commandments.  
If you love Jesus, do his will.  
 Live for him.  
Live for him.  
Don't let your life be conditioned upon his hurts.  
He has been not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.  
Renew your mind.  
Tell somebody renew your mind.  
So again renew your mind.  
 All right, put it this, the Mark's Gospel chapter 11 from verse 22, we've got the words of Jesus.  
And Jesus answered and said, on to them, have faith in God.  
Next.  
For very I say to you, that whosoever shall say, on to this moment,  
 Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he says."  
Now, someone said, I've never seen anybody with faith move a mountain.  
Was Jesus just using  
 symbolism or did he mean this?  
Can you really command a mountain to move?  
Yes.  
Jesus meant it, but Jesus wasn't talking about a game.  
Jesus wasn't saying that we go out on the street  
 And say, now, you know I got this power.  
And I'm here to show you what I got.  
I can imagine where some of you would like to start.  
That fellow, who doesn't like you, or you don't like him?  
You're going to command his house to be uprooting.  
He must move out of US state.  
 See, so he wasn't expecting us to use as a game.  
This is serious business.  
Why would you want to move a physical mountain?  


  
Our faith is always connected to our need.  
Hear what I just said.  
 Hear what I just said.  
Our faith is always connected to our need.  
If there is no need for it, there will be no faith to it.  
So you may find yourself trying to make something happen that will not happen because there is no need to activate faith.  
Our needs always present themselves  
 Activate, activate our faith.  
So when you find yourself in a situation you have a need, don't despair.  
It'll activate your faith.  
That woman, until she heard that she'll never have a baby, she didn't know.  
 She could have won with faith until she was told there was no way out.  
See what I mean?  


  
A fellow who was healed of cancer didn't know he could make it happen until he was told he had one month to live and his faith was triggered.  
 He said, I shall not die, but live and happen.  
Your need triggers your faith.  
That means never be overwhelmed with your need.  
Don't say you see what we need, you see we need this, we need that, we need that, and then you get overwhelmed.  
No, let your need connect to your faith.  
 Let your need excite you.  


  
Let your need excite you.  


  
That's the way I've lived my life.  
 When I connect to a need, I overwhelm my need with my faith.  
No need overwhelms me.  
I refuse.  
I refuse.  
You know, one day, I was having a conversation with the Lord and I was saying, Lord, I said, you've so trained me.  
 I cannot think differently.  
I said, Lord, I find it difficult to think thoughts of defeat, thoughts of needs.  
I said, I find it difficult.  
I find it difficult.  
I can't think the other way.  
My mind has been conditioned by the words.  
 It's called the wisdom of the righteous, for this is the wisdom of the righteous.  
You are separated onto the wisdom of God.  
And when you're separated onto the wisdom of God, it makes no difference what happens.  
 Your life is not decided by the happenings.  
No, you are in charge.  
You will change whatever situation to fit the call and purpose of God for your life.  
That's the way you see things.  
As you walk on your way, you are coming with power.  
I hear me.  
 Look at your pots.  
Every one of us has a pot.  
Every one of us has a journey.  
You understand?  
You are an honor journey.  
And as you're going, there's something you will meet on the way.  
For David, there was a beer, and there was a lion.  
And after that, there was a goliath.  
Then the armies of the Philistines, and then lots of other armies on his pots.  
 but he defeated all of them.  
I'm not sure what's in your past, but there's surely something in your past.  
There's something in your past.  
What are you gonna do when you get there?  
What are you gonna do?  
 Are you going to be pleading, oh God, please do something.  
Oh God, I didn't know this wasn't my part.  
Listen, there's something in your pants.  
You're not going to just run free.  
No, it's not the will of God.  
You're going to get somewhere and you'll find that mass devil.  
It doesn't matter what he's wearing.  
You say in the name of Jesus Christ.  
 Get out of my way!  
You know what?  
When you do that, some will fall away.  
And you keep John in.  
You get to another one, and you say in the name of Jesus Christ.  
Get out of my way.  
Each will not move.  
 And you step back and you say in the name of Jesus Christ, I command you to get out of my way.  
You still standing there.  
You say in the name of Jesus Christ.  
Now you get ready and you say, get out of your way.  
You push it down.  
Are you hearing me?  
 So you push it down?  
After that one?  
There's another one.  
When you get to that one, you say in the name of Jesus.  
Get out of my way.  
It's still standing.  
You say in the name of Jesus, I push you down.  
It's still standing.  
And you go back a little bit.  
 You're speaking out of charge.  
Are you hearing me?  
I'm not using the name of Jesus Christ.  
You want to.  
Hallelujah.  
By the time you want to, you will look back and see.  
He wasn't even there.  
I said he wasn't even there.  
It was a mirage.  
 Are you still there?  
Now you can understand when God tells you, don't worry, it is nothing.  
When you face the biggest troubles, that's what the Spirit says.  
The small arms, He lets you train your faith.  
 You talk and you kick and you push.  
When you get to the bigger ones, God saves the battle.  
He's not your battle.  
Oh my God.  
The battle is not your battle.  
He says, don't worry.  
You don't need to shout.  
You don't need to kick.  
You don't need to push.  
Just keep going.  
 Hallelujah.  
Then you get to where he is, then he is not there.  
Oh, where is he?  
Then the father says, I told you it was nothing.  
His name is called nothing.  
Hallelujah.  
 So when you keep shouting and you command it, and you're praying and kicking and pushing and nothing is happening, stop for a moment.  
As the pastor Chris said the other day, when you keep shouting and pushing and kicking and there's no change, just walk through.  
Now we'll leave here.  
Just walk through.  
Get back to business.  
Glory to God.  
 Sit down, sit down, sit down.  
Thank you.  
You just walked through.  
Let nothing discourage you.  
What are you made of?  
The word.  
What are you made of?  
Set again.  
The word.  
That's what you're made of.  
 You're made of the word.  
That's where you're from.  
That's your life.  
You're from the word.  
That's who I am.  
I'm a winner every day.  
See, keep this principle in your mind.  
Meditate on them.  
 every day, meditate until they become your mentality.  
Until they become the only way you think.  


  
It's not possible for me to be discouraged about anything, discouraged.  
It's not possible.  
Discouragement fires were deleted from my system a long time ago.  
Don't get discouraged.  
 In 1980, God spoke to me.  
He said, one thing I require of you.  
He said, be strong and very courageous.  
And I've kept to it.  
He said to me, be strong and very courageous.  
Then he said, have no fear.  
No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life.  
 That's what it said to me, 1980.  


  
When God talks to you, you take His Word into your spirit.  
You can bet your life on it.  
You can bet your life on it.  
And you just write on that Word and live joyfully, please, in Him.  
 He had called him the one who sees me.  
For the name.  
That was an understanding of God, the one who sees me.  
It didn't matter where she was.  
He was called the one who sees me.  
Is he that to you?  
Does he know your address?  
Is he the one who sees you?  
Does he know where you are at?  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
So gratikimakruv.  
Surinfai.  
Knebrotokorsafra.  
He's one season.
