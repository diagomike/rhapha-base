title: The Year of Preparation
---
 Jesus is wonderful.  


  
Are you ready?  
First Samuel chapter 7.  
 And summer speak unto all the house of Israel saying, if you do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and ashtrath from among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only.  
He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.  
Praise God.  
Now that's a very important  
 verse that I'm going to be explaining to you, I believe in the next few days.  
And I'll read another one to you.  


  
 Second Chronicles chapter 12 from verse 13.  


  
So King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned.  
 For real-bomb was one and 40 years old when he began to reign.  
And he reigns 17 years in Jerusalem, the city which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there.  
And his mother's name was Nema and Ammonitis.  
And he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the Lord.  
 Those are very powerful statements from the Word of God.  
And I want to read to you from 1 Chronicles chapter 22 from verse 5.  
This time, we're going to be reading a fairly long passage, so get yourself ready.  


  
 First Chronicles chapter 22, beginning with verse 5.  
And David said, now this was at the time that David was, this was at the close of his life.  
And the Lord had showed him that he was  
 going to pass on into glory, he was going to die.  
And he would give the kingdom over to his son Solomon.  
From verse five, and David said, Solomon, my son is young and tender.  
And a house that is to be built for the Lord must be exceeding magnificals of fame and of glory throughout all countries.  
 I will therefore now make preparation for it."  
So David prepared abundantly before his death.  
Wonderful.  
He had said that he would build God a house.  
And that this house must be magnificent.  
It must be a fame.  
 In all countries, what he said his son was young.  
And the Lord had said that Solomon would build the house.  
So David said, since my son is young, I'm going to make preparation for the building of this house.  
So because Solomon is young and tender,  
 I will therefore now make preparation for it.  
So David prepared abundantly before his death.  
David prepared abundantly for the building of the house before his death.  
Then he called for Solomon, his son, Keirahang Rodego Bafosh, Tarabaglerahandegestus.  
 called for Solomon his son and charged him to build and house of the Lord God of Israel.  
And David said to Solomon, my son, as for me, it was in my mind to build and house unto the name of the Lord my God.  
But the word of the Lord came to me saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly and has made great wars.  
Thou shalt not build and house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.  
 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about.  
For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.  
He shall build an house of my name, and shall be my son and I will be his father.  
And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.  
 Now, my son, the Lord be with thee, and prosper thou, and build the house of the Lord thy God, as he had said of thee.  
Only the Lord give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge, conson initial, that thou mayest keep the law of the Lord thy God.  
Then shall thou prosper, if thou takeest heed to fulfill the statutes and judgments which the Lord charged Moses with conson initial.  
Be strong and of good courage, dread not,  
 Nor be dismayed.  
Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the Lord and hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight.  
For it is in abundance, timber also, and stone have I prepared.  
 and thou missed at their toe.  
Moreover, there are workmen with thee in abundance.  
He was and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men, for every manner of work, of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number.  
Arise, therefore, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee.  
Hallelujah.  
You know, Jesus said, I will be with my church.  
 And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
But you see, Jesus had to die.  
It was important for him to die.  
And it was important for him to rise again.  
And he did.  
He said, I will build my church.  
But  
 It is his songs that are built in it.  
Are you hearing me?  
It is his songs that are built in it.  
Solomon asked God for wisdom because his father David taught him and said to him, wisdom is the principle thing.  
Therefore, get wisdom.  
His father David instructed him about the importance of wisdom.  
 When the time came that Solomon ascended the throne, God spoke to him and said, Solomon, ask whatever you want, and I'll give you.  
He remembered what his father taught him, and he asked for wisdom.  
And God granted him wisdom.  
Christ didn't wait for us to ask for wisdom.  
He became our wisdom.  
 He became our wisdom.  
So the Bible says, Christ has made unto you wisdom from God.  
So he's my wisdom.  
And the Lord said it, years ago, years ago, shortly after the middle part of 1981,  
 The Lord spoke to me in very clear words.  
And He said to me, He spoke to me from these verses that I just read to you.  
And then He instructed me.  
And He said, beard my church.  
Then He said, I want you to make it magnificent.  
 I wanted to make it beautiful.  
For it is the most beautiful thing in all the world.  
I knew he was not talking about when he was speaking to me.  
I knew he was not talking about a physical structure.  
Then he said, and this is remarkable because I look back at the things that God said to me in different years.  
In years past, I'm stunned.  
 How all of those things come to pass.  
I'm amazed.  
I'm amazed.  
He said to me, I have a help pass for you all over the world.  
He said, I know we'll join you and build the house of the Lord that should be built.  
Remember the numbers I just gave you.  
 Nothing of that nature has happened in our world.  
So many ministers of the gospel from different backgrounds, how can they just all come together like this and give so much support to the work of the gospel?  
It's the most amazing thing.  
And just like we read, David said to Solomon, I have hewers of stone, I have workers of all kinds.  
He said, they are without number.  
He said, they are all available to you.  
 And God said to me, I have all those who will help you.  
It says they're all over the world.  
So I knew from the very start.  


  
It's lying down in my room one day.  
And a minister of God came  
 knocked at my door and tapped without invitation.  
When he entered, he said to me, here's what the Spirit of God says.  
You will prepare my people for the coming of the Lord.  
Amazing.  
This was a year ago.  


  
 Years ago, I'm there thinking, what does this mean?  
What does this mean?  
This is 1986.  
What does this mean?  
I took it generally at the time, but I noted it.  
 And when I found myself teaching and preaching to the whole world and getting them set for the coming of the Lord, I remembered the word of prophecy.  
I remembered, but it was not the only one who said it.  
 those of others through the years who said precisely the same things.  
Prophecy is so important.  
It's so important.  
For example, I told you that we were praying and I said, we're going to sing the songs of God, songs of praise of Jesus Christ.  
 I said in the Middle East countries, right in their major cities, I said, we will.  
Now, February, I told you it was the month of songs, right?  
Then we had a program in Dubai.  
We arrived in Dubai.  
I couldn't even preach.  
 The whole program for today was singing.  
Singing and singing and singing.  
Six months later, they signed an accord with Israel.  
Now, these are important things.  
These are important things.  
I remember when I went to Zimbabwe, the Lord had said something to me.  
He said, there will be no change.  
 All right?  
Until you go there.  
He said, I will send you there at the right time.  
I wanted to go there.  
But the Lord said, no, I'll tell you when to go.  
Then I'm getting ready, doing some things.  
I was over in South Africa, and the Lord said to me, now I want you to go to Zimbabwe.  
I'm ready.  
I said, all right.  
I went to Zimbabwe.  
 And I said to them, I came for a reason God sent me because I knew and I was careful because politically they were charged on all sides.  
But I knew that all I needed to do was come there and carry out what the Spirit said to carry out.  
When I was done, six months later, there was a change in government which I knew was coming.  


  
 I said this for a reason.  
Prophecy is important.  
When we are guided by the Word of God as to where we should go and what we should do.  
And this year is a very special year.  
You have since learned about the things I told you in 2020.  
I told you that the work of God was going to collide with the work of men that advanced.  
 And I said, the work of men that had advanced in the positive and in the negative.  
And I said, it would collide with the work of God in 2020.  
And it did.  
And it did.  
But I told you what will happen.  
Now this is the year 2021.  
Isn't it amazing we are in 2021?  


  
And there were those who said,  
 that the churches of God will never meet again.  
Let me warn you.  
Let me warn you.  
You are not the first to think like that.  
Read your history.  
There are many who plan the annihilation of the church.  
 There were those who saw that they would destroy the church and that after they had done with the Church of Jesus Christ, people were not remembered that there were churches.  
The Church of Jesus has outlived them.  
And everyone who has that plan, the Church of Jesus will outlive you.  
Believe me.  


  
 Don't let any man push you against the churches of Christ.  
It doesn't matter what your political position is.  
Let no man push you.  
Refuse to accept anyone telling you to destroy the church.  
Whatever you want to do, but don't touch the church of God.  
Listen, what Jesus said was this.  
 He referred to his church as the stone.  
He said, anyone who falls under stone shall be broken.  
And anyone on whom it shall fall, it shall grind into powder.  
I want you.  
I want you.  
I want you.  
I want you.  
Leave the churches of Christ alone.  


  
 those in our ministry, and ministries all around the world who listen to what I tell them, I say this, don't criticize God's people, especially the ministers of God.  
I say, leave them alone.  
For the Bible says, whatever the do, the do unto the Lord, are you hearing me?  
You are not the one to accuse another man's servant.  
To his master, his stance of force.  
And he says, yeah, God is able to make him stand.  
 And I tell you, I said, don't join anybody to criticize other ministers.  
Don't do it.  
Don't do it.  
I said the same thing to family members.  
I said, don't criticize any minister.  
Leave them alone.  
Because there are curses against those who do.  
Then you find sickness never leaves your home.  
 There will always be some terrible thing about some members of your family.  
No, no, no, no, no.  
Don't join those who do.  
They're ignorant.  
They're ignorant.  
You may say to me, but not everybody who says it's a minisess.  
Leave that.  
That is not your business.  
Leave them with God.  
There's so much more for you to do.  
 than to find yourself going after the church of Jesus Christ.  
If Satan pushes you and you do it, you have yourself to blame.  
Just remember, the church can never and will never be defeated.  
It's impossible.  
It has a self-cleansing system.  
In other words, inside the church, there are those who don't truly believe in Jesus.  
 And they have come to positions of authority even inside the churches of Christ.  
And they join sinners to declare war against the church.  
They corrupt the church.  
But the church has a self-cleansing system.  
It cleanses itself and discourages them of itself.  
So we never have to bother about that.  
 So I have warned you, leave the churches of Christ alone.  


  
No, listen, listen.  
I lay my hands on people with terrible contagious diseases and they get healed.  
Are you hearing me?  
 And we have testimonies, medical reports, medical reports from different countries around the world.  
Some apart from lain hands on them, I only spoke on the phone.  
Then how can I, with the name of Jesus, become afraid of some virus?  


  
 He made us heal us.  
Are we supposed to deny who we are?  
Let me tell you, what they are setting up the church for is persecution.  
They are setting the church up for persecution because there are many of us who will never accept those things that are based on forest claims, will never, will never deny our faith in Jesus Christ.  
 So what that means is they're going to call us extremists, they're going to call us all kinds of names and set us up for persecution.  
That's what that means.  
But I'm not afraid.  
Neither are we afraid.  
No.  
A thousand times no.  
None of these things move me.  


  
 Now, go to Amos 4, from verse 7.  
The book of Amos, you became very quiet when I said Amos.  
You don't know where it is?  


  
Amos 4, from verse 7.  
 Now, I'm going to skip some verses because I don't want you to get confused along the part.  
So I'm going to start reading from verse 10.  
 I have sent among you the bestalens after the men of Egypt.  
Your young men have eyes slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses.  
And I have made the strength of your camps to come up onto your nushears, yet have you not returned unto me, said Lord.  
 I've overthrown some of you as God over through Sodom and Gomorrah, and you as firebrand plucked out of the burning, yet have you not returned unto me, said the Lord.  
Therefore, thus will I do unto thee, O Israel.  
And because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.  


  
 These are serious things.  
Number one, prepare your heart.  
Prepare your heart to serve the Lord.  
Number two, make preparation for the house of God.  
Are you hearing me?  
 David said, I have set aside so much gold, so much silver, so much.  
He prepared abundantly for the building of the house of God.  


  
Number three.  


  
 Ephesians chapter 6 verse 15.  


  
And your feet shut with the preparation of a gospel of peace.  
The gospel of peace is the gospel of Christ.  


  
Therefore being justified by faith,  
 We are peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
Number four, prepare to meet God.  


  
I said prepare to meet God.  
Number one, what?  
Come on, number one.  
 Number two.  
Number three.  
I didn't hear you.  


  
You didn't know how to put it.  
Number three.  


  
 I said, preparation of the gospel.  


  
So what would that mean?  
Prepare with the gospel.  
Because it says, your feet shot, your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel.  
 meaning that you prepare with the gospel.  
It's about reaching out how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of them that publish peace.  
Let's say unto Jerusalem thy God reign it.  
Remember that?  


  
And number four.  
Say it again.  
Prepare to meet.  
 My brothers and sisters, 2021 is the year of preparation.  
It is the year of preparation.  


  
 In heaven, preparation is being made.  
And I looked, and all over the world, angels are out preparing people, preparing people, preparing people, preparing people, helping with the work of God, all over the world.  
I saw them working and working and working as though the things around them didn't matter.  
 They were not distracted with the activities around them.  
They were just busy preparing people.  
Why are they ignoring the things around them?  
They said, this is more important.  
We're getting them set.  
Why?  
The Lord is coming soon.  
I looked and behold, in the world of darkness, preparations were taking place.  
 I said, why are they preparing?  
What are they preparing for?  
They said they are preparing for war because they know their time is short.  
Then I remembered the Bible actually tells us that Michael and his angels, they fought against the dragon and his angels.  
Oh, so they also are preparing.  
In the Spirit, we have entered into the hour  
 We have ate that into the time of preparation.  
How long?  


  
Listen, don't miss God.  
We are in the closing  
 period of the world.  
We are in the ending times that the Bible speaks of.  
And the forces of darkness are pulling together all their arsenal to see if they can pull just one more resistance.  
But the Lord has said they don't stand a chance.  
 They don't stand a chance.  
Why don't they stand a chance?  
Because the church is walking in sync with the Father, in sync with the Son, in sync with the Holy Spirit.  
We're in sync with the heavens right now.  
 We're in the timing of God, Mandukorabaka City.  
We're in the timing of the spirits, right now.  
Right now.  
Likarabaka City, kirabados.  
Don't be confused at all.  
 Don't be confused.  
We just came through the year of perfection.  
Now I look back and I understand.  
There was an alignment.  
There was a perfection.  
There was a synchronization.  
And we got synchronized with the perfect will of the Father in timing of the spirits.  
And we are there right now.  
We are there right now.  
We're in the place where we should be right now.  
 Right now in the Spirit, the church is in sync with the Spirit of God right now.  
And when you are in sync with the Spirit of God, you're in the place of perfection.  
This is when we are right this moment.  
Right this moment.  
And the glory of the Lord.  
 will be revealed in this church like never before.  
And as a move of the Spirit, you heard the numbers that I was given the moment to go.  
The works of God that took place in 2020 when we didn't even, we couldn't have even planned all of that.  
But what is coming in 2021 will even surpass that.  
 by the Spirit of God will even surpass what you heard.  
A quick work will belong to you, and it will cut its shawn in righteousness.  
For all that earth is mindset alone.  
Yeah, the pillars of the earth belong to him.  
He has established the world of wonder.  
It's all his, and for none other.  
And he will not give his glory to the gods of darkness.  
 But rather he will execute judgment.  
The idols of the nations.  
 But the time is short.  


  
 The time is short set below.  
The time is short.  
Be faithful and fulfill that which I've called you to do.  
Fulfill your ministry.  
Fulfill the sculling.  
Do what I've actually to do.  
For the time is short set below.  
Walk in love.  
Walk in faith.  
Walk in my Word.  
Walk in my light.  
And do not pay attention.  
 to those who seek to destroy, for they have no power to destroy.  
I am with you always, even unto the end of the age.  
So says the Spirit of God unto you.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  


  
 Right now,  


  
 If you have never made a definite commitment to Jesus Christ, if you have never received salvation the Bible way, I call on you right now to receive salvation.  
Say these words after me and mean them from the bottom of your heart, and God will hear you.  
Say, O Lord God, I believe in Jesus Christ with all my heart.  
 I believe Jesus died on the cross to save my soul.  
I believe God raised him from the dead and he's alive today.  
I confess with my mouth, Jesus Christ is Lord of my life from this day.  
And in his name, I receive  
 eternal life into my heart.  
Thank you Lord for saving my soul.  
I have eternal life now because I believe in the name of Jesus.  
Thank you Lord.  
I have eternal life now.  
I'm a child of God from this day.  
I am born again.  
 Amen.  
Praise the Lord.  
If you pray that prayer, I want you to know that God heard you and that He answered you.  
I want to pray for you right now.  
Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, I pray for everyone who prayed that prayer.  
Everyone who made the decision to receive Jesus Christ as Lord.  
Into their hearts.

 Satan has no claims about them anymore.  
They belong to Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God.  
I bless them with your word.  
I bless them with your love.  
I bless them with your grace.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus, Amen.
