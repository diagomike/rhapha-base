title: September 2022 â€“ The Month of Meditation and Declaration
---
 And today, I want to share some things with you.  
You know, the month of August was a month of meditation.  
And we come into September.  
And what is it?  
All right.  
First, let me begin sharing thoughts with you from last month, which was meditation.  
 So we begin Proverbs chapter three and verse number three.  
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee.  
Bind them about thy neck.  
Write them upon the table of thine heart.  
 Now, if you read like this, you will think he is telling you to bind mercy and truth about your neck and write mercy and truth on the table of your heart, but not quite.  
This is verse three.  
So go to verse one.  


  
 Verse two, for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee.  
Now, I want you to follow this teaching of God's word because it's going to help you tremendously.  
Let's go again from verse one.  
It says, my son, forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments.  
 For Lent of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee.  
Hm.  
Lent of days, long life and peace shall they add to thee.  
All right, next verse.  
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee.  
Bind them about thy neck.  
What does he want you to bind about your neck?  
 the commandments.  
Write them upon the table of thine hearts.  


  
Okay.  
Now go to Deuteronomy chapter six.  
 Verse six, we're just gonna look through a couple of verses here.  
And these words which are commanded these days shall be in thine heart.  
Did you see that?  
Proverbs chapter six, verse 20.  
My son keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother.  
Bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck.  
Did you see that?  
It's about the commandment.  
 And he told the fathers to teach their children, told the parents to teach their children God's commandments.  
So it's not just mother and father's commandments, no, they are commandments that they received from God to be delivered to their children.  
Go to chapter seven, Proverbs chapter seven, verse number three.  
 Okay, again, he starts to bind them upon thy fingers.  
What in the world must he be talking about?  
Verse one, keep my, this is my son, keep my words and lay up my commandments with thee.  
Do you see that?  
Keep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine eye.  
Bind them about thy fingers.  
Write them upon the table of thine heart.  
So you see, it's about God's word.  
It's about God's word.  
 So I'll go back to Proverbs 3, verse 3.  
And he says, let not mercy and truth forsake thee.  
Mercy and truth.  
The word for mercy is Hasid.  
Hasid means not just mercy, it actually means a covenant kindness.  
It means covenant kindness.  
That was translated mercy there.  
 It says, let not covenant kindness and truth.  
And truth is referring to faithfulness and conviction, the stability of the heart on true information.  
You become unshakeable.  
It says, don't let that leave you.  
Bind them about thy neck.  
Write them upon the table of thine heart.  
 All right?  
Okay.  
So, first Samuel chapter 18, let's go there from verse 1.  
And it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul.  
 when David had spoken to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan, Jonathan was Saul's son.  
Saul was king of Israel at this time.  
He was the first king of Israel.  
And Jonathan was his son.  
That means that Jonathan was heir-aparect.  
He was heir to the throne of Israel.  
But Jonathan, after watching how David slew Goliath, and he just loved the guy.  
 All right?  
So, Jonathan, the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David.  
And Jonathan loved him as his own soul.  
Wow, when the prince loves you.  
Not just the prince, but the heir to the throne.  
Okay, next verse.  
And Saul took him that day.  
King Saul took David that day.  
I would not let him go anymore to his father's house.  
Then, Jonathan and David made a covenant.  
Here's what I want you to begin to watch.  
 Jonathan and David made a covenant.  
Now David comes with nothing.  
And here's the prince who brings David a shepherd boy into a covenant with himself.  
So David doesn't have anything to give the prince.  
The prince brings everything.  
Watch.  
Next verse.  
 And Jonathan, go back to verse three, so you see the reason for the covenant.  
Then Jonathan and David made the covenant because he loved him as his own soul.  
Jonathan loved David as his own soul.  
Isn't this what God says?  
Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself.  


  
So it's not impossible, don't say,  
 That's what God said.  
Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.  
So Jonathan loved David as his own soul.  
Look at the next verse.  
And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David.  
And his garments, even to his sword and to his bow and to his gavel.  
He gave all of them to David.  
Next verse.  
And David went out.  
 He doesn't say David gave him anything.  
He got everything from Jonathan and David went.  
That's remarkable.  
So there's a covenant between them.  
Something happens years later.  
Go to chapter 23 from verse 16.  
Years later,  


  
 Now, before I take you to what happened years later, I think I should read this to you.  
From verse 16, and Jonathan's son arose and went to David into the wood and straining his hand in God.  
At this time, Jonathan found out Saul had become mad against David because the women caused trouble when they began to sing  
 Saul has slain his thousands and David, his 10,000s.  
And Saul said, what?  
They ascribed 10,000s to David.  
And to me, they ascribed only 1,000.  
So he got offended.  
And from that day, David became persona non grata.  
Okay.  
So, next verse.  
So, Jonathan,  
 knew his father.  
Maybe I should give you a little bit of that story.  
On one occasion, Saul wanted to kill David.  
So he, in fact, it happened twice.  
The Bible says David, David was saved from Saul twice.  
He threw his javelin  
 He said, I was smiting to the wall.  
I remember Saul was a man of war.  
He was head and showed us above everybody else in Israel.  
He was the hugest guy in Israel.  
Imagine when that guy throws a javelin at you.  
He was a man of war.  
He was not supposed to miss, but God saved David on two occasions.  
He fled.  
So one day,  
 Saul said to his son, Jonathan, he said, don't you know that as long as David lives on earth, you will not be established?  
He said, you are full.  
You are given the opportunity to David.  
That means you can become king.  
We have to kill him.  
 Then Jonathan said, father, what has he done?  
Then he threw the javelin at.  
That's the boy he wanted to become king.  
He threw the javelin at him.  
He almost killed his son for asking, what has David done?  
How much love is that?  
I thought he wanted to save him alive so you become king.  
Now he wants to kill him.  
That's how far human love goes.  
 It's not good enough.  
If you offend them, they get angry.  
They change suddenly.  
In a way, verse 17, and he said unto him, fear not, for the hand of soul my father shall not find thee, and thou shall be king of Israel.  
Who's talking?  
Jonathan!  
Jonathan says to David,  
 Fear not, for the hand of Saul, my father shall not find thee, and thou shall be king of our Israel, and I shall be next unto thee."  
He says, and that also saw my father knows.  
Isn't that touching?  
Verse 18, and day two made a covenant.  
This again, they made a covenant again before the Lord, and David aboard in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.  
 Wonderful.  
So, years later, 2nd Samuel chapter 9, from verse 6.  
Now, when Mephiboshet, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come onto David, he fell on his face and did reverence.  
What happened?  
What happened to Mephiboshet?  
Good, verse 1.  
And David said,  
 And David said, and David said, this was after David had become king.  
And David said, is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul?  
That I may show him, Hasid.  
The word that was translated mercy that you saw in Proverbs, Hasid, I told you is covenant kindness.  
 sometimes translated loving kindness.  
So he says, is there any left of the house of Saul that I may show him covenant kindness for Junatan's sake?  
He thought everybody in the house of Saul was dead.  
This was yours later and so many things that happened.  
He says, is anybody there because I owe Junatan something?  
We're in a covenant.  
 Next verse.  
And there was of the house of Saul, the servant whose name was Ziba.  
And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Adao Ziba?  
And he said, like 70s here.  
And the king said, is there not yet any of the house of Saul that I may show the kindness of God unto him?  
 And Zeva said, onto the king, Jonathan had yet a son, which is lame on his feet.  
Now they tell you the story, how he became lame.  
All right, go on, next verse.  
And the king said unto him, where is he?  
And Zeva said unto the king, behold, he is in the house of Macare, the son of a male in Lodeba.  
Then King David sent and fetched him out of the house of Macare, the son of a male from Lodeba.  
 Now, when Mephiboshet, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came on to David, he fell on his face and did reverence.  
And David said, Mephiboshet, and he answered, behold, I serve it.  
And David said unto him, fear not, for I will surely show thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake.  
La quorum, I see your back heart is.  
And we restore to thee all the land of Saul thy father.  
And thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.  
 And he bowed himself and said, what is that servant?  
The thou shoulders look upon such a dead dog as I am.  
Then the king called Zebra, Zebra, saw a servant and said unto him, I have given unto thy masters, saw all that patented to Saul unto all his house.  
And he told that Zebra, he said, you go and make sure everything is secure and serve him from now on.  
 So my people shit was promoted to David's table.  
There's a whole lot of story about my people shit.  
You know, the Bible tells you what happened afterward and so on and so forth.  
And, you know, but what I wanted you to see was how David had to also recognize  
 that covenant kindness.  
Because of the covenant that they had made, there's a kindness that follows it.  
And the Bible tells us, Jonathan gave David everything, including the throne.  
He said, you will be king over Israel.  
He was the heir-apparent.  
 What he had made of covenant with him is that you will be king and I will be next to you.  
There's much more to be said about Jonathan, but not in today's discussion.  
But here's what I want you to see.  
Go back to Proverbs chapter three in verse number three.  
 This is like not mercy and truth for safety.  
And then he says to bind the commandments.  
All right, God's word about thy neck.  
Write them upon the table of thine heart.  
Write them upon the table of your heart.  
Then he says, next verse, so shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.  
Remember, the Bible says about Jesus that he  
 was in favor with God and with men.  
And you know, of course, there are sons of Billio who will never accord you any grace or goodness, but that doesn't matter.  
That doesn't matter.  
What you do is you follow what God says.  
He says, so shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.  
 You want good favor to follow you in your life?  
Do you know there are people who face terrible things in their life, they always face, you know, the bad stuff.  
They always have, they're in a job, somebody hates them, doesn't want them on the job, they kick them out.  
They're people who have had several jobs.  
They just can't hold a job because, you know, somebody doesn't like them, they always run out of favor.  
 Things always go bad.  
So they say, why is my life like this?  
Why do I go through this?  
Why?  
There's a way to change everything.  
And that's what I'm showing you in the word today.  
That can be a sudden change, a sudden transformation.  
Look, so shall now find favor.  
When you're in favor with God,  
 If, because David was in favor with Jonathan, Jonathan would give him everything.  
In fact, one of the portions I was about to read to you, I'll just tell you the story, which you can find for yourself later on, Second Samuel chapter 21, when you read from verse one, the Bible says that there was a famine  
 in the days of David for three years of famine in the days of David, famine.  
That means that there was hunger.  
That means that there was shortage of food.  
 for three long years.  
What would the people have been thinking about David?  
What would have been thinking?  
These things happen in different nations and the leaders have no clue what to do.  
But David, the Bible says, David prayed, David and quiet of the Lord.  
He prayed, Lord, why?  
What's the cause of this problem?  
Why are we going through this?  
Why are we having this famine?  
 Because they're supposed to be raining season, dry season, winter, summer, cold, heat.  
How can it just be dryness throughout?  
He prayed, and the Bible says, and the Lord answered and said, it is for Saul.  
Now, by this time, Saul was long dead.  
 And God said it is for Saul and for his bloody house because he slew the Gibeonites.  
Who were the Gibeonites?  
The Gibeonites were Amorites.  
In the days of Joshua, long, long, long ago, can you imagine that?  
Many years before.  
In the days of Joshua, as they conquered different lands, as they were moving into the Promised Land,  
 They got to this place and these Gibeonites came to Joshua and said, we live very far away.  
We learned something about you and we just thought we can come and help and we can become stone coders and water drawers and anything you want us to do, what we'll do.  
All you do is you just make a covenant with us to protect us and we'll be happy with that.  
So Joshua,  
 Believing them, Joshua and the leaders of Israel, believing them, made a covenant with them.  
Because they thought that they were far away.  
Because they were destroying all the nations that were near.  
And claiming the lands.  
Only to find out later that these Gibeonites were actually among them in their own place that they had conquered.  
And Joshua was upset.  
And called them and said, why did you lie to me?  
 They said, because we were afraid.  
And the people were angry with Joshua and the leaders.  
Because now they have to stay with this.  
What do we do?  
They can't kill them because they have signed this pact.  
They have made a treaty with them.  
So they allowed these amorites, these Gibeonites, to live among them.  
 and to become stone quarters and all kinds of things, they served indeed a lot of things for the children of Israel.  
So years later, in the days of Saul, as Saul was conquering and God was using him, the Bible says in his zeal for Israel, he killed several of the Gibeonites.  
He forgot the covenant that Joshua had made with them and killed them.  
 Many of them in his zeal to please the Israelites.  
And what happened?  
Years later, the visitation came.  
We have to understand how the kingdom works, God's relationship with man, and what God expects between human beings.  
Remember, he is the judge between human beings.  
 When he brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, he said, I will not give you the promised land all at once.  
He said, I will give it to you piece by piece until you're strong enough and many enough to occupy it all.  
What was the real reason?  
Something had happened.  
Years earlier,  
 He said to Abraham, I give you all of this land as far as you can see.  
But you can't take it yet.  
He said, because the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.  
In other words, God was measuring their sense.  
He said, the iniquity is not yet full.  
When the iniquity is full, I will take action.  
And I will dispossess them.  
 But right now, the iniquity is not yet full.  
So I can't give you their land, but I've promised it to you because I see their sins and their cup will soon be full.  
Jesus also said the same thing.  
He said to the Jews, you have judged yourselves.  
You have said that you are the children of those who killed the prophets.  
He said, fill up then the iniquity of your fathers.  
 that upon this generation will be visited all of the debt, the blood of all the prophets slain from the foundation of the world.  
So from righteous able, even onto Zachariah the son of Barakiah, whom you slew between the porch and the altar, that all these things shall come upon this generation.  
He said, fill up then the iniquity of your fathers.  
 which means that God was saying to them, just continue your evil ways.  
When your copy is full, I will take actions against you.  
So God said in the Old Testament about the Amorites, and Jesus said it over in the New Testament about the Jews.  
But we see a story here that saw  
 did what he shouldn't have done against the Gibeonites, but they were not visited in the days of Saul.  
Rather, they were visited in the days of David, and they would go through so much drought, so much famine, so much hunger.  
Sometimes some things happen to some families, and they have no clue why, because nobody's asking why.  
If you ask, God will tell you,  
 There are things that people have done and hurt other people.  
They never cared.  
Maybe.  


  
Some parents who were in the court and destroyed other people's children.  
 expecting that their children will do well, you position your own children.  
While you destroyed others, don't you know that there is a measurement of sin?  
At the appointed time, actions will be taken, not by those that you have afflicted, but by the laws of God that he has put in the world.  
 God said to David, it is because of Saul and his bloody house.  
Saul and his bloody house.  
He called it a bloody house.  
Was your grandfather's house a bloody house?  


  
Was your father's house a bloody house?  
Did you come from there?  
Or you think it doesn't matter?  


  
 There are things that happen.  
David himself was not suffering it, right?  
But it's a corporate sin because Saul was king of Israel.  
He's a corporate sin.  
And that's what sorts of things that happen to a whole family, can happen to a whole nation.  


  
When you are a child of God, because you're born again, you are a watchman.  
 So you're like, David, you ask the Lord.  
Is there anything that can do about it?  
You pray He will give you guidance.  


  
And the Lord gave David guidance.  
Incidentally, He asked the people, He said, what do you want us to do?  
How can we settle it?  
They said, well, we don't want money.  
We don't want anything.  
Just give us seven sons.  
 of soul, the man who hurt us.  
And the first person that came to David's mind was Mephiboshette, because he was a grandson of soul.  
You know what David did?  
David protected Mephiboshette.  
He says, because of Jonathan.  
He protected him.  
 And they found others and delivered to them.  
But the Bible specifically tells us that David saved Mephiboshet because of Jonathan.  
Hallelujah.  
How God loves us.  


  
Okay.  
 He said, write the commandment so that favor will come to you.  
Good things will happen with you.  
He says, write the commandment on your heart.  
How will you write God's commandment on your heart?  
How?  
Go to Psalm 45, Psalm 45 from verse one.  
My heart is indicting a good matter.  
 A good matter, a good thing.  
In that rahaj, rahaj means to compose.  
It means my heart is composing a good thing.  
My heart is composing something.  
How does your heart compose something?  
Through meditation, through contemplation, is in your heart.  
 You're musing over it.  
See, you're contemplating it, composing it, constructing it, inside.  
It says, my heart is composing a good thing.  
My heart is composing a good thing.  
 I speak of the things which I have made touching the king, concerning the king.  
My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.  
Did you see that?  


  
My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.  
The word is Mahir.  
Mahir refers to skilled.  
It means to be skilled.  
 Scared, skilled and diligent.  
So my tongue is the pain of a skilled and diligent writer.  
So how do, if my tongue is a pain?  
Of a skilled and diligent writer.  
And it says my heart is composing a good matter.  
 My tongue is a pen.  
So I'm meditating, but how can I write it so that it's not just there, nebulously?  
Because I use my tongue to write it.  
How do I use my tongue when I speak?  
 See, my tongue is the pen for writing on my spirit, on the table of my heart.  
My tongue is the pen for writing on my heart.  
You want to write something in your spirit?  
Use your mouth.  
Use your tongue.  
Use your tongue, and it will stay.  
Use your tongue.  
Hallelujah.  
 Your tongue, your tongue is your spiritual pain.  
Hallelujah.  
Your tongue is your spiritual pain.  
And this is very important.  
Now, there are benefits for this kind of meditation.  
I told you there are three levels of meditation.  
Okay, Psalm 119, from verse 97, let's read, we'll read quickly.  


  
 Oh, how love I thy law.  
It is my meditation all the day.  
I love God's law.  
He says it is my meditation all the day.  
All right.  
 Thou through thy commandments.  
Thou through thy commandments has made me wiser than my enemies.  
How would you love to be wiser than those who reproach you?  
How would you love to be wiser than all your adversaries?  
How would you love to be wiser than your competitors?  
How would you love to be wiser than your enemies?  
Is this my enemies I have always made?  
But thou has made me wiser than my enemies.  
 Hallelujah.  
So I'm smarter than my enemies.  
So you see, you're not afraid of your enemies, because you're wiser than them.  
Hallelujah.  
Next verse, look at it.  
I have more understanding than all my teachers.  
I have more understanding than all my teachers.  
Lake Cara Baba Messiah.  
More understanding than all my teachers.  
Why?  
It says because your testimonies are my meditation.  
 What are the testimonies of God?  
They are the proclamations of God.  
The testimonies of God are the proclamations of God, the declarations of God.  
They are the testimonies of God.  
They have more understanding than all my teachers.  
For that testimonies are my meditation.  
Hallelujah.  
If you're not meditating on the word, how can you know even what your teacher is teaching you?  
Much less have more understanding.  
 Next verse.  
I understand more than the ancients.  
More than elderlies.  
I understand more than the ancients because I keep thy precepts.  
I keep thy precepts.  
So I have better understanding than the ancients.  
That's powerful.  
That's powerful.  
Just your chapter one.  
Just your chapter one verse eight.  
 Remember it, remember it, remember it.  
Since this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth.  
You see, it's in your heart, but don't let it get out of your mouth.  
That means, talk it, talk it, talk it, talk it, talk it.  
You may have it in your heart, but until you talk it, you are not writing it on your heart.  
God told them, make sure this thing is in your heart.  
You're gonna have to write it.  
 with your pen, your tongue.  
Now it tells you, this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth.  
Remember, he's not talking now about out of your heart.  
This is out of your mouth.  
It should not leave your mouth.  
That means keep talking it.  
Keep saying it, keep talking, keep talking, talking the word.  
Not your experience, talk the word.  
 Not the pain, talk the words.  
Not the circumstances, talk the words.  
You know, sometimes I want to minister to some people.  
They want to first tell me the whole condition so that I can understand it.  
And I'm trying not to hear their condition.  
Because if I listen to their condition, you remember the story of one guy.  
He said he saw one man trying to jump into the river.  
 he observed it and he thought, let him go and help him.  
So he went and they tried to counsel him.  
But that guy said this because he don't understand my story.  
So he decided to listen to him.  
After listening to him, both of them were ready to jump in.  


  
 So they want to convince you of the seriousness of their problem.  
God is not trying to understand the seriousness of your problem.  
Don't look at the seriousness of your problem.  
Look at the power of your God.  
Look at his love.  
Look at his willingness to help you.  
 Shut your eyes against the trouble.  
Shut your eyes against the condition.  
Shut your eyes against the darkness.  
Shut your eyes.  


  
Be like Abraham, I believe God.  
And I say against hope, I believe in hope.  
Against hope, I believe in hope means in spite of the hopelessness of the situation, I believe hopefully.  
 That's what he's saying.  
I believe in hope.  
I believe in what I see, in the Spirit.  
And I'm holding on to it.  
I'm holding to my hope.  
The Bible says, he's tugged not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith.  
Giving glory.  
Mash a karabadi, it was.  
Giving glory to God.  
In that kind of situation, when I give you the bad news, you shot your door.  
You start praising God.  
Say, God, you are the only one I'm seeing in this situation.  
 I see you only.  
I hear you only.  
I see you only.  
I hear you only.  


  
Look at Joshua chapter one, there's eight.  
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouths, but thou shall meditate there in day and night.  
Why?  
Look at it.  
It says that thou mayest observe to do.  
 He didn't say so that you will do.  
No.  
He is not asking you to do.  
He says so that the doing will happen.  
That thou may observe to do according to all that is written therein.  
He says, if you meditate, your life will necessarily happen according to what you meditate.  
You will go in this direction and you will see it.  
 He didn't say, if you meditate, then obey it.  
No, he says, if you meditate, it will happen.  
You will observe to do.  


  
 Keep the Scripture on the screen.  
Just keep it there so they can see it.  
It says that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein, for then thou shall make thy way, not God.  
So when we are praying for success, when we're praying for victory, we're praying for the wrong thing.  
Why?  
Because it's not God who is going to do that.  
He has told you how to make it happen.  
 He says, so are you.  
Listen, Joshua was the leader of the whole Israelite army.  
He was leading the whole people.  
They're gonna meet enemies.  
How can he win?  
Remember, Moses was trying to pray to God before the Red Sea.  
The Bible says, as he began to pray to God, God said, Moses, don't pray now.  
Don't call on me now.  
 God said, Moses, stretch your hand over the water and divide it.  
He says, don't pray now.  
Don't call now.  
This is not the time to praise us.  
Do something.  
He thought God should do something.  
But God said, Moses, do something.  
He says, stretch your hand over the sea and divide it.  
He didn't say, stretch your hand over the sea and I will divide it.  
We want him to divide it.  
But God said, Moses, divide the sea, divide it.  


  
 Now again, he tells Joshua, this book of the law shall not depart or lie out, but thou shall meditate there in day and night, that thou may as observed to do according to all that's written there in, for then thou shall make thy way prosperous, and then thou shall have good success.  
You will make your way prosperous.  
Do you want to make your way prosperous, or do you want to be praying?  
I ask people, what do you want?  
Prayer or action?  
 Do you want the answer or do you want the prayer?  
They want to carry prayer like this.  
You can carry the prayer.  
That will not help you.  
No, because prayer is not something we carry.  
When we pray, we are talking to someone that's listening to us who already knew your problem before you started the prayer.  


  
 The Bible says all the promises of God in Christ are yes, and in him a man to the glory of God.  
All his promises, no need to say to him, oh God, don't disappoint me.  
All his promises in Christ are yes.  
 Yes.  
Yes.  
As far as what you want is consistent with Christ.  
Yes.  
The answer is yes.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
Including Mashaka Rapadalabaha'i.  


  
Nothing is too good for you.  
Hallelujah.  
All right.  
 The principle is clear.  
Psalm 49, Psalm 49 verse 3.  
My mouth shall speak of wisdom.  
My mouth shall speak of wisdom.  
And the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.  
My mouth shall speak of wisdom.  
How can my mouth speak of wisdom?  
 because I have it in my heart.  
I have the wisdom of God working in my heart.  
You see, if you meditate on God's word, God's words will reside in your heart.  
And when you speak, it will be the words of wisdom.  
That's very important.  
All right, look at this beautiful thing.  
I shared this with you many years ago, probably  
 That's years ago, maybe early 2000s or somewhere, many years ago.  
All right, let's look at it.  
Proverbs chapter 16 from verse 29.  
A violent man enties at his neighbor and leaded him into the way that is not good.  
A violent man.  
Have you seen them?  
Violent guys.  
They recruit others into their violence, into their wickedness.  
 A valent man enties at his neighbor and lead at him into the way that is not good.  
Your son used to be a good boy.  
Now he's a bad boy because he's following bad guys.  
And you wonder what happened.  
Look at it.  
Because he's a friend of that violent boy in the neighborhood.  
So now that other guy is leading him into the way that is not good.  
 Why is that life like that?  
He tells you there's a principle of life.  
Look at the next verse.  
This violin guy, how he lives.  
He shot at his eyes to devise froward tanks.  
Now the word froward means to be habitually rebellious and opposed to authority or to good things.  
That's what it is to be froward.  
 So he says, he shot at his eyes to devise foul things.  
He's just used to being wicked, rebellious, opposed to good things, opposed to authority.  
He's headstrong all the time.  
He has what the Bible calls his Tony heart.  
 So when he shuts his eyes, the Bible says he devises.  
That means he imagines, he imagines, froward things, which means wickedness is in his heart, rebellion is in his heart.  
So moving his lips when he talks, he brings evil to pass.  
Look at that.  
He says his touch on his heart.  
 And his lips go in that direction.  
Moving his lips, he brings what evil to pass.  
Now, a few translations don't understand this metamorphosis of evil.  
So they translate it with the wrong synonyms.  
And the translations become almost like senseless.  
But the King James gets it very, very clearly.  
It gives you the best  
 rendering of the verse from the Hebrew.  
He shot at his eyes to devise froward things.  
Moving his lips, he bring it evil to pass.  
I want you to look at it from the other side.  
What if you shot your eyes to devise positive things?  
Good things.  
When you move your lips, you bring what?  
Good things to pass.  
Because this is very consistent with the words of Jesus, as a man thinks.  
 So is he.  
Jesus said something.  
He said, if you have, says a good tree, bring it for what?  
Good fruits.  
An evil tree, bring it for what?  
Evil fruits.  
Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.  
So out of the abundance of your devising, your imagination,  
 Your meditation, you bring forth.  
So that's why we wrote the book, The Power of Your Mind.  
What you can use your mind to do, the good that you can bring into your life with the power of your mind.  
 So much, most people don't know that the mind is given to them as a tool.  
They just use their mind to think anything.  
Anything that comes with them, and they just think.  
Something just passes, then they think.  
They think like this.  
Then they look at the watch, all kinds of videos on the internet, and all they can think about is what they watch.  
Then they think, think rubbish.  
What do you think your life would be out of the abundance of what you've been thinking?  
Is what you will bring forth.  
It can be better.  
 Your life is the character of your thoughts.  


  
You're still out there?  
Okay.  
So even in Genesis, when you read in Genesis chapter one, the Bible says, the spirit of God, there was darkness.  
The earth was without form and void.  
And the spirit of God moved.  
He says, the spirit of God, fluttered, fluttered.  
 Bruted, that means that the Spirit of God was incubating.  
Have you ever seen a hen sitting over eggs to incubate until the eggs hatch out chickens?  
Without that incubation, it will not happen.  
 So he says, the Spirit of God flooded over, brooded over, to incubate over the earth.  
And then finally, God said, let there be light.  
That means he shot his eyes and devised what the earth should be like.  
All that creativity will begin to take place shortly in the next few verses.  
 brooding over, brooding over, then moving his lips, he brings good things apart.  
Let there be light, and there was light.  
And then from then, let there be, let there be, let there be, let that be, let that be.  
But all the time before he spoke, it was meditation.  
Meditation.  
Are you still out there?  
That's why.  
 This month is the month of meditation and declaration.  
You are about to declare something.  
Are you hearing me?  
The level of meditation has moved forward.  
You are about to declare something.  
 through that meditation.  
Something is going to happen in your home, in your life, in your body, in your school, in your spirit.  
Something is going to happen in your city, in your nation.  
Something is going to happen and you will bring it forth by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
Oh, Hallelujah.  
 the Makurama, Sandalabaha.  
The grace of God is at work in your life.  
It's your month.  
It's your month.  
And you will effect changes.  
It's your month.  
It's your month.  
Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
It's your month.  
It's your month.  
 and any day in the month that the Spirit of God tells you fast, go ahead and fast, because sometimes you will need to fast or meditate, you know, and you need to fast to contemplate and bring it to the level where you can speak.  
 When you're fasting like that, you shut your door and you're speaking, you're speaking.  
That's still meditation, but this is the higher level of the meditation where you are now talking out.  
You're talking out, you're talking out, ah, my shikah, my, my, my, and the Lord will put words in your heart and before long those words will come to your mouth.  
 And you start declaring them, declaring them, declaring them, releasing words into the realm of the spirits.  
And when the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth.  


  
 When you're declared with your tongue, it is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.  
It is written.
