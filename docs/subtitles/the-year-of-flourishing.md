title: The Year of Flourishing
---
 2017 is the year of flourishing Now we have released the rumor  
 The Rema has come out.  
2017 is a year of flourishing.  
That word has come out because we received the Rema from God and now we've spoken it into our lives and into our future.  
The rest of 2017 was complied.  


  
 Go rid of God!  
Once again, history was made as millions all over the world.  
Across different time zones and seasons, gathered in one spirit with unity of faith and purpose at the superlative December 31st New Year's Eve service with the man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Thousands joined Pastor Chris at the Majestic Love World Convocation Arena in Lagos, Nigeria, while millions of people participated in the service live via major satellite, terrestrial and cable television stations.  
Radio stations on the Internet, Stadia churches as well as designated viewing centers around the world.  
This single service was the biggest event in the whole world on that night.  
 from different parts of the world.  
Many expressed their heartfelt expectations for this single-life service and for the new fast approaching year.  
From South Korea, welcome to December 31, New Year Eve service with Pastor Chris.  
 We are so looking forward to receive the World of the Year 2017 from the Man of God.  
We are so sure that the year 2017 will be so wonderful, glorious and even much greater than year 2016.  
I'm from Toronto, Canada.  
I'm looking so forward to tonight's New Year's Eve Service with Pastor Chris.  
 It's going to be a night of expectations and greater glory.  
I know 2016 has been a wonderful, awesome year of spreading and tonight there's going to be even a greater dimension of blessing and just  
 beyond words and beyond our comprehension.  
And I'm looking so forward to the destiny that God has called me into for 2017 and into the lives of others.  
Thank you so much, Pastor Chris.  
I love you.  
God bless you.  
Happy New Year.  
 Hello, my name is Boris, I'm a member of Christ Embassy Germany in Bremen and my expectations for the service with Pastor Chris is to get a good start in the new season of our life with the Word of God and to lay the new year in God's hand completely.  
 My expectation for 2017, let's start from 2016 first.  
Thank you for everything what we have got till now.  
It was a year of spreading and we have spread well.  
For 2017, my expectations, oh, Lord, it's to have much more blessings like this year and the years before and pass the grace you're teaching.  
That is what I'm waiting for because we are growing.  
 Thank you for this privilege and Happy New Year!  
 First of all, I would want to take this opportunity to thank our dear man of God, Reverend Dr. Chris Oyaki-Mome.  
Thank you, sir.  
So as you declared that 2016 was a year of spreading, indeed it was a glorious year where we experienced expansion, victories like never before.  
And as I'm going to step into 2017, I'm working with that same grace, sir.  
Thank you for believing in us, sir.  
We love you.  
 India loves you.  
I'm hearing Toronto Canada is actually freezing.  
However, I'm seriously excited, super excited for the word that will come from our men of God, Pastor Chris, that will usher me into 2017.  
Now 2016 was a marvelous year.  
It was the year of spreading and whoa what testimonies and we did spread.  
 2017.  
I know it's gonna be even a greater year because our latter days shall be greater than our former.  
Wow, Pastor Chris Sir, I'm here.  
My spirit is open.  
I'm so receptive and I'm ready for 2017.  
World watch out.  
We're coming big.  
Glory be to God.

The BLW Anthem was sung with joy and pride  


  
 You hear me go, lie for me then.  
All we know is that I'm all you need.  
All we share, all we know.  
All we know is love, all we know.  


  
 Oh, oh, oh  


  
 There were moments of heartfelt worship where everyone literally poured out their hearts to the Lord in sheer gratitude for a remarkable spreading impact in 2016.  
All other special presentations lined up for the Superlative Night was divinely orchestrated to create the perfect atmosphere and aura for the global congregation to receive the prophetic word and message for the year 2017.

 You have it all No, I'm not dead Can you take it from me to love?  
Doors out will run to you No, in possibilities You were born You were born to fly  
 What if I told you mountains have been moved?  
What if I told you you're not afraid of?  
No, no, no.  
I came to tell you you're more for this.  
I came to tell you your tenness might be upon your life.  
 You will shine through it all As you stand on all is His word, in victory We can match it all Once you have Jesus, you have it all  
 No, I'm not dead, can take him from his love.  
Cause I'll roll the line to you.  
No, it must have been a tease.  
You were born.  
You were born to fly.  
Oh, it's you and Jesus.  
You and we are.  


  
 I'm not deaf, you take a promise, love.  
Yours are all good unto you.  
Oh, if all of you sneeze, you are born.  
You are born to life.  
Yes, today was great.  
 But it later is greater Yesterday was beautiful But it gets better I thank the Lord for everything I'm forever grateful For the things that you've done And higher I go, brighter I go  


  
 No stopping me, no, no Higher I go, brighter I glow For what I go, no stopping me Take a look at me, I'm big, I'm so mad

 The beauty of my life and the glory, the glory of the Lord.  
Anything I touch on is mine.  
And the glory, the glory of the Lord.  


  
 Take a look at me and be what I'm like.

Take a look at me.  
I'm strong.  
There's a mind.  
Yes, today.  
Oh, yes, my life is so long.  
God is safe.  
Grandma finds our way.  
 Another major segment in the night's event was the Future Africa Leaders Award, followed, where the ministry recognized 10 young Africans who have demonstrated exemplary leadership and impacted the lives of many young people in the continent.  
The winner of the Fala Stop Rise Award, 2016, all the way from South Africa, Miss Karen Musonza.  
 Let me hear your words.  
Let's give a incredible message.  
Ms.  
Cara Busso from South Africa.  


  
 Since inception, this initiative has birthed more young African leaders who have taken the reins of leadership.  
As the clock ticked in the last few minutes of the outgoing year, the man of God, Pastor Chris, led the congregation in a prayer of Thanksgiving, and we crossed into 2017 gallantly.  
Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's 2017!  


  
 We are here!  
It's 2017!  
We are here!  


  
 And you know, something beautiful.  
You know, when I say Happy New Year, it's not, it's not a normal, it's not an ordinary, usual greeting.  
No, it's a word under the anointing of the Holy Ghost.  
Happy New Year.  
Happy New Year.  
Happy New Year.  
 So it's going to be a happy New Year for you.  
It's going to be a happy 2017 for you.  
I know what you're waiting for.  
You want to know what is the Lord saying about 2017?  


  
 You really want to know?  
Oh blessed Lord Jesus.  
How great thou art.  
How great thou art.  
Thou at awesome, awesome and wonderful.  
Precious to us.  
Thank you Lord.  
Amen.  
 They're gonna all result at the redegos, so short.  
Legarando gazestera, y gazesteradilos.  
Paronde zogos de paraptar alagistas.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Glory to God.  
What is 2007?  


  
 Are you ready?  
I love it.  
I love it.  
I love what the Lord said.  
I love it.  
I'm so powerful.  
So powerful.  
So powerful.  
I know you're saying, tell us, just give it out.  
Somehow, I'm sure that many of you would have already received a signal.  
 Am I right?  
A lot of you already have it inside you.  
Because the Holy Spirit's been witnessing your spirit as to what it is.  
Lagrondas gave a Alistace.  
Turning to your Bible now.  


  
Psalm 92.  


  
 Psalm 92 and we are reading from verse 1.  
It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord and to sing praises unto thy name almost high.  
To show forth thy loving kindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the sultry upon the harp  
 with a solemn sound.  
For thou, Lord, has made me glad through thy work.  
I will triumph in the works of thy hands.  
O Lord, how great are thy works.  
And thy thoughts are very deep.  
That means very profound.  
A British man.  
Know it not.  
Neither do the fool understand this.  
 When the wicked spring gas the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish, it is that they shall be destroyed forever.  
But thou, Lord, at most high, for evermore, for lo thine enemies, O Lord, for lo thine enemies shall perish, all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.  
But my horn shall thou exalt, like the horn of an unicorn,  
 I shall be anointed with fresh oil.  
My eyes also shall see my desire in my enemies, and my ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.  
The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.  
He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.  
 Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.  
They shall still bring forth fruit in all age.  
They shall be fat and flourishing.  
 to show that the Lord is upright.  
He is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in Him.  
2017 is the year of flourishing.  


  
 What a world.  
What a message.  
What a people.  
What a year this will be.  
In Fort Hall Court, Nigeria.  


  
In Wurley, Nigeria.  
In Johannesburg, South Africa.  


  
 You see, when we say the message of the year, I've told you before, we're not just talking about the title.  
It's not a title, it's not a topic.  
It's much more than that.  
It's an insight into what the Lord is doing with us, through us, and for us in the year.  
It's His direction.  
 And that's why it's so important.  
There are people who don't care about that.  
It doesn't mean anything to them.  
But it does mean a lot to us.  
It does mean a lot to us because God gave the moon, the sun, the stars to set and regulate times and seasons in the earth.  
 times and seasons don't exist in heaven, they're in the earth.  
They help us, like the Psalms, the teachers to number our days.  
That means teachers to account is an accounting word.  
That means to schedule our days, to plan our days.  
So, good planning is important.  
 Hallelujah.  
Number one.  


  
In letting you understand this, one says it's a year of flourishing.  
Okay?  
Flourishing.  
The three key things that are important to this.  
The first one takes luxuriant growth.  


  
 Luxury and growth.  
And notice it says they shall flourish like the palm tree.  
What's so special about the palm tree?  
It's the way it grows.  
The palm tree doesn't have recognition of the seasons.  
It thrives, whether it's dry season or it's raining season, doesn't care.  
It just keeps going.  
It leaves evergreen.  
 and the different types of palm trees, the different types, different species.  
And generally, they can grow very tall.  
Some of them get as far as 200 feet tall.  
That's amazing.  


  
And whether it's rain or shine, they thrive.  
 He says, you're going to flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar and leban, luxuriant growth.  
You're just going to grow like my goodness.  
What's happening?  


  
Hallelujah.  
Growing.  
You see, they're spreading.  
 And interestingly, one of the rare synonyms of flourishing in the Hebrew word is spreading.  
Which means the spreading continues.  
The spreading continues.  
And then not only do you grow laterally like that, you go upward as well.  
 What's that telling us?  
Something beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.  
It is the year of luxury and growth.  
That's number one.  
Number two, it is the year of significant attainment.  
Significant attainment.  


  
 like that pantry that reaches high heights.  
It attains to high heights.  
Get ready for significant attainments.  


  
God wants to do marvelous things as great things are about to happen.  
Great things are about to happen.  
 significant attendments, not just attendments, but significance.  
So the first one is what?  
My year of luxury and growth.  
Number two, my year of what significant attendments, nothing will stop me.  
That thing doesn't exist.  


  
Number three.  
 It is my year, your year of persistent productivity.  


  
The weather doesn't count.  
The economy doesn't count.  
The country doesn't count.  


  
 Are you still there?  
So what are the three?  
Number one, what?  
Luxor and growth.  
My goodness.  
I'm growing big time.  
Number two.  
Significant attendance.  
Significant.  
News making attendance.  
 Significance.  
Significance.  
And number three.  
Persistent productivity.  
Persistent productivity.  
So might you agree with the word of God and prevail.  
Persistent productivity.  


  
 What does God want you to do?  
Very simple.  
You know, last year, I told you, in amazing 2006, since last year, it's gone forever.  
It's now called last year, amazing.  
I told you that you'd have to speak in tongues like never before.  
Speaking in tongues is so important.  
All right?  
It's so important.  
 But I'm going to tell you something you're going to add to that.  
You've got to speak in tongues like never before.  
I've got to tell you this.  
Too important.  
He says, this is the refreshing.  
Where would you make cost the weary?  
The rest.  
Hallelujah.  
And Peter called it times of refreshing.  
But it's more than the refreshing.  
First Corinthians chapter 14.  


  
 And we'll read the Amplifier translation.  
Verse four, he who speaks in a strange tongue, that's the tongues when we speak in tongues, edifies and improves himself.  
You want to improve yourself, speak in tongues.  
When you speak in tongues, it becomes sensitive to the things of the spirits.  
You know, there's some people who say, well, I don't know when God is talking to me, speaking tongues.  
 Your spirit becomes sensitive, sensitive to God, sensitive to spiritual realities, sensitive to the spiritual realm.  
By speaking in tongues often, speaking in tongues a lot, your spirit becomes sensitive to spiritual realities.  
This is he who speaks in a strange tongue, edifies and improves himself.  
 So this year you're going to what?  
Speaking tongues more than ever.  
Adify your spirits.  
Improve yourself.  
Turn to the book of Jude, verse 20.  
Still amplified version.  
I want you to notice this.  
You'd love it.  
He says, but you'd love it.  
 Build yourselves up.  
Found it on your most holy faith.  
Make progress.  
Rise like an edifice higher and higher.  
Praying in the Holy Spirit.  


  
Build yourselves up.  
Found it on your most holy faith.  
 What do you mean by most holy faith?  
Your most holy faith means your most sanctified faith.  
What does that mean?  
In our lives, at different times, we have done certain things as our act of faith.  
Sometimes your faith was not very high, okay?  
You did some things and sometimes your faith was really high and it did some  
 extraordinary things.  
Now, your highest faith that you ever expressed, God is saying, hey, build on that.  
That's your most sanctified faith.  
That means the faith that had no doubts around it, it had nothing like fear coming close to it.  
It was your highest purest faith.  
That was your best expression of your faith.  
 He says, build on that.  
Don't build on the lower one.  
Build on the higher one.  
Build on your most holy faith.  
How do you do it?  
Praying in the Holy Ghost.  
Through praying in the Spirit, you become not only do you have sensitivity of the Spirit, what happens is your faith is purified.  
Your faith is purified.  
 Praying in the Holy Ghost.  
Hallelujah.  
So, praying in tongues is important.  
I mean, why was Paul so successful?  
Why was he so successful?  
Simple.  
First Corinthians chapter 14.  
Go to verse 18.  
This is what Paul said.  
Look, read that for me.  
What does he say?  
Says, I thank my God.  
I speak with tongues more than heal.  
 How many had the boldness to tell that church?  
I speak with tongues more than all of you.  
It just tells us how much this man spoke in tongues.  
No wonder he was so successful.  
If you were speaking tongues, nothing will stop you.  
You'll be building your spirit strong if you were speaking tongues.  
Are you hearing me?  
So don't play.  
 Light on, speaking in tongues.  
Some Christians say it's not important.  
Well, they don't want to have a successful life.  
They say, oh no, it's not so important.  
You can speak in tongues sometimes.  
Well, if it is sometimes, look at it.  
Did you read what we just saw?  
He says, I thank my God.  
I speak with tongues more than you.  
Glory to God.  
No one, he was so successful.  
 You want to be very successful.  
2017 is yours.  
It's your year of flourishing.  
Flourish with tongues.  
Flourish with tongues.  
Speak with tongues.  
You say, if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit spreads.  
You see that?  
So it's not your head.  
It's your spirit that's praying.  
When you speak with tongues.  
Now, there's more.  
 So that's about time.  
You're going to have to do that more than even last year because I told you that was very important for last year.  
Here's what you're going to add to it.  
And this is so important.  
Don't miss it.  
You need it as you journey on your way in 2017.  
You're going to need this.  
You're going to need this.  
I want to show you something.  
And it's so powerful and so important.  
Book of Hebrews chapter number 11.  
You're still there?  
 Great.  
Let's read from verse one.  
Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  
For by it, by what?  
By faith is talking about faith.  
For by faith, the eldest obtained a good report.  
 It wasn't anything else.  
It was faith.  
They obtained a good report by faith, by the act of faith.  
Now here's the big thing.  
Verse 3.  
Read it one to go.  
Oh boy.  


  
 is through faith we understand that the words were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  
What is he saying?  
 Through faith, we understand that the words.  
Now, the Greek word that's translated words there is Aeon.  
It refers to your cause of life.  
How things go with you for your life, the direction of your life, the things that are going to happen with you and for you and about you.  
 And then also about your world.  
The world as it is, in its systems and direction.  
The different eras, when you say the life and times of Mr. So and So, that's Aeon.  
Mr. Jones Aeon refers to his life and times.  
The era of the  
 Roman emperors.  
How they lived and what they did.  
How?  
Where they fixed.  
Now, look at this.  
It says, through faith we understand that the words were frames.  
The word, the Greek word there is catatizo.  
It means to mend.  
It means to fix.  
It means to set in order.  
It means to arrange.  
It means to frame.  
 the words were framed, the eons were framed by the word of God.  
Now, here's something that's significant.  
What is translated word there is Rima, which is different from logos.  
 Now let me remind you, in St.  
John's Gospel, when you read chapter 1 from verse 1 it says, in the beginning was the word.  
There is talking about the logos of God.  
And the word the logos was with God and the logos was God.  
Now the logos of God became flesh.  
That's Jesus.  
 But now, what we're reading here in Hebrews is not talking about the logos of God.  
It's the word is rema.  
And rema is the word which God speaks, but he never addresses it directly to things.  
He addresses his word.  
 The Rhema, like Jesus' men shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.  
That's the Rhema of God.  
When God gives His Word to His prophets, He's giving them Rhema.  
When God speaks His Word to your heart, He's giving you what?  
Rhema.  
So, it's not Rhema that created the Word.  
 The logos of God created the world.  
In the beginning was the Word.  
And the Word was with God.  
And the Word was God.  
Okay?  
Then it says, all things were made by Him.  
Without Him was not anything made that was made.  
The logos of God made all things.  
But this is not talking about all things.  
This is not talking about the creation of the Word.  
It's talking about your life.  
How things go with you.  
 It's not about your words, how things work around you and about the things that concern you and your city, your life and times.  
 So, look at, I want you to look at something.  
From verse one, he says, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen in verse two, he says what?  
But eat the airdas obtained a good report.  
Isn't it talking about God?  
We're talking about the airdas.  
Then he goes to verse four, go to verse four, by faith, Abel.  
 offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than came.  
And this goes on talking about the great elders of the faith, what they did with their faith.  
So here in verse three, he says, through faith we understand that the words, the eons, the eras, the various eras that he's going to be talking about.  
He says, they were framed by the rim of God, which means these men of God had the rim of God and they framed their words.  
 would raima the word of God from their mouths, the word which they received from God by their spirits, and spoke that word out and corrected their times.  
Are you listening to me?  
I said, the only thing that is not under your charge is the life of another human being.  
 That's all that is not within our control.  
God doesn't give me control over your life.  


  
But everything else that concerns me, I have control.  
 But you see, you've got to grow your face, because faith is so important that too many people who play down on faith, and yet the Bible says, without faith it is impossible to please God.  
For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.  
Faith is important.  
You've got to use it, it says, but the errors obtain the good reports.  
 says through faith we understand that the words were framed, you're going to have to frame your future, frame your words, frame your words.  
How 2017 will be the year of flourishing for you is in your mouths.  
He has given it to you, which means that God's decision is that this year should be your year of flourishing.  
 How are you going to make it happen?  
It's in your mouth.  
It's right there.  
Now we have released the Rema.  
The Rema has come out.  
2017 is a year of flourishing.  
That word has come out because we received the Rema from God and now we've spoken it into our lives and into our future.  
The rest of 2017 must comply.  


  
 Glory to God.  
It's good to comply.  
And here it is.  
We are moving.  
This 2017 sets us into a new phase of the Battle of the Ages.  
Remember, we are engaged in a warfare.  
 Don't forget that.  
The Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers and the darkness of this world, and against spiritual wickedness in high places.  
Wherefore take on to you the whole ammo of God.  
Take on to the whole ammo of God.  
We're engaged in a warfare, but we're on the winning side.  
 We are on the winning side.  
I mean, think about it.  
None of those in our family truly ever failed.  
None of them failed.  
Think about it.  
Not one of them failed.  
Some of them made mistakes, but they didn't fail.  
They got up and kept running.  
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,  
 David, Solomon, and the prophets, Elijah.  
I mean, think about all this.  
Think about those wonderful kings, Jehoshaphat, Asa.  
Wonderful.  
Marvelous stories.  
 It's a beautiful thing that the Lord is doing in our day.  
2017 is Austrian in something.  
There are not too many times in the calendar of God who has things in the Spirit, sync with things in the earth.  
There are not too many times.  
But ever once in a while, it happens.  
And this is one of those times.  
 where we are entering a new phase.  
And in this new phase, tremendous things are going to happen.  
Let me help you get this.  
You know the Bible says, where sin did abound, grace did much more abound.  
We are seeing some of the most wicked, atrocious arts that man ever comprehended in our day.  
But I want to tell you something.  
 Satan is not more wicked than God is gracious.  


  
Did you hear what I said?  
Satan is not more wicked than God is gracious.  
If Satan can go this much in wickedness, God goes higher in his grace.  
 where sin did abound, grace did much more abound.  
God's grace is greater than Satan's wickedness.  
And because the iniquity of man has so increased, you know, Jesus said, because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall grow cold.  
What is happening in the realm of the Spirit right now is there are angels that the Lord has dispatched.  
 They are more fierce than the demons that are using those people.  
And because man has become so ruthless in his wickedness and evil, God also has decided to throw away the limits in his pursuit of souls.  
Something is happening.  


  
 He says it is not by might, it is not by power, but by my Spirit say it alone.  
So we're about to see the move of the Holy Ghost like never before.  
You are going to love the Word of God like you never thought possible.  
You're going to be so much in love with Jesus.  
 You're going to love the words.  
God's people are going to be passionate about Christ, about the Holy Ghost, about the written words more than ever before.  
That's going to come a hunger for the things of God like you never knew before.  
 You're going to be on your bed and you're just going to be dreaming about the Lord.  
Just loving Him, just being passionate about Him.  
There are many websites today that I use in insulting Christians.  
Many of those people are going to turn to Christ and many of those websites will change their function and begin to preach Jesus Christ.  
You will see it is about to happen.  
The Holy Ghost is about to knock down seven people into Christ.  
 like he knocked Saul of Tassus.  
He was making half-orc of the church, but the Holy Ghost went after him.  
 There's a move of the spirits that stick in place.  
Satan can't stand it.  
He can't stand it.  
Because you see, the Word of God is in our mouths.  
And we are speaking like never before.  
He said, in the last days, say it, God, I want to pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.  
The old men shall dream dreams and the young men shall see visions.  
Hallelujah.  
And the Holy Ghost is working in us.  
 I mean, something's been happening with me in the last four years.  
And it just, I thought maybe to soon stop nobody just kept on increasing.  
You know, the power, the fire of God's spirits, that works through my being.  
When I start praying, sometimes, and I'm just meditating, like coherence of electricity.  
Just going through my being.  
 There was a time when it used to be on my hand, but it's gone past that sense.  
It's just all through my body.  
And a lot of times I say, Lord Jesus, it's so much!  
It's so much!  
But I become so accustomed to it.  
It's always happening.  
It's always happening.  
And I'm thinking, what is this going to mean?  
What is this going to mean?  
 when more and more people understand the move of the Spirit of God.  
So that you can understand we are not ordinary beings.  
We are the living tabernacles of the living Christ, of the living God.  
He is not dead, he is alive, and he lives in every one of us.  
We're not ordinary people.  
Hallelujah.  
No one says, count it all joy when you go to drive a stess.  
Count it all joy.  
 Count it all, George.  
There's only a count it all, George.  
Luxury and truth.  
Momma.  
Significant attainment.  
Persistent productivity.  
Haha!  
Hallelujah.  
I can hear the spirit of the Lord.  
 Saying to me, where I'm heading to is greater than where I'm coming from The greater one lives inside of me I'm not moved by what I see I am born of God, I overcome the world  
 The vessel of the Lord is who I am Spirit of the Lord is in this place I can feel His presence everywhere I can hear the voice of the Lord say my time is now I flourish on every side  
 I flourish on every side My time is now I flourish on every side My time is now I flourish on every side Another day is here again And we keep spreading on every side  
 The glory of the Lord of days is greater than the farmer.  
So our God is more than me.  
Because we are born of God, we have overcome the world.  
The place of the Lord is who we are.  
 I can hear the voice of  


  
 And create your name resolve We will never fail, no, never We're blinded by the real side to lead, never without We will never fail, no, no, no, never  
 We're planted by the reamers, I believe that we are.  


  
 I am a blessing to my world, yeah, for each and every time  


  
 This year, we shall flourish like the palm tree, and because we are planted in the house of the Lord, we shall flourish in the courts of our God, 2017, our year of flourishing.
