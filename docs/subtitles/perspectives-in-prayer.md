title: Perspectives In Prayer
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 You see, the Word of God doesn't produce results just because it's there.  
It produces results when we receive it into us and act upon it.  
You see, you've got to understand it and act upon it.  
The Word doesn't produce results just because God said so.  
 And that's the mistake of a lot of people.  
They say, didn't the Bible say thus and thus and why isn't it working for me?  
It can't work for you just because it's there.  
You are the one to work out the Word of God.  
You're the one to do it.  
Life should be  
 Now, you know, when I say these, there are a few people who wonder what in the world is the same.  
When I say that life should be wonderful.  
Great all the time.  
And wean all the time.  
All the time.  
But it's not the experience of many.  
But why should your experience  
 be the interpretation of truth.  
Just because a lot of people don't have it that way doesn't mean it's not supposed to be so.  
Okay, just for the records.  
How many of you believe Jesus never exaggerated?  
He never lied to anybody.  
Agreed?  
 Sure.  
Okay.  
Would you turn into your Bible now and let's look at St.  
John's gospel?  
The 16th chapter.  
Have you found it?  
All right.  
Now, let's go straight to verse 23.  


  
 Jesus is talking to His disciples, and we get to His statements from verse 23.  
Let's go.  
Want to go.  


  
Let me read what I think you saw.  
 You tell me if it's right.  
And in that day, he shall ask me nothing.  
Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.  
Is that what you saw?  
Now, what's Jesus saying?  
In that day, he shall not pray to me.  
Jesus here is teaching about prayer.  
He's teaching about prayer.  
 And he says, in that day, what day?  
Now, if you study the context, he's talking about the day of salvation.  
He's talking about the day of the church after his resurrection.  
He says, it's going to be a new day.  
Things are going to be different.  
 And when that day comes, when salvation is consummated, this is when that day comes, you shall not pray to me.  
I tell people, a lot of times they don't know why their prayers are not answered.  
Now as a baby in the things of God, you may get along fine for a while.  
 But after that while God expects you to grow up and have things changed.  
For example, according to this portion we just read, you're not supposed to pray to Jesus.  
Come on here.  
I know a lot of folks say, oh Lord Jesus, we just thank you in the name of Jesus.  
Stupid prayer.  
You cannot pray to Jesus in the name of Jesus.  


  
 Right?  
Yeah, it doesn't even make sense.  
He gave us the power of a Tony to use his name.  
He said to use his name.  
And you can't use his name to him.  
You can't talk to Jesus in the name of Jesus.  


  
 The Nigerian ambassador to the United States doesn't have authority to function as an ambassador in Nigeria.  
His job is in the US, not here.  
Hello?  
So he operates on behalf  
 of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Government of Nigeria, in the U.S.  
Not here.  
We don't need the Nigerian ambassador in Nigeria.  
Did you get that?  
He represents the country, the government.  
 in another country.  
So Jesus said, now you go in my name.  
And so you can't say, oh Lord Jesus, you know, people don't listen to their prayer when they pray.  
Oh Jesus, in the name of Jesus.  
And then they wonder why things didn't happen and the way they all happened.  
 And don't get the strong.  
See, sometimes even the Minister of God may pray wrongly for you.  
And you'll get a miracle.  
He might say, O Lord Jesus, hear this man in Jesus' name.  
You might get healed.  
But what you may not realize at that moment is that  
 He may be operating in a gift of healing.  
And the gift of healing doesn't require his prayer.  


  
Whether or not he prays, it'll work.  
And secondly, even in healing people, Jesus didn't say to pray.  
Don't you, Bible now.  
 Sir Mark's Gospel, chapter 16.  
Sir Mark's Gospel, chapter 16.  
Have you seen it?  


  
That's the last chapter of Sir Mark's Gospel.  
Okay, read from verse 17.  


  
 uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh stop did he say they shall lay hands on the sick and free he didn't say anything about prayer they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover said nothing about prayer  
 He didn't say, they shall lay hands in the sick and if they shall pray.  
No.  
Praise the Lord.  
So don't get it wrong and say, well, somebody said so in the name of Jesus, well, Jesus didn't work.  
Jesus here said, in that day, you shall not pray to me.  
So you don't pray to Jesus.  
 Watch now.  
Let's go again.  
Verse 23, chapter 16, St.  
John's Gospel where we read.  
Now, are you there?  
Okay, read it for me again.  
Uh-huh.  
Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever usual ask the Father in my name.  
That's it.  
So you pray to the Father in the name of Jesus.  
 Did you hear that?  
So, you don't pray to Jesus, you pray to the Father.  
Now, if you were to pray to Jesus, then what name?  


  
How?  
Then you have those who pray for Jesus' sake.  
They say, oh God, do it for Jesus' sake.  
That would mean Jesus is the one in need of it.  
 I can say, bless this food, O Lord, for Christ's sake.  
Wrong prayer.  
Bless this food, O Lord, for Christ.  
Jesus is not going to eat it.  
You are the one eating it.  
He's the blessed for your sake.  
You know, we do a lot of things without even thinking.  
And God said, my people suffer for the lack of knowledge, the lack of knowledge.  
 Let's look at it again.  
And in that day, you shall ask me nothing.  
Verily, verily, I see only you whatsoever.  
You shall ask the Father in my name.  
He will give it to you.  
Now, that's another thing to see.  
Whatsoever you shall ask the Father whatsoever.  
You've got to be big to make such a statement.  
You've got to be big.  
Nobody can say to you, ask what you want.  
 Hey, you don't know what I want, do you?  
What I want?  
Anything?  
Only God talks like that.  
What's so ever?  
You shall ask the Father in my name.  
Now, what is Jesus saying?  
He's saying my name is big enough before the Father for anything.  
That's the biggest name in heaven.  
 Whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, whatsoever.  
Does that include what you're thinking about?  
I know you're thinking.  
Does that include what you're thinking about?  
Somebody said, I really wish he was so.  
What, it's so?  
It's so.  
It's so.  
Jesus never lied to anybody.  
Look at it again.  
 Very, very assy on you whatsoever.  
You shall ask the Father in my name.  
He might consider giving it to you.  
He'll give it to you if you deserve it.  
You know, people pray, oh Lord, you know, I know I really don't deserve it.  
They think they're being humble, but they're being ignorant.  
That ignorance gone on rampage.  
They'll say, oh, I know I don't deserve it.  
 But I'm just asking you for Jesus' sake.  
I'm not worthy.  
You're not?  
So why do you want it?  
I'm only asking God for something very little.  
I'm not worthy of His attention.  
No, sanctimonious.  
You can't take...  
 Oh father, we thank you for this morning.  
We are not worthy to coming today.  
Glorious presence.  
It sounds religious and nice.  
But it's stupid.  
It sounds nice.  
So we want to pray and we're trying to get his attention.  
Just be sure we don't disturb anything.  
 and kneel down and try so much to ensure nothing dirty is in our minds.  
Oh, Father, accept that faithful servant.  
Here's the point.  
You were unworthy and undeserving  
 But Jesus took your place and died for you.  
He took your place and died for you.  
And God raised him from the dead.  
And he said, if you will believe that I did that for you and accept the new life that I give to you, then  
 You'll be a new creation.  
The moment you accepted that and confessed with your mouth the lordship of Jesus Christ over your life, eternal life was imparted to your spirit.  
You became a child of God.  
Now, you might have not felt it because he said nothing about feeling.  
You didn't have to feel it.  
 But if you confess his logic over your life, believing in your heart that God raised him from the dead, salvation is yours.  
And you are a child of God.  
And from that moment that you received Christ, you became worthy of his attention, deserving of his kindness and all of his blessings.  
Why?  
Because you are now in Christ Jesus.  
 Your righteousness is not the righteousness of your acts, but the righteousness of his act.  
So his righteousness has become your righteousness.  
So now you can act in boldness.  
You can ask for anything in the name of Jesus.  
 And you have God's full attention.  
Is that difficult?  
Doctor, is that difficult?  
No.  
No.  
No.  
Say this with me.  
Because I am in Christ, I have his full attention.  
 And so I am deserving of His blessings.  
Listen, you're no longer an outsider to Christ.  
You were brought by virtue of the new birth into His presence, into His kingdom, and there's where you live.  
Hello.  
You know, I've said many times that our religious thinking  
 destroys faith.  
And then we think we have faith.  
But faith must be based on accurate information.  
Otherwise, it's not faith.  
It's presumption.  
Faith must be based on accurate information.  
Now, if somebody lied to you,  
 that I said I would give you a 100,000 IRA tomorrow morning and that fellow lied to you and you began to expect that you were going to have a 100,000 IRA from me tomorrow morning, your faith is presumptuous.  
It's not based on accurate information.  
 You've got to have accurate information.  
This is what he said.  
And on the basis of what he said, I can expect.  
Praise the Lord.  
This is good.  
It'll get better in a moment.  
Watch this.  
What is in here is beautiful.  
You want to see more?  
 Okay, now remember we said, Jesus said here, whatsoever, whatsoever.  
That includes, say that includes what I have in my mind.  
That includes whatever I want him to give to me or do for me.  
Yeah.  
Whatsoever, whatsoever.  
Now somebody said, what if it's not God's will to give it to you?  
 I'll come to that.  
You might just be asking for something and it's not God's will.  
So, what is God's will?  
God's will.  
If that's what it means, that every time I want to ask, I've got to find out, is this God's will?  
What we just read, did he say anything about God's will?  
Did he say anything about that?  
Okay, why do you want to introduce that into the subject?  
 You're trying to include a clause that has no business being there.  
Now, there's only one place where he talks about the wheel being included in asking, and we will go there.  
We will go there.  
I hope we have the time.  
We'll go there.  
But let's finish this portion first.  
Are you still there?  
No.  
Because you see, when I'm through with this, I'm ready to ask.  
 And I hope you will be ready to ask Hallelujah.  
Whatsoever is your last the Father in my name.  
Whatsoever is your last the Father in my name.  
Whatsoever is your last the Father in my name.  
Whatsoever is your last the Father in my name.  
He will give it to you.  
 I like to map such things in my Bible.  
I hope you did.  
I like that on Mac.  
Okay, now verse 24 as another beautiful one.  
Would you read it for me?  
Want to go?  


  
Wow!  
 He says, up to now, you haven't asked anything in my name.  
You haven't prayed in my name.  
They didn't need to pray in his name.  
Now, this should take your mind, if you're a Bible scholar, this should take your mind quickly to when the disciples came and said, Master, the demons were subject to us in your name.  
Do you remember that?  
That was not prayer.  
That was not prayer.  
 And that will help you understand when Jesus said something about if he shall ask anything in my name, I'll do it.  
You remember that?  
That's not prayer.  
That's not prayer.  
We have a series of teaching on using the name of Jesus and  
 Another series on the wonderful name of Jesus.  
I'd like you to get those tapes or CDs or DVDs.  
They will help you immensely.  
They're enlightening you because we took several weeks to deal with that subject.  
All right?  
Several weeks to deal with that subject.  
And you need to understand that.  
Very important.  
 you would have an extraordinary faith and confidence in the use of the name of Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
So that was not prayer.  
That was making demands.  
Prayer is asking the Father.  
You ask, you make requests.  
That's different from using the name of Jesus as an instrument.  
 And he said, I'll be back of it.  
Using his name as an instrument.  
You know what it is to use the name of Jesus as an instrument?  
For example, I can come to you with a letter from someone asking me to come to you.  
And I tell you that so and so sent me.  
So I'm coming to you in his name.  
 Okay, to make requests for something.  
And you give it to me, not because of who I am as the messenger, but because of the one who sent me.  
You don't care who the messenger is.  
So you just give it to me.  
Because you respect the one who sent me.  
So whether or not you liked my look, even if I didn't seem to greet you.  
And I just came and you knew that that fellow sent me and you had respect for him.  
 It wouldn't matter to you now what my attitude was.  
You may tell him about my attitude later, but because of your respect for him, you'd give me what I came to ask for in his name.  
Right?  
Then there's another one.  
Here's a demand with the signature.  
And I come to you, don't even have to talk to you.  
 I'll show it to you, the moment you see that signature, you respond.  
Because you know that man's got power.  
So that signature there is an instrument.  
You see that?  
 Now, the name of Jesus, that's what Peter did when the man who was important in his feet never walked from birth, who was asking for arms at the gate of the temple called beautiful, when Peter and John were going to the temple at our prayer, and reached out his arms for the poor, arms for the poor, and Peter said, look on us.  
 Then he said, "'Snow and gold have I none, but such as I have.'"  
Notice he said, "'Such as I have, give I.'"  
Such as I have, give I thee.  
He didn't say, "'Such as God has.  
We will request of you.'"  
Was not a request, was not prayer.  
Then he said to the man, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.  
Didn't talk to God?  
 And then he lifted the man with his right hand.  
And when he did that, the Bible says his uncle bones received strength and he leaped up stood, never walked from birth.  
And right away began to walk.  
And the Bible says he went with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.  
 What did Peter do?  
He used the name of Jesus as an instrument.  
He demanded that the man be restored using the name of Jesus.  
In the name of Jesus, you make your demand.  
I command the cancer to die.  
You see, that's not prayer.  
And Jesus said, I'll see to you that it works.  
 Hallelujah.  
You use the name of Jesus as an instrument.  
Glory to God.  
You see, a lot of people suffer for nothing.  
They have this mighty, wonderful instrument and they don't know how to use it.  
They don't know how to use it.  
 I know how to use it, so I refuse to suffer in my life.  
I know how to use it.  
You want to use it?  
Use it every day.  
Use it.  
It's an instrument.  
Whatever you demand.  
 In that name, the Bible says, listen, I remind you of something.  
Jesus said something to His disciples one time.  
He said, you know what?  
Talking to His disciples.  
He said, you know what?  
The Pharisees seat on Moses' seat.  
Therefore, whatever they ask you to do, do it.  
But do not like them.  
Don't do what they do.  
For they say and do not.  
 That's remarkable, remarkable.  
He said, the Pharisees, seat on Moses' seat.  
In other words, dare represent Moses, dare represent the law of Moses.  
So, whatever they tell you to do, do it.  
Then he said, but you know them guys don't act like they took.  
So don't follow them.  
So he knew there weren't actinists that were supposed to.  
 And yet he ordered his disciples to respond to their demands because they sat on Moses' seat.  
You know what?  
One day Jesus was at some of his disciples and a voice spoke out of heaven and said, this is my beloved son.  
Here ye him.  
They heard it.  
 Peter said, we heard it when we were with him on the holy mountain.  
God spoke out of heaven to all creation to hear Jesus.  
Hear ye him.  
We know Jesus talked to water.  
Jesus talked to fish.  
Jesus talked to bread.  
Jesus talked to a tree.  
Jesus talked to the cops.  
 He talked to the wind.  
He talked to the waves, just about everything.  
And they responded to Jesus.  
He talked to blind eyes, deaf ears.  
He talked to maimed legs.  
The grief you can come today, it means, you see that?  
So in their minds, every time they pray, they come to God.  
As soon as they open their eyes, they walk out of God.  
 and do what they like.  
So life is different.  
So they're not in God all the time.  
I am in God all the time.  
See, that's the difference.  
I live there all the time.  
There.  
All the time.  
 But if you have to come to Him, Father, we come to You in the name of Jesus.  
We come.  
You're supposed to come once and never go away again.  
The day you're supposed to come to Christ is the day of salvation.  
When you come, stay.  
Then you will never have to pray that prayer a second time.  
I come to You.  
No, I am in Him.  
 Say, I am in Christ.  
Therefore, I am in God.  
Now, if you have this consciousness, where will sickness come from?  
No, talk to me now.  
What I'm sharing with you is to help you every day from where you are.  
If you would take a hold of it,  
 You know, I can come to church and pray for you.  
Just pray.  
And I have miracles up on that once.  
And then, you know what?  
When you go back home, after some time, you face neutral angels, then you need another injection.  
But you see, if I share the word of God with you, and you take a hold of it, you will have it for all time.  
All time.  
 See that?  
I believe the God is raising champions with you.  
Yeah, great men and women.  
This world hasn't seen anything yet.  


  
And you are going from one level of glory to another.  
Can you say, man,  
 So you put these principles to work.  
But these principles to work, you'd be amazed.  
You'd be amazed.  
Hallelujah.  
I just showed you those things.  
 He said, ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full.  
Now, the guy sitting there, he hasn't asked.  
And I did say that when we finish this today, we should be ready to ask that your joy  
 may be fooled.  
So, if you were listening to this and at your face, nothing in the words is powerful enough to deter you.  
Nothing.  


  
Nothing.  
From my teenage years, I began to say, teenage years, young guy,  
 I can do all things through Christ.  
I can't.  
Outside the world belongs to me.  
I can't.  
Anything is possible.  
Why?  
Because I found them in the world.  
It's in this book.  
Nothing can stop me.  
I'm on my way.  
From glory to glory.  
From success to success.  
I don't believe in failure.  
No.  
 Somebody said, well, yo, yo, yo, you win a few, you lose a few.  
No, I don't lose a few and win a few.  
I win all the time.  
All the time.  
All the time.  
Why?  
The thing to make it happen is in here.  
Is in here.  
When I meet obstacles, I do one of three things.  
 You remember?  
Talk to it.  
Or?  
Push it down.  
Or?  
You know that.  
You close your eyes.  
 Those are the biggest obstacles.  
The biggest obstacles really don't have any foundation.  
You don't need to push them.  
They are not real.  
Just walk through them.  
I told you, Satan doesn't like being ignored.  
He hates it.  
He hates it.  
He doesn't like being ignored.  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Ask and you shall receive.  
That's your joy.  
May be full.  
All right, I want my joy to be full.  
So am I going to ask?  
I'm going to ask.  
I'm going to ask without restrictions.  
I'm going to ask, what do I want?  
Hey, I want to ask.  
See, and your faith keeps growing.  
 Your confidence in the Word of God keeps growing.  
And you notice you're going for the bigger ones.  
Be bold, cast for the bigger ones.  
And you know what?  
The secret is this.  
Anything you ever desire is actually available.  
It is available.  
 Nobody can ask for the same thing in the same way, at the right time, at the same time, in exactly the same way as you.  
So don't be concerned about, what if I'm not the only one asking for it?  
Forget it.  
There has nothing to do with it.  
 Ten people may be asking for the same thing, but like that woman who had hemorrhage, the woman with the issue of blood, you remember, only one of the multitude, strong in Christ, only one said, if I may but touch the hem of his gamut, I shall be made whole.  
And she went through the press and touched and got healed.  
And Jesus said, who touched me?  
And the cypress said, Master, everybody's touching you and says, now, who touched me?  
He said, somebody touched me.  
 Many touched him and got nothing but one touch and got something.  
Who touched him?  
Is Jesus going to say that today?  
Who touched him?  
Hallelujah.  
How do you touch him today with your hearts?  
Glory to God.  
Hello?  
Are we ready to ask?  
 Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Glory to God.
