title: July 2018 - The Month of Laughter
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
Psalm 126, and Pastor Chiki will read for us from verse one.  
Thank you, Pastor Sir.  
 When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.  
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue was singing.  
Then said they among the hidden, the Lord had done great things for them.  
The Lord had done great things for us, where of we are glad.  
Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.  
They that sow in tears shall rip in joy.  
 And he that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.  
Oh, glory to God.  
You know, I wish I had time to expatiate on this portion of the Bible  
 You know, some 126 is not alone.  
It goes with 127 and 128, 129.  
These Psalms are actually together.  
And very, very powerful indeed.  
But let me go with you through verse one, and then...  


  
 or look a little farther.  
When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.  
It is when the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like dreamers.  
Here, it's not clear as to which particular captivity that the writer is referring to because Israel went into captivity several times.  
 on different occasions.  
So it's not clear.  
But it doesn't show something that they were in a terrible condition, in their need.  
They were taken away.  
They were in captivity.  
They were oppressed.  
And think about this.  
And suddenly, there was deliverance.  
 Now, the writer is looking at it in retrospect.  
He's thinking about what happened in the past.  
And he's thinking about, now we're in this situation, oh God, turn again our captivity.  
In other words, turn this evil away from us.  


  
Restore our fortunes.  
 Look at it again from verse one.  
He says, when the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.  
Then was a mouthful with laughter and our tongue would sing.  
Then said they among the heathen, the Lord had done great things for them.  
The Lord had done great things for us.  
Whereof we are glad.  
Then he goes, turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.  
So, south, he's looking at the desert.  
And  
 Who's going to the man's mind as he writes?  
He's thinking about the Lord had done and now he says, oh God, do it again.  
And then he goes on to talk about the various responsibilities, God's responsibility, man's responsibility, for example.  
 Imagine, he says, God has brought us back.  
He's turned again our captivity.  
We've been brought back from bondage.  
We've been released from exile.  
And we're back to our land.  
Praise God.  
It's wonderful to be back to your land.  
But you know what?  
 He opens, he opens 127 in verse one, and says, except the Lord build the house, the labor in vain that build it.  
You see, now you've come into your land, but you know, it's been ravaged.  
We've got to build a fresh, we've got to build new houses, new cities, because we're back in our land.  
 But accept the Lord builds the house, the labor in vain, that builds it.  
So He's telling us now that you're back into your land, you've got to live for God.  
You can't just rebuild your life without God.  
You need God to help you rebuild your life.  
Then He tells them, you know?  
 We were taken into captivity.  
Thank God we're back now.  
And we might say to ourselves, nobody's going to take us out of our land anymore.  
We're going to be watching.  
He says, no, accept the Lord, keep the city, the watchmen, wicket, but in vain.  
Then he says, I know you're thinking about you're going to work very hard.  
You're going to be very prosperous this time.  
He says, it is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows, for so he give it his beloved sleep.  
 This is God's going to give you sleep.  
You don't have to work until you've worked yourself to death.  
And then he says, now you've come back bereaved of your children.  
I mean, they smash their children against stones.  
They destroyed them when they took them into bondage.  
Now they've come back.  
So he says, listen, children are the heritage of the Lord.  
And the foot of the womb is His reward.  
He's letting them know God's going to give you children.  
Don't worry.  
Everything's going to be all right.  
 And it goes on with this blessing and goes into 128.  
Blessed is everyone that ferret the Lord.  
Now you back into that land, you got to walk in the field of the Lord.  
That walk in his ways, for thou shalt eat the label of thine hands.  
Oh, wonderful.  
You know, so I was telling you, reading those sounds together is really, really wonderful.  
It's beautiful.  
Very instructive, very enlightening.  
But we're talking about the month of July.  
 You know, the Holy Ghost is wonderful.  
No sooner had I gotten the words out of my mouth just to ask about the moment of July, then the Spirit said, why?  
It's the moment of laughter.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Yeah.  
 Glory to God.  
It sees the amount of laughter.  
And I want you in the light of that, I want you in the light of that, to go back to, go back to Psalm 126 in verse one, when the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, He says, we were like dreamers.  
 There was a mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue would sing in.  
This month, you're going to experience the miracle of power of God in a very special way.  
There are things that will suddenly happen, suddenly, suddenly.  
Suddenly, because the word, the word is gone false.  
The word of blessing is gone false.  
 and the manifestations of your faith you will see.  
Praise God.  
Sodden blessings.  
Sodden restorations.  
Sodden open doors.  


  
It'll be like a dream.  
You'd wonder, are you dreaming?  
Is this really happening?  


  
 This is happening in this month of July.  
Hallelujah.  


  
So it's a month of laughter.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Now share a laughter in our tongue with singing.  
Glory to God.  
Now here's something I want you to do.  
 in this first seven days of July.  
It's not hard, it's not difficult, just very simple.  
We're going to pray in tongues every day.  
This first seven days, we're just going to pray in tongues every day.  
So I'm going to send you outposts,  
 for the seven days.  
Alright?  
We'll start out tomorrow and we'll pray in tongues, throughout.  
We're just praying in tongues and praying in tongues and praying in tongues.  
Not asking for anything.  
Is it a month of laughter?  
We're just praying in tongues.  


  
 So each of those prayer sessions we're just gonna pray in tongues.  
Just praying tongues every day.  
Every day.  
Praying tongues.  
Praying tongues and praying tongues.  
Now if you haven't received the Holy Ghost, you can't pray in tongues.  
You got to receive the Holy Spirit.  
And He'll give you the ability to pray in other tongues.  
So I would say that in the churches, the pastors can give  
 and instruction for all those who have not received the Holy Spirit or who have received the Holy Spirit and still are not speaking in tongues.  
When we are through today, you should be asked to come forward somewhere where the pastor can minister to you.  
 to receive the Holy Spirit or the ability to speak in other tongues.  
Very important is a very special kind of prayer.  
And every Christian ought to have that kind of prayer.  
It's direct communication.  
Can you imagine that?  
With untainted language.  
Say, when you speak in tongues in your prayer, God, the words are chosen by the Holy Spirit.  
You're not using the language, the corrupt language of men.  
No.  
 You're using the language of the Holy Spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
So now, this is nice, really, really cool.  
Praise God.  
 Praise God.  
Praise God.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  


  
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.
