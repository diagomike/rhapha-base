title: Anticipating Evil Part 1
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 I want to share something with you this morning, a little bit, I don't use your subject, but it's important.  
You know, when you come to Christ and you are blessed, and life, you know, things go in a one of a direction, but then the process of development  
 is something a little different.  
It's not always exciting.  
You know, like they talk about teasing problems.  
That means when a child is beginning to grow teeth, there's some pains, there's some discomfort.  
But he will need them because there's some hard stuff he's going to have to eat and he will need the teeth.  
 Because he would not always take milk and custard.  
He would soon need something stronger, harder.  
You know what I'm talking about.  
And without the teeth, he can have that.  
The Word of God also has tough areas.  
 And so we must be built.  
We must be built strong.  
The Christian life is a marvelous life.  
But you see, in that path, are several challenges, several battles that are there.  
Even though God already pronounced you the victor, you've got to walk in that victory.  
You've got to have it manifested.  
 They're going to have to fight the fine of fate.  
My subject, anticipating evil.  
That's what I want to talk about.  
And dissipating evil.  
I told you is a rather unusual subject.  
Did you ever hear the expression, I smell trouble.  
 You know, because some Christians, many Christians really, have never been taught about anticipating evil and what to do, they get into trouble too many times.  
 It's not a problem to get into trouble.  
The problem is when you get into trouble, you don't know how to come out of it.  
That's where you really have a problem.  


  
It's not wrong about getting into trouble.  
So long as you come out of it.  
Praise God.  
May it take long, but come out of it.  
Win, that's it.  
 I'm anticipating evil.  
Let me read the scripture to you.  
Would you turn into the book of Proverbs?  


  
Somebody said, Proverbs is somewhere around the middle of the Bible.  
You just divide it into two and you're there.  


  
Proverbs chapter 22.  
Have you found it?  


  
 Read verse 3, 1, 2, go.  
Did you see that?  
A prudent man foreseeeth the evil.  
He can anticipate evil.  
 A prudent man anticipates evil.  
He foresees the evil and hides himself.  
But the simple pass on they go ahead and are punished.  
Sort of getting the trouble.  
And when God tells you anything twice, take it seriously.  
 That's one of the spiritual laws.  
If it tells you the same thing twice, you better take it very, very seriously.  
Why?  
Let me show you.  
Proverbs chapter 27.  


  
Read verse 12.  
One, two, go.  


  
 Exactly the same thing.  
Exactly the same words.  
From the same writer.  
The spirit prompts him to say the same thing again.  
A prudent man for see it the evil and hide it himself.  
But the simple passed on and I punished.  
 You know, when you have the Holy Spirit, there are many things that you begin to experience in your life.  
Because the Holy Spirit guides you.  
The Holy Spirit guides you.  
And if you want to live a very successful life, it's important that you learn  
 how to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit.  
You see, the Holy Spirit leads you, He guides you.  
You have to learn to listen to Him, learn to listen to Him in everything in life.  
Anything that's important to you is important to Him.  
 And He saves to guide you in the affairs of life.  
His responsibility in your life is to make you a success for God.  
That's His job.  
Can you see that?  
And of course, you know, He is the biggest.  
The virus is greater, is He that is in He than He that is in the world.  
That's the Holy Spirit in you.  
 is greater than the one in the world than whatever is in the world.  
And this greater one that lives in you has a responsibility of making you an absolute success if you listen to him.  
He'll make you a success in your life as a person, in your career,  
 You make your success in all your endeavors.  
This is his job.  
This is his responsibility.  


  
He desires to fulfill it in your life.  
It's his ministry.  
A man or woman that has the Holy Spirit has no reason to be a failure in life.  
No reason.  
 if you learn to listen to the Holy Spirit.  


  
Hallelujah.  
He knows what stage you're at.  
He knows where you are in life.  


  
And so he guides you, he leads you.  
Again, I said, if you listen to him, if you listen to him,  
 Because he'll talk to you.  
Hallelujah.  
Let me show you something.  
Would you turn to the Book of Romans?  
Chapter 15.  


  
Romans chapter number 15.  


  
 Here you have the apostle Paul writing to the Romans and at this time he seems to have a nagging, dampening feeling in his spirit.  
Listen to what he says here, from verse  


  
 Chapter 15 from verse 30.  
Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake and for the love of the Spirit that is trying to gather with me in your prayers to God for me that I may be delivered from them that do not believe into there.  
 and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints.  
That I may come on to you with joy by the will of God and may with you be refreshed."  
Did you see that?  
I'm going to Judea.  
I'm going to Israel, the land of Israel.  
He says, and I want you to strive together with me in prayers.  
 that I may be delivered from those who do not believe in Judea.  
He sends us some trouble over there.  
He knows he's still got some work to do, but he knows that except this kind of praying is done, he may never return.  
 So He says to them, I want you to strive together with me in prayers that I may be delivered from those who don't believe in Judea, and that the service that I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints.  
You see, even God's people, even God's people may not accept what I'm coming to Jerusalem to do.  
There's a spray to God for me that I may be delivered.  
 in that may return to you.  
Come back with joy.  
He anticipates evil.  


  
Sometimes you anticipate evil and you know, there's some people who just say,  
 First of all, it's important for you to understand there's a difference between being attacked by a spirit of fear and anticipating evil.  
They're not the same thing.  
Fear is an outside force.  
I hear me.  
Fear is an outside force.  
But anticipating evil is from within your spirit, recognizing the signals of the spirit within you.  


  
 Like some people hang on to a certain job for so long, even when the Spirit of God is telling them this is the right time to move to this or that or the other, they're not moving.  
They're so used to it, they wouldn't change until they lose everything at once.  
In one sweep it's all gone.  
The people who lost all their money.  
 They couldn't anticipate evil when the Spirit of God was talking to them.  
Now, this is the right time to do this.  
This is the right time to do this.  
And they thought, no, why would I?  
Everything else looks so nice from the outside.  
They couldn't anticipate evil from their spirits.  
And in one move of the devil, they lost everything.  


  
 Oh, they said so-and-so.  
A Christian, he had the Holy Spirit, a nice gentleman.  
He traveled to somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, for somebody's wedding and didn't return.  
How come he didn't anticipate evil?  
How come?  
Because most have never been taught along these lines.  
 and they are unable to separate fear.  
Like I said, I'm not talking about fear.  
There are people who wouldn't do anything because of fear.  
Fear is an outside force.  
You can easily recognize fear.  
Let me show you some nurse here.  
Turn to St.  
John's Gospel.  
Chapter 12.  


  
 An interesting situation here is something beautiful.  
Jesus had been preaching here.  
He had done some real big things.  
 when you studied this chapter.  
And then, let me read it to you from, you know, this is chapter 12.  
In chapter 11, you recall that he raised Lazarus from the dead.  
And so he had become very popular now, because he raised this man from the dead after the adberidium.  
 A lot of people have taken notice of him.  
So I'll read to you from verse 18.  
For this cause, the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle.  
 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Pecivi, how he prevailed, nothing.  
Behold, the world is going after him.  
The Pharisees were jealous of Jesus.  
And they said, look, the whole everybody is going after him.  
So they thought about killing Jesus.  
All right?  
But here, verse 20, and there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast.  
The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Betsida, of Galilee, and desired him saying, sorry, we would see Jesus.  
 And Philip come at, and tell it Andrew, and again, Andrew and Philip tell Jesus, you know, they come to tell Jesus, some Greeks want to see you, some Gentiles.  
They want to see you, sir.  
Jesus didn't see them.  
But he made a statement.  
I want you to notice.  
To him, this was a sign of something else.  
 from verse 23, and Jesus answered them saying, the hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified.  
Imagine that the answer, two of his disciples come to him and say, Master, there's some man outside, they are Gentiles, they want to see you.  
And then Jesus looks up and says, the hour is come that the Son of Man must be glorified.  
And they're wondering, oh, those Gentiles are going to glorify him, what's going to happen?  
And then he goes on talking, listen,  
 Verily, verily I say unto you, accept the corn of wheat.  
A corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, eat abided alone.  
But if he died, bring it for much fruit.  
He that love it his life shall lose it.  
He's preaching to them.  
I thought they just told him, some people want to see you.  
He's got a message for them.  
 25, he that love at his life shall lose it, and he that hated his life in this world shall keep it on to eternal life, or on to live eternal.  
If any man served me, let him follow me.  
And where I am, there shall also my servant be.  
If any man served me, him will my father honor.  
Read verse 27, everybody want to go.  


  
 Did you hear that?  
Jesus was troubled within.  
Jesus, now is my soul troubled.  
And what shall I say?  
Father, save me from this power.  
Now he anticipates evil.  
 You remember when he was arrested, he said to the soldiers, he said, this is your hour and the power of darkness.  


  
Now is my soul troubled?  
Have you ever been troubled from within and you didn't even know why you were troubled?  


  
Now is my soul troubled?  
 And then he prays a prayer, Father, save me from this hour.  


  
But then he says, but for this course came on to this hour.  
In other words, he says, I know this is part of my destiny.  
 And when you know that something is part of your destiny, you pray in a certain way.  
I'll show that to you.  
What can you tell if something is supposed to be in your way of life?  
You can be trained through the Spirit.  
 through God's world, to recognize those things that are part of your destiny, your God-given destiny.  
Did you know there are people who shouldn't ever come into your life?  
They're not part of God's destiny in your life.  
And yet they could be there.  
 And there are those that God chose to be part of your destiny.  
They would meet you at a certain point in life.  
As part of God's destiny for you.  
Somebody said, do you believe in predestination?  
And farically, yes, the Bible talks about it.  
It talks about predestination.  
But just because God  
 does predestinate your life.  
For certain events doesn't mean that you will always fulfill God's plan for your life.  
 Because I told you, there are two destinies.  
There's a natural destiny for every man, the way you're going to go because of several factors, your environment, the way you were raised, everything that has to do with the natural things of life.  
And then there's also God chosen, the God chosen destiny that only begins in your life when you give your heart to Christ.  


  
 But you've got to know it to walk in it, to follow in it.  
I've got to learn to listen to the Holy Spirit so that you only do those things that are consistent with God's calling in your life and so finding yourself in places you shouldn't be and so on.  
 He said, now is my soul troubled.  
And what shall I say?  
His father saved me from this hour.  
What an hour.  
What a moment.  
And when it's got to be, if it's got to be, then what you need is trained from within.  
Because sometimes, you know,  
 the tough times in life.  
And when you face tough times, it doesn't mean that something was wrong with you.  
It just means this is one of those things you're going to have to face and win.  
And your eyes must be on the goal.  
I'm going to have to win.  
Question is how?  
It's going to be tough, but I've got to win.  
 It's part of my destiny.  
I want to press true.  
I'll press true.  
And Jesus had that situation.  
Turned to St.  
Luke's gospel chapter 22.  
 First, let's read from St.  
Matthew, now go to St.  
Luke.  
So Matthew chapter 26, it's the same story, but different details.  
So I want to pick something from Matthew, and then I'll give you some detail from Luke.  
Are you here?  
Okay.  
So Matthew's Gospel chapter 26, we're reading from verse 36.  


  
 All right, I read to you.  
Then come at Jesus with them, with his disciples, onto a place called Gethsemane.  
And said unto the disciples, sit ye here while I go and pray yonder.  
And he took with him Peter in the two sons of Zabidi and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.  
Do you see that?  
He went to pray, but they noticed something different about Jesus on this occasion.  
 He wasn't praying in his usual way.  
There was a time to watch Jesus praying and he was jumping up.  
That's the way he was praying and rejoicing.  
But on this occasion, Jesus is dull, looking sorrowful and heavy.  


  
 They noted something different about Jesus and his prayer now.  
Verse 38, then said he unto them, my soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.  
Carry you here and watch with me.  
Did you see that?  
Then he stepped for a little and fell on his face and prayed, saying, oh, my father,  
 If it is possible, let this cup pass from me.  
Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou willed.  
What a moment this was for Jesus.  
A horrifying moment.  
He anticipates evil.  
Something terrible is about to happen, but he knows that  
 This is part of God's destiny for him.  
He has to go through.  
But how he wished it didn't have to happen.  
So when you're going through something that you wish shouldn't happen and yet in your spirit you feel like this is something I've got to face.  
What'd you do?  
What'd you do when you anticipate evil that's surely coming?  
 and you've got to face it.  
What did you do?  


  
What did you do?  
Like the young guy, 16 years old, his mother had died when he was much younger.  
At 16, his father died.  
 And he gave up on life because he anticipated so much evil.  
He knew life was going to be terrible.  
So he gave up in life.  
No.  
No.  
You make the right choices now.  


  
The guy who lost his job and because he lost his job,  
 And he had spent so long on that job.  
He said, at my age, nobody's going to give me a new job.  
I don't have enough money to start a new business.  
He was fed up.  
And he became sick very quickly and aged very quickly.  
He anticipated evil.  
He knew evil days were coming because now he didn't have any place to get money.  
No more work.  
 Any thought, it's over.  
What do you do when the evil that's anticipated is surely coming?  
You know you've got to face it, but to face it is not to destroy you.  
There's no evil that comes to you  
 And God allows it for your destruction.  
No, anything evil that ever comes to you was not meant to destroy you.  
Didn't you read what he said, no evil shall befall you?  
That didn't mean that evil will not come, but they would never have the upper hand.  
 against you.  
No weapon fashioned against you shall prosper.  
No weapon fashioned designed against you, mashingated against you shall prosper.  
It says, and nothing shall by enemies hurt you, by enemies  
 So no matter how they've been fashioned, they cannot destroy you.  
But you see, that works when you know what to do.  
Praise God.  
It works for you when you know what to do.  
Now look at Jesus.  
How am I going to go through?  
How would Jesus go through this thing without giving up?  
 What if on the cross, imagine when he started the first nail on his head while he was lying on that cross on the ground and he felt the terrible pain?  
What if he said, okay, okay, okay, okay, I'm not Christ, please, please.  
Enough.  
The pain's too much.  


  
Did you know he could have?  
Read your Bible.  
 He gave his life of his own free will, of his own free will.  
He said, this one thing I received from my father.  
He gave me the authority to lay my life down.  
In other words, I can decide if I want to or not.  


  
He was his choice.  
He was not fast.  
 That's when the Bible says, because he humbled himself onto death, God also has highly exalted him and given him a name that is above every name.  
God also honored him because he led down his life in extraordinary humility in spite of an extraordinary humiliation.  
 Lead down his life.  
Hallelujah.  
So here, Jesus brings this prayer.  
This is, if it be possible, let this come pass from me.  
And yet he hears himself to the Father's will.  
Taunterson looks gospel chapter 22.  
Go straight to verse 39.  
 St.  
Luke's Gospel, chapter 22, from verse 39.  
You know, if you keep reading the St.  
Matthew's part that we were reading, you see part of this story.  
But there's a detail that's here that's not in Matthew's account that I want you to notice, a very important detail.  
 So I read from verse 39, and he came out and went as he went to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him.  
And when he was at the place, he said unto them, pray that he had not into temptation.  
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed.  
We got them in Matthew's Gospel, saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me.  
Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.  


  
 Did you see that?  
And there appeared an angel onto him from heaven, strengthening him.  
And being in an agony, he prayed more endlessly.  
And his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.  
 Wow, as he prayed, he was sweating.  
The Bible says he prayed more endlessly.  


  
But they appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.  
Who's that angel?  
The Holy Ghost.  


  
 The Holy Ghost was strengthening him.  
When you come to that point of crisis and you pray, as you should pray, you will have the Holy Spirit strengthening you.  
And that's why he was praying like this.  
When he said, Oh God, save me from this hour.  
My Father, save me from this hour.  
 What an hour.  
When you come to a crisis point, a crisis moment, you need this kind of strength to go through.  


  
Fear is different.  
Fear makes you panic.  
This was not a man who was panicking.  
 He anticipated evil or right, but he was not panicking.  
He didn't push the panic button.  
He knew exactly what to do.  
He prayed until he was trained things by the Spirit of God.  
He was trained.  
Even though he was in agony, Paris is being in agony, he prayed more endlessly.  
 And what does the Bible see?  
The earnest prayer of a righteous man does.  
It makes tremendous power available, dynamic in its working.  
It makes tremendous power available.  
Hallelujah.  
What a moment.  
What a moment.  
What a moment.  
 Being in agony, he prayed more honestly, verse 44.  
And his sweat was at it where great drops of blood falling down to the ground.  
And when he rose up from prayer and was calm to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.  
They took, became sorrowful, but they didn't pray.  
What happened?  
They were so sorrowful, they fell asleep.  
Do you know?  
Yeah, but he said to them, pray that he entered not in the temptation.  
They could not anticipate evil.  
 They saw the Master was sorrowful and heavy-hearted and they were sorrowful, you know?  
Looking worried.  
Have you seen some people when something happens, all they just do is... Then they all go like this.  


  
 They're not doing what they're supposed to do.  
Jesus was sorrowful.  
Jesus was heavy.  
Jesus was in agony, but he prayed more endlessly.  
Just being in agony, he prayed more endlessly.  
He prayed more endlessly.  
The other ones went to sleep.  
He said to them, pray that you enter not into temptation.  
 Have you ever felt so bad about something you went to sleep?  
Hoping that you'd wake up and find you a dreamy.  
Just go like... Sleep.  
Or you just drive in your car, particularly to nowhere.  
 Just enter maybe a mechanic workshop and then it just comes around you to see, oh God, oh God.  
Your doors are still locked.  
Just relax your chair and sleep.  
Like the whole world is lost.  
He says pray that you enter not into temptation.  
 They didn't pray, they slept.  
Let's read them.  
Have you seen it?  
Verse 45 again, and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, and he said unto them, Why sleep ye?  
Rise and pray lest ye hear and into temptation.  
In St.  
Matthew's gospel, he added something there.  
 Would you go there?  
26, Matthew 26.  


  
I want to read to you from verse 40.  
We already read to verse 39.  
Verse 40, St.  
Matthew's Gospel, chapter 26.  
Are you there?  
And he come it unto the disciples and find out them asleep and say it unto Peter, what could you not watch with me one hour?  
 Watch and pray that he ate or not into temptation.  
The Spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.  
The Spirit is willing.  
I know you would like to pray.  
I know you would want to do anything about it.  
But you see, the flesh is not allowing it.  
 Have you ever tried to pray, and your body did not allow you?  
It goes called a bakah wa shalama siv.  
Ma ma ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
Ma ma shig habari wa siv.  
 to rest your back.  
Before long, just go on your chair.  
Then you finally stretch out.  


  
The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is not allowing him.  
Did you ever have an experience in your sleep?  
 And, you know, something, whatever it was, you were trying to open your mouth to talk.  
Your mouth was heavy.  
You couldn't open.  
And you wanted to raise your hand.  
It was so heavy, you couldn't move it.  
You felt the struggle.  
 Some people have reported that they have this thing pressing on their chest.  
They want to shout Jesus.  


  
Do you know what's happening?  
The spirit wants to respond, but the flesh is sleeping.  
The flesh has not been dominated and controlled by the spirit yet.  
 His flesh is still having the upper hand over his spirit.  
And so that is so difficult for him.  
 So difficult for him.  
He's awake in his spirit.  
He knows the battle is on.  
He knows what to say.  
He knows what to do in his spirit.  
But he has not learned how to control his body.  
And so the body still has the mastery.  
So he's trying to make his body do something.  
To say something, the mouth will not allow him.  
The tongue is snippet.  
The hands are snippet.  
Finally, he's able to say, jeez.  
 Then the devil goes away and he wakes up.  
You know more, Jesus.  
You know more, Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
You see, the Spirit, the Spirit,  
 is alive, the Spirit is awakened, the Spirit is willing, the Spirit is powerful, the Spirit is knowledgeable, but the flesh is weak and not under the control of His Spirit.  
Learning to tend  
 The flesh and his senses is one of the Christian's exercise.  
That's why, you know, Paul wrote a Timothy and he says, bodily exercise is wonderful.  
He says, but godliness is profitable onto all things, having the promise of the light that now is and the one that is to come.  
So he said to him, therefore, what exercise yourself onto godliness?  
 Exercises yourself onto godliness.  
There are things you do.  
For example, memorizing Scripture is part of exercising yourself onto godliness, training your brain to keep scriptures.  
Even though your scriptures, you keep in your heart, in your spirit, you also train your brain to hold them.  
You see that?  
Exercising yourself onto godliness.  
 Like when you were learning two times one, two, two times two, four, two times three, six, two times four, ee, two times five, 16.  
This is... 16?  
Sorry, sir.  
Sorry, sir.  
Two times five, 12.  
This is 12!  
Sorry, sir.  
You're 10, five.  
After a while, you crossed that path.  
 You knew it.  
Even if you were sleeping, you could get it.  
Where did you put it?  
You see it?  
The same way you memorized things in the Word of God.  
You put them in your heart and then in your head.  
Exercise yourself onto godliness.  
So when we say, let's fast and pray.  
You fast.  
Your body will start rioting.  
Oh, that's a cook.  
Only cook.  
Give us cook.  
Only cook.  
Just give us cook.  
 Your whole body will be calling for something.  
And that's when somebody, the guy who hasn't seen you for months, now he's coming to see you with three-bit pies.  
All for you.  


  
All the things that have been hidden that you didn't see before, now you are seeing them.  
You never had eggs in your fridge today that you are fasting.  
Something moves you to the fridge, now you can see them.  
 Heavy temptation between you one and the fridge there.  


  
It's only cake.  
Cake is not food after all.  
Your body's in kick, kick, kick.  
Just kick.  
Small bite, small bite.  
Just a little.  
Just a little.  
And you are saying, but I'm fasting.  
Say, but fast doesn't stop kicking.  
 What is cake?  
It's no food.  
After all, it's just cake.  
Just a little bite.  
They say, you are there, only you.  
You want cake.  
It has become a fight of fate, but you are... Then you say, well...  
 You can do one of two things.  
Either it's not saying, praise the law, you just make it loud and don't listen to your spirit.  
Take your knife anyway.  
It's only a small slice.  
I'm still fasting.  


  
What have you done?  
You've lost another opportunity to make your body conform to your spirit.  
 In the day of trouble, your body will be the master.  
Every time there's an opportunity for a spiritual exercise, this is what exercises yourself onto godliness.  
When you want to pray, pray.  
Take it with those things that are likely to stop you or to make your prayer time weak.  
 so that you can train your spirit to dominate your body.  
Such that you know the spirit has memory and the flesh has memory.  
See, the outward man has a mind that holds memory, but the human spirit also has memory.  
Are you listening to this?  
This is very important.  
 So the human spirit has a senses.  
The outward man has a senses.  
Which one do you want to train?  
That's really up to you.  
It will determine the quality of life that you're going to live.  
Those who live from their senses are limited.  
Terribly limited.  
 and out there, there's failure.  
But those who are led by the Spirit who have trained their Spirit are the ones that have the mastery.  
See?  
And you learn to fix things in the realm of the Spirit and being controlled in your Spirit.  
 And when you are in control in your spirit, nothing in this world has the ability to defeat you.  
Nothing.  
You always win.  
Irrespective of what happens.  
Irrespective of what happens, you'll always win.  
Because success is in your spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
 Glory to God.  
How can we be so sensitive to the Spirit?  
How can we be so sensitive and know that this is the way you take rather than this way?  
Only for you to hear that all those who went this way didn't return.  


  
 Your spirit can gain this.  
And you can tell even when you have an opportunity that you are surrounded by evil in spite of your opportunity.  
Turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 16.  
You just found a nice house in a neighborhood  
 Beautiful house.  
You're so excited.  
Can you know whether or not you should stay there?  
Can you know?  
You see, you don't say, oh, this is just the house of my dream.  
It can be the house of your dream.  
But my turn out to be how my house of horror.

 King James says, and there are many adversaries, the emergency is, but there are many adversaries.  
He says, there's a great opportunity here for me.  
He's a great door and a factual, but there are many adversaries.  
He knew, but there are many adversaries.  
 Can you be that sensitive to know that in spite of this tremendous opportunity, there are many adversaries?  
And if there are many adversaries, what are you going to do?  
What are you supposed to do?  
How do you win?  
It's like a treasure in the midst of adversaries.  
In a sense, that's a trap.  
But if we must take that thing,  
 We must then know what to do with our adversaries.  
Can you see it?  
That's what he's telling you.  
He says, I have a great opportunity.  
But this thing is surrounded by many adversaries.  
What did Paul do?  
Go and read.  
These ones that he called many adversaries, you know what he called them?  
Beasts.  
He said, we've displayed even of life.  
 When he recounted his experience on that occasion, it was amazing what he went through.  
So when you read, and there are many adversaries, it's not just talking about someone saying, I don't like you, Paul.  
There's more than that.  
He said, we despair even of life.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
So there's much for us to learn  
 in our Christian walk to help us achieve those things that God has planned for us to live the life of glory and victory that he has given us so that we always win but we have to learn these things we've got to we've got to amen hallelujah glory to God lift your hand and say thank you Lord Jesus  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Go ahead and worship you.
