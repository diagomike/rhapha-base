title: Anticipating Evil Part 4
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Mabel is yours.  


  
 I'd like to start out our reading from, first I think, Scripture and Proverbs, chapter 22, you remember?  
What does it say in verse 3?  
Come on.  
A what?  
 A prudent man for see at the evil and hide at himself.  
But the simple pass on and are punished.  
A prudent man for see at the evil and hide at himself.  
But the simple pass on and are punished.  
 A pregnant man here is a man of wisdom who is careful.  
He foresees evil and is cautious and responds.  
He may make a detail or wait  
 like Zazir, he hides himself.  
But the simple, simple-minded, naive, naive, naive, the simple,  
 The naive fellow goes on and gets punished.  
He gets into trouble.  
Many have destroyed their families, destroyed their business, destroyed their own lives.  
 because they were not listening to God's Spirit, tugging at them.  
They were not listening.  
They were not listening.  
 The Bible says there is a road, a way that simmeth right onto a man.  
But the ends thereof are the ways of death.  
A way that simmeth right onto a man.  
But the ends thereof are the ways of death.  
Wisdom  
 comes from God.  
And understand this, there is no wisdom outside the Word of God.  
Doesn't matter how you feel that you are wise, there are people who feel they are wise.  
You know what I'm talking about.  
The smart fellows, they always think they are very smart and very wise because they know how to reason this way and that way.  
 The Bible says there's no counsel against the Lord.  
That means you can't be so wise and outsmart God.  
It is not possible.  
No one could be wiser than the Word of God.  
Hey, let's look again at Moses before the Red Sea.  
 And the children of Israel are angry at Moses because he's brought them thus far.  
They expected to finally escape the Egyptians.  
None of a sudden they find themselves before the Red Sea.  
There's nowhere to go.  
The Egyptians are coming right behind.  
There's nowhere on this side or on this side.  
And so they said, now Moses, you got us stuck.  
 We'll kill you first before the Egyptians get us.  
Then he said, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.  
Okay?  
Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.  
You can imagine all the smart guys that have been very upset with Moses.  
 Because common sense showed there was no way out.  
Imagine some people already saying the best thing for us to do.  
Let's just negotiate with Egyptians.  
Let us just all go on our knees and start begging them.  
Then we'll catch Moses and deliver Moses to them.  
That he misled us.  
That's all we're going to do.  
 Now, then Moses begins praying and God says, no, don't pray now.  
And God gives him an instruction that baffles the mind.  
God says to Moses, don't pray now.  
Stretch your hand over the sea and divide it.  
Oh my goodness.  
He just stretch your hand over the sea and divide it.  
 Now, let's imagine Moses saying, okay, how many of you here are engineers?  
Please come, come, come, come.  
Now, imagine reasoning it differently, you know?  
If Moses had said to the congregation, hold on, I just heard from God.  
And they say, God, at this moment, what did he say?  
He says, as you stretch my hand over the ceiling divided, they would have killed him right away.  
So you think of fools?  


  
 They wouldn't have waited for him to explain.  
Stretch your hand over the sea and divide it.  
They'll kill him.  
But see, he didn't negotiate with them.  
He didn't explain to them.  
He just did what God said and it worked.  
But look at this.  
Imagine if he had called all the engineers to come forward quickly, come forward.  
God says we should divide the sea.  
And it's important for us to know how deep it is.  
 And how long it is, and so how far we're going to have to work.  
Others will say, did you hear God very well?  
Because the editions are coming very fast.  
They are not, and they are vicious.  
They are angry with us.  
They will not tolerate nonsense.  
I understand that Pharaoh is right behind them.  
Now, the danger was such that it was either God was right or he was wrong.  
 And what God said was not wise to the natural mind.  
That's my point.  
Human wisdom would have tried to figure it out.  
But human wisdom is not wisdom at all.  
What's the way out?  
The way out is the life of faith.  
 That's the only way out.  
The way out is the life of faith.  
The life of the Spirit.  
That's what I'm sharing with you.  
The only way out.  
Acts chapter 27.  


  
 Acts chapter 27, from verse 9, now when much time was spent and when selling was now dangerous, because the fast was now already passed, Paul admonished them and said unto them, Sars, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the laden and ship, but also of our lives.  
 Nevertheless, the Centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul.  
And because the Haven was not commoduous to wither in, the more part advised to depart thence also, even by any means they might attain to finish, and there to wither, which is an haven of Crete, and lied to at the south-west and not west.  
 And when the south wing blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, losing thanks, they sailed close by Crete.  
But not long after, they arose against it a tempestuous wind called Eurocliden.  
And when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.  
And running under a certain island, which is called Claudia,  
 we had much work to come by the boat, which when they had taken up the used helps on the garden the ship, and fair and less they should fall into the quicksands, strict sail, and so were driven.  
And we've been accidentally tossed with a tempest the next day, the light in the ship.  
 On the third day, we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.  
And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.  
 But after long abstinence, power stood forth in the midst of them and said, Sars, you should have harkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this ham and loss.  
And now I sought you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, but of the ship.  
 For they stood by me this night, the angel of God, whose I am and whom I serve, saying fear not, Paul, thou must be brought before Caesar.  
And Lord God had given thee all them that sail with thee.  
Wherefore says be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
 He had anticipated this evil.  
He said, I perceive that this journey will be with much damage.  
I perceive spiritual perception.  
There was a heaviness within his spirits.  
 And he knew it concerned the Johnny.  
You know, sometimes you have this deep feeling that something's going wrong and you don't know exactly what it concerns.  
The times you're not sure what it is.  
The times you're not sure what it is.  
You just know within your spirit, this is not okay.  
And sometimes, you know, the Spirit of God try and get you and do something than you.  
 You may be too hard-headed to listen.  
I remember one time, some years ago, I was having a, I believe it was a convention of some kind.  
And we set out to go.  
I was driving.  
I was to speak during this session of meetings, and I wanted to be there  
 this particular day.  
But it was getting late.  
And I was wondering why am I not leaving as early as I want to.  
Everything that could stop me from leaving as early as I wanted seemed to be happening.  
Finally, I drove out of Lagos about 2 p.m.  


  
 After I'd gone about 20, 25 minutes, I had this heaviness within my spirit, not knowing why.  
I thought through everything, what could be wrong?  
What could be wrong?  
What could be wrong?  
Wasn't sure.  
So I decided, okay, maybe I'll just go back and change all the tires because, you know, I want to fly.  
You understand?  
 So I drove back to Lagos, got to one of the guys and asked them to remove all four tires and replaced them.  
They did all this little over two hours.  
I started the journey.  
Now I was more, more confident.  
 But I had been told there was nothing wrong with the tires.  
I know why, but you know, I just, but this delay was there and I had to go back and remove all the tires and then get back on the way.  
Eventually got into Benin City and I told him and told myself we got to go.  
He said tonight, I said, yes, we're going.  
So hopped into the car and off to worry.  
As we got to the gates,  
 of the hotel who are supposed to stay.  
They told me that the armed robbers just finished with everybody.  


  
And that they went from room to room.  
This was several years ago.  
So they had visited all the guests.  
So you see why I went back to Lagos.  
 when you have in your spirits.  
It's like, you know, a lot of times we don't like to recognize when the Spirit of God is getting our attention.  
We don't like to listen, especially if it's trying to get our attention about something that we really want to do.  
A certain fellow wanted to go into this company.  
How he wanted to work there.  
 He went to his pastor, and the pastor said, well, why do you want to go there?  
Oh, he said, I've always dreamed of working there.  
Anyway, so he convinced the pastor, and he went.  
Shortly after he started, the company was closed.  
Where's he going to go from there?  
 the dreams over, right?  
Because the spirit of God had been talking to him about not going there.  
And he wasn't going to listen.  
He wasn't going to listen.  


  
Anticipating evil is what I'm talking about.  
As a young guy, married with two lovely children.  
 He said he wanted to relocate with his family to some Greenland.  
So he had been very involved in the church.  
The pastor loved the family.  
They were very much involved in the church.  
Everything was fine, but he wanted a new life.  
 And the wife was in support.  
You know, sometimes some people don't pray, or they just, if the thing sounds nice, they're ready.  
So he traveled.  
When he got there, after he got himself good accommodation and everything, the wife was waiting, you know, for him to send for them.  
 So he sent a letter that, please, I have decided to start a new life here.  
So you face your own life.  


  
You see, the point is, you know, where do some people get horse-banned from hell?  
 You know?  
Why did they get them from?  
And also, some of her husbands know where to get wife from hell.  
You know, people who are so unreasonable, so wicked.  
You know, this guy was the nicest guy you would meet.  
He was so, I mean, he was, he was it.  
No wonder she fell for him.  
Listening to your inside.  
 Listening to the voice of the spirit within you, will keep you from many hurts, will keep you from a lot of harm.  
Listening within you.  
Train your spirit to listen.  
And I told you, if you want your spirit to be a sure guide, you need to study the Word of God.  
You don't know the Word of God, you are sunk.  
 That's for sure.  
Because you see, the Holy Spirit speaks to you with the voice of God's Word.  
That's how He speaks to you.  
And you also have to understand, it's not, you know, sometimes some people say, well, but I want to do this for God.  
 Does God want it?  
Does God want it?  
Did you know that a certain king was killed?  
King Josiah was killed, first he became lepers and was carried away until his death.  
What happened to him?  
He was a prosperous king.  
Everything was good with this guy.  
The Bible says God made him to prosper.  
 Until he said one day, I know it's the priest that offer the incense to God, but I think I'd like to do that too.  
So he went into the temple of God and decided to offer the incense to God, which was the job of the priest?  
So the priest stormed into the temple and said, oh King, live forever.  
But this thing you want to do is the responsibility of the priest.  
 So we advise you to stay out of this.  
But the Bible says his pride was too much.  
He wouldn't listen to the priests.  
So he went ahead and offered it.  
And as he did, right away, leprosy struck him.  
And the priests saw that he had become lepros and immediately carried him out of the temple.  
 But he wanted to offer the incense to God.  
What was wrong with that?  
What was wrong with that was no man ticket this honor upon himself.  
That's what the Bible says.  
You know, a certain church got split.  
The elders were very angry.  
So they moved out of the church and they started another church.  
 So when they started another church, they called one of the senior members among them, that's you, we are a pastor.  
So they are knowing to him.  
It's like the king Zedekiah, who was mid king by the king of Babylon.  


  
 They appointed him to be the pastor.  
So he was pastor, you know, not the anointing of these elders.  
See, it pays to serve God God's way.  
Are you hearing me?  
It pays to serve God God's way.  
God's way.  
 You may be a better preacher than the pastor.  
That'll make you the pastor.  
You may know the Bible more than the pastor, but no one is called to be a pastor because he has known the Bible.  
Are you listening to what I'm telling you?  
 Many people don't know how to anticipate evil.  
They don't know when the hand of God is against them.  
They don't know.  


  
They don't know when the hand of God is against them.  
Always you ask yourself, this thing I'm going into, this thing that I want to do,  
 What does the Word of God say about it?  
Ask yourself.  
I told you the other day how that Paul wanted to go and preach in Asia and the Spirit said no.  
 But God already said, go into all the world.  
He could have argued with God.  
He could have argued with him, within himself, to say, that cannot be God.  
God says, go into all the world and preach the gospel.  
How can he stop me from going to Asia?  
Definitely, it's not God.  
No, there's specific guidance.  
Well, he was listening to the voice of God's Spirit.  
Then he decided to go to Bethania, and the Spirit of God said, no!  
What it called you, is stay back.  
For some others, they'll go right ahead and get punished.  
 He stayed back.  
He stayed back.  
Hallelujah.  
There are things that we find ourselves doing and they are just traps.  
They are traps.  
It's not every open door you enter.  
Some open doors are traps.  


  
 How are you following this?  
Some open doors are traps.  
I mean, that story we just read from the Acts chapter 27.  
Did you notice what happened?  
Paul said to them, stars, let us stay here and not go.  
The journey I perceive will be dangerous.  
And our winter was coming.  
And they said, but this place is not good for us to winter in.  
Let's move over to Crete.  
 It's all part of Crete, you know, another part, they said.  
Let's go over there.  
So the owner of the ship had argued that, look, this is a business I know.  
So the centurion decided, okay, and majority of the people agreed with the owner of the ship, and they decided to leave.  
When they left,  
 The Bible says, the weather got better.  
And they said, look, we have achieved our purpose.  
Everywhere has become calm.  
And that rascal over there trying to tell us what to do.  
And they were happy.  
And then all of a sudden the weather changed.  
Suddenly, the weans became postures, tossing the ship this way and that way until by themselves.  
 They started throwing away everything.  
For many days, they couldn't see the sun, they couldn't see the stars.  
It was dark.  
Two weeks in the dark, then we read something.  
He said, finally, all hope that we should be saved was lost.  
They have lost all of their belongings.  
They've cast everything into the ship to lighten the ship.  
 what they were now fighting for was their own lives.  
Until all hope of being saved was lost.  
And power said to them, you should have harkened on to me when I told you to stay back.  
Now listen, this is very important.  
Just because  
 See, just because you've prayed about it, somebody says, well, I've prayed about it.  
Prayer should help you get into God's will.  
When you pray, you listen to God.  
You don't pray until God follows me.  
 I'm going, so I've prayed, so follow me.  
He's not your errand boy.  
When you pray, you listen to God.  
Then the Spirit of God convinces you, so you follow Him.  
But many times we think that, okay, I've prayed about it.  
And because I have prayed about it, it's okay.  
Paul prayed about it.  
They still lost everything.  
 Only their lives were saved.  
Why?  
Listen, Paul was a prisoner there.  
Don't forget.  
He was the prisoner.  
It was not a holiday.  
He was a prisoner with a few others.  
And they were being taken to Caesar because he had appealed to Caesar.  
So he was under Roman guard as a prisoner.  
 It was not his choice to go on that ship.  
And the angel said to him, be not afraid, Paul, for thou must be brought before Caesar.  
You'll get to your destination.  
And God has given you the lives of all those who are sailing with you.  
Which means the only reason they were saved was because of Paul.  
 Because Paul was not the one who was hard-headed.  
He would have listened, but they forced him to come along.  
Come along.  
They dragged him on.  
And he was a priest.  
So he had to appeal and pray to God, Lord, I know that we are on the wrong journey.  
And pray for the salvation of the lives of these men.  
 Praise God.  
You're still there?  
So don't say, oh God, I've decided I'm going to do this.  
You said whatever we ask.  
You said, so you'll be with me.  
You said, look, I'm with you always.  
So I clean it that you are with me.  
 Part of what you are claiming is spiritual guidance.  
And in that guidance, God tells you, son, not this way.  
So you should listen.  
He said, the Spirit of God, when he comes, the Spirit of Truth shall guide you into all truth.  
For he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak.  
 And he will show you things to come, Mass in John chapter 16 verse 13.  
He will show you things to come.  
So you should be, you know, you should decide in your own mind to listen to God, listen to his spirit.  
 And I did tell you on Sunday about these prophets that we get all around us.  
You remember?  
There's some people who are always hanging around to prophesy to us.  
And I told you on Sunday how many people have had their businesses destroyed because of one brother, so and so, who was very good as a prophet.  
Meanwhile, he was not a prophet at all.  
 Now they bring him, they want, they have a new business they want to do.  
They call him, brought a prophet to come and pray along.  
And then he will always see something.  
I see.  
He will always see something for them.  
The Bible didn't say as many as are led by prophets.  
It says as many as are led by the Spirit.  
The Spirit.  
 Not the prophets.  
You need to be careful in your life, you know?  
I believe in prophetic order ends.  
I believe.  
 When you talk about prophecy that reveals the future in about war and life, it's not the gift of prophecy that is in operation.  
The gift of prophecy may help to bring it out, but that revelation of the future actually has to do more with the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge.  
As contained within the office of a prophet,  
 Not the gift of prophecy.  
The gift of prophecy serves for three major things.  
Turn in the first Corinthians chapter 14.  


  
Have you found it?  
Read verse three.  
One, two, go.  
 He that prophesied, speak unto man, unto man, to edification and exhortation and comfort.  
Those three things, the gift of prophecy, would speak unto you  
 to identification, excitation, and comfort.  
It doesn't tell you about your future.  
Except, of course, where it's a prophetic utterance for excitation, comfort, about the future.  
But doesn't reveal your future as it were.  


  
 Like, come and look at this business for me.  
I want you to pray.  
I have this man I want to marry.  
I have this woman I want to marry.  
Then you call three people with the gift of prophecy.  
They should assemble.  
And they all start praying.  
And then we see something.  
Then we surely see something.  
Because they were as stupid as yourself.  
 You see what I mean?  
Because for you to call them, that was stupidity in the first place.  
And they just stupidly came and said, all right, all right.  
So they tell us what the matter is.  
You know to them, it's okay, let's pray.  
Because they're ignorant of the Scriptures.  
This is what causes problems for many people.  
That's why you find some Christians.  
After everything has been all right with them for many years.  
Somewhere along the line, they just fade off.  
 They just fade away.  
Because they kept following these wrong principles.  
Just fade away.  
Because the Word of God is no longer sufficient for them.  
Then you have those wives who believe, you know, they're very smart.  
They use prophecy to control their husbands.  
They say, my wife is very spiritual.  
 And she too, she's smart, she knows.  


  
Before long, she prophesies to him that all the cousins must live the house.  
They say which in the house.  
They say which, there's always a which, and to certainly be the smallest cousin that came from the village.  
 Is it which that must go?  
Is it which in the house?  
Don't try to control your husband with prophecy.  
It's only what God says.  
Don't add to it.  
Don't add to it.  
It could destroy that marriage.  
Just a matter of time.  
 until you finally prophesy him into a business that you thought he should do.  
Or because he's close to a certain friend of his, and you don't like that friendship, you start.  
Don't settle on.  
Don't settle on.  
Be here not from equally young together with unbelievers.  


  
 Just sit down with him, open the Bible and discuss it.  
Don't use prophecy to do it.  
Because after a while, you better be ready to sustain the marriage you'd prophecy.  
I didn't say don't prophesy.  
I'm just telling you to be careful and let the Word of God be  
 your firm foundation, that God's would be your foundation.  
And Barbara says, test the spirits, whether they be your God.  
Test the spirits.  
Test the spirits.  
Every once in a while, you have a group of brethren in the church.  
 that in a church, not necessarily in this church, they find themselves gravitating towards one brother or sister from some way who is said to be very gifted.  
Before you know what, every Tuesday they gather there to this brother's place.  
 He doesn't come to church.  
He probably goes elsewhere or stays at home to see from God.  
And then they come here on Sunday, come here on Wednesday, on Tuesday in between they go to somewhere where this brother teaches them the Bible.  
What Pastor Chris could not finish on Sunday?  
 That brother now takes it up.  
So all the questions they could not ask me here, they take to him over there to be asking, and he starts explaining.  
Let me tell you something.  
It's always the way out of truth.  
I've been a Christian many years, and I have seen these kind of groups again and again, often with  
 You know, they usually have a good mind, a good motive, but good motive is not enough.  
Ozer had a good motive when the act of God stumbled, and he tried to stop it, but the Bible says the anger of the Lord was kindled against Ozer and accused him.  
 God killed him for touching the ark.  
He had a good motive.  
Good motive is not enough.  
See, there are two types of sins.  
You gotta understand this.  
You have spiritual sins, and then you have physical sins that people commit, or either, well, whether we,  
 physical sense, but the spiritual sense are those things that are very dangerous and you can only know them through the light of the Scripture.  
For example, pride is a spiritual sin.  
It is difficult to define.  
You cannot know pride except through the Word of God.  
You can't know it.  
 You can say someone is proud because you think he is.  
That doesn't mean he's proud.  
Because pride is of the Spirit, is of the heart.  
Only God's work in George Pride.  
You can accuse anybody of pride.  
It doesn't mean he's proud.  
You might be the one that are actually proud.  
 You see, but the Word of God is the only one that can discern pride.  
When such a person studies the Word of God, he will discover that, oh, this is pride.  
This is what God calls pride.  
Rebellion.  
What is rebellion?  
It is very difficult to discover.  
Power is as rebellion is as witchcraft.  
 Stop on this, it's as iniquity.  
What is rebellion?  
Very simple thing.  
God said to Saul, go and destroy Amalek, and then he didn't really do it.  
He did part of it.  
Okay?  
And came back, kept some things which he said he was going to sacrifice to God.  
Samuel came.  
 I said, have you obeyed the commandment of the Lord?  
He said, oh, yes, I have.  
Then Samus said, so what is this bidding of the ship that I hear?  
Oh, he said, oh, the people took them to sacrifice them unto God.  
Samus said, really?  
He said, so to obey is better than sacrifice.  
To obey is better than sacrifice.  
 to obey is better than sacrifice.  
Okay, that group I just talked about now, in that fellowship that those people went to, they could gather there for as many times as they want, and then the leader there now says, okay, I want you to send this seed to Pastor Chris.  
 telling that we really appreciate him, we're very glad.  
And then they now take the seed and come here.  
And say, Pastor, there's a fellowship where we're attending.  
He answers all our questions and lays on us every week.  
So he told us to bring this seed to you that you've really blessed his life.  
And I say, brethren, did I ask you to go there?  
Is he one of your say leaders?  
No.  
Is he one of your pastors?  
No.  
Did I send you there?  
No.  
To be is better than this sacrifice.  
 and to hack him than the fat of Rams.  
Take this seed, go and give it back to him, and come back and stay in church.  
You see what I mean?  
To obey is better than sacrifice.  
To hack him than the fat of Rams.  
 He told him, said, rebellion is as witchcraft.  
So he called that rebellion.  
But that's not the way Saul saw it.  
That's not what he thought.  
He was shocked.  
And Samuel said, now the Lord has turned his back on you and has rejected you from being king.  
 in shock.  
Saul began to plead with him.  
Please, I'm sorry.  
That's not what I thought.  
We brought them to sacrifice to God.  
I'm sorry.  
We brought the best on the ship, the best of the oxen.  
I'm very sorry.  
Someone said, leave me alone.  
Then he hung on to his sketch, and it got done.  
And he says, I have told you, as you have told this thing, so has the kingdom been turned away from you.  
 He got worse.  
See how that man lost that kingdom.  
For violating simple instructions.  
See, spiritual scenes are very, they're simple things.  
Let me give you a story.  
You know, can Ehegan said something some years ago that was very touching.  
He had been, he was called into the office of a prophet.  
 But he enjoyed the ministry of a teacher more.  
So he preferred to function as a teacher more than he would in the office to which God called him primarily.  
So one day, he had an accident.  
He fell and broke his hand.  
And the spirit of God said to him that he would talk to him later about it.  
Finally, Jesus appeared to him.  
 and said to him, you had that accident because I was trying to get your attention.  
Why?  
He said, if I had not allowed that to happen to you, you would not now, he was at this time, 35 years old.  
I want you to notice, he was at this time, 35 years old, when this thing happened.  
Then the Lord said, you would not have lived past the age of 55.  
 because you put your teaching ministry above your prophetic ministry, which is against the order of the Word of God.  
Because of that, he would not live past the age of 55.  
Now, so he got his attention with that accident and said, so now put this straight and you will live past that age.  
 He put it straight, and he knew he would live past the age of 55.  
He died at 86.  
Way past 55.  
How simple.  
Can you imagine that kind of thing was going to cost him his life?  
Something as simple as that.  
Yeah, in the eyes of men, it's simple, but not with God.  
I told you on Sunday about Moses striking the rock.  
 Because he was angry.  
And God said, Moses, you don't strike the rock.  
You talk to the rock.  
He says, for this, you will see the promised land, but you will not enter.  
Imagine that.  
Spiritual things are the little things in the eyes of men.  
You wonder, so what's this all about?  
There's not what's this all about.  
It's what does God say it is.  
 What does God say it is?  
Someone was so angry.  
And they said, ah, Pastor said, you must come and say, Pastor, my food was angry.  
Pastor, my food.  
Not food though, food.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Develop your spirit.  
Develop your spirit.  
Tell somebody, develop your spirit.  
 But to do that, say it, say to do that, you must listen to the word that has already been written for us.  
Because that's the voice of God to us, the Scriptures.  
The Scriptures given to us.  
That's the voice of God to us.  
That's how you learn the voice of God.  
 know the scriptures.  
You know, some people are praying they want God to talk to them.  
They say, after all, what am I asking God for?  
If you open the Bible, you won't see it.  
I'm asking of between Shell and Mobile, which one should I go to?  
How now can I know it from the Bible?  
If you started that Bible, you will know the difference.  
You will know when God is saying Shell or Mobile or none of them.  
You will know.  
The guy was interested in three ladies in church.  
 He wasn't quite sure of their names, but he just liked them.  
So finally he got a friend of his together and said that we're going to pray.  
There are three ladies alike in church.  
God is going to show us which one.  
So finally, that one said, the one whose name is in the Bible is the one that God has chosen.  
So they went  
 and found out that the three of them had their names in the Bible.  
Father Confucian.  


  
Alleluia.  
Okay, do you know how to do draw your sword?  
Somebody would do draw your sword to tell the will of God.  
Let me show you draw your sword.  
When I was a young Christian, I also did it.  
 Well, speak!  
Speak!  
So, you open it and can I tell you something?  
Several times God actually spoke to me like that.  
I'm telling you, He did until I started learning God's word and then as I knew better  
 And I did.  


  
My conscience was worrying.  
You know why?  
Because I knew that the middle part, I was too familiar with my Bible.  
I knew where the middle area was.  
Proverbs, sounds, they are the middle part of the Bible.  
If I move this way, I'm going to Jeremiah.  
I don't like Jeremiah.  
So which side should I go?  
 So I devised a new method.  
Lord, I'm just going to let the Bible fall.  


  
You know what Paul said?  
When I was a child, I spoke as a child.  


  
 I understood as a child.  
I thought as a child.  
He said, when I became a man, I put away childish things.  
Put away childish things.  
Put away childish things.  
Grow up.  
Put away childish things.  
That's not the way God wants to talk to you.  
He doesn't want to do this to talk to you.  
 He wants to talk to you in your spirit.  
That's the surest guide.  
But it must be trained.  
It must be trained.  
See, that spirit must be trained.  
Hallelujah.  
That spirit must be trained.  
And some of the things we're doing  
 Some of the things we're doing like sharing along these lines will help you begin to have the consciousness of spiritual guidance.  
You know, sometimes when you find yourself not having sufficient finances over a long period of time or going through some pain over a protracted period of time, those things you get your attention.  
 that you let you know your way of doing things is wrong.  
And so you must adjust.  
I told you I did a personal study on why people suffer for a long time.  
He got my attention.  
I wanted to know why do people go through problems for a very long time?  
 So far, either a health problem, a financial problem, an emotional problem, for a very long time.  
Why?  
And I've found the answers from the Scriptures.  


  
So it's never God's will.  
It's never God's will for you to go through like that for a long time.  
 Make up your mind.  
Make up your mind.  
Don't become used to a situation.  
There must be progress.  
There must be progress in your personal life.  
There must be progress.  
God wants to see progress in your life, in every area of your life.  
He wants to see it.  
It's his desire.  
 And He has made everything available that you ensure that you make that progress.  
It's God's dream for you.  
Hallelujah.  
It's God's dream for you.  
Say, I'm making progress in the name of Jesus.  
I will develop my spirit.  
Say, God wants to make you  
 his dream.  
He has a dream for you, and he wants you to be that dream that he has for you.  
Life can be better than what it is now.  
God says, the wilderness shall become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall become a forest.  
Hallelujah.  
 So if there's been dryness in your life, it can become a fruitful field.  
And if you have had a fruitful field, it can become a forest.  
Which means it's got to be progress.  
Say again, I'm making progress by the power of the Holy Spirit.  
I'm making progress by the hand of God.  
I'm making progress.  
 I'm getting greater by the day.  
The knowledge of God is in my spirit.  
The knowledge of God is in my spirit.  
And I'm winning.  
I'm a victor because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.  
Thank you, Father.  
 for making me a victor, for making me a success.  
And I am prospering in every way.  
I'm moving forward in the name of Jesus.  
I see me moving forward.  
I see me being influential for the gospel.  
I see me  
 changing lives.  
I see me making a difference by the power of the Holy Spirit.  
Thank you Father.  
Your kingdom is at work in me.  
You are at work in me.  
Heaven is at work in me.  
Hallelujah.
