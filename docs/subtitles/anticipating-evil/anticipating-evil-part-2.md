title: Anticipating Evil Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Debo is yours.  


  
 anticipating evil.  
Somebody would have said we should be anticipating miracles.  
Yeah, we should, but we must also be trained on dealing with evil, anticipating evil.  
Can we know that  
 There's some danger ahead.  
Can we know?  
Can we know that there's trouble, trouble ahead?  
Can we know?  
Many Christians get into trouble because they're not trained in the things of the Spirit like this.  
 There are those who don't even believe God talks to people.  
They say, God talk to you.  
God?  
They think that's too big.  
How can you say God talk to you?  
Don't you know he's so busy?  
How can God live all the busy things he's got to do?  
Running all the planetary systems and then come talk to you little rascal?  
But God is a master communicator.  
And he thinks we're important enough for him to talk to.  
 Hallelujah.  
So God talks to people.  
God talks to me.  
You know, the Jews, when Jesus said, God talked to him, they thought, what?  
You?  
They said, we know that God spoke to Moses, but we don't know about you.  
And they weren't there when God talked to Moses.  
It was somebody who told them, God talked to him.  
In fact, they read what Moses said.  
Moses said, God talked to him.  
 And nobody heard God talk to Moses to report it.  
But they believed it.  
They believed it.  
They believed it.  
Which was good.  
But now the son of God shows up and he says, God talk to me.  
And they said, who are you?  
Are you greater than Moses?  
I thought he was greater than Moses.  
 Hallelujah.  
So God talks to us today.  
Does God talk to you?  
I know not a very enthusiastic, yes, from some people.  
Some of you just trying to think that God talked to me.  
Well, God talks to us.  
If you've never heard him,  
 Maybe you've not been listening.  
Did you know that God could have been talking to you a lot of times and you didn't think it was God?  
Don't forget the story of the little boy's Samuel.  
God called him three times.  
He thought it was the priest that was calling him.  
Because you see, when God talks, he talks with the voice of a man.  
 Secondly, a lot of times, he would talk with a familiar voice.  
Hadley ever speaks to you in a strange way.  
He talks to you in a very simple way.  
Even when he spoke out of heaven, when Jesus spoke out of heaven to Saul of Tassus, he called him by name and said, Saul, Saul, who are persecutors thou me?  
And Saul said, who are thou Lord?  
 He said, I am Jesus from thou persecuted and went into a dialogue with him.  
And the Bible says he spoke to him in the Hebrew tongue, a language that he understood.  
You know sometimes we say, God talk to us and they say, what language does God speak?  
They're trying to tell us God couldn't have spoken to you.  
It doesn't speak your language.  
But God would talk to you the language that you understand.  
Let's read those  
 opening verses.  
Proverbs chapter 22, I'll read to you from verse three, a prudent man for seeeth the evil and hideeth himself, but the simple pass on and are punished.  
And then we noticed that the same words  
 are given to us again in Proverbs chapter 27 and verse 12.  
The same words, and I told you that by a law of the Spirit, when God repeats what he says to you in the same way, or reveals something to you twice, you better be careful because it means this is of vital importance.  
Watch out.  
And  
 That's why we got this twice in the same book.  
Read it for me.  
Want to go.  
The simple do what?  
And they're punished.  
They're getting the trouble.  
 That's why many get into trouble.  
Some people say whatever will be will be.  
If it falls my lot, it will happen for me.  
It's not true.  
The Bible shows us that's a lie.  
Don't ever think whatever will be will be.  
If you don't know that you are very much responsible for your destiny, you're cheating yourself.  
God sets up  
 The system gives you the principles for life and it tells you to run them.  
It's up to you.  
Whether you're going to be successful or you're going to fail would depend heavily on you.  
So that's important.  
I want you to look at Proverbs chapter 20 and read for me verse 27.  
 Proverbs chapter 20 verse 27, 1, 2, go.  
Again.  
Again.  
One more time.  


  
 The spirit of man is a candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly.  
The belly there is an expression for the innermost being.  
It means deep within you.  
And that means is talking about your spirit.  
It means the hidden man of the heart.  
Inside your being.  
 Like when you see the heart of a matter, you see, so you're dealing with the inside your being, the core of your nature.  
Now it says, the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.  
In other words, the light of God is lit in your spirit.  
In your spirit.  
If you're going to know the purpose of God, the will of God for your life, it's in your spirit.  
 That's what it's telling you.  
It's in your spirit.  
Psalm 18, verse 28, what do you have?  


  
That would light my candle.  
See that?  
God would light my candle.  
In what?  
The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.  
 He sets up his light in your spirit.  
This is what the light of God is.  
This where God guides you in your spirit.  
You know, after you've given your heart to Christ, to be born again, to be a Christian, the next thing is for you to start growing in the spirit.  
 Now many Christians don't realize that it's important to grow in the spirit.  
That means to develop your spirit.  
You know, when you're born again, maybe I should explain some of the basics.  
Man is a spirit being.  
He's in the class of God.  
He's a spirit like God is a spirit.  
Okay?  
Like angels are spirits.  
So man is a spirit.  
 But man has been given a physical body.  
He lives in a body.  
That's your body.  
That's not you.  
We don't see your spirit because we're looking at you with our optical eyes that are from our outward man, the body.  
 So the Bible shows us that there is a hidden man and there is an outward man.  
The hidden man is called an inward man and then you have this outward man.  
The outward man is the body and his senses, the five senses of the body that you see.  
Okay?  
And then the real you are a spirit being.  
You live in your body and then you have a soul.  
 By your soul, you contact the intellectual world.  
There's where you relate and recognize your emotions.  
And there's where you have your understanding, your reasoning.  
Okay?  
There you reason to say two plus five is seven.  
 All that is from your soul, the realm of the understanding.  
Like I'm talking to you now, it gets to your mind and you think what I've said because I'm speaking a language that you understand, but you've got to do more than that.  
And that is by letting your spirit receive what I'm sharing with you, then it becomes permanent.  
It becomes food for your spirit.  
 by which your spirit grows.  
That's why Jesus and man shall not live by breath alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouths of God.  
You're following this?  
So your spirit recognizes God.  
It contacts God.  
Your spirit recognizes spiritual things.  
Your body recognizes physical things.  
 I brought those two first because they're easier sometimes for us to talk about.  
But then there is the soul which you relate to intellectual things, and emotional things.  
When you say, I'm not happy at all, and you feel down, that's relating from your soul.  
When you feel discouraged and downcast,  
 It's not your body, because you want to know what it's your body.  
Let somebody shout, fire!  
I know what you'll do.  
This guy was so downcast and tired.  
You'll be qualified for the Olympics.  
You know what I'm talking about?  
Yeah.  
See, so, but in your soul,  
 You know, you deal with things intellectually, you understand, you reason, all of that is there.  
Let me read something to you that's familiar, but you probably didn't recognize it that way.  
First Corinthians chapter 14.  
Have you seen it?  
First Corinthians chapter 14, I want you to read for me verse 14.  
Want to go.  


  
 Did you see that?  
For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays.  
But my understanding is unfruitful.  
I don't understand what I'm saying.  
When I pray in other tongues, you say, this is my spirit that's praying.  
So you see, that means I can activate my spirit.  
I can put my spirit to work.  
And my soul will have nothing to do with it.  
 My understanding is unfruitful when I pray in an unknown tongue.  
Hallelujah.  
My understanding is unfruitful.  
If I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays.  
But my understanding is unfruitful.  
I don't get anything in my mind.  
I don't get anything intellectually when I pray in other tongues.  
My spirit is activated.  
 See why it's important that you pray in tongues?  
Because you see, many Christians, in fact, most Christians pray with the understanding.  
It doesn't matter how they change their voice when they want to pray.  
For though we pray today, amen.  
It doesn't matter.  
It's still in the understanding.  
Right?  
Most Christians pray with the understanding.  
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  
Bless the bed that I lay on.  
And you understand?  
Let's read Father.  
Verse 15, want to go.  
Uh-huh.  
Uh-huh.  
Our pray.  


  
 With the understanding?  
No, with the Spirit first.  
And then the understanding also, which means the more important one is the Spirit.  
So you pray in the Spirit.  
And to pray in the Spirit here, it told us means praying in other tongues.  
It says, for if I pray in an unknown tongue, my Spirit prays.  
 My understanding is unfruitful.  
What is it then?  
I'll pray with the Spirit and I'll pray with the understanding also.  
Praying with the understanding means with my mind.  
See that means praying from the soul.  
So I understand what I'm saying.  
I'm speaking a language that I know.  
Hallelujah.  
Let me show you something else for a moment.  
First Thessalonians chapter 5.  
 I want y'all to read verse 23 for me.  
One, two, go.  
Aha.  
Aha.  
Yeah.  


  
 He says, in the very God of peace sanctify you wholly, completely he means, in our pre-God, your whole spirit.  
Did you notice it puts the spirit first?  
Your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless onto the common of our Jesus Christ.  
Now, for many people they say, body, soul and spirit.  
Right?  
Because the body is more important to them.  
 But God puts its spirit, soul, and body.  
The spirit first.  
Tell us something close to you.  
The spirit always comes first.  
Yeah.  
Say, I'm a spirit being.  
Say it again.  
I'm a spirit being.  
I'm a spirit being.  
I have a soul.  
I have a body in which I live.  
But I'm a spirit being.  
 Yeah, you need that consciousness.  
You need that consciousness.  
Become conscious that you are a spirit being.  
Become conscious that you are a spirit being.  
This is a prayer God, your whole spirit and soul and body.  
Spirit, soul, body.  
Somebody said, Man is a tripartite being.  
He's not a tripartite being.  
Tripartite means that he has three parts.  
 He's not three parts, he's a spirit.  
If you're a man and you have books and you live in a house, are you a tripartite being?  
Come on.  
No, you're not a tripartite being.  
You are a man.  
You've got books that you read and you live in a house.  
 So the house is not you.  
The books are not you.  
They belong to you for separate functions.  
So you are a spirit.  
You have a soul.  
You have a body, but you live in your body.  
So by your spirit, you relate with God.  
All right?  
And with your soul, you relate with intellectual things and emotions.  
 And with your body, you contact the physical world.  
I remember my brother, dear brother, here some years ago, he was taken to the hospital while he was ill.  
And while in the hospital, he died.  
And you know, to die doesn't mean you're gone.  
It means that the spirit has come out of the body.  
And so he came out of his body,  
 And the doctors, while he was standing there, his sister was inside.  
The doctor said he's dead.  
And he thought, I'm not dead.  
But he was looking at his body on the bed.  
The doctor said he was dead, and he didn't feel like he was dead, but he knew he came out of his body.  
And the doctor tried to push on his chest for a while, nothing happened.  
And then the sister began to cry, and he tried to hog his sister to say, I'm not dead!  
And his hands just passed through.  
 Why?  
He'd come out of his body.  
Didn't have his physical body to contact the physical being.  
See that?  
I know you want to hear the rest of the story.  


  
Okay, well, I couldn't have told you the story except that he came in, okay?  
So he came back into his body, all right?  
He woke up in the hospital.  
 Praise God, thank God.  
Hallelujah.  
Yeah.  
Okay, now you just got that, all right?  
Let's go back to who we're talking about.  
He says, if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays.  
My understanding is unfruitful, so that already separates the spirit from the understanding, okay, from the mind.  
 which is in the soul.  
So a lot of times we find ourselves living our lives from the soul, from our reasoning.  
You've got a problem to solve.  
You've got something you want to deal with.  
And there you are thinking and thinking and thinking.  
You see, the most successful people in the world do little thinking.  
I know you didn't know that before.  
You better write it down.  
 It's important.  
The most successful people in the world do very little thinking.  
That's not what you thought.  
I tell people, be careful, whose success books you read.  
I mean, they have the word in the mess.  
They cost this mess, didn't they?  
After I'd know the books and success, they cost this mess.  
So, if you read the Bible,  
 You'll be more successful.  
The most successful people in the world do very little thinking.  
Why?  
Because to be very successful, you train yourself to listen to your spirit.  
And the spirit gives you answers.  
The spirit is always accurate.  
 And the Spirit has absolutes because He can hear from God.  
He can get the light from God and give it to you.  
You become creative.  
You don't need to put these and that and that and that together.  
The most successful people are the creative ones.  
They are the top  
 After that you have those who synthesize information.  
They are good thinkers.  
They reason this and they reason that and they reason that.  
Often they are the ones that get things and they mess because people trust them so much.  
Because they have... Did you notice very successful people don't talk much?  
They don't talk much.  
See that?  
 The spirit has answers.  
If you listen to your spirit, but you know for your spirit to be an accurate guide, you've got to educate your spirit.  
See, the human spirit can be educated just like your outward man or your soul can be educated.  
 I mean, you've gone to school and all the time you're going to school and they were teaching you in the kindergarten or they got into the primary school and to the university, they were teaching your soul.  
All that time, they were teaching your soul, they were teaching your understanding.  
So at your best, you can't be the best because the best would have to have his spirit  
 educated.  
Even that's your best.  
The most enlightened soul will be short of being the best because the highest potentials of the human nature are in the spirit.  
They're in the spirit.  
So begin the exercise of educating your spirits.  
 Begin the exercise of educating your spirit, deliberately educating your spirit, educating your spirit.  
If you study the Word of God and meditate on the Word of God, you will educate your spirit.  
You listen to the Word of God like you're listening now, you educate your spirit.  
So develop your spirit.  
God's plan.  
 is for man to have his spirit educated, to have his spirit developed.  
See, you know, if you have a child, for example, you really can fellowship with your child.  
Come on.  
It's not real fellowship.  
Fellowship says something more.  
You may relate with the child, play with the child, but there's more to fellowship.  
 Fellowship means a rubbing of minds.  
How are you listening?  
It means a rubbing of minds, a coin of near, a drinking together, a sharing together.  
See?  
That's why most spiritual babes in Christianity think that fellowship means we go for the meeting  
 And then somebody preaches, and then we sing songs to worship.  
We pray after that, they say, what's next?  
What else?  
They can't understand what we do in church.  
Because all they understand is just what they have seen.  
I go to church.  
When I enter, somebody leads in choruses, then somebody gives an expectation.  
 Or somebody gives a testimony, and then we pray, and then someone maybe sings, we give the offering, and there's a closing prayer, and we go back home.  
And then you say, is that all?  
He says, what else?  
Because you see, he has itemized them from the realm of his soul.  
That's why people get bored of going to church.  
 because they can't understand the least out these five things and they can't see anything else.  
So, I'm not missing much.  
This is the present subject is on anticipating evil.  
So, someone said, I'll get the tapes.  
It's not enough.  
There's much more than that.  
When you grow spiritually, you understand a lot more about fellowship.  
So I said, if you have a child growing up, you really don't have much fellowship.  
 No matter how much time you spend, but if that child grows up, you can talk intellectually, right?  
You can discuss subjects.  
You can share ideas.  
Same thing with God.  
You come into reach fellowship with the Spirit of God as you develop your human spirit.  
You've got to develop your spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
 Tell somebody you got to develop your spirit to moving to higher realms of fellowship with the Holy Ghost.  
Yeah, that's right.  
Praise God.  
Okay, moving right along.  
Book of Abs.  
I want to show you something now.  
Have you seen it?  
Acts chapter 16.  
 I want you to read from verse 6 into verse 7, 1 to go.  


  
Stop, forbidden of the holy goes to preach the word in Asia?  
That's amazing.  
How could God?  
How could God?  
 Forbid them from preaching the word somewhere.  
Did he say going to all the world and preach the gospel?  
Why would he ask you not to go?  
How could that be?  
Oh, yes.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
There is the generic instruction from God that we all act upon.  
 But then again, every one of us is not at the same level, spiritually.  
And secondly, there's the subject of timing with God.  
Timing.  
Somebody said, if God didn't want me to travel, to France, why would he give me a visa?  
Your visa could put you into trouble.  
 You don't know that God sent you to France because you got a visa.  
After all, the God applied for the visa.  
It was you.  
Somebody said, well, I'm just going to apply to five countries.  
Anyone that takes me father, wherever you send me, I will go.  
And I take it that any country that gives me the visa is the country you're sending me to.  
You're in trouble.  
 because you're likely to get the one who puts you in a hole for a long time.  
Never measure the purpose of God by the things that happen around you.  
Are you hearing me?  
Never do that.  
The two things in the Bible that some people like to follow, the first one is  
 It's something that happened with Gideon.  
You remember Gideon?  
He wanted to know the will of God.  
And so he brought out the fleas.  
And he said, I'll put it in a dry place.  
If water comes in it, then I know it's God.  
Okay, I'll make it wet.  
If around it is dry, I know it's God.  
So he did all of that and used that to determine the will of God for his life.  
Now remember, Gideon at the time,  
 was not a prophet of God.  
Gideon didn't have the Holy Ghost at the time.  
Gideon was trying to, he was a natural man trying to find out the will of God.  
And the Holy Spirit to them at the time was an outside force.  
 And over in Ezekiel chapter 36, when you read from verse 26, he said, Oh, this is a new spirit.  
Will I give you a new spirit and a new heart?  
Will I put within you?  
And I'll take the stony heart out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.  
Then I'll put my spirit within you and cause you to obey my status.  
I'll put my spirit within you.  
 So at the time of Gideon, the Spirit didn't live in them.  
Now, you can't follow Gideon's example.  
Don't follow it because you don't belong in that dispensation.  
So don't follow it.  
It's like trying to follow the law of Moses.  
It will not work.  
It will not work.  
 because those who are born again are not expected to follow the law of Moses.  
Praise God.  
The second thing is the casting of lunch.  
Heads and tears.  
So to say, I'm just going to toss the scorn.  
If heads  
 I'm gone.  
Tails?  
No.  
Father, the casting of the Lord is man's.  
The result thereof is God's.  
So they go, and join off heads.  
I thank you.  
They say, but in the New Testament, the apostles did cast laws.  
They did before they received the Holy Spirit.  
 Right after the Holy Spirit came, there was no casting of lodge, there was no fleas in, do you understand?  
So don't use any of those examples because God will not move in that direction.  
In fact, the man that they chose by casting lodge, we never heard of him anymore.  
Because nobody sent them.  
So be careful about what you call the leading of God.  
 God wants to lead you through the Holy Spirit within you.  
He wants to lead you through the Holy Spirit within you.  
That's the way He wants to lead you.  
Look at the examples that we have in Scripture.  
The reason people get into terrible things, they get into trouble the way they do, it's because they ignore the Spirit.  
All right.  
 We were reading something in verse six, right?  
Acts chapter 16.  
Now, when they had gone throughout fragile and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the Word in Asia, after they were come to Misea, they are say to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit permitted them not.  
Twice, the Holy Spirit would not let them go.  
 How did they know in the spirit?  
So what did Paul do?  
He waited until he had this revelation, the man of Macedonia saying to him, Paul, come over to Macedonia and help us.  
And then they gathered that, all right, God is asking us to go over there.  
They have this special revelation.  
And you know, they went to Macedonia.  
 But they wanted to go to this place to go preach the word in Asia and the spirit didn't give them the release.  
The spirit didn't give them the release.  
Have you ever felt like doing something and just why you're ready to take your steps?  
You have been excited.  
Now you're about to and somehow  
 Everything just goes, all the inspiration to pursue it just goes down.  
But you've been talking yourself happy about it.  
You know, somebody said, well, the reason I want to do this thing is I feel good about it.  
You feel good about it?  
Feel good?  
What do you feel?  
Where does the feeling come from?  
Your senses.  
You feel good about it?  
This thing is not about the feeling.  
It's not about the feeling.  
 And because a lot of Christians have been taught wrong, they were taught, if you feel good about it, go ahead.  
Feel good about it.  
Feel.  
Feel good about it.  
Do you know how many bad things you felt good about?  
Feeling good about it has got nothing to do with it.  
It's educating your spirit to know.  
Educating your spirit to know.  
 You know, why were they taught that way?  
I'll tell you why.  
Because many times people just want you to bring everything to the natural realm.  
They want to know, how do I know that it's God?  
They want you to give a formula.  
If you feel a twitch here, like somebody said,  
 I always know when God is leading me to do something because my left hand was going... When God wants to talk to me, there's something somewhere in my head.  
It was like getting hot on the left hand side.  
These are all sense knowledge descriptions and they could fail.  
 But this is how God has been leading me.  
My back starts getting hot.  
Then I know that somebody is telling me a lie.  


  
No.  
No.  
It may have worked for a while.  
It may have worked for the days of ignorance.  
God, meanwhile, waiting for you to come out of childishness.  
Because that's not the way he leads.  
 doesn't lead by your back getting hot on your side, twitching, or your tongue getting hot or something.  
You know?  
That's not the way God does it.  
You say, how?  
That's why.  
That is the mystery.  
It's by the Holy Ghost.  
Hey, come on here.  
When you received the Holy Spirit, how did you know?  
How did you know it was the Holy Spirit?  
You didn't see Him, did you?  
 So I said, I felt him.  
Oh, what was the feeling of the Holy Spirit like?  
You said you received Christ.  
You have salvation.  
How do you know?  
It's got nothing to do with your feeling.  
It's got to do with the Word of God.  
The Spirit has been made real to your spirit.  
I love the way it's put in the Romans chapter 8.  
Can you go there?  
Have you seen it?  
 Romans 8, verse 16, want to go.  
Oh, glory.  
Hallelujah.  
The Spirit, old King James, is himself, is himself, cost the spirits a person.  
The spirits of bear witness with our spirit.  
He bears witness with our spirit.  
The Holy Ghost bears witness with my spirit.  
 Is this the spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God?  
I know I'm a child of God because I've got the witness in me.  
Hallelujah.  
I will never go to hell.  
My God, I know I'll never go to hell.  
See, why?  
Because the spirit bears witness with my spirit, I'm a child of God.  
 Second in the Bible says, we know that we have passed from debt onto life because we love the brethren.  
See, love cannot be cast into hell.  
See, now I have that witness in my spirit that I love God and I love God's people and my heart is full of love.  
I'll never go to hell.  
Glory to God.  
That's important.  
 That's important.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
The spirit bears witness with our spirit, with our minds, not with our feelings.  
The spirit bears witness with our spirits, with our soul, with our body.  
Oh, God.  
 Let my neighbor's dog back three times at three a.m.  
in the morning.  
Let me know it's your wheel."  
Then you're, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo  
 The Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we are the children of God.  
And you know, this is the most important thing.  
And that's your salvation.  
And if for your salvation, you require the Holy Spirit to bear witness with your Spirit, all the other things which are less, why wouldn't He do the same?  
He's the most important thing.  
You didn't require some sign somewhere.  
And you could trust this, the Spirit bearing witness with your spirit.  
 How much more should you trust that same witness for other things in life?  
Let me show you more.  
You still there?  
Glory to God.  
Sir Luke's Gospel, chapter 22, a very interesting account here from Jesus.  
Sir Luke's Gospel, chapter 22.  
I want to read to you from verse 31.  
 Are you there?  
The Lord, verse 31, and the Lord said, it's talking to Peter, Simon Peter.  
He says, Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desire to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.  
But I have prayed for thee.  
See, Jesus anticipated evil coming to Peter.  
He anticipated Peter's denier.  
He knew something was going to go wrong with Peter.  
 And he did something about it.  
He said, Simon, Simon, Satan had desired to have you that he must sift you as wheat.  
But I prayed for the hallelujah that thy faith failed not.  
And when thou had converted, strengthen thy brethren.  
When you are restored, strengthen your brethren.  
So Jesus forewarned you.  
You know, I was still in the Bible and the prophet of God was looking at a man.  
 He looked at him and started crying.  
He was just crying, the man said, why are you crying?  
He said, because God has shown me what you're going to do to Israel.  
He said, what?  
Me?  
He said, yes.  
You're going to deal terrible havoc to Israel.  
He said, me?  
Am I so wicked?  
But the prophet had foreseen it.  
That's why sometimes you see a man who's just been so nice and kind and wonderful  
 until he gets into a place of power and influence.  
He's turned into something else.  
He has become the very thing that he was trying to destroy.  
Look at Peter was tough.  
He was the guy who had a sword with him at the arrest of Jesus and he was ready to defend Jesus.  
And he caught the high priest's servant  
 of the ear, actually cut the ear off, and Jesus picked it up and slapped it back and healed the man and said to Peter, put back your sword.  
Hallelujah, Jesus.  
And in spite of that miracle, there's still our instant Jesus.  
How wicked they are.  
 that's to let you know how human beings are just because you're good doesn't mean you know people say I don't know what have I done to my neighbors what have I done I've been a nice man I've tried I've helped everybody and I don't know why they hate me they hate you you haven't seen anything yet people will not be your friends just because you're good stop thinking like that stop expecting others to love you just because you're nice this world is evil  
 The Bible says the heart of man is desperately wicked.  
So don't think that because you're good or that you just see your goodness and be helpful to you.  
They may praise you, but man's praise, man's love is fickle.  
Just annoy them once.  
 And you will know.  
So when men love you and praise you, treat it like chewing gum.  
Don't swallow it, brother.  
Chew it and spit it out.  
If you keep swallowing chewing gum, so do something terrible to your body.  
You're still there?  
 So Jesus said to Simon, Simon, he said, Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wit.  
He said, what I have prayed for you, that your fate fail not.  
When you are restored, strengthen your brethren.  
Now let's see what happened here.  
Verse 33, and he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, but  


  
 He was ready to go with Jesus to prison.  
He was ready to go with Him anywhere.  
He said, I'm ready.  
Come, what may?  
What Jesus say?  
He said, I tell the Peter.  
There's Simon.  
Let me read this.  
Simon said, Lord, I am ready to go to deal with you and even to die with you.  
 Said, I'm ready.  
How many times have we been ready to do anything for the Master?  
We're so ready.  
Lord, I'm ready.  
Jesus anticipated evil.  
Peter couldn't see it.  
Peter didn't see it coming.  
Peter didn't see his witness.  
He didn't see it coming.  
Jesus, I've prayed for you that your faith failed not.  
When you are restored,  
 Strengthen your brethren.  
He said, Master, I'm ready to go to jail with you.  
I'm ready to die with you.  
No matter what happens, the master said, hold on, Peter.  
Before the court closed twice, you would deny me thrice.  
He said, Master, me!  
Never!  
I will never deny you!  
The next morning,  
 What happened?  
The very thing happened.  
A man said to Peter, you look like one of them, me?  
Never.  
And then another one.  
Then a little girl.  
A little girl looked at Peter and said, you resemble them.  
He started cussing.  
Peter started cussing.  
 I've never been with that man.  
If anyone says this on me, God, I swear to God.  


  
But you see, that was human frailty.  
And then the cock, and when Jesus was inside the hall, oh, what a beautiful picture.  
 Peter was here denying Jesus, the cock crows.  
Jesus turns back and Peter catches his eyes.  
At that moment, Peter remembered what Jesus said.  
He felt like killing himself.  
He said, I failed.  
He ran away.  
He wanted to destroy himself.  
He was so confused, didn't know what to do.  
So when he heard that Jesus had reason,  
 He was thinking how to apologize.  
He came to look for him, but oh no, he was not there.  
But I love Jesus.  
He said to the woman, Mary Magdalene, he said, go and tell my brethren and Peter.  
Called him by name, remembered him.  
Tell him I've risen.  
 and they should meet me in Galilee.  
He wanted him to know he still believed in him.  
Hallelujah.  
Praise God.  
But Jesus anticipated it.  
Peter couldn't see it.  
Have you ever been able to measure the way you're going to know that your faith has not been strong lately?  
 And at the push of a button, you may just say what you shouldn't say.  
Jesus prayed for Peter.  
What would you do under circumstances?  
You pray.  
I told you, when Jesus anticipated evil, he said, my spirit is heavy.  
The Bible says he was so sad.  
His visage was of sadness.  
He was so heavy.  
 And he asked his disciples, he said, pray with me.  
They were too tired, they slept.  
He anticipated evil.  
He knew something was about to happen.  
Then he prayed to the father.  
He said, if thou be willing, let this copass from me.  
Nevertheless, not my will, but I'll be done.  
Let me show you, lastly, another very touching moment  
 in Scripture, the book of Acts, chapter number 27.  
Have you seen it?  
Okay.  
From verse 9, Acts chapter 27, from verse 9.  
 read want to go.  


  
 Nevertheless, the tension gone in the ears of our other owner.  
Gone?  
Even because of what's going on in time.  
More than the rest of the world has passed.  


  
 Okay, thank you.  
You're going to have to do your personal study of it and read all of that to the end of the chapter.  
But here's the background.  
Paul was arrested.  
He was a prisoner at this time.  
 And the soldiers that were to take him to Caesar because he had appealed to Caesar.  
And so his case was being moved to Rome.  
So he was going to see Caesar.  
Now, that necessarily didn't mean face to face, but he was on that Caesar's judgment.  
So the soldiers put him in the ship and they jumped.  
There were others there.  
 traveling, the total number of them was about 276 people on this journey.  
And they got to this place, this place called Fair Havens.  
It was a particular habit at the time.  
And the journey was already quite dangerous.  
 things weren't going too well.  
And it wasn't a very convenient place for the winter, because the winter was already at hand.  
So they said, Paul said to them, Sars, I perceive, you see, this is a second time that Paul would use this term, all right?  
Or rather,  
 The scripture would use this term in regard to Paul.  
On one occasion he was preaching and Bible says that he perceived that the man who was important in his feet had faith to be healed.  
Paul perceived that the man had faith to be healed and so called out to him.  
This is a spiritual kind of perception.  
You're not talking about you sniffing your nose and saying you can smell something on the wall.  
This is spiritual perception.  
 to perceive something by your spirits.  
So on his occasion, he said, Sars, I perceive that this voyage, this journey will be with hurt, with a lot of destruction, and our lives are in danger.  
We are in danger of losing everything, including our own lives.  
My advice is that we stay here, even though  
 We are in a difficult situation staying here.  
My advice is that we stay here because I perceive that the journey will be with grave danger.  
He anticipated evil.  
He anticipated evil.  
He could see something wrong happening.  
Then the Bible says that they would rather listen  
 to the, to the captain.  
And majority carried the date.  
More of them, if you study probably what you read, more of them sided with the captain.  
They said, well, you know, it's not, we can't stay here for the winter.  
It's going to be too cold.  
And by the way, it looks like if we can just get over to the other side, then it'll be better.  
So the larger number,  
 agreed to Johnny and Paul had to keep quiet after all he was a prisoner.  
So they went on the Johnny.  
If you study you'd notice as the Johnny out of that place the wind showed that everything seemed even better.  
So it seemed better  
 You can imagine some of them saying, see now, that guy down there was trying to tell us not to move.  
See, everywhere he's getting brighter already.  
So they moved on and then the Bible tells us until suddenly the weather changed, suddenly, for the next two weeks they will not see the sun, they will not see the moon.  
They were in darkness for the next two weeks.  
 a very dangerous voyage.  
The Bible records that they could no longer control the ship.  
They had to let it go.  
The wind was tossing it this way and that way, this way and that way.  
And they had to start throwing all their belongings out.  
Aren't you the God rid of everything?  
 Wasn't that what Paul said?  
They had lost everything.  
Now their own lives were in danger.  
Until Paul said to them, size, you should have listened to me when I told you not to move.  
He said, you should have listened to me.  
Nevertheless, the angel of the Lord appeared to me  
 last night.  
And he told me that I will surely be brought to Caesar, which means I will get to where I'm going.  
And then he also said that the Lord has given me all those who are joining with me.  
So be a good chair.  
None of you will lose your lives.  
Now the prisoner was in charge.  
 So they agreed with him and followed what he said until some smart guys wanted to do something foolish.  
They thought once we get close to anywhere we feel there's hope we escape.  
So they pretended that they were going to fix something at the front of the hall.  
And the Bible says they actually had planned to escape with the boats.  
 How did Paul know about the spirit?  
Paul was inside.  
He called out to the commanding officer.  
He said, sir, except everybody remains on this ship.  
You were all perish.  


  
So then the commander realized that some people were trying to escape.  
They checked and then he caught all the live boats that had been attached.  
 and let them go.  
Were they saved?  
Yes, they were.  
They were saved by the word of that man of God.  
Hallelujah.  
This is very important.  
He anticipated evil.  
And because his spirit was enlightened in that direction, he knew exactly how to pray and not to let other people lead him to his own destruction.  
 We hear that a boss carrying 25 people with three of them born again.  
The boss burnt and burned everybody, including those who were born again inside.  
This kind of thing shouldn't be that way.  
Do you understand?  
The Christian is different from the non-Christian.  
And God always wants to show that there's a difference between his children and those who don't know him.  
 But because many of God's children have not been taught, how to function in the Spirit, they suffer like non-Christians.  
Your life shouldn't be that way.  
Or like the lady that gets pregnant with the child, she should have never been pregnant with.  
Every day, oh God, if you don't give me a child, I will die.  
I will die.  
I will die.  


  
 Just because you have no heart and child.  
Every day you've disturbed heaven with your prayer about this child's thing.  
Once it's time for prayer.  
You remember my kiss?  
You remember my kiss?  
Father, this year, this year, if I don't have a child this year,  
 Through confession, body, you are pregnant.  
Body, you are pregnant.  
Okay, finally, body now gets pregnant.  
Until the lady dies at childbirth.  
And a lot of times, including the baby.  
What is all this?  
Is this the work of God?  
 No.  
The Bible says, the blessing of the Lord may get rich and he added no sorrow with it.  
How can God now bring you this blessing that has now brought so much evil into the home?  
The child has died, the woman has served, have been praying and confessing, has died.  
The whole family is bereaved.  
What is all this?  
Be careful what you ask for because you might get it.  
 If you learn to ask God for the things that He has planned to give you, don't ask for things because other people have them.  
Father, my neighbor, my neighbor, my neighbor.  
What's the problem?  
You and your neighbor are not the same.  
Leave your neighbor alone.  
Your neighbor has seven children and is not even asking.  
 for any, and has mistakenly gotten pregnant for the 8-1, and is angry.  
You don't even have a choice if I don't look now.  
Is this not a travesty of justice?  
She has seven mistakenly with an 8-1, and here I am for eight years, no child.  
Is there nothing else in life that you can be excited about?  
Isn't there anything else in life that you can be happy about?  
 or the guy that's been crying for his wife, that finally got one.  
You finally got one.  
Now you're looking for how to run a week.  
Stay there!  
You haven't seen anything yet.  


  
Finally, you got one.  


  
 Now you don't know who is the boss at home.  
Now you're looking for how to call Pastor on the phone.  
I don't understand my wife.  
You don't understand your wife.  
You just want to understand.  
Just continue.  
Very soon you will understand your wife.  
After I receive her, I receive.  
You have now received.  
What you ask for has come.  
 function in God's perfect will for your life.  
The Bible says, be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.  
That he may prove what is that good and what?  
Acceptable and perfect will of God.  
There is the good will of God.  
There is the acceptable will of God.  
And there is the perfect will of God.  
Which one do you want to live in?  
The perfect will of God.  
 The good will of God is that general will of God, like he says, going to all the world in prison gospel.  
And so Paul and his team went to preach.  
But there was the perfect will.  
God said not this time in Asia, not this time in Bethany.  
They're not going there.  
Did he eventually preach in Asia?  
Oh yes, he preached in all of Asia.  
He covered it with the gospel eventually.  
 But things have to be done in God's perfect timing, in God's perfect order.  
Hallelujah.  
See, a lot of things we pray for or pray against, we would be saved of those problems if we would just educate our spirits.  
So your spirit recognizes the voice of God.  
How do you recognize the voice of God by starting his word?  
That's his language.  
 That's his language.  
That's his language.  
Okay.  
You lit a candlestick.  
Put it on your television set.  
Because you said there was no light.  
Your head started sleeping.  
You told yourself, you soon wake up.  
You are watching.  
The spirit says, remove that candle now.  
 You say, I will put it off as soon as I'm ready.  
God says, Son, put off the candle now.  


  
You look at the time.  
I want these people to bring light.  
What are they doing?  
What are they doing?  
You grumble, grumble, grumble, and forget what the Spirit of God is saying.  
Then you sleep only to wake up  
 the whole house or rounded with fire.  
Jesus!  
Jesus!  
Jesus!  
Jesus!  
Jesus came before the fire started.  
You didn't listen.  


  
Educate your spiritual response of God at once.  
Learn to respond to the Spirit of God at once.  
 When the Spirit speaks to you, learn to respond quickly.  
It's one of the ways of training your human spirit.  
Okay, you're traveling.  
You're driving.  
Sleep is coming.  
You find yourself driving like...  


  
 So I said, are you sleeping?  
No, I can not be sleeping.  
Until you bow!  
And you got to just save your life.  
The whole car ruins it.  
This is a testimony.  
It's not a testimony.  
It's so close to always.  


  
 God, listen, if you will listen to the Holy Spirit, a lot of the problems that you find yourself getting into, you will be saved of them.  
You will be saved of them.  
Listen, listen quickly, respond quickly to the Holy Spirit.  
Respond to the Holy Spirit quickly.  
 Sometimes you are even in fellowship with certain people.  
God doesn't want you running with them.  
This stands yourself.  
There are things the Holy Spirit would talk to you about.  
Learn to listen to Him.  
Don't wait for the spectacular.  
What is important is the supernatural.  
The guidance of the Spirit of God in your life is already supernatural.  
It doesn't have to be spectacular to be supernatural.  
 For some of you, you receive salvation in a very simple way.  
Someone shared the Word of God with you and you just listened and accepted it.  
There wasn't any spectacular thing.  
But that doesn't mean your salvation is not supernatural.  
It's supernatural.  
It doesn't have to be spectacular.  
So if it's spectacular, great.  
Or don't wait for the spectacular.  
 Every guidance of the Holy Spirit is supernatural.  
Supernatural means it's beyond the natural.  
It's beyond the natural because the Holy Spirit is involved in it.  
And the Holy Spirit doesn't function in the natural world.  
Why did so many people lose money?  
And this last economic bust.  
Why?  
Because most were not listening.  
 to the voice of the Spirit of God.  
I want several times about the stock market.  
I want several times here, several times.  
It looked to stable to have a problem.  
So many were not listening.  
I want several times.  
When it happened,  
 You know, like the devil sometimes, it's just gradual.  
They say, don't worry.  
By next, everything will change like this.  
So you added more.  
They said, there are some problems, but we have been told that in about one week, everything will be normal.  
It went down.  
Then they said, actually, there are some people that just reduced some money.  
Everything just went up.  
So some other people are bringing some money now.  
So you put in more.  
Until your  
 You had invested eight nair.  
It appreciated for 43 nair.  
You were waiting for it to be 60 before you would liquidate.  
Then suddenly it went to 30.  
They said you should hold on.  
You held on.  
It went to 20.  
They said you should hold on.  
You invested eight.  
Your head could not tell you.  
Yeah, because your head does not know the truth.  
 It will take the spirit to educate you in such things.  
From the edge, now it's two.  
How can you take out the tuna hair?  
It's now a problem.  
It went to 43.  
You wanted it to hit 60.  
Then to 30, 20, 15, 10, 8, you still didn't take it out.  
They kept telling you, don't worry.  
 In three days time, now it's two now.  
When you remember it, you do like this.  
You don't even want to think about it.  
Imagine if you have been listening.  
Imagine if you have been listening.  
See, it's not when trouble comes, you start learning to listen to the Holy Spirit.  
You listen now, then the lessons you have learned  
 The lessons gained will be present for you in the time of crisis.  
And then it will produce results for you.  
Are you hearing this?  
We're going to pray.  
I know that somehow there are things that will be coming to your mind, maybe where you missed it.  
A lot of times it's where we missed it that comes to us, the quickest.  
 Yeah?  
Well, you may have lost something.  
Whatever it was that may have gone wrong.  
When we sat praying, remember that the lessons that are coming to you now are for a greater future.  
Amen.  
Amen.  
Yes, so believe in a greater tomorrow.  
 But that greater tomorrow must begin with today's principles.  
And that's what you're doing right now.  
That's why I tell you, don't miss church services.  
Because even when the subject is not related to what you may be going through at the time, there is the ministry of the Holy Spirit beyond what you see that's taking place.  
 And at such times, the Holy Spirit impresses things in your spirit that will come to you later.  
The blessings of that fellowship are also so important.  
The atmosphere of faith is your spirit to be energized to function in God's plane of life.  
And that's what you should be looking forward to.  
Every time you go into service,  
 No one may know that you're there, not there.  
What's important is I'm going to have the Holy Spirit minister to me today.  
I'm going to have the blessings of God's Word today.  
I'm going to have the blessings of the rich fellowship of God's people today, the atmosphere of a corporate anointing.  
I'm going to be a part of it today.  
So you come to church having that in mind that the anointing will be in the air here and it will rest upon you.  
 Hallelujah.  
Stand up and let us pray.  


  
Just go ahead and talk to the Lord.  
Thank Him for the opportunity to receive the words, to be taught.  


  
Thank Him for the time of learning
