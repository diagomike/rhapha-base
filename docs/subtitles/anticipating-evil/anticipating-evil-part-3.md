title: Anticipating Evil Part 3
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 anticipating evil, we need to develop our spirits to recognize when the Spirit of God is leading us about something that we ought to be careful about.  
The theme scripture, Proverbs chapter 22, and read verse three for me.  
One, two, go.  


  
 Again, a prudent man see at work and work and hide it himself.  
But the simple, they keep going and what happens, they are punished.  
So, why is man?  
 sees evil ahead and takes another way.  
He says, but the simple keep going and they're punished.  
They get into trouble.  
That's why many people get into trouble.  
Because they've never been taught about things like this.  
Glory to God.  
 a woman some years ago was out for her business.  
She was just out in the city.  
And somewhere at the city center, she had this strong urge to pray.  
And she just sat down on the cab and began to pray.  
So loud and so fast people gathered around her.  
 Wondering what the matter was.  
Turned out she was a Christian.  
She actually was the wife of a police officer.  
So she was praying so hard and fast and people gathered around her.  
You know, what's happening?  
What's happening?  
But she was praying and she was praying.  
She was, her heart was heavy.  
Finally, when she came down, somebody recognized her.  
 They said, can I take you home?  
They went home and found out, robbers had come to their home, searched everywhere, taken out all the important things, scattered the whole house, cost them a looking for things, but then they parked everything and heaped them up somewhere and left them.  
 Nothing was removed.  
Why?  
Because that woman responded to that urge of the spirit to pray now.  
And she prayed now and saved the situation.  
A certain family got together in a restaurant they were eating.  
Suddenly the man said, we've got to go home now.  
 They hadn't even, they hadn't finished.  
He said, I just have this art, we have to leave now.  
We've got to go home now, now.  
And they left their food and got into the car and went home.  
Got there, the house was burning, was on fire.  
Just in time to save their belongings.  
Just in time.  
Could have lost everything.  
Just in time.  
 Said a young guy got into a boss.  
They were supposed to be traveling.  
When the boss was about to leave, he had this urge to calm down.  
They argued with him and argued he said, I'm not going again.  
He came down.  
Shortly after the boss left, got on fire, everybody died.  
Young man saved his life.  
 because he was listening to his spirit.  
He was listening to his spirit.  
I want us to go again to the Book of Acts chapter 27.  
I'm going to read to you from verse 9.  
Are you there?  
 Verse 9, Now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already passed, Paul admonished them.  
Remember Paul was a prisoner at this time and they were in this ship traveling and they had gotten to this particular harbor and he made the statement when they wanted to take off.  
 Paul admonished them, verse 10, and said unto them, sars, I perceive, I want you to mark that word, perceive.  
I perceive that this voyage, this journey, will be with hurt and much damage.  
 not only of the letting and ship, but also of our lives.  
It is I perceive that this Johnny is going to be dangerous and we will not only lose everything, but even our lives."  
Then he advised them, let's stay here and not move on.  
Let's wait.  
You read the rest of the story, the majority  
 Say, Ed, let's go on.  
Everything is all right.  
The weather isn't too bad.  
Plus that.  
We can't even stay here.  
This place is not good enough.  
Let's move to the other side when we get there.  
We can rest.  
That side is better than here.  
We can't stay here at winter time.  
And winter is just around the corner.  
So let's move over there and winter there.  
Well then, they started out.  
When they started out, everything looked even better as they moved on.  
 And they began to say, the man at Rasko over there telling us to stay back, look now.  
He was telling us, selling will be dangerous.  
Everything's getting better.  
Well, as they went on in their journey, the Bible says, suddenly, suddenly the weather changed.  
Suddenly, suddenly, and eventually led to the destruction of the ship and everything they had.  
 they lost everything, and they were now trying to save their own lives.  
And you read the story, it was Paul's prayer that even saved them.  
An angel appeared to him and said,  
 be not afraid, you will surely get to your destination and the Lord has hurt your prayer and has given to you all those who are joining with you.  
So they were protected because of Paul.  
Are you still there?  
Paul said, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage.  
 But only of the living and the ship, but also of our lives, I perceive.  
We call it spiritual perception.  
We are not talking about I perceive in your sleeping and sleeping with your nose.  
No, we're talking about spiritual perception.  
Where within your spirit you have this, what we call inward intuition or inward witness.  
It's within your spirit.  
It's a knowing in your spirit.  
 But you see, your spirit has to also be developed to recognize those things better.  
So you're going to have to train your spirits.  
Because a lot of times, some people say they got in their spirits, they're actually having their head.  
And they don't know the difference.  
 So they say, I know this in my spirit, but they are wrong because they're actually thinking about their heads.  
How are you going to know what the difference is?  
Hey, it's very simple.  
It's very simple.  
Turn the Galatians chapter 5 and reach them to you.  
Verse 16 into verse 17.  
This I say then, walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the loss of the flesh.  
 Is that what you saw in 16th verse?  
Okay, verse 17, for the flesh lost it against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh.  
And these are conerari, the one to the other.  
They are opposed to themselves.  
 The Spirit is opposed to the desires of the flesh and the desires of the flesh are opposed to the desires of the Spirit.  
Let me read to you from the Amplified.  
Verse 17, for the desires of the flesh are opposed to the Holy Spirit and the desires of the Spirit are opposed to the flesh.  
Simple.  
 See, if you are interested in doing something, the chances are you will get the ideas to do them.  
And if you're not careful, you're gonna think it's the Spirit of God, okay?  
You want a job in Chevron, because you want an oil company.  
Now use that brand.  
 Most of the time you're going to have this belief that that's where God is sending you because you've always wanted to have an oil company job.  
There's a difference between asking God for something and claiming what we are asking for  
 There's a difference between that and God leading us in His will.  
They are not the same.  
They're not the same.  
Somebody says, does God give you what He doesn't want for you?  
Oh yes, you can.  
Yes, you can get from God what He doesn't want to give you.  
The Bible shows us you can.  
 The Bible shows us you can.  
Didn't you read of Balaam?  
He asked God three times.  
God said, no, no.  
Finally, God said, okay.  
He convinced God.  
And finally, the Bible tells us God forbade the madness of the prophet by letting the dumb ass speak to him.  
 Just because something you want seems to be working out is not proof it's from God.  
God sent Moses to talk to the rock to bring out water.  
The first part of their journey, the Bible tells us that God actually told him to strike the rock and water will come out.  
So he went with his rod and he struck the rock and water came out.  
 and the people drunk.  
The next time he asks God again, the people are thirsty, what are we going to do?  
God said, all right, take your rod in your hand and go to the rock.  
And in the presence of the people, talk to the rock.  
Talk to the rock.  
And water will come out.  
Well, he got there.  
And because he was mad at the people for some of the things they said, he didn't talk to the rock.  
He struck the rock like he did before.  
 Water came out as God said it would.  
But Moses had done the wrong thing.  
God said, talk to the rock, not strike the rock.  
But he was used to striking.  
So he struck the rock the first time when it came out.  
And this time, he struck the rock again and water came out.  
Just because water came out didn't mean it was God.  
You know what God said?  
He said, Moses, because of this,  
 You will see the promised land, but you will not go in.  
You still there?  
So just because what you were asking for, you got it, doesn't mean  
 It was from God.  
You know, there's a scripture sometimes, you know, people quote and they go wrong.  
They say, if we ask according to His will, you know, you read from 1 John in chapter 5, you read from the 15th verse to the 15th verse.  
If you ask according to His will, all right, He hears you.  
 And if you know he is you, you also know you have the petitions that you desire of him.  
Now, what he said there was not asking according to his will for whether or not that thing is his will.  
What he made there was asking according to his will for asking.  
That means the principles governing asking and receiving.  
 So there he was dealing with the laws of prayer, the principles of prayer.  
He wasn't saying to ask if the thing is this will, then you're going to get it.  
Then if it's not this will, then you're not going to get it.  
No.  
Getting it or not getting it's got nothing to do with God's will.  
Hear this.  
God never put the clause that if we pray, we only get it if God wants us to.  
No.  
He said, ask anything.  
You get it.  
 So you better be careful of what you're going to ask for because you're going to get it.  
How are you getting this?  
It's very important because we are children of God.  
He doesn't hold back from us.  
What he does is to teach us.  
For example, you go back to the Old Testament and do the same thing.  
God said to them, I put before you life and I put before you death.  
 Then I put before you blessing and I put before you cousin.  
Then he said to them, I'll tell you what to choose.  
He said, choose life.  
The options are before you, but life is better than death.  
So he says, choose life.  
The options are all yours in the New Testament same thing.  
He said, whether Paul or Paulus or the word or things present or the future or life or death, he said, it's all yours.  
 And the word is, it's all yours.  
What you choose is not to you.  
It's all yours.  
It's all yours.  
So God doesn't hold back from you.  
So, you know, as a child, you can ask anything.  
Give me, give me, give me, give me.  
 But when you grow, you start learning to know the perfect will of God.  
You don't want to just ask what you want.  
You want to know the perfect will of God for your life.  
That becomes the most important thing in your life.  
Not what I want, but what he wants for me.  
Because I want to be the man or the woman that he chose me to be.  
 Remember that in your life.  
It's very important.  
You know, the Bible shares us about the gifts of spirit.  
Maybe we should, let me read something to you.  
Turn the ox up to 20.  
Verse 22,  


  
 I want you to read verses 22 to 24.  
Do you see that?  
Gone.  


  
 Raise God.  
Says, and now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem.  
Is I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem?  
Not knowing the things that before me there, except that the Holy Ghost witnessed it in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.  
Did you notice what he said?  
 The Holy Ghost witness it in every city.  
The Holy Ghost witness it in every city that bonds and afflictions about me.  
The Holy Ghost witness it in every city.  
It's like what we read in Romans 8, in the 16th verse, let's say the Spirit of God bears witness with our spirits and we are the children of God.  
The Holy Spirit of God bears witness with our spirits.  
 See, he bears witness with our spirits, meaning that the Holy Spirit gives us in our spirits that information.  
Now this time, this is the Holy Spirit, witness is never sitting, in other words, I'll give you an example how that worked.  
Believe us in different places, had this knowing,  
 that something wrong, or not wrong, was something terrible was going to happen to Paul.  
They had the indication in their spirits.  
Now, this was because of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  
Sometimes, as God's children, we seem to know something.  
 See, a child of God can't know something.  
It doesn't mean you're a prophet because you know something.  
You can know something of the future.  
It doesn't make you a prophet.  
You can know something of the future.  
Jesus said, when He, the Spirit, through this God, into our truth, He tells us the Holy Spirit would show you things to come.  
He'll show you things to come.  
That means He'll show you the future.  
Who's going to do that for?  
 God's people, God's children.  
When you receive the Holy Spirit, He lives in you.  
You can get to know something of your own future or of another person's future.  
But you see, it doesn't mean you're going to know everything about your future or about another person's future.  
But sure enough,  
 You don't, being the dark, praise God.  
If you function rightly, I'll read this to you.  
In chapter 21, Book of Acts, I want you to notice some things here.  
Remember what Paul said, I perceive, I perceive, I perceive.  
That's what he said, okay?  
When we read earlier in the 27th chapter, okay, here,  
 from verse 8, 21, book of Acts, okay?  
Alright, verse 8.  
And the next day, we, that way of power's company, departed and came onto Caesarea, and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven and abode with him.  
 And the same man, this is Philip, had four daughters, Virgers, which did prophesy.  
I mean, young women, they weren't prophesied.  
Somebody said they were preachers, but that's not the point.  
The point is here, they did have a gift of prophecy.  
They had a gift of prophecy.  
A gift of prophecy.  
 Notice that they did prophesy.  
They didn't say there were prophecies.  
He says they did prophesy.  
All right, look at the next place.  
And as we tarry there, many days, they came down from Judea, a certain prophet named Agabos.  
There's a difference between these ones that had a gift of prophecy and this other one that was a prophet.  


  
 You see the difference?  
This for had a gift, a prophecy.  
Forgers with a gift, a prophecy.  
The Bible says they did prophesy.  
But it doesn't tell us what they prophesied, okay?  
Then a man came from Judea  
 He, this was a man who had been named before.  
He didn't mention before, on another occasion.  
And the Bible says he was a prophet.  
And this man did something that prophets would do.  
He took Paul's gutter, bound himself with it, and said, Thoth said, the Holy Ghost, so shall the Jews, bind the owner of this gutter in Jerusalem.  
 He prophesied concerning something that was going to happen to Paul in the future.  
But in every city the Holy Ghost witnessed, witnessed, witnessed, didn't say the Holy Ghost prophesied, he said, witnessed, which means many believe us in different places, in different cities had this witness about the Holy Ghost that something like this was going to happen to Paul.  
And it must have set them praying, praying.  
Paul also knew  
 that something was going to happen.  
But then he said, none of these things move me.  
He says, I'm going bound into spirits.  
I've got to do this.  
I know it's going to be dangerous, but I've got to do it.  
You know, just because something bad is going to happen doesn't mean you should run away.  
 And the Bible says, everybody began to say to Paul, hey, please don't go, please don't go, please don't go.  
The Holy Ghost tells us something's going to go wrong.  
Please don't go.  
He said, stop it.  
Do you mean to break my heart?  
I'm not only ready to suffer in Jerusalem.  
I'm also ready to die there.  
I like that.  
It was a resolve because the man had a conviction.  
 Man of conviction don't run away.  
Did you hear what I say?  
He was a man of conviction.  
That's a man of character.  
Conviction.  
Most people don't have a conviction.  
Most don't have.  
They don't have something they stand for.  
 They don't have a cause in life, they fight for them.  
They don't stand for anything.  
They just live.  
They just live from day to day about themselves.  
The world is centered around them.  
Everything about life is about them.  
And something happens that chicken out.  
Man of fear.  
 Stand for something.  
Be bold about something.  
Stand for something.  
I'll never forget I was a student in school when the Vice Chancellor came, because they were offended that I was holding, kind of meetings I was holding.  
And he came, headed into the meeting while I was conducting the service.  
 And stood beside me, I kept conducting the service.  
Then I greeted him, good evening, sir.  
He said, can I have the microphone?  
I won't talk to my students.  
So I gave him the microphone.  
And got everybody to quiet down, and they sat down, and he talked.  
I don't think he ever spoke so fast in his life.  
 He talked so fast, somehow I think that he lost what he really wanted to say.  
Because he was mad, he was angry.  
He had wanted us to stop.  
But it kept saying things like, serve God well.  
One day, I'll teach you how to serve God.  
He was talking like that.  
He was so angry.  
So by the time we finished, he walked outside and he sent for me.  
 So I went outside to meet him.  
So what is your name?  
I told him.  
He said, one of these days, in fact me.  


  
So he was angry.  
He was angry.  
Then he said to me, yes, you've come a long way.  
He's angry.  
But he's not saying what he wants to say.  


  
 So, when he was through and stunned out of the place, a fellow student of mine came, smelling that things might just go bad, he said, please listen to the Vice Chancellor.  
Please, your education is in jeopardy.  
Please, he was begging me as I was walking down back to the meeting, listen to the Vice Chancellor.  
Please, listen.  
You see, men of fear, without convictions,  
 without convictions.  
I had a conviction.  
I had a cause.  
I knew what I was heading for in life.  
I remember maybe about two, three years later, something like that.  
I don't remember exactly now, but we were organizing the camp meeting and we were doing it on the campus.  
And as I prayed,  
 I perceived that there was going to be trouble during the conference.  
And because of this, I kept on praying.  
I kept on praying, praying about it.  
You know, I had this heaviness within my spirits.  
Something was going to go wrong.  
So I kept praying.  
I called some of my guys together, let's pray, you know, we prayed.  
And finally,  
 When I was spending my own one day, a few days before the conference, I saw in a vision, the Vice-Chancellor drive in, come out of his car, come into the camp meeting, in order the camp meeting to stop.  
So I knew when he was going to do it,  
 And I knew how he was going to do it, because I saw it in a vision.  
So on that night, I went to the back and stood at the back while the meeting was going on.  
I was waiting for the Vice Chancellor.  
Normally, I wouldn't stay there, you know.  
So the meeting went on for a while, and I was there waiting for the Vice Chancellor.  
Showing off, he showed up.  
 came out of his car just like I thought he would.  
Order that the meeting be closed.  
And the federal government at the time had also banned Christian meetings like this one on campuses.  
So he had a federal government backing to do what he was doing.  
What I had... Yeah.  
I had authority from a higher power.  
 So he ordered the meeting closed and everybody to get out.  
And some of the leaders were looking for me.  
I was looking at everybody from a strategic position.  
And after he was gone, I sent word around, you know, I was not going to be disobedient.  
He said to close up the meeting, get out of this place.  
I wasn't going to stay here.  
So I chose another hall still on campus.  
 and ask everybody to meet there.  
Vice Chancellor says, don't meet here.  
He didn't say, don't meet there.  
So I said, everyone over there, we start from 9.30 p.m.  
So at 9.30 p.m.  
they all came.  
And the security men stormed to the place.  
You know, one of them was the leader of the band.  
They all came because they had instructions to make sure we didn't meet.  
 So I came out.  
I said to the leader, I said, we're having this meeting.  
The Vice Chancellor is a human being.  
I said, if he insists that this meeting doesn't hold, he will lose his job and so will you.  
You will lose your job too.  
So just go back to your place and do other things.  
This meeting will hold.  
Beyond that, this is just the first day.  


  
 So we will continue till Sunday and leave on Monday.  
So, you know what he said?  
He said, okay, thank you.  
Thank you.  
And he went away.  
And of course we had the meeting.  
Hallelujah.  
Are you still there?  
Working with your spirit,  
 working with your spirit, listening to your spirit.  
If you want your spirit to be a sure guide, you must learn to follow the written word of God.  
If you want your spirit to be a sure guide.  
Remember, your spirit is not God.  
Your spirit is not God.  
Your spirit doesn't know everything.  
Otherwise, your spirit will be God.  
 Your spirit doesn't know everything.  
So your spirit has to be educated in the things of God.  
Your spirit has to be taught.  
So if your spirit is gonna be a char guide, you've got to learn the word of God.  
You know, sometimes there are people who already know that they wanna go in a certain direction.  
 And they think God is leading me in this direction.  
 And then you say, all right, would you mind us talking to pastors so and so?  
I mean, talk to the pastor and they say, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
You know why they say no?  
They already know what pastor's gonna say?  
Pastor's gonna say no.  
Okay, question, why is the pastor gonna say no?  
Is it because pastors blind and can't see what you see or because you know what pastor's gonna say from the Word of God and you wanna ignore the Word of God that he's gonna bring up to you?  
 And you don't want it.  
Most of the time, that's the reason.  
I know what it's going to say, because you know what the word says.  
And you don't want him to say what the word says.  
You see it?  
And there are people who prophesy.  
You better be careful about prophecies.  
And hey,  
 Have you ever seen a fake Nigerian dollar?  
How many of you have ever seen a fake Nigerian dollar?  
It's a Nigerian dollar.  
Have you ever seen a fake one?  
Have you seen a fake Nigerian dollar?  
Never seen a fake Nigerian dollar?  
Why?  
 because there's no genuine Nigerian dollar.  
We'll make any sense to fake a Nigerian dollar, because everybody will know Nigeria doesn't use dollars.  
But you can find a fake Nigerian IRA.  
You can find a fake American dollar.  
You can't find a fake American IRA.  
You get it?  
Nobody fakes something that doesn't exist.  
 Because it doesn't make any sense to fake it.  
You only fake something that has a genuine version.  
Why are prophecies faked?  
Because there are genuine prophecies.  
Why does the devil like the gift of prophecy so much?  
Because God likes the gift of prophecy so much.  
So the devil likes it too.  
 He likes to use it.  
So, but we've got to be careful about who's prophesying to us.  
Do you know there are people who have lost their businesses because of a particular brother or sister that they were always relying on who was giving them prophecy?  
The Lord says that he should invest in this day, and he invests because this brother is known to be so good in prophetic orderms.  
 I don't make him a prophet.  


  
I know people who lost their businesses, they lost their finances because they were listening to certain people who gave them prophecies.  
I know them.  
I know some people.  
I know them.  
I still know them today.  
They used to have money.  
They lost everything.  
They lost everything.  
 because of listening to some brother somewhere who had this prophetic, whatever it was, you know?  
And then he gives this prophecy and then he starts doing the praying for them.  
He starts doing the praying for them.  
Oh, how people love prophecy, especially the good one.  
Someone said, I don't like that brother.  
He always prophesies bad for me.  
 The gift of prophecy, hey, come on here.  
Hello, hello, hello.  
The gift of prophecy doesn't foretell, doesn't tell the future.  
 Now, that doesn't mean that anybody cannot know the future.  
I already told you the Holy Ghost will show you things to come.  
That means they show you the future, which means the possibility of knowing the future resides in our spirits because we've received the Holy Ghost.  
We can know.  
We can know, especially if you ask Him.  
Especially if you ask Him, you tell you.  
 So long as you don't want to confuse Him with your selfish desires, because that's always conflicting your mind.  
You see, when you're already headed in one direction, it's difficult for the Holy Spirit to tell you it's the other way, because you're not going to be listening.  
Your desire already collars everything.  
It's not going to help.  
It's not going to help.  
It's not going to help.  
 imagine you going home this afternoon and finding one million dollars left at the corner of your house and last night you asked God for money and this afternoon there's one million dollars in the back abandoned by some rascals somewhere let me tell you what terrible difficulty you're going to have do I take it  
 Do I take it to the bank, the police?  
Do I hide it somewhere?  
Do I call anybody else?  
You're going to be there.  
Not knowing exactly what to do.  
For some, they don't have a problem with that.  
Somebody says, try me!  
How many of you here boys?  
Let me tell you.  
 There was a day, there was a day.  
That day, that day may seem to be long gone.  
But I tell you, there was such a day.  
I did live in that day.  
There was such a day that we were taught, if you found something that wasn't yours, and you didn't know who owned it,  
 Take it to a place called Lost and Found.  
Report it to the authority.  
It was part of your character.  
There was no question as to, do I keep it?  
You couldn't ask such a question.  
You knew what to do.  
You were going to take it and return it to the place lost and found or to some authority figure who would do something about it.  
There was such a day.  
 I find it, you know, it's difficult to understand how people think today, you know?  
If God... If God didn't want me to have it, why did He put it here?  
Now they're holding God responsible for it.  
As far as they're concerned, it's God who put it there.  
He knew I needed it, so He gave it to me.  
 What has happened?  
You say, you fool to carry one million dollars and start looking for the police.  
In fact, the police are taking it from you for themselves.  
So what do I do?  
I can't give it to police.  
The police will eat it.  
I can't take it to the bank.  
They will divide it.  
There's nowhere to go, but with me.  
So the safest place is to be here.  
 Now, I know someone's asking, so should I bring it to church?  
To Pastor Chris!  
I know you're waiting for an answer.  


  
Okay, you find a million dollars first.  
 Then we sit down and start thinking what we're going to do?  
No, sir.  
You found a million dollars?  
Besides your house?  
It means you are going to have a million dollar trouble.  
You're about to hit a million dollar trouble.  
Be smart.  
If God organized one million dollars and put it beside your house,  
 They'll leave it for you.  
Don't worry about it.  
Go to the police.  
Take two or three lawyers.  
I'm telling you, take pictures.  
Because in a terrible place like this, all three lawyers can be killed.  
So make sure they never talk about it.  
Make sure they have sufficient witnesses.  
Call the neighborhood.  
 to come see, let everybody see it.  
Let many of us go to the station.  
It'll be difficult for anybody to do something with such money, I tell you.  
Now, when you return such a thing, and they take it away, don't say, can you imagine they just took the money?  
Nobody even asks me what I've eaten.  
You know, you want to be rewarded.  
 No, nobody needs to reward you for character.  


  
You know what will reward you for character?  
Life itself will reward you.  
And when it does reward, it rewards in a big way.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
 Then, you know, apart from those who are looking for one brother, so-and-so, who, in a prayer meeting, and, you know, these people always differ from the church.  
They always have ideas different from the church, but have these prophetic order answers that seek to guide the lives of others.  
Okay, yes, I see it.  
Now, you are interested in the sitting sister.  
You've been praying.  
I know you call brother James, or that John and brother Jimo to come together.  
 and join you in prayer, because you are interested in Sister Anne.  
Shenga Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan Mahegan  
 Another one sees the two of you giving out bread to many people.  
Take those prophecies and move to the pastel.  
Yeah, don't just, the Bible says, let two or three prophets speak, let the other judge, right?  
He got a judge.  
 Hey, first, that's a lot in chapter five, everybody.  
Somebody said, you mean I prophesied to you, and you took it to the pastor to examine it.  


  
So you are examining my prophecy?  
Yes, bro, yes.  
Yes.  
 How are you there?  
First Thessalonians chapter 5.  
And I want you to read from verse 19 to verse 21.  
1 to go.  
Quench not what?  
Haha.  
 despise not prophesyings.  
So allow prophesyings.  
Let people prophesy.  
Don't despise them.  
It's good, he says.  
Let's encourage people to prophesy.  
Yep.  
I'm for that.  
I prophesy.  
Many of you here prophesy.  
We encourage that.  
Read the next one.  
Prove what?  
Again.  
Go on.  
 Hold fast, that's which is good.  
And leave out the one that's not.  
Prove all things.  
You've got to prove the prophecy.  
Prove all things.  
Prove that prophecy.  
Take that prophecy.  
So I say, how, okay, that kind of vision, how are you going to prove it?  
Oh, first of all, the character of the person who is prophesying to you.  
When you take the matter to the pastor, he will begin with the character of the prophets.  
 That's how he will start.  
The character of the prophet.  
Did you know that an old prophet in the Bible led to the death of a young prophet?  
Because the Bible says he lied to him.  
He lied to the young prophet.  
He lied to him.  
As an old prophet, I don't think that that was the day he started lying.  
 Because God wanted to do something in the city and he brought this young prophet from somewhere else.  
Why didn't God tell him to do it?  
And when he heard about it, he said, I'm going to test to find out if that young prophet is from God or not.  
Then he used a lie.  
He didn't have to use a lie.  
And that young prophet listened to him against what God said to him.  
God said, don't eat in that city.  
 And this prophet came and said, hello, young man, come, come, come.  
I understand you're the prophet that came over from Judah.  
Hey, come on.  
The Lord just told me to have lunch with you.  
And he said, man of God, the Lord told me not to eat in this city.  
He said, I know, but he just changed his mind.  
He told me that I should tell you.  
Then the Bible says, but he lied.  
He lied.  
Young prophet turned around and followed him.  
 and he died of miserable death.  
And when he was killed, it was this old prophet that came and said, I heard his death.  
Where is his body?  
When he got there, he said, hey, he died because he didn't listen to the Word of God.  
He got to be careful.  
There are some who are friends of different ministers.  
 evangelists, doctors, so-and-so, will pray over your business.  
Then, prophet, brother, so-and-so, will pray over your business.  
Then, prophetess will pray over your business.  
You know, all these prophets and prophetesses and evangelists and pastor and so on, you think that if all these people are praying for me, there's no way I've got to know here.  
 He doesn't function by numbers.  
He don't convince him by the multiplicity of prayers.  
If all these people are praying, they say, you know the number of men of God that have recruited for this matter?  
I have said from ministers that are praying over this matter.  
You are finished.  
 Because those are things that offend God.  
Are you hearing me?  
He didn't think you should recruit several ministers to be praying for you.  
No.  
Be a member of a church.  
There, the brethren will pray for you.  
He sings you one pastor.  
You may have several instructors.  
That means different people may teach you something.  
 I mean, on Sunday, for example, you are listening to evangelists, doctors, so-and-so preaching.  
After that, you come to pastor, so-and-so.  
Then after that, Reverend Dr. Bishop, so-and-so, you listen to several of them teach.  
You may learn something, but it says to you, though you have 10,000 instructors in Christ, yes, you do not have many fathers.  
You see that?  
 So you may have several people.  
You read several books by several ministers.  
But only one is sent to you.  
Only one is sent to you.  
That one that is sent to you is the one whose counsel you follow.  
 You can be taught by others.  
You can learn something good because the Scripture will be there to prove whatever they're saying.  
But they are not called to counsel you.  
Counseling is in the ministry of the pastor.  
You see that?  
Counseling is in the ministry of the pastor.  
 Now, we have several pastors here.  
That doesn't mean that every one of them is your pastor.  
You have only one pastor.  
Now, the only ones that you are listening to are the ones that the pastor sent to you.  
Not anyone who is a pastor in the congregation.  
 See, but I was told by some, not a pastor, that something, something like that.  
But another pastor told me, what did the pastor say?  
You see, you've got to be smart in your life.  
And so whatever instruction we give goes through whichever pastors we have given to you, even onto the cell leaders,  
 The question is, are those leaders, are those pastors listening to what the pastor said to them?  
Because at the end of it, we all have only one pastor, and that is Jesus Christ.  
Which means whatever any one of us is going to say to you must come from the one and only Jesus Christ.  
Hallelujah.  
 Glory to God.  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
If only we would learn to develop our spirits.  
And let that spirit become a sure guide.  
He would help you in everything in life.  
He would make you financially buoyant, spiritually stored, materially wealthy,  
 and your life of the full of grace.  
Yeah, if you would learn to listen to Him.  
Say this with me.  
I choose to listen to the guidance of God's Spirit.  
I choose to listen to the Holy Spirit within me.  
 I choose to let the Word of God guide my conduct.  
I choose to let the Word of God, which is the light of God, shine on my path.  
I choose to be full of God's Spirit and the Word of God.  
Is that your choice?  
 Then go for it.  
Hallelujah.
