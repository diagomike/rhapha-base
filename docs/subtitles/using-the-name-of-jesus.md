Be blessed as we bring you an excerpt of one of the teachings from the Healing Stream's live healing services with the man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 What shall few thoughts with you from the Bible on the name of Jesus Christ?  
You know, Jesus gave us the legal authority to use his name.  
You've heard people praying the name of Jesus.  
You've heard people call on the name of Jesus.  
Have you ever wondered why?  
 Why do we use the name of Jesus in prayer when we pray?  
And what does it mean?  
When you pray in the name of Jesus, what does it mean?  
I'm going to read the few verses to you.  
And the first one,  
 The words of Jesus himself, what did he say?  
In St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 14, and then I'm reading to you from verse number 13, these are the words of Jesus.  
And whatsoever you shall ask in my name, that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  
 If you shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.  
That's extraordinary.  
This emphatically tells us that Jesus gave us the power of a Tony to use his name.  
We have the legal power.  
 to use his name.  
He told us we could.  
He says, if he shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.  
Now, let me read further to you in St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 16, from verse 23.  
And I want you to listen very carefully to the words.  
Jesus is talking here.  
 And in that day, he was referring to the day of the New Deal, when he opens a new way to the Father, the day of salvation that he came to consummate.  
So he says, when that day comes, and that day began from his resurrection.  
So he says, and in that day, you shall ask me nothing.  
 Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, He will give it to you.  
This is extraordinary.  
Jesus says, in that day, you shall not need to pray to Him.  
You do not pray to Jesus.  
He says, or whatever you ask the Father in my name, He'll give it to you.  
 So here again, Jesus says, we can pray in His name.  
He gives us the power, the legal authority to use His name.  
He says, whatever you ask the Father in my name, He'll give it to you.  
In my name.  
That's amazing.  
But then we say to ourselves,  
 What is so important about the name of Jesus that we should use it?  
Why does Jesus expect us to use his name?  
Why does he tell us we can use his name?  
What is in his name?  
What does his name represent?  
How can we just have confidence in the name?  
Because he told us we could use it.  
 What's in his name?  
Well, I'm going to read the Bible to you again.  
And this time, I want to read to you from Philippians chapter 2, from verse 9.  
And I want you to listen carefully to what he says.  
 where for God also had highly exalted him.  
If you read the verses before, you'll see us talking about Jesus Christ.  
He says, God, because Jesus humbled himself onto death, even the death on the cross, he says, God also had highly exalted him, exalted Jesus, and given him a name which is above every name.  
That's amazing.  
 God gave to Jesus a name that is above every name.  
Look what it says more.  
That at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow.  
Now I want you to notice the construction of the language.  
He says that at the name of Jesus, he's given him a name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow.  
 That language, that construction, means God made a sovereign decree.  
Meaning that it's become a law in the realm of the Spirit.  
Not a promise that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.  
That means every knee should submit.  
Everyone submits to the name of Jesus.  
 Look at it, of things in heaven and things in earth and things on that earth.  
Now the word that's translated things means whatever.  
It means beings, things, anything that exists.  
That was described with that word in the Greek.  
 that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things on that earth.  
Now, what does it mean on that earth?  
He's not talking about when you describe in the geography and you're thinking, okay, maybe it's the earth's crust.  
No, spiritual language again, because the Bible says, hell from beneath is moved to meet the Adai coming.  
That means in the spirit realm, hell,  
 is spiritually beneath the earth.  
So not in your physical description when you're thinking about digging into the earth or looking for where should you be with respect to another to call it beneath.  
You have to look at it from the language of the Bible.  
So he's referring to hell.  
That's amazing.  
 No wonder he told us we could raise the dead.  
No wonder he said so.  
No wonder he said so because even if a man went to hell, she could call him back.  
That's amazing because the name of Jesus Christ has power in heaven, in earth and on the earth.  
That's in hell.  
Now there's more.  
I want to read this time.  
Well, let's finish reading this.  
 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.  
That's remarkable.  
Everyone submits to the name of Jesus.  
Everyone declares the lordship of Jesus.  
His boss overall, he's above all.  
It doesn't matter what that thing is.  
A situation, a condition, a sickness, an ailment, an affliction,  
 Whatever it is, and then there's more.  
I'm gonna read Father to you in Ephesians chapter one from verse 17.  
Hear what it says.  
That the God, if you read the verses before, it's a prayer here that he prays for the Ephesian Christians, which means, and from the context, it meant it wasn't just for those who live there, but it's for every saint.  
 That's amazing, everyone who is born again, everyone who belongs to Jesus Christ.  
Now, here what he says.  
So he prays that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give on to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.  
That means the spirit of insights, insights into secrets and mysteries of the kingdom of God.  
He prays that God will grant you  
 insight that's amazing the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him he goes on to say the eyes of your understanding being enlightened the eyes of your understanding he's talking about your spiritual sight the eyes of your heart  
 being flooded with light, that he may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.  
Now, start following from this next verse because I'm talking about who this Jesus is, what kind of a name does he have?  
 And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us words?  
That means the greatness of his power directed to us who believe according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised him, talking about God, when he raised Jesus from the dead and set him out.  
Here's where Jesus is, it's amazing.  
He says, God raised Jesus from the dead and set him  
 At his own right hand, when you say right hand, you're not talking about the geographical location, you're talking about the seat of power.  
When you say, that man is my right hand man, you mean that he represents you, he has your authority to act in your stead.  
So the Bible says, God set Jesus at his right hand.  
So Jesus is in the seat of authority of God, in the heavenly places, in the heavenly realms.  
 Far, here's where Jesus is.  
Look at it.  
His position of authority.  
The Bible says far above all brings of polity and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come.  
That means the name of Jesus Christ is above every power.  
 Every rulership, every government, every authority.  
It's this criteria.  
Look at it.  
He's above all principality and power and might and dominion.  
And every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.  
This is extraordinary.  
No wonder the apostles use the name of Jesus.  
 And this is what Christians around the world must rediscover the power of the name of Jesus.  
You must learn to use the name of Jesus in all circumstances.  
Use the name of Jesus because he gave us victory in every situation in this world.  
But if you don't know, you will live the life of a failure.  
You'll live the life of a slave.  
You'll live a defeated life and you'll wonder why.  
 But it's because of the lack of knowledge.  
God said, my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge.  
Not the lack of power.  
He gave it to them.  
But if they don't know, they can't use it.  
Now, let me read for that.  
Let's read that same scripture one more time.  
 Far above all, principality and power and might and dominion.  
And every name that is named, not only in this world, but also, look at that.  
He's above every name that is named.  
Anything that you can call, anything that you can name.  
That's amazing.  
Not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.  
That means then, now and the future.  
 Next verse, watch now.  
And I put all things under his feet.  
God put all things under the feet of Jesus.  
This is remarkable.  
And I put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head of all things to the church.  
Ah, yeah, yeah.  
Look at the next verse, which is his body.  
 The fullness of him that felled on in all.  
Let me explain this to you.  
It's so simple, but it's so powerful, so profound.  
Those two verses, verses 22 and 23, what he's telling you is this, that God put all things on at the feet of Jesus and then declared Jesus to be the head and made the church, all those who believe in him, his body.  
 Meaning that Jesus becomes the head of a body that he calls the church.  
And then he calls the church the fullness.  
That means without the church, Jesus is incomplete in this world.  
And so when he says, and that's what all things under his feet, he means that below, look at your own body, your head is at the top.  
Then you have the rest of your body at the very lowest are your feet.  
 So, no matter where you are, when you stand on anything that is below your feet, even the lowest member of your body is above such things.  
 meaning that as a member of the body of Christ, as a Christian, it doesn't matter what role you occupy, what place in the church you occupy, what place in the body of Christ you belong, as long as you're in that body, you are above all things.  
Why would you live a life of fear?  
Why would you live a life of defeat?  
 Why would you be afraid of disease?  
It's amazing that many Christians today are afraid of sickness.  
And many even fled because of what they called COVID.  
They fled.  
They forgot who Jesus is.  
They forgot his name.  
They forgot the power of the name of Jesus.  
They forgot.  
They forgot.  
 Let me read another verse to you.  
Colossians chapter three, verse 17.  
See what the Bible says.  
And what so ever ye do in word or deed?  
That means whatever you do in speech or in action.  
He says, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.  
What life are you living?  
 He told you that whatever you do, do in the name of Jesus, the name of Jesus never fails.  
That's why he told you to do all things in the name of Jesus.  
What does that mean?  
It doesn't mean that when you want to clean your shoes, you say, I clean this shoes in Jesus name.  
I wipe this law in Jesus name.  
No, it's not the constant announcement.  
It is living in his name.  
That's what he's telling you.  
Living your life in the name of Jesus.  
 In our situations, in our circumstances, proclaim the name of Jesus Christ.  
Live as His representative.  
Doesn't the Bible tell you exactly what life you have?  
1 John, chapter 5, verse 11.  


  
 And this is the record that God has given to us eternal life.  
He didn't say shall give us.  
It's not a promise.  
The day you receive Christ into your heart, you receive eternal life.  
Look at it.  
And this is the record.  
It means this is the testimony that God has given to us.  
 eternal life, and this life is in his Son.  
Look at the next verse.  
He that had the Son had life, and he that had not the Son of God had not life.  
If you have Jesus Christ, you have this life.  
If you don't have him, you don't have this life yet.  
And once you have this life, let me show you another portion.  
 Chapter 4, verse 17.  
First John, chapter 4.  
Look at verse 17.  
Herein is our love made perfect.  
And we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is, so are we.  
Not so shall we be in heaven.  
Look at it.  
So are we in this world?  
I ask you, what life are you living?  
 God wants you to live like Jesus now.  
Live in His name from this day.  
Don't allow sickness or disease or infirmity have dominion over you and never live in fear.  
Let me show you that the very next verse, watch what it says.  
There is no fear in love.  
Do you believe God loves you?  
If He loves you, then there is no fear in love.  
 How can you live in fear?  
Look at it, there is no fear in love, but perfect love casts that out fear.  
Because fear had torment.  
When people have fear in their lives, they are tormented.  
Fear that fear is not made perfect in love.  
So you say, I refuse to fear.  
I will not fear.  
 So left in boldness in the name of Jesus, and no matter the condition that you have right now, no matter the affliction, no matter what prognosis, don't worry.  
Say to yourself, today is my day of liberty from this disease, from this pain, from this affliction, I will use the name of Jesus.  
All over the world, we're gonna use the name of Jesus.  
 We're going to use the name of Jesus, and you'll use it now.  
We trust that you have been blessed by this message.  
If you would like to invite Jesus Christ to be the Lord of your life, kindly say this prayer.  
Oh, Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ, Son of the living God.  
I believe He died for me, and God raised Him from the dead,  
 I believe He's alive today.  
I confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day.  
Through Him and in His name, I have eternal life.  
I'm born again.  
Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul.  
I'm now a child of God.  
 Hallelujah.  
Congratulations!  
You are now a child of God.
