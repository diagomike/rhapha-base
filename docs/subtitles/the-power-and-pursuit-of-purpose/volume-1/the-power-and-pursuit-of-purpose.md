title: The Power and Pursuit of Purpose Part 2
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and he left us with a message to tell the untold, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and his unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
 You are watching the Power and Pursuit of Purpose series on Pastor Chris Teaching.  
In a meeting like this, you look forward to so much from God.  
A personal impact.  
A personal impact.  
 Because if you are going to bless others, if you're going to help them to know God better, to be more effective in the things of God, to grow, then it must happen with you first.  
He said, you can't give what you don't have.  
 you can only give what you have.  
And these few days will help you acquire so much into your spirit in a way that's different.  


  
Humility is a key.  


  
 to walking with God.  
Humility.  
Being of a humble spirit.  
A humble mind.  
A humble heart.  


  
Very, very important.  
 During the meetings, you're listening for you.  
You're listening for what God has called to say to you.  
What the Spirit of God will do within you.  
Don't try to correct anybody.  
Don't correct anybody in your mind.  
You understand?  
Yeah, don't try to correct anybody in your mind.  
 The one you're not sure of, let it go.  
Maybe that's not for you.  
You get it?  
Don't get distracted trying to reason out what you didn't agree with.  
Some people are so carried away by the things they don't agree with that they never remember what they agree with.  
 So don't be carried away by something you didn't agree with.  
Let it go.  
Maybe that's not for you.  
Maybe this is not your time to know that one because you are not God.  
So you don't know everything.  
So maybe that one that you don't agree with, one that you discover.  
And then if it's wrong, in any case, let it go.  
What do you want to do with it?  
You understand?  
How to listen for what God is giving you.  
 so that when you leave here, the results will show.  
Don't allow it to be one more conference you attended.  
But that depends solely on you.  
The result of this conference will depend solely on you.  
We are prepared  
 We have received you.  
We have welcomed you.  
We are here now.  
So God is here.  
You are here.  
We're all here together.  
What happens from now is up to you.  
It's like, you know, when, you know, I go for different meetings, different programs to say it's on.  
And then I got lots of ministers and those will help us with security.  
 We're all moving as a large team, you know?  
Then the number starts reducing as we get closer to the platform.  
And then finally, they leave me.  
And I'm the only one up there.  
And I think, yeah.  
 They're saying to you, that's how far we can help you.  
What happens with you there now?  
You and God.  
And I know that.  
So same thing with you.  
We've even given you chairs to sit on.  
We've prepared, everything is set.  
What happens now?  
 is between you and God.  
The thoughts that come to you, what you will do with them between you and God.  
I wanna begin tonight to share with you a message that's coming through my spirit in a simple title.  
And I've been looking forward to sharing these things with you.  
 You'll be surprised for three years.  
And the title is, I've given you some of it before.  
What?  
This is, this is at another level.  
Let's come into you.  
The purpose.  


  
Okay.  
 Hold on.  
Everybody's about to write.  
I've not started giving you the title.  
But you have already written it as the title.  
The purpose of a message.  
See, I got you, right?  


  
Is to provide  
 instruction, information, guidance, not just to get you excited or to fill your notes.  


  
So are you ready for it?  
Okay, simple.  
My message from tonight, the power  
 in pursuit of purpose.  
The power and pursuit of purpose.  
What is purpose?  
Purpose is intent.  
Design.  


  
 The reason for being, the reason for course, the reason for an action.  


  
I have to say the reason, nature.  
Why do you do what you do?  
What motivates you?  
What drives you?  


  
 What's your fire?  


  
What's your purpose?  


  
Purpose matters.  


  
Well, somebody said, you have rhapsody of realities, a daily devotional  
 that's going around the world.  
Why?  
Why do we do it?  
What's the purpose?  
Somebody said, well, it's to evangelize.  
You are not totally right.  
That means you don't know.  
Oh, well, we want to use it to teach the Word of God.  
That means you don't know.  


  
 Purpose must be specific.  
Purpose is never general.  
Design is specific.  
That's what we say, design.  


  
Why are you doing it?  


  
 It's like asking the Christian, why do you go to church?  
He says, I go to church to save God.  
He hasn't gotten it.  
You know, generalizations in the mind never help us to actualize those things that the Spirit of God has deposited within us the visions that is deposited within our spirits.  


  
 Look what God has done.  
He's given us the Bible.  
A book of 66 books.  
So detailed.  
So detailed.  
Leaving us without assumptions.  
Clarity.  


  
 Hallelujah.  


  
So, peppers, what is causing your driving force?  
Why do you do what you do?  
Why are you pastoring?  
Why are you a minister of the gospel?  


  
 Who are you into this thing?  
And when will you stop?  


  
And there were some who expected me to stop somewhere along the line when my eyes were clear.  
They thought that by the time my eyes were clear, I would stop this my jumping around.  
 But it's been many years now, my eyes are still not clear in that way.  
Because my eyes were already clear.  
Alleluia.  
Did you ever know anybody waiting for you to calm down?  


  
Let me begin with some negative driving forces.  
 so that we can start clearing in our minds.  
Why do people do what they do?  
It doesn't matter what they do, whether it's a profession, whether they have moved to live in a certain place, whether it's about the church they go to, why do you go to that church?  
Why do you do this or that?  
Why did you move to that city?  
 Like some of you who have enrolled for some online courses that you are doing right now, why are you doing the online courses you are doing?  


  
Don't be so quiet now.  
Why are you doing what you're doing?  
Let's look at some negative driving forces.  
 The one that comes here of the list for me here is fear.  
There are different kinds of fear.  
Fear of failure, fear of the future, fear of man, fear.  
A lot of times they can't even define what they are afraid of.  


  
Fear.  
 There are people who are more motivated by fear than by faith.  
There are people who move to live in a certain place because of fear of danger.  


  
 Fear.  


  
Or until you locate the problem, locate the driving forces, these are negative driving forces, but they are driving forces.  
Anyway, they make people do what they do.  


  
Fear is number one.  


  
 It can make you do something and it can stop you from doing something.  
Fear.  


  
Fear, you might not be accepted.  
Fear of rejection.  
See it?  
People who are fear of rejection.  
 What something about, can we read Proverbs 29 and verse 25?  
Read for me, it's on the screen, want to go.  


  
The fear of man, bring at what?  
A snare, a trap.  
But anybody who puts his trust in the Lord shall be safe.  
 The fear of man brings what?  
A snare.  
He sets a trap for your life.  
But if you trust God, you are safe.  
You have people who are the fear of insecurity.  
They're not sure about their job.  
They're not even pastors.  
Sometimes they think that maybe their senior pastor is angry with them.  
Or maybe the regional pastor might just kick me out of here.  
 Why the fear, why this insecurity, why is it so?  
The fear of man sets a trap in your life that destroys you.  
But the one who trusts in God is safe.  
He never has to fear anything.  
He trusts in God.  
He's safe.  


  
 Number two, for number two, I have at least put together because they all related.  
Resentment, anger, bitterness, hatred, jealousy.  
These can be a driving force in someone's life.  
 You can resent someone or resent something that has been done and that prompts you to action.  
Are you aware that churches have started because somebody resented something in another church?  
That was their driving force.  
They started their ministry on the foundation of resentments, anger, bitterness.  
Churches have fought, fought themselves and spit right through the middle.  
 And some went this way and the other way.  
Resentments.  
Hatred.  
Jealousy.  


  
You have those who will not attain a pastor's conference or meeting of pastors in their group.  
Why?  
They have some resentments.  
They have some anger.  
That's inside bottled within.  
 For which reason, they're not going to go for that meeting.  
Because that pastor is the one that called for it.  
If the other one calls for it, they will go.  
But because this one called for it, the resentment will not allow them.  
How are you able to lift your hands and say, Cara Baso, Cara Mande?  
How are you able to do it?  


  
 Samadhi's Gospel, chapter 23, from verse 27.  
He says, what do you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye are like unto quieted supplicers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's booms, and of all uncleanness.  
Next verse.  
 Even so he also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but we think you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.  


  
Does that say anything about you?  
That you appear righteous before men?  
But inside, full of dead men's bones.  


  
 hypocrisy and iniquity.  


  
You think about it in your life.  
What's your driving force?  
Why do you do the things you do?  


  
 You have some of this motivated by guilt and memories of the past.  
They are fighting, fighting, fighting to overcome memories of the past.  
Somebody hurt them.  
Oh, they did something wrong.  
They bonded to their past.  
They have never left their past.  


  
 And they're working so hard.  
Maybe if they can please God a little more, their past will be somehow forgotten.  


  
Bondage.  
Bondage.  
These are children of bondage.  
And bondage to a sense of guilt and memories of the past.  
 Some people have nightmares because of something that happened to them.  
The pastor said he was counseling somebody and why the person was talking.  
 He just remembered himself because pictures of what happened to him just came.  
Why that person was talking and he said, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  
Hold on, hold on.  
He said, I was sweating, I was sweating.  
I was sweating, I said, hold on, hold on.  
He had to go away to first of all gather himself together because of what happened to him many years ago.  
He wept, wept, wept.  
And also Jesus gave me strength.  
Jesus gave me strength.  
So he can come back and help to cancel.  
 Why are you in bondage to your past?  


  
There's that.  
Number four.  
Oh, this one is so terrible.  
Desire, so much driven by the desire for approval.  


  
 And sometimes they won't approve out from pathologically unpleasable people.  


  
There are people who cannot be pleased.  
There are parents that cannot be pleased.  
There are friends that cannot be pleased.  
There are spouses that cannot be pleased.  
You cannot please them, no matter what you do.  


  
 They have this very morbid desire to demand more of you.  
And until you so-called pleas then, there are bosses you cannot please.  


  
It's just that way.  
It's a sickness, don't you understand?  
That they have.  
And the way you get enslaved to such people  
 You're in trouble because you carry this burden of pleasing the unpleasable.  


  
And because of that, you can do much with God.  
You can't.  
St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 5, verse 44.  


  
 is that how can you believe which received honor?  


  
One of another and signaled the honor that coming from God only.  
And one of the synonyms translated honor is approval.  
How can you believe which received approval one of another?  
 not seeking the approval that comes from God.  


  
This is if you're always carrying the burden of pleasing somebody, you always be a slave to the last person you talk to.  
Somehow they control your life.  
 And that's your driving force.  


  
That's what Paul the Apostle said, follow me, as I also am a follower of Jesus.  
As I follow the Master, you follow me, as I follow the Master.  
So that all sports are pleasing the Master.  
Right?  
 That's the way it should be.  


  
Number five.  
Number five of these negative driving forces, worldliness.  
 Some people are driven by worldliness.  
They are motivation, worldliness, worldliness.  
It's carnality.  
Friendship with the world, the Bible says it's enmity with God.  
Friendship with the world.  
 being carried away by the spirit of the world.  
Oh, oh, oh!  


  
You should hear some Christians talking.  
They have discussions, not in spiritual.  


  
When they start talking about their things,  
 They can get in the fight.  
Because that one is for Ashnell, and this one is for Manchester United.  
They're going to argue until they're almost about to fight.  
They have to remember that they are Christians.  
Worldliness.  
You become so passionate after that team.  
 that you forget who you are.  


  
Worldliness.  


  
So sometimes you find that even the pastor  
 has a role model that is not a Christian.  
That is his role model.  


  
Canality, worldliness, worldliness, what you have asked of.  
 Yeah, I passed on.  
Very pastoral wordliness.  
First John chapter 2 from verse 15, one of the very first verses that were pressed into my mind, my young impressionable mind when I was eight years old.  
Listen to it.  
He says, love not the world.  
 Neither the things that are in the world.  
If any man loved the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  
Period.  
This is God's declaration.  
If you love the world, he says the love of the Father is not in you.  
Doesn't matter how many times you confess it.  
He has told you, love not the world.  
Neither the things that are in the world.  
 I remember something several years ago, where we used to be in a much smaller building somewhere down the corner.  
So as a lady, that came to church for our first time.  
And she wanted to see me after the service.  
And she came with her whole family.  
 Indian and she came with her sons, their wives, the whole family, the whole clan came.  
And she was the mother of the clan.  
So since she said she wanted to see me, everybody had to wait.  
It's a first time.  
So I came out and greeted her.  
Oh, she said she'd like to talk to me.  
 So I went into my office and sat down.  
And she said, it's my first time to your church.  
I really enjoyed the service, but I was troubled throughout.  
I said, you were troubled throughout.  
What was the problem?  
She said, on the stage, you had, believe us, love worlds.  
And God said, love not the world.  
 You are asking us to love the world.  
She said, I was troubled.  
And I said, I will have to see you to discuss it.  
But while listening to her, I noted that the English was somehow sometimes broken, not too good, but very educated.  
 just not very fluent in English.  
So I said, you know, this is English language.  
So I'm going to explain the English to you.  
He said, OK, go on, go on.  
So I explained to her, oh, she hugged me.  
She said, thank you.  
That freed her.  
Can you imagine?  
She probably taken the whole clan out of the church.  


  
But she stayed.  
 Hallelujah.  
Okay.  
So, well, the Bible tells us, go back to that scripture.  
He said, love not the word.  
Neither the things that are in the words.  
If any man, if any man love the word, the love of the Father is not, is not in him.  
Listen, we don't know what is right or what is wrong until the Word of God tells us.  
What God tells us is final.  
 We cannot argue with the word.  
If the word God says, if any man loved the word, the love of the Father is not in him.  
No, you think, oh, then the Bible says, for God so loved the word, that he gave his only begotten son.  
So kept me loved the word, like the Father loved the word.  
He loved the word of men.  
The people, he loved the people.  
Jesus died to save the people.  
 Are you hearing me?  
Not the world and its systems and the things that are there in.  
Let's read further.  
Next verse.  
Next verse.  
For all that is in the world.  
The lost of the flesh.  
The lost of the flesh.  
Did you see that?  
The lost of the flesh.  
And the lost of the eyes.  
 He says, this is all that you have in the world.  
The lost of the flesh.  
Feed my flesh more.  
Entertain me.  
You love to be entertained.  
More, feed my flesh.  
The lost of the flesh.  
The lost of the ice.  
What you want to see?  
And our world is, I mean, it's full of things to see.  
See, see, see.  
 Some can't even go to where they're going, they're seeing, they're looking like this.  
And they're running into other people, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  
Reality show, every hour.  
Oh, I love reality shows.  
You carry your dinner, come straight to the sitting room, reality show is on, it's on, it's on, it's on.  
I just want to see how, it's reality, this is not acting, it's reality.  
 Wordliness.  
Wordliness.  
Then you finish from the reality issue, after watching, watching, watching, ugh.  
Santara bakas, you're not going anywhere.  
Your tongues are not going anywhere.  


  
 No, why do you go through things?  
Which after you finish your spirituality to the pit?  
Why?  
For all that is in the world, the loss of the flesh, the loss of the eyes and the pride of life.  
Kai, the pride of life, the pride of life.  
What are those things you are proud of?  


  
 Never forget the story.  
A gentleman who was said to be so upset.  
He said, I don't understand these people who are always so proud of their family tree, their family tree, their family tree.  
When all the tree ever produce a bunch of knots.  


  
How true?  
 Is it family tree?  
So I'm proud of that.  
The pride of life.  
What are you proud of?  
What is the thing?  
What is the thing that really gets you thinking everybody else is just not good enough?  
The pride of life.  
Or is it about the car you drive now that you want all your friends to see since you bought it now, your neighbors can't rest?  
See how the Lord is blessing me.  


  
 Isn't that the pride of life?  


  
What is it?  
What is it?  
The pride of life.  
For all that is in the world.  
 The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.  
It is not of the Father.  
It is the speech of the world.  
The world passes away and the lust they're off.  


  
Alleluia.  
 Go back to verse, let's read it from verse 15.  
Love not the word, neither the things that are in the world.  
If any man loved the word, the love of the Father is not in him.  
For all that is in the world, the loss of the flesh and the loss of the eyes and the pride of life is none of the Father but is of the words.  
He says, all that is of the words.  
All that is of the words.  
I didn't say,  
 Do not appreciate what people do.  
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  
A thousand times no.  
But don't get carried away and sucked in to who they are and what they do until you don't know the purpose for your life.  
Who are you here?  
What's the purpose for your life?  


  
 When you have to start thinking differently, you know, become conscious that you have a higher purpose.  
I live for a higher purpose.  


  
I live for a higher purpose.  
Next verse.  
 And the world passes away and the loss they're off.  
But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.  
You want to have stability in your life?  
This is it.  
The one that does the will of the Father abides forever.  
He's unshakable.  
No matter what happens, calm rain or shine, he's unshakable.  
I'm unshakable.  
Absolutely unshakable.  
 Doesn't matter where I go.  
Doesn't matter where I am.  
Makes no difference to me.  
The world is mine.  
Oh, I'll come to that.  
Hallelujah.  
So what life do you want to live?  
How do you want to live it?  
How do you want to live it?  


  
 power and pursuit of purpose, the Lord Jesus.  
Think about it.  
In Genesis chapter 28, Genesis chapter 28, verse from verse 12,  


  
 Here's talking about Jacob.  
Ready for me, want to go.  


  
 And he dreamed, Jacob dreamed, and behold, a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven.  
And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.  
Next verse.  
And behold, a lodge to the above it, and said, I am the Lord God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of Isaac, the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it unto thy seed.  
 God said it to him.  
Oh, boy.  
I like this.  
Go on next verse, and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth's.  
 He's talking to a man.  
Thy seed shall be at the door of the earth, and thou shall spread abroad, to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south, and in thee, and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."  
Somebody say hallelujah.  
God's talking to him.  
Then he goes next verse.  
And behold, Santokarabasetiki.  
 And behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places we that thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land, for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of."  
I'll never forget one day I was praying, and praying the Spirit.  
 Just praying.  
God said to me, and I will not leave you until I've done all that I've spoke to you of.  
I said, Lord Jesus, that's what you said to Jacob.  
That I will not leave you until I've done all that I've spoken to you of.  
Everything.  
Oh, wow.  
The power of preppers.  
What am I talking about?  
Look at this man.  
 God chose him the purpose for his life.  
He is the bearer of the Abrahamic connects.  
Remember, his father had two sons, Isaac had two sons, Jacob and Esau.  
Esau was profane.  
He had little regards for spiritual things.  
And he would rather go for what he would eat.  
 Do you hear those people who used to make that carnal statement?  
You talk to them about something, they say, is that what we would eat?  
So carnal, they always brought up the Isor in them, who sold his birthright for food, plates, irrational food.  
 Is that what we'll eat?  
Someone is discussing something important with you.  
You say, hold on.  
Can I explain something from the Bible?  
Is that what we'll eat?  
Is what you will eat?  
What you eat?  
What Jesus said about what you eat?  
He said, don't think about it.  
That's what Jesus said.  
Don't think about it.  
He said, your father feeds the birds on the air.  
Don't think about what you're going to eat.  
 to seek He first, the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things that the Gentiles seek after shall be added unto you.  
All these things that they seek after.  
Hey, all these things.  
Listen, I'm not interested in anything in the world.  
What is it?  
Nothing gets my attention.  
There's nothing.  
There's nothing I like.  
 I mean, all over the world, people ask, what would you like?  
What would you like?  
People want to get me anything.  
What do I like?  
I don't like anything.  
No, what is in this world?  
There's nothing I can't get.  
Not to begin with.  
There's nothing I can't get.  
And I'm not interested in any of them.  
Anything I'm not having right now is because I don't want it.  
No, that's a fact.  
 Complete fact.  
I'm not interested.  
What is that?  
What is it?  
What is it?  
The only things I would like is if I can use them for my Bible.  
If I can use them for my Bible, for studying the Word of God, okay, nothing interests me.  
Houses and lands.  
 I own everything.  
I own them.  
So what is it?  
Everywhere, every nation, make no mistakes about it.  
You'll be amazed how many lands I have in China.  
I'm serious.  
All of other world.  
All of other world.  
There's nothing I don't have.  
 See what I mean?  
Remember, if you are going after the things of the world, the love of the Father is not in you.  
What is it you want?  
What are you seeking after?  
Does all these things do the Gentiles seek after?  
 says, your father knows that you have rid of them.  
He says, I tell you, seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added.  
He didn't say, after seeking this kingdom of God, then go and seek other things.  
No, he didn't say put kingdom of God first and then seek the other second.  
He said, only seek the kingdom of God.  
All these other ones will be added.  
They will be added to you.  


  
 Do you understand?  
So when you see people in pursuit of things of this world, and they're like, won't you also get in the rat race?  
You say, I'm not a rat.  


  
No, they're going for it.  
You say no.  
I have all this.  
Hallelujah.  
 You still there?  
Oh, glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Is it I'll not leave you until I have done that.  
But I have said concerning you.  
So look at that.  
He said, I am with you.  
Wherever you go.  
 Look at that, look at that.  
So God is saying to the man, I've told you about your life.  
I've told you that you're carrying this vision, this covenant that I made with Abraham.  
You're carrying it.  
So no matter where you go, I'm with you.  
I'm with you.  
So the man knows nobody on this earth can touch me.  
 He knows the power of purpose.  
What's the purpose for your life until that purpose is for fear?  
Nothing touches you.  
But if you don't know your purpose,  
 Purpose is not about what you chose for yourself.  
You know, there are a lot of people who are, I mean, especially young people, when you're through school, one of the first things you want to find out is about your life.  
And so, when the first things that come to you will be those self-help books on how to become successful, how to point one, they say, dream, point two, what do you like, point three, what excites you, point four,  
 And then you start thinking all these things and you think, hey, you found something that nobody else knows.  


  
So you are ready.  
You believe you are ready for life.  
They just got you.  
They just sold you a book.  
That's it, they just sold you a book.  
 Eve, those books could make you truly successful.  
There'll be no poor people in this world, except in very few places where they don't like to read.  


  
But no, that's not where all the made success comes from.  
 Real success doesn't depend on circumstances.  
Real success doesn't depend on the government of the day.  
Real success doesn't depend on the type of business or the thing that's working now.  
They say, oh, this is what's moving now.  
This is what's selling now.  
No, real success doesn't have any of those things.  
It flies in the wings of the spirit.  
It's beyond this world.  
Ever winning.  
 Hey, go and look at the Bible, think about it.  
All now what circumstances was just as successful.  
When things are going difficult for the world, our history has shown our history, read to the Bible, discover our history, find out about us from Genesis to Revelation.  


  
 When things get difficult for the world, we always thrive.  
That's what has always happened to God's people.  
Always.  
The devastation in the world never makes us victims.  
We never become victims.  
 Situations may get our attention because sometimes, you know, people doing all the things they shouldn't be doing, then the devil comes in and tries to rob them of what belongs to them.  
And that's when they sometimes wake up and say, oh, what have I been doing in my life?  
Maybe I should have been praying, maybe I should have done this, maybe I should, well, now, anyway, you've woken up.  
If a lion is sleeping, have you ever seen a sleeping lion?  
Okay, if a lion is sleeping, does he stop it from being a lion?  
 He's no longer in line because he's sleeping.  
You will know when he wakes up.  
Yeah.  
You know when he wakes up.  
So just because you weren't doing what you were supposed to be doing, didn't mean that your nature changed.  
You're still the super you.  
That God made you to be.  
 Alleluia.  
Even when Samson had his eyes dodged out.  
And they bound him.  
He was still Samson.  
He was still Samson.  
They bound him and tied him.  
He even asked for assistance.  
He said, please, can you just take me to the middle where they can see me more and laugh at me if they like you?  
So they said, oh, we'll take you to the very middle pillar.  
So they took him there and stretched him between them.  
 What his hair had grown.  
And they didn't know the significance of that.  
He said, oh God, remember me.  


  
Oh, hallelujah.  
Remember me.  
 Isn't our father so wonderful, so kind, so loving?  
What a prayer.  


  
And when he prayed that prayer, the Bible says he shook himself, but he prayed that prayer and the spirit of God came mightily upon something.  
And he pulled the pillars together and brought the building down on the Philistates and killed more people at his debts.  
 that in his lifetime.  
Because even though he was blind, he was still Samson.  
Hallelujah.  
He was Samson.  
Now, one more area, because we'll go on tomorrow, right?  
We'll get deeper and deeper into it.  
 Joshua chapter 1, the power of purpose.  
When your purpose is clean life, you're a different man, you're a different woman, a man of purpose, a woman of purpose,  
 Joshua chapter one, we're gonna read from verse number one.  
Now, after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came the past that the Lord speak unto Joshua, the son of none, Moses ministers say in.  
Moses, my servant, is dead.  
Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all these people onto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.  
 Every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.  
From the wilderness and this leopard uneven unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the heat hides and onto the great sea, two of the going down of the sun shall be your coast.  
 There shall, boy, look at that.  
There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life.  
As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.  
I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.  
Be strong and of a good courage, for purpose.  
 For all to these people shall now divide from the inheritance, the land which I serve unto their fathers to give them.  
Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee, to nod from it to the right hand, or to the left, that thou mayest prosper with us soever thou goest."  
This book of the law  
 shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou miss observed to do according to all as written therein, for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success."  
 have not recommended thee, be strong and of a good courage, be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee, with us, soever thou goest.  
Somebody say hallelujah.  
Now with this, what happens with Joshua?  
He knows I cannot be defeated.  
He knows.  
 He knows way back in 1980.  
That's what God said to me very clearly.  
These words.  


  
That's 1980 from 1980 to now is how many years?  
Really, really.  
Anything that will work for 38 years will always work.  
The cross-casual valley, Ainsanera,  
 But you see, purpose defines your life.  
It defines your life.  
What God said, this is what I want you to do.  
He says, for unto these people, shall that fight for inheritance, the land which I sought to your fathers to give you.  
You are going to do it, he says.  
And he says, I'm with you.  
No man shall be able to stand against you all your life as I was with Moses.  
 So I'll be with you.  
Then he says, I will not feel you.  
Oh, I remember those things brought tears out of my eyes.  
The young guy, just my teenage years.  
I don't cry like this.  
Tears out of my eyes.  
Because God talked to me.  
I'd heard the God talk to people.  
And now God talked to me.  
Oh God.  
Then I said, can I ask you one thing, Lord?  
I thought about my friends.  
 I said, please help me.  
No, just the mind of a young youngster.  
I said, Lord, help me when I get to my friends.  
I didn't want them to laugh at me so much I run back.  
I said, please help me when I get to my friends.  
Of course, now you can tell he sure did.  
And then years ago, hallelujah.  
When your purpose is clear, your way is clear.  
 You're always glad.  
You're unmoved.  
You're always glad.  


  
I mean, we're talking about the nations of the world and all the things we're doing around the world.  
Because God said, He said to me, I've given you the nations of the world.  
That's what He said.  
I didn't tell Him to say it, I didn't ask Him.  
I said, I've given you the nations of the world.  
 Oh Lord, the nations of the world, I didn't even know how big they were.  
So that word is what's taken us to the nations of the world.  
That's the word that has brought people from all nations to us.  
Because then I was telling my friends, I was telling them, I said, people are going to come from all over the world.  
I said, they're going to come from all over the world.  
That's what God said.  
 They didn't know how big the world was.  
I didn't know how it was.  
But we're talking about it.  
I didn't even have a passport.  
I have not seen one.  
They didn't know what it looked like.  
You understand?  
And then God's saying all these things.  
Then I said, they're going to come from all over the world.  
I told someone, I'm going to be ministering to ministers from all around the world.  
 really?  
How is that going to happen?  
Well, as a God said so, God said so.  
That's what he said.  
But there is no human way of making it happen, no human way of making it happen.  


  
 When I told him first edition of Rhapsody Realities, I said, this book God said, it'll go throughout the earth, the whole world.  
I said, God said so, not because I wanted it.  
I want you to understand something, because God has his purpose clear, he has his plans, he has his visions, he has the things he wants us to accomplish.  
Each one of us is placed in a second position for God's purpose and timing.  
 So what he said to me, no, because I wanted it.  
I can't help it.  
Do you get it?  
I can't help it.  
So what I'm doing, it's not, I'm not doing it voluntarily.  
Like, you know, I want to do it.  
I can't help it.  
It has to happen.  
 Like Paul said, necessity is laid upon me.  
Oh, first Corinthians, maybe I should take you there.  
 First verse chapter nine, from verse 16.  
Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, this is an IV.  
I cannot boast for I am compared to preach.  
Word to me if I do not preach the gospel.  
If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward.  
If not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me.  
Did you see that?  
So it says, what then is my reward?  
It's because it says, if I were to do it voluntarily,  
 then I have a reward for it.  
But he says, I'm not doing it voluntarily.  
He says, it's necessity.  
I'm compared to.  
So he says, what then is my reward?  
Just this, that in preaching the gospel, I may offer it free of charge.  
See that?  
 free of charge and so not make use of my rights in preaching it.  
Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to everyone to win as many as possible.  
Oh, glory to Jesus.  
Are you still there?  
Yeah.  
Can't help it.  
It's the compulsion in my spirit that's based on the calling.  
 And I can't make it happen.  
It is the working of the Spirit, mightily in me.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Yeah.  
Working mightily in me.  
And I tell people, one of my experiences in the healing school, I've never won the end at the healing school and hoped or wished that  
 the power of the Spirit would be manifested, maybe experiencing something like, oh, the anointing of God who wasn't present, oh, today, or strong.  
It's never happened to me.  
Why?  
Because I didn't start it out of a good idea.  
 The Lord instructed me to do it.  
And so every time, my experience has been every time.  
The moment I enter, I feel the sarge, corrains of electricity.  
Inside and every time, never feel once.  
Never feel once.  
 Not once, not even once.  
Why?  
Because it is not of him that will it, of him that run it, but of God that show it mercy.  
It's not my idea.  
Praise God.  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
The power of peppers, peppers.  
 Purpose, I'm set on a course that I must follow.  
Now you understand why I said that?  
I'm set on a course that I must follow.  
I know I'm on this course, but I'm set on this course.  


  
And I know where it's leading.  
I know where it's going.  


  
 because Jesus loved me so much.  
He liked me to give me the responsibility that he gave me.  
Did you ever read David?  
David said, among my father's children, he said, the Lord liked me to make me king.  
I feel the same spirit with him and think like that.  
The Lord liked me.  
 to make me what do you mean?  
But you see, I said all those things, not because of past regrets, but because of you.  
Because I want you to realize that where you are is not your choice.  
Are you hearing me?  
It's not your choice.  
Otherwise you're in the flesh.  
The Bible says, day that I'm in the flesh cannot please God.  
Then he says, but he are not in the flesh.  
He are in the spirits.  
 If so be the Spirit of God dwells in you.  


  
God chose you.  
And until you yield yourself to that purpose and say, I know the purpose.  
I know that God has chosen me.  
And yield yourself.  
Don't battle with God.  
Don't struggle with him.  
When you're struggling with God, you can know by the things that offend you.  
 I tell people, you can't offend me.  
How could I?  
It's not possible.  
Why?  
Why can't you offend me?  
Because I'm not living for myself, so I don't care.  
Can you see the trouble?  
That's it.  
So when someone thinks it's offending me, my mind is not on what it's doing.  
I don't care.  
Because I'm only standing by grace.  
 You see, I'm only standing here by grace, simple grace.  
It is not of him that will it or of him that run it.  
It's not my qualification.  
If it was true qualification, I would not be here.  
So since I'm standing by grace, how could you offend me?  
I learned that lesson long ago, years ago, and my life is to live for him.  
 not for myself.  
It's about what He wants, not what I want.  
Do you love the Lord with all your heart?  
Genuinely?  
How do you show it?  
 by loving your brothers and sisters, right?  
Because you don't see God, right?  
But you see your brothers and sisters.  
If you can show the love of God, how much you love God through those that you can see people and demonstrate that love, then you truly love God.  
But if you have one person that you dislike, one person that you're bitter against, one person that you resent, you don't love God.  
 Because until you qualify with that man or woman, you will make no progress with him.  
That will always be a stumbling block.  
Until you qualify with that person, it will be a temptation unto you, a snare unto you.  
One person become a problem in your life.  
Because as long as that person is before your mind, that you resent, dislike,  
 I don't dislike him, I just don't want to have anything to do with him.  
Ah, you are not ready.  
Until you love him and so love him that you can so pray for him and port.  
Sometimes, trials and temptations come your way, but they are good because the Church of Jesus must be shaken like this.  
So that everything that can be shaken can be shaken up.  
And those that cannot be shaken will remain.  
 then he would build from there a strong, virile church, uncheckable, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, hallelujah.  
If you're in a war, who would you like to be on your side?  


  
The guy that has ticked his life  
 You know, not the soldier that's afraid to die.  
Not the one that has an option.  
The Bible tells us how some of Jesus' disciples, after Jesus preached a certain message, they were offended.  
And the Bible says they walk no more with him.  
Then Jesus turned to his disciples.  
He said, will you also go away?  


  
 He experienced it.  
He experienced it.  
 He had a multitude.  
He experienced it.  
They worked no more with him.  
Think about those partners that turned away.  
They have been contributing because a mass of people followed Jesus and many of them gave up their substance all the time.  
As people were fed, they were with Jesus day in and day out.  
Now this guy said, he would give us his flesh to eat.  
What does he think we are?  
We are giving him our money here.  
He's telling us he'd give us his flesh to eat.  
To hell with you.  
They turned away and walked away from Jesus.  
 The Master said, what about you?  
Would you also go away?  
Peter spoke up quickly.  
The Master, to whom shall we go?  
He said, we have left all and followed you.  


  
In your life, there's got to be some permanence.  
Some people don't understand that, so they got options.  
 There's no permanence in their lives.  
There's no stability in their lives.  
There are mental and spiritual hobos.  
See, they can't stay.  
They can't stay.  
No, I'm offended.  
Oh, no.  
How can he say that?  
Did he say that?  
That, they didn't even come to church.  
They heard.  
Somebody told them what Pastor said.  
You mean he said that?  
He said that.  
 He's already shaking his... I can't imagine saying that.  
He says to his wife, wife, are we still going to that church?  
Did you hear what they said?  
He didn't say it about them.  
He just said it.  
They have not understood what he said.  
What is he taking away?  
He's taking away his partnership.  
 Do you understand?  
What is saying, I want to punish the pastor.  
So I withdraw my resources.  


  
The power and pursuit of purpose.  


  
 You know, everything has a sound.  
Sound waves are the essence of life, the heartbeat of creation.  
The very beginning of all, everything listens to sound, and everything has a sound.  
There's the sound of nature, the rustling of leaves, the rushing waves of the ocean, and there's the sound of animals, the buzzing of bees,  
 The flapping of a hummingbird.  
The galloping of a horse.  
And there's the sound of humanity.  
The heartfelt laughter of a loved one.  
The traffic noise in a metropolis.  
The blasting club beat all through the night.  
And there's the sound of the creator.  
The only sound with the ability to laugh, cheer and transform you.  
She was deaf from your tears.  
She can hear that.  
 You can hear.  
Yes.  
You can hear.  
As you listen to his sound, his word makes you a creator.  
So he's introduced sound codes.  
So when we speak, we're using codes.
