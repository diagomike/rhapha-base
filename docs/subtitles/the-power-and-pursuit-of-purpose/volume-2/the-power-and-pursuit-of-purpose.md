title: The Power and Pursuit of Purpose ï¿½ The Power of Prayer
---
 You are watching the Power and Pursuit of Purpose series on Pastor Chris Teaching.  
As an individual, you are born for a purpose.  
And the best way to live it is to discover from the Word of God the purpose of God for your life.  
Discover in this enlightening message by Pastor Chris.  


  
Amen, praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
 Can you turn to your Bible and to your notes?  
You remember what we talked about so far?  
The power and pursuit of what?  
Purpose.  
In the pursuit of purpose,  
 We discussed number one, the power of resources, number two, the power of faith, number three, the power of love, number four, and number five,  


  
 And then number six, the power of purity.  
In number seven.  
All right, so we're gonna get into that.  
The power of prayer.  
That's the seventh one.  
I want us to begin with James chapter five from verse 16.  
 James chapter 5 from verse 16.  
Confess your thoughts one to another and pray one for another that he may be healed.  
The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availed much.  
 Can we read it from the amplified version?  
Confess to one another therefore your force, your slips, your footsteps, your fences, your sins, and pray also for one another that you may be healed and restored to a spiritual tone of mind and heart.  
The earnest,  
 heartfelt, continued prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available, dynamic in his working.  
It says the anest prayer, the anest prayer of a righteous man.  
Anest here he says, heartfelt, continued prayer.  
 In other words, not just talking go, but pressing in.  
Heart felt, continued, sustained.  
And his prayer for righteousness makes tremendous power available, dynamic in its working.  


  
 prayer, every Christian must learn.  
Not only about prayer, but to pray.  
Every Christian.  
Jesus trained his disciples to pray.  
He didn't only teach them to pray.  
He trained them to pray.  
 The many things that the apostles of Jesus did, we can tell that those things came from the examples that the Lord gave to them.  
Okay, you're still there?  
Saint Luke's Gospel.  
Chapter 6, from verse 12.  
 And it came the past in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God.  
Praise God.  
The Holy Ghost strategy is most important.  
Amen?  
The Holy Spirit strategy.  
Strategy.  
 One of his strategies is prayer.  
And every Christian was learned, effective praying, effective.  
To be effective in praying, you must know the rules of prayer and the different kinds of prayer because our prayer is not the same.  
So you must know the different kinds of prayer, the rules of prayer.  
For example, simple rule.  
 we pray in the name of Jesus, not through the name of Jesus, huge difference between them, huge difference.  
You hear people, you know, especially those who are not learning the things of God, they pray and they say, through Jesus Christ our Lord, and everybody say, oh man, that's not a prayer.  
That's not a New Testament prayer.  
You don't pray through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
That's making him a medium.  
He's not a medium for the Christian.  
 No, you pray in his name, in his name means that you are speaking in his stead.  
That means it's as though Jesus himself was making that request.  


  
So he gave us the legal authority to use his name in prayer.  
 to speak in his stead, in his name.  
That means Jesus is authorizing whatever it is that we are saying in his name.  
You don't pray through Jesus.  
You pray in his name.  
And several other rooms of prayer.  
And you can get this from our books, praying the right way.  
That's one book.  


  
 What do you call it?  
How to pray effectively.  
That's another one.  
I think there are three or four of them on prayer.  
Get those books, study more about prayer.  
Every Christian was learned to pray effectively, effectively.  
But let's look at the Master and see what he did.  
It's a Luke's Gospel.  
Chapter 6 again, we were in verse 12.  
 And again, the person those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God.  
He continued all night in prayer to God.  
And when it was day, he called on to him, his disciples, and of them, he called on to him, his disciples, for he had many, in fact, ones of Bible churches, he had a multitude of disciples.  
And of them, he chose 12, whom also he named apostles.  
 Right?  
Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew, his brother, James and John, Philip, and battle alone.  
Matthew and Thomas, James, the son of Alferes, and Simon, called Zilodz.  
And Judas, the brother of James, and Judas, his character, which also was the traitor.  
 And he came down with them and stood in the plain, cutting of his disciples and a great margin of people out of order, the Andrew Ruzleman, from the Zecos of Tansahedon, which came to hear him and be healed of their diseases.  
And they that were vexed with unclean spirits, and they were healed.  
And the whole monitor sought to touch him, for they went virtue out of him and heal them all.  
Wow.  
Three things to observe were respect to his brain all night.  
 Number one, after prayer, he chose his disciples.  
In other words, he was preparing for this special assignment.  
He was going to choose his disciples.  
He needed to pray like this.  
Because we don't find him praying any other time or night.  
So we have to find out why that Jesus have to pray all night on this occasion.  
What followed when he did?  
 First thing we find, he makes a choice of his apostles.  
He had called them.  
They were all going with him.  
Many are called.  
Few are chosen.  
Now he chooses these 12th from his host of the cybers.  
So when you're going to be choosing leaders, have you considered serious praying?  
Or do you just look around and pick those you think they look like they can lead?  
 Jesus prayed all night, and the effect was he chose people who could actually carry on the ministry after him except the son of Perdition that his scriptures might be fulfilled.  
Secondly, you find an extraordinary healing service that he knew was coming the next day.  
The martyrgists came to hear him.  
 and to be healed.  
So he had this meeting in front of him.  
He knew what he was going to be doing.  
And instead of having godless chatter around and moving from place to place, he had to consecrate himself in prayer, in prayer.  
He kept this kind of meeting that is going to be happening next day.  
They're coming from everywhere.  
 We saw the least, the cities from where they came.  
To hear Him and to be healed of their diseases.  
Jesus had to be prepared.  
Jesus had to be ready.  
And we saw the results.  
But not only were they healed, we saw a thought saying that we observed a result of prayer.  
The Bible says, there went virtue out of Him.  
 But this is different from when in the same Saint Luke's Gospel chapter 5, the Bible says, the power, the virtue of the Lord was present to heal.  
He was in the atmosphere.  
The power was in the atmosphere.  
I'll never forget, years ago, we were going to Port Hackett for a crusade.  
We had the large stadium there.  
 But as the spirit of that was ministering to me, I could see the stadium was just not going to be it.  
They had a large expanse of land that could take maybe four or five of the stadium, large.  


  
 I said, we're going to have the stage, the platform outside the stadium.  
The stadium was going to be used as an overflow.  
So the stadium was actually, in fact, that night it was estimated we had 2.5 million people.  
The stadium was a small, small,  
 overflow, and every way that human beings could stand, you had people, to the roads all the way, everywhere, as far as your eyes could see.  
All night long, and the Spirit God was talking to me, he says, he says, the power, he says, the power I've given you works in the air, use the air.  
 He says, use the air.  
It's amazing when the Holy Spirit is training you in telling you things.  
Later he would explain to me how to use the air and what it meant.  
That was wonderful.  
What I did, I did.  
And oh God, miracles and miracles and miracles that night.  
 Power was in the power.  
Jesus had this and says, the power of the Lord was present to heal.  
Now, here's another one in chapter six that we just read, is this virtue went out of him, virtue went out of him and healed them all.  
Virtue went out of him and healed them all.  
So these three things from here, Jesus prayed all night.  
Jesus was a pre-imperson.  
 Think about this.  
What dealing with one who was known to be the celebrity.  
He himself therefore believed it.  
And he prayed.  
Give attention to prayer.  
Why would he do it?  
And if he thought it was important.  
Why wouldn't we?  
 Still to come, there are rules in prayer.  
And as a Christian, you must be effective and know the rules of prayer.  
In this next segment, Pastor Chris.  
Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
Let me show you some more things from the Bible.  
I will go to Hebrews chapter 5, from verse 5.  
 First we read it from the King James, and then our Lycos read it from the amplified translation.  
He says, so also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art my son, today have I begotten thee.  
As he said also in another Psalm, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.  
 Who in the days of his flesh?  
Now, the way the King James carries on, you would think it's Melchizedek.  
He's talking about in the days of his flesh.  
No, talking about Jesus, okay?  
Jesus Christ.  
Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered our prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears?  
 I don't know how many of you have ever got a hold of the message I preached years ago titled Try Tears.  
Because I tell people, you've done this and say, I've used all the faith, I could.  
Then I say, Try Tears.  
Try Tears.  
Not Crocodile Tears.  
As it Try Tears.  
 Look at that.  
How in the days of his flesh when he had offered a prayer and supplications with strong crying and tears onto him that was able to save him from death and was hurt in that he feared.  
Wow.  
 You know what he's talking about here?  
Let's go on to verse nine and then I'll pick up from the other side.  
Though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.  
I mentioned that yesterday, he learned obedience by the things that he suffered.  
And being made perfect, glory to God, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him, blessed be God, hallelujah.  
 All right, now let's read from the amplified version and get a clear idea.  
So to Christ the Messiah did not exhort himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed and exalted by him who said to him, you are my son, today I have forgotten you.  
 As he says also in another place, you are a priest appointed forever after the order with the rank of Melchizedek.  
In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up definite special petitions.  
 for that which he not only wanted, but needed, and supplications with strong crying and tears to him, who was always able to save him out from death, and he was heard because of his reverence toward God, his godly fear, his piety, in that he shrunk from the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the, did you look at that last line, go back there?  
In that he shrunk from the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the Father.  
 That's what he didn't want.  
And he takes us, you see, that last portion there takes us to the experience in Gethsemane.  
He said, Luke's Gospel, chapter 22, let's read from verse 39.  
And he came out and went as he was walked to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him.  
And when he was at the place, he said unto them, pray that he had a knot into temptation.  
 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneels down and prayed.  
Did you notice?  
See, sometimes the Bible tells us that Jesus was standing somewhere and then he looked up and prayed.  
Sometimes the Bible tells us he lifted his hands and prayed.  
Now we find he kneels down and prayed.  
So when we talk about, because sometimes I teach positions of prayer,  
 Very important.  
Sometimes you can stand and pray.  
Sometimes you can kneel and pray.  
Sometimes you can leave your hands and pray.  
Right?  
And sometimes you could be prostrate on the floor and pray.  
We've got all of this in the Bible.  
There are actual positions of prayer.  
And they're all significant.  
Not one of them is without significance, mind you.  
But today is not the day to deal with that.  
He was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, kneeled down and prayed.  
 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me.  
Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.  
And they appeared, an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.  
Oh God, Landor Agaba Chaturaga.  
They appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.  
Doesn't that tell us about the ministry of the Holy Spirit?  
 It's amazing.  
The Holy Spirit does so many things at the same time.  
He's inside you, and then He does things from outside you.  
Amazing, amazing.  
Stronton in Him.  
If He's stronton Jesus, He's stronton you.  
Look at the next verse.  
And being in an agony, He prayed more earnestly.  
The earnest prayer.  
 of a righteous man, a valid match."  
You remember that?  
And being an agony, he prayed more innocently, more innocently, had felt and continued, had felt and sustained, had felt.  
All of his emotions were into the prayer.  


  
 And his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.  
Think about it.  
Think about it.  
His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.  


  
Next verse.  
 And when he rose up from prayer and was calm to his disciples, he found him sleeping for sorrow.  
And turned on to them, why sleep ye, rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.  


  
The problem was not being tempted, the problem was falling into temptation.  
Jesus here was wrestling with this temptation to say, no, I'm not doing it anymore.  
 But he had to pray.  
Why?  
Because he had found himself in the place of humanity.  
Let me explain it.  
Here was a man who was himself God.  
And now he found himself as a human needing to pray.  
He knew he had to pray.  
What did he tell us?  
Men ought always to pray.  
 and not to faint.  
Men are not always to pray.  
Now that he found himself in the place of a man, he knew he had to pray.  
Jesus finds himself in this situation.  
In Philippians chapter 2, I want to read from verse 5,  


  
 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.  
 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.  
Being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death.  
Hallelujah.  
 My, my, my.  
Let me show you another thing.  
Hebrews chapter 12.  
We'll read from verse 3 to verse 4.  
Here's one portion of the Bible that makes many translators  


  
 I think it just, it worries them, let me make it that simple, worries them.  
But it's so simple, let the dream, for consider him, that endured such contradiction of sin as against himself, lest he be worried and faint in your minds.  
That's the place, it shakes translators, almost all versions have something  
 to say that's not really right.  
So they're all trying to reinterpret it.  
But what King James says here is the best way to put it.  
I'll tell you what it means.  
All right?  
But look at this.  
He says, consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself.  


  
 lest he be worried and faint in your minds.  
Him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself.  
He says, consider him a man who was judged as a sinner by sinners.  
He was under the condemnation of wicked men.  
 Can you imagine a man, the righteous Jesus, sitting on that judgment, being condemned by sinners, by these wicked men?  
It was a contradiction.  
He endured the contradiction of sinners against himself.  
Here he was in the position where there should be.  
 He should be the one judging them.  
They subjected him to their own judgment.  
They've been seen us and he endured it.  
Do you know what it is?  
To look at robbers, thieves holding you and calling you a thief and punishing you by their law.  
And you are quiet.  
It's a contradiction.  
He endured such contradiction of seen us against himself.  
Terrible.  
 He says, consider him who endured such contradiction of sin as against himself, lest he be worried and faint in your minds.  
He said, look, think about Jesus, who went through that.  
So now you shouldn't think that what you're going through is too much for you.  
Look at verse four.  
He said, look, you have not yet resisted.  
Onto blood, striving against sin.  
Again, he alludes to the garden of Gethsemane.  
 where he resisted onto blood.  
Until blood, the Bible says, sweat like great drops of blood came out of his body falling on the ground.  
Jesus Christ went through that.  
He said, you haven't done that yet.  
You haven't faced that yet.  
You have not yet resisted onto blood, striving against sin.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
All this he did in prayer.  
In prayer.  
 He knew what was coming.  
He knew what was coming.  
Sin, do you remember what God said to King?  
Sin light at the door.  
Here Jesus was.  
Sin!  
It's before him.  
Bye tomorrow.  
 something's going to happen.  
This is, I remember what John said.  
All this happened shortly after Jesus had been with his disciples.  
And he had broken bread with them.  
He turned to Judas.  
He said, what thou doest do quickly.  
 Jude has stormed out.  
Some thought Jesus meant he should go and distribute money to the poor.  
But no, he headed for the high priest.  
He had had a deal with them to sell Jesus to them for 30 pieces of silver.  
But John knew what was going on because he had asked Jesus, who's the one you're talking about?  
That's going to betray you.  
And Jesus told him who it was.  
And it was Judas.  
 And John writes that Judas, he says, and Judas left, as Judas walked away, John.  


  
In that verse, the most touching part, he says, and it was night.  
It was night.  
I've wondered  
 How did John feel at that moment?  
How did he feel?  
When he was writing about it, what was going through his mind?  
He seemed to remember, he seemed to remember what happened when he says that it was night.  
A night of confusion didn't know what to do.  
 A night of death, their future was gone.  
Everything that put everything was gone, everything was gone, their life was gone, everything was gone.  
It was night.  
It was night.  
Imagine just walking around, not knowing where your life is headed.  
That's night.  
That's night.  
No voice, no direction, nothing.  
 Jesus, whom you have been with for three years, miracle worker, you know, it's just about a few hours and he's gone.  
Praise God.  
Amazing.  
But Jesus took us to pray.  
Pray with all your emotion into it.  
 pray with all your person into it.  
There are different kinds of prayer.  
You've got to study that book, how to pray effectively.  
You need it.  
If you've read it before one, read it again.  
There are different kinds of prayer.  
There are things that require that we pray like this.  
 Those things, you say, what kind of things?  
Everything that doesn't depend on your personal decisions requires this type of prayer.  
Do you get it now?  
Those things that don't depend on your decisions.

 Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
In the concluding segment, pastor explained more about the pursuit of prayer and speaking with bonus.  
Watch and be blessed.  


  
 All right, so I'll take you to the next place.  
Look at something that gets me.  
We'll talk about the power of prayer, right?  
The power of prayer.  
The church should not lose it.  
See, the more we learn about faith, the less we think prayer is important.  
And then when we are taught about prayer, we leave faith behind.  
Then the things we shouldn't be praying for, now we are praying.  
 Nobody had faith like Jesus.  
Nobody prayed like Jesus.  
That means you have to have a balance.  
That's why understanding prayer, the roots of prayer, different kinds of prayer is important.  
Oh, if you would pray.  
The things that will happen if you would pray.  
My brothers and sisters, if you would pray, the changes you will see, even your own life, your own life,  
 You'd be amazed.  
You'd be amazed.  
Acts chapter four, verse study.  
Oh, they prayed in the book of Acts.  
Do you remember?  
After the miracle in chapter three, the government got angry with them.  
 In trouble came, you remember, okay.  
 We get into chapter four here, the apostles and the brethren got together to pray because persecution had started and they wanted miracles.  
Maybe we should read it from verse 29 into it.  
So in their prayers, and now Lord, behold their threatening, see we're being threatened.  
Behold their threatening and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word.  
Oh God.  
 Oh, hallelujah.  
Oh, by stretching forth thy hand to heal.  
Did you see that?  
And that signs and wonders may be done by the name of the Holy Child, Jesus.  
And when they had prayed, are you seeing this?  
And when they had prayed, the place was shaken.  
 where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they speak the word of God with boldness.  
The place was shicken.  
It didn't get destroyed, but the place was shicken, where they were assembled together.  
I'll never forget, we're in Camp Meeting, we're at the National Theatre.  
 We pray it in that place.  
They reported that the building shook.  
The building.  
The place shook, literally shook.  


  
 So that's what happened at chapter four of us, study one, let's read.  
And when they had prayed, the place was shaken, where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and we were all filled with the Holy Ghost that day in that place.  
And they speck the word of God with boldness.  
 Remember their requests, grant unto thy servants, that they may preach thy word with what boldness, by stretching for thine hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done at the name of thy whole child, Jesus, and then when they prayed, the place was shackled where they were gathered together, and they were all fair with the Holy Ghost, and speak the Word of God with boldness.  
Every member became bold.  
 they were failed with the Holy Ghost and pricked the word with boldness.  
Haven't you seen so many members in the church that say that, well, you know, I am so timid, I don't think I can talk to somebody about Jesus, I like to, but I can't because they're not filled with the Holy Ghost.  
When they are failed with the Holy Ghost, they pricked the word of God with boldness.  
I didn't say when they have received the Holy Ghost.  
These people had already received the Holy Ghost.  
These are people who received the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter two.  
 In chapter 4, they are failed again with the Holy Ghost whom they have already received.  
That's what the Bible says, be failed with the Spirit.  
Speak into yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.  
Sing in and make in what?  
Men are in your heart to the Lord.  
Be failed with the Spirit.  
Be not drunk with wine wearing this excess, but be failed with the Spirit.  
Be failed with the Spirit.  
When you're failed with the Spirit, you speak the Word of God with both.  
 Hallelujah!  
With boldness!  
Hallelujah!  
Hallelujah!  
With boldness!  
You will not be timid.  
You will not be afraid.  
You will speak it with boldness.  
It doesn't matter who it is.  
You will talk to him with boldness!  
Hallelujah!  
Why haven't you talked to those people that work with you?  
 Get failed and see what happens.  
Get failed and see what happens.  
When you are failed, you will speak with boldness.  
It will literally pour out of you.  
Jesus said, he that believe it in me.  
Out of his belly shall flow.  
Gosh, ouch.  
Reverse of living water.  
Hallelujah.  
There'll be another flow.  
 You won't have to make it come out.  
It won't come out of itself.  
Hallelujah.  
No, you'll be timid until your fails.  
You get failed and see.  
You get failed.  
No one will have to prompt you.  
No one will have to send you.  
No one will have to first get you agitated.  
No, no, no.  


  
 be filled with the Spirit.  
Speak into your zeroes, not be complaints.  
See, the reason I'm not doing this is because I am not doing this because because because, no, you're not filled with the Spirit.  
When you are filled with the Spirit, all those fleshly reasons will be gone.  
They'll be gone from you.  
Hallelujah!  
With boldness!  
 And there's something that goes with borders on your field of the spirit.  
It's called joy.  
Because the Bible tells us, again, when they were filled with the spirit, they were filled with joy.  
And what does the Bible tell us about it?  
With joy, shall you draw water out of the wares of salvation.  
With joy.  
Hallelujah.  
Are you still there?  
The place was shaken.  
 It was shaken whether we got that together.  
That's not the only time it happened.  
Go to Acts 16 and see.  
This time, it wasn't the crowd of the apostles.  
It's not according to the numbers.  
If we have many enough, all our voices will shake the building.  
No, no, no.  
There were only two of them.  
Paul and Silas, they were thrown into jail.  
But look at verse 25.  
 midnight.  
Paul and Silas prayed.  
I like that.  
They were prayed and sang praises unto God and the prisoners hurt them.  


  
They prayed  
 They sound praises to God.  
The other prisoners heard them.  
I kind of like this rendering better than the paraphrase I just gave it.  
Because if you notice, he didn't say the other prisoners.  
He said the prisoners.  
That seems to suggest to me that these ones that were praying and singing praises didn't think they were prisoners.  
 Do you understand?  
The Bible doesn't say the other prisoners.  
It says the prisoners.  


  
Yeah, because Paul tells us, he that is bound by men is the Lord's free man.  
Which means that they saw themselves as free.  
 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sent praise to the God, and the prisoners heard them.  
Look at the next verse.  
And suddenly there was a great earthquake.  
So that the foundations of the prison were shaken, and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bands were loosed.  
Shall amen somebody.  
 Oh boy, I like it suddenly.  
There was a great earthquake.  
Hi.  
So this was even more than the one that happened in Chapter 4.  
That one was, the building was shaken, but didn't get destroyed.  
And the crowd was there, but this had only two.  
 How loud could they have been singing enough for their voices to cause an earthquake and break everyone's bands?  
Certainly not the volume of the shout.  
No, it was the power, the power of prayer.  
What are you going to do with your life?  
 is prayer going to be a major feature in your life.  
There's nothing that we cannot change.  
Nothing.  
Nothing that we cannot change.  
Nothing.  
Nothing.  
If you define your purpose, maintain your focus,  
 There's nothing that we cannot change.  
You see, what we should be concerned about really is not, let me explain, I heard a story all the time.  
And it was about a couple with their little dog.  
And just behind their house was this  
 real line and every time the train came by the dog would be backing and running like after the sound of the train like it wants to get a hold of the train.  
So finally the woman said to her husband, I wonder  
 Why he keeps backing after the train?  
I wish you would just stop it.  
The husband said, that doesn't even bother me at all.  
What troubles me is what he would do with it if he caught it.  


  
Did you get it?  
If he caught the train, what would he do with it?  
 See, that's what brought that here.  
So really, when you understand what the Bible tells us about prayer, you're not going to be worried about whether or not you get what you're asking for.  
It's about what you do after giving it.  
Because there's no suggestion in the Bible  
 that we may not get it if we pray right.  
There's no suggestion that we may not get it.  
Here's what you would do with it when you got it.  
Do you now understand?  
 I'm only worried about whether or not God will answer, whether or not he'll be compelled to do what you want him to do, because he will do it.  
And he's bound himself to you in such a way that he'll answer your prayer.  
You have a right to receive an answer to every prayer according to the Bible.  
Every prayer.  
But pray the right way.  
 It's whether you know what to do with the answer, when he gives it to you.  
See what I mean?  
Imagine that you're praying to have a great voice to sing.  
He gives it to you.  
Oh, you do with it.  


  
Right?  
Uh-huh.  
It doesn't matter what you're asking for.  
 You receive it.  
You'll have it.  
All you do with it.
