title: Topical Teaching Highlights on Soul Winning
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 Experience the glory of God's Word as you watch today's episode on Pastor Chris Teaching.  


  
Who is a soul winner?  
What are the responsibilities of a soul winner?  
Find out in this insightful teaching by Pastor Chris  
 You were watching topical teaching highlights on soul winning.  
You know, we are soul winners.  
So we understand the importance of leading others to Christ.  
Every soul winner has to have a clarity  
 Clarity of the message.  
You can't preach to others if you're not glad about the message.  
There has to be a clarity of the message.  
See, as someone who leads others to Christ, you must  
 understand the message of Christ.  
You must understand it.  
You must understand it first for yourself.  
You know, because how can you bless someone else with something that you don't understand.  
 How can you bless someone else with something that you haven't been blessed with?  
You can only give what you have.  
And so a good understanding of a gospel is imperative.  
And that's why I share the word with you like that to help you get  
 a good picture of what Jesus came to do, who he is, and the meaning and essence of his message.  
So that's number one clarity.  
Number two, conviction.  
 absolute conviction.  
There has to be a clear conviction.  
You must become fully persuaded of his message, of his person, of his mission.  
Who is Jesus?  
His message.  
What did he come to do?  
What was his mission?  
Did he accomplish it?  
Did it work?  
Was he successful?  
 in what he came to do.  
Conviction.  
Conviction.  
Those two things, let me give you a simple scripture.  
Saint Luke's Gospel, chapter 1.  
Let's read from verse 1.  
 for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth and in order a decoration of those things which are most surely believed among us.  
Look at the expression, those things which are most surely believed among us.  
Even as they deliver them under us, which from the beginning where eyewitnesses and ministers of the word,  
 It seemed good to me also.  
Luke is writing this.  
It seemed good to me also.  
Having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first.  
You see that?  
Having had perfect understanding.  
You should become like Luke.  
Having had perfect understanding of the message.  
Perfect understanding.  
 of all things, from the very first to right onto the in order most excellent Theophilus.  
Now something beautiful about this Theophilus is, even though Bible scholars believe he must have been a definite individual, a definite personality because of the expression as Luke writes,  
 Because the two materials said Luke's gospel and the book of Acts were written to this same man, whoever he was.  
But the beautiful thing is, his name means lover of God.  
So, historians don't exactly know who this man is.  
But if you're a lover of God, you might just be theophilus.  
Praise God.  
 So he says, it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding.  
See, a soul winner was a perfect understanding of the message.  
He says, of all things from the very first.  
Now, of all things he's talking about, in consistency with the gospel, he's talking about the life of Christ, his message, his mission.  
That's what he's talking about.  
To write on to be in order of most excellency of Allah's.  
 that thou mightest know the certainty of those things, conviction.  
Since I'm writing to you, that you may know the certainty of those things wherein thou has been instructed.  
I wanted to go to the Book of Romans chapter number one, and let's read from verse 16 into 17.  
I'm talking about now,  
 Conviction.  
You see, you've got to have clarity.  
You've got to have conviction.  
Conviction.  
Paul says, I am this, for I am not ashamed of a gospel of Christ, for it is, not it may be, it might be.  
 It is the power of God onto salvation to everyone that believes it, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.  
It says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel because it is.  
See, there is a lot of conviction here, a lot of persuasion here.  
It says, I'm not ashamed.  
Why?  
It says, because this is the only way.  
 That's why I'm not ashamed.  
There's no other way.  
There are no options.  
So he says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God onto salvation to everyone.  
That believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek, the Gentile.  
Then he goes, next verse, for therein, oh God, this is so powerful, therein in the gospel,  
 Is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith?  
As it is written, the just shall live by faith.  
There it is the righteousness of God revealed.  
The righteousness of God is not revealed in any religion.  
It's only in the Gospel of Christ.  
And men have been seeking the righteousness of God.  
 wanting to become righteous, fighting to become righteous, trying their best.  
They think that if they became more righteous, God will hear their prayer.  
They're trying their best to become better Christians.  
They're trying.  
If I could only be a better Christian, if I could only be a more righteous Christian, that'll never happen.  
You know why?  
 because the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel.  
And what the message says is that he has given us his own righteousness because we couldn't get or attain to righteousness by his errors.  
He was not possible.  
That is the gospel.  
The gospel is good news.  
You couldn't be righteous on your own no matter how you tried.  
God is now giving to you his own righteousness and he's not counting your sins against you.  
 If you could only accept this righteousness, it would be imparted to your spirit and you can live accordingly.  
That's the gospel in a nutshell.  
You were watching topical teaching highlights on soul-winning.  
In Romans chapter 1 verse 16, 4, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believe it.  
 believe in his doing and doing a stake in action.  
As a soul winner, you must have a perfect understanding of the clarity and conviction and take full possession of the message of Christ to the ends of the Earth.  
Become fully persuaded of his message, of his person, of his mission,  
 In this life-transforming message, ministering to sole winners, you will be inspired to know the real essence of his message, why he came, and your responsibility as a Christian to live above every day.  
Whatever it is that I believe about Jesus is in action.  
So I'm talking it, I'm walking it.  
I'm acting it.  
Hallelujah.

Did you know the meaning of the name Joseph?  


  
In the Old Testament, the version was more clearly Jehovah has added.  


  
For the thought,  


  
 of expecting a new son, another son, the Lord will add on to me another son.  
Over in the New Testament, the version twists a little to a more futuristic thing.  


  
Like he will add.  
 But here is a point as he is.  
So are we in this world?  
The fourth is like the Son of God.  
Here's where you come in.  
Here's where I come in.  
Joseph number one was trusted by God to preserve life.  
Joseph number two trusted to preserve the salvation that he brought.  
 Joseph number three was trusted with the body of Christ.  
And now he will add a son.  
Adding sons is the meaning of the name Joseph, who will add more sons unto him.  
He expects you to do it.  
Preserving life is your work.  
 Preserving souls is your work.  
Expanding the body of Christ is your work.  
Every soul that you bring into Christ becomes a member of the body of Christ.  
Can you see the responsibility that you have?  
Can God trust you like he trusted Joseph?  
Whether Joseph number one, Joseph number two, or Joseph number three.  
 That's what it's trusting you with.  
That's the message that you carry this Christmas.  
Saving souls, winning people, bringing them to God, having the vision of the first Joseph, preserving life, a posterity in the earth.  
The body of Christ is a vision to you.  
Say amen.  
 Yes, it's your job.  
Each one of us must do it.  
We must carry that message, burning in our hearts every day.  
Like this is the most important thing in all the earth.  
You know, it's Christmas time and for a lot of people it's a happy holiday.  
But we are never on holidays when it comes to so winning.  
Because Satan is not on a holiday in destroying men's lives.  
 Right?  
Every opportunity that we have, we use it in winning souls and bringing people to Christ because God is trusting us.  
I want you to recognize that.  
God is trusting you in your world.  
Can you imagine that God trusted these men in such a way?  
Think about what He committed into their hands.  
Think about that.  
 Why will God trust me in so much?  
I told you the value of trust is how much is put in your hands.  
Did you know we have today the most important news on earth?  
We have today the most important message in all the world for every generation.  
 The gospel of Jesus Christ is the most important message in all the world and it's committed to us.  
Did you know that today we are the custodians of the eternal gospel?  
Did you know that?  
In our generation, we are the ones trusted by God to take this message to everyone.  
 We received it from others who will receive it from us.  


  
You have to make up your mind.  
No matter what it costs, you're going to do it.  
Even if it costs your life.  
You have to be so resolute.  
Did you hear me?  
You have to be so resolute.  
 This should go through your mind.  
Our cause is right.  
Our cause is right is right and it's worth everything.  
Our cause is right and it's worth everything.  
When I was a young guy in my early teenage years, I made up my mind.  
I knew the cause was right and I was gonna go for it.  
 I was told, you may have a terrible future.  
You may become poor.  
You may, this may happen to you, this may happen to you, and that may happen to you.  
What those who were talking to me didn't know, I had counted the cost.  
I had made a decision that nothing on earth was good enough to stop me.  
No off eyes on earth.  
 No offers on earth would help.  
Nothing could change my mind.  
It was a cause worth more than life.  
And I was gonna go for it.  
It didn't matter to me.  
If I never had anything on my back, in other words, if I didn't have any clothes to wear, it would change nothing.  
 If I was never going to have any money, it would make no difference to me.  
I remember one day I was praying.  
I said, Lord, if I have to walk through the valleys and the hills and the mountains of this world, because I read about that in Hebrews chapter 11, I said, if I have to do that, I never have a home, never have a place to stay.  
I said, I don't care.  
It doesn't mean anything.  
 This gospel is worth everything.  
I was ready.  
I may never be known.  
I didn't care.  
If I have to preach the gospel to the poorest of the poor, and guess what?  
I had gone to see very poor people and preach the gospel to them.  
I went there, where the forgotten people are.  
I saw their poverty and preach Jesus to them.  
 If I would, if God wanted me to preach to them and live among them, I was ready.  
After all, I had studied about Albert Schweitzer, a medical doctor, who came all the way to Africa and lived and walked among lepers until he became lepers himself and died a leper.  
I thought he was a hero.  
I thought he was a hero.  
 Because he didn't run away.  
He stayed.  


  
And that's what I'm saying to you.  
The other fourth man that God is trusting.  
And he's trusting you with everything.  
He's trusting you with everything.  
Everything.  
Everything now.  
 is at stake.  
The stakes have never been higher than they are today.  
And God is trusting us to save men's lives, save them from hell, and carry the blood-stained banner of Jesus Christ around the world.  
Are you hearing me?  
We've got to do it.  
 We have no other choice.  
We've got to do it.  
This is the only way.  
It says, well, there is no other name under heaven given among me and whereby we must be saved.  
There is no other name under heaven.  
Is that true?  
Do we believe that's true?  
You know, that verse, I accept the 4 of us 12, goes through my mind from time to time.  
 that there is no other name under heaven.  
If this is true, how much responsibility I have, we can't afford to fight for human recognition.  
There's too much at stake.  
Too much at stake.  
It's about the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
 and everything that we do and see.  
To fill our minds, fill our hearts with passion for Christ, passion for Christ, passion for Christ, and have your dream alive.

You're still there?  
 And so, man had to die.  
Man had to be separated from God because of the sin of Adam in the Garden of Eden.  
Then Jesus came to take our place because every man right from Adam's sin, Adam's transgression, right from him, every man that was born into this world was born into sin, every one.  
 because there was no permanent salvation from sin until Jesus came.  
Because to give permanent salvation, the sacrifice for sin must be sinless.  
And there was not.  
There was no perfect.  
The blood of an animal couldn't save men because an animal was a lower being.  
 How could the blood of a Lord be and save your life?  
So they offer those animals every year, every year, continually, because the Bible says it is not possible that the blood of booze and goats should take away sin.  
How could the blood of an animal purify your soul?  
Not possible.  
A sinless man had to take our place, and that's why Jesus came.  
 Jesus, that's why he had to be born of a virgin.  
So his life would not be touched, or it would not have anything to do with sinful man.  
Every human life comes from the sperm of a man, but Jesus had to be born of a virgin.  
 because his life came from the Word of God.  
The Word that was spoken by the angel to the woman, that who shall have a son and his name shall be called Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.  
And the woman never received that Word.  
In that Word, the Bible tells us the Word of God is seed.  
It's a seed of life.  
And when that woman received that Word,  
 He conceived the baby.  
That baby is called the word.  
You see it?  
Because it came from the word and not from the life of a man.  
So the Bible says in John chapter one, from verse one, in the beginning was the word.  
The word was what's God and the word was God.  
 See, the same word that God spoke, let there be light, the word that God spoke to create, all the things that He created, that was the same word.  
The angel brought to Mary and said, I come from the presence of God with a message for you.  
And she said, let it be to me according to your word.  
 when Jesus was born.  
He was the living world.  
The Bible says the word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
As Jesus.  
So this is the sinless man that had to die in our place.  
He had to die the second death.  
Spiritual death.  
You see it?  
Now that's not what?  
 Let me be clear with the terminology for you so you understand.  
I'm referring to the deaths on the cross.  
Isaiah calls them deaths.  
Now, the real terminology of your second death in the book of Revelation refers to when a man is finally cast into the lake of fire.  
Did you get it?  
So I'm talking about two deaths on the cross.  
The first is spiritual.  
The second is physical.  
Now here is Jesus.  
 sinless.  
He would never die.  
But then he gets separated from God because of us.  
And then he dies physically.  
First death, Jesus is on the cross.  
And finally, He's paying for our sins.  
 In that payment, the Bible says the sin of the whole world was laid on him.  
Isaiah 53, when you read from verse 4, into verse 5, into verse 6, and it tells us all we like sheep have gone astray.  
We have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all.  
And once that became consummated in the realm of the spirits, Jesus cried out.  
 When the sins were laid on him, he cried out because the Bible tells us that God turned his back on Jesus.  
Why?  
Because our sins were laid on him and the Bible says, God's so holy, he doesn't look at sin.  
So when our sins were laid on Jesus, the Father turned his back on Jesus.  
 And Jesus cried out, a lawyer, lawyer, a mass about tonight.  
My God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?  
That was what he dreaded in the garden of Gethsemane.  
You remember in that garden when he was saying, if it be possible, let this cop pass from me.  
 Then finally, he said, nevertheless, not my will, but your will be done.  
In other words, I never want to be separated from you, Father.  
So this is not my will.  
I don't want to be separated from you, but this is your will.  
And it was done because of us.  
Are you hearing this?  
 So when Jesus was dying on the cross, in the mind of justice, in the mind of God, every one of us was on that cross.  
Because he did it for us.  
We were on that cross.  
When the Father turned his back on Jesus, we were on that cross.  
And when he gave up the ghost and died, we were in him.  
 in his crucifixion, in him, in his death.  
So when he died, we died.  
And in that death, every one of us paid for his sins.  
Every man that ever came before Jesus, every man that lived at the time and everyone who would ever come paid because his blood was divine.  
 And it was adequate.  
You need never pay again for your sins.  
I remember a young guy many years ago, were little kids, and he said, he did something wrong, and he gave himself seven knobs.  
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  
I said, why'd you do that?  
He said, because I did something wrong.  
See, he didn't understand the gospel.  
No more punishment for sins.  
 because Jesus was punished for us.  
It's only those who reject His sacrifice, who don't accept His sacrifice, that must make up their minds how they are going to pay for their sins.  
And you will never be able to pay.  
That's the reason for the lake of fire.  
That's the reason for eternal punishment.  
 Some people think, well if I ever go to hell, maybe somehow Sunday God will finally decide it's enough.  
It'll never be enough because it's about paying for your sin.  
And because you would never be able to pay, you'd be there eternally forever.  
In the Bible says the lake of fire was never prepared for man.  
He was prepared for the devil and his angels.  
 And so everyone who rejects the name of Jesus, the blood of Jesus, the life of Jesus will have to go that way.  
Not because God prepared it for him, but because it was his choice.  
Salvation is a choice.  
Condemnation is a choice.  
You make the choice.  
 Hallelujah.  
But for those who have made the choice to follow Jesus, what a life, what a glory, what a glory, what a glory.  
First, let me give you the picture of the man who doesn't know Jesus, how God sees you.  
I want to give you that picture.  
And everyone who has received Jesus, when you understand how God sees the sinner, you understand why we must preach the gospel, why we've got to do it.  
 Let's go Ephesians, Book of Ephesians chapter number two.  
I begin reading from verse 11.  
I want you to follow this.  
Good.  
He says, therefore remember that at one time you were Gentiles, heathened in the flesh, called on circumcision by those who called him zero circumcision.  
 itself a mere mark in the flesh made by human hands.  
Go on.  
Just remember that you were at that time.  
You see, listen to this.  
Now, he's talking to Christians.  
He says, before you became a Christian, before you were born again, this was what you were like.  
Which means everyone who's not born again is this way.  
 Remember that you were at that time separated, living apart from Christ, excluded from all part in Him, utterly estranged, terrible, utterly completely estranged, and outlawed, outlawed from the rights of Israel as a nation.  
 Now, why does he say Israel as a nation?  
Because God gave covenants to Israel, a special blessing to Israel as a nation.  
And God's plan was to make all of those blessings become available to everybody else, every other nation, everybody else.  
It was God's plan.  
And the only way to do it, that he planned, was to do it through Jesus Christ.  
 You get me?  
All right.  
So at that time, you were corrupt from all of that blessing.  
And it says, I'm strangers with no share in the sacred compact of the Messianic promise, with no knowledge of all rights in God's agreements, His governance.  
And you had no hope, no promise, you were in the world without God.  
 Think about how a man lives without God.  
It doesn't matter that he calls the name of God 10 times a day.  
In the mind of God, he lives without God.  
But God helps him.  
God blesses him.  
God puts Christians around him to bring the gospel to him.  
God sends his angel so protective so that he would have an opportunity to hear the gospel and receive salvation.  
But God's not with him.  
 He says, you're in the world without God.  
To have the help of God and to have God at two different things.  
I can send you money without being your friend.  
I can send you help.  
And this is shit myself from you.  
That's what God's saying.  
Just because he protected you, just because he helped you, doesn't mean he's with you.  


  
 He says that without God in the world, without light, the work in darkness, every day, doesn't matter that he's your uncle, doesn't matter that he's your brother in law, he's your younger sister or younger brother or your dad.  
Here's what God says.  
And why we must preach the gospel, we're not just trying to get them into the church, no, it's for their spiritual salvation.  
 Hallelujah.

 That's painful.

The church is marching on.  
 The gates of hell shall not prevail.  
The church is marching on.  
Hallelujah.  
That's wonderful.  
They shall shine like stars.  
They that turn men to righteousness.  
He that winneth souls is wise.  
And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the families.  
 the brightness of heaven.  
You know, sometimes you don't see the sun, but every way is bright, because the sun is somewhere.  
Is that correct?  
Yeah, to everyone's pride.  
Oh, even sometimes at night, when you get a full moon, it always seems bright.  
It says day that you wise just shine like the brightness of the  
 Then, there that turned many to righteousness asked the light give us.  
You see?  
They are the reason for the brightness.  
Uh-huh.  
Vision's chapter five.  
Just trying to lay the foundation, all right?  
So you can get this stuff.  
It's so powerful.  


  
 Vision's chapter 5 verse 13.  
He defines light for us very simply.  
But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light.  
For what so ever don't make manifest is light.  
The King James gets it so perfectly.  
What so ever don't make manifest is light.  
He says light is that which makes manifest.  
If you turn light on, you're going to see something.  
 Light illuminates.  
And so when the Lord says to you, you want a lot of the world.  
That means I have a calling in this life.  
I bring illumination to this world.  
When I arrive, illumination comes.  
When I arrive, what you didn't know you will get to know.  
 Are you getting it now?  
See, I'm the light of the world.  
I'm the light of the world.  
See, you have a calling.  
Everywhere you are, you are the light.  
You are the light.  
You are the light.  
You are the light.  
And here's not a beautiful thing.  
 You know, it's a great idea about the sun and the moon, a wonderful relationship.  
You know, the moon is not a light.  
That's an interesting truth.  
Scientific truth.  
See, the moon is not a light, even though you see it with the light, as though it's light.  
The moon gets its light from the sun.  
 And it's an amazing reflection because the moon is a very black substance.  
The sun is black.  
Can you imagine that?  
It's so black!  
And yet it reflects light in such a powerful way.  
And so there's an interesting idea about us being the moon.  
 Jesus being the sun and so we reflect the light.  
I know you like that, but not exactly.  
Not exactly.  
I'll show you from the word now.  
It's better than that.  
He really doesn't take us as the moon that reflects the light of the sun.  
 even though it's a powerful idea, okay?  
There is the babyhood stage of understanding, and then there is the mature stage of understanding.  
Jesus Christ, the Bible says, is the son of righteousness.  
Not S-O-N, but S-U-N, son like given light, you know?  
So he's the son of righteousness.  
Now, what does the Bible say about us?  
Oh, dear.  
First thessalonians chapter five,  
 And we're gonna read from verse number five.  
You there?  
Oh, yeah, all the children of lights.  
Somebody say hallelujah.  
If you're a child of a dog, you're a dog.  
Ha ha ha.  
If you're the child of a cat, you're a cat.  
 He came to different from your origin.  
Look at that.  
He are all the children of light.  
If you're a child of lights, what are you?  
Jesus said, I'm the light of the world as long as I'm in this world.  
I'm the light of the world.  
And he says, you are the light of the world.  
He really wasn't saying you are reflecting my light.  
No, let's see.  
He are all the children of lights.  
And the children of the day.  
When does the moon shine?  
 Not in the day.  
Children of the day, we are not of the night nor of darkness.  
So we are not of the moon.  


  
We are not of the night.  
 Nor of darkness for day that sleep, sleep in the night.  
And day that be drunken, at drunken in the night, eight.  
But let us, who are of the day?  
There it is again.  
Be sober, put it on the breastplate of faith and love.  
And for an helmet, the hope of salvation.  
Somebody say hallelujah.  
Say I'm of the day.  
Not of the night.  
That means I'm of the sun, not of the moon.  
 So I give lights.  
Oh, that's me, reflect.  


  
Ha ha ha.  
Don't talk about it.  
So I am an illuminator.  
Yeah.  
I bring illumination.  
 I unveil and reveal the things of the Spirit.  
I reveal truths.  
I reveal reality.  
That's my calling.  
Glory to God.  
I'm the light of the world.  
I'm the light of the world.

Hallelujah.  
 Now you can understand why they have been admiring you.

 You know, everything has a sound.  
Sound waves are the essence of life, the heartbeat of creation, the very beginning of all.  
Everything listens to sound, and everything has a sound.  
There's the sound of nature, the rustling of leaves, the rushing waves of the ocean, and there's the sound of animals, the buzzing of bees,  
 The flapping of a hummingbird.  
The galloping of a horse.  
And there's the sound of humanity.  
The heartfelt laughter of a loved one.  
The traffic noise in a metropolis.  
The blasting club beat all through the night.  
And there's the sound of the creator.  
The only sound with the ability to love, heal and transform you.
