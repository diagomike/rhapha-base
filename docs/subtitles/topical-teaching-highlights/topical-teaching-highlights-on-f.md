title: Topical Teaching Highlights on Fellowship
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.

This is topical teaching highlight on fellowship.  
 Hallelujah.  
Fellowship.  
What do you mean fellowship?  
Oh yeah.  
First Corinthians chapter one verse number nine.  
You like it.  
God is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ our Lord.  
 Jesus Christ, our Lord, we are in fellowship with Jesus Christ.  
Isn't that amazing?  
Don't you understand what that means?  
We're in fellowship with Jesus Christ.  
Now, the word is coined on there, okay?  
I mean fellowship.  
It's the strongest word to use, and that's why they're choosing it there.  
It means partnership.  
It means communion, okay?  
It means to be sharing.  
 Together.  
How?  
It means oneness.  
Oneness with Jesus, partnership with Jesus, communion with Jesus, fellowship with Jesus.  
He's brought us into fellowship with Himself like we are worn together.  
This is amazing.  
No wonder He says that we are joint heirs with Christ.  
God is faithful by whom you were called.  
 You were called.  
You didn't qualify for it.  
You didn't walk your way there.  
It happened through his calling in Christ Jesus.  
What a gift.  
What a gift.  
What a gift.  
Go to 1 John chapter 1.  
Amazing.  
1 John chapter 1.  
Worry from verse 1.  
That which was from the beginning.  
 which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life.  
Verse two, for the life, wow.  
For the life was manifested, what a construction, what a construction, the life is calling Jesus the life.  
That means Jesus Christ is the embodiment of the divine life.  
Jesus Christ is the embodiment of deity.  
 For the life was manifested and we have seen it.  
Oh, dear Lord.  
And show unto you that into the life which was with the Father and was manifested under us.  
Oh, that which we have seen and heard the clay we own to you, that He also may have fellowship with us and truly God Almighty.  
This is powerful.  
 Truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.  
Oh God, oh God, associates of the God kind.  
What a truth.  
We're in fellowship with God.  
In fellowship with the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.  
Lord, thank You.  
Thank You.  
Thank You what a life has given us.  
 What a life.  
How can you know this and say you are having some discouragement about something?  
How can you know this and face frustrations?  
How can you know this and say you are broke?  
How can you know this?  
How can you know this?  
I'll be wondering about your future.  
How can you know this?  
Fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.  
Amazing.  
Amazing.  
What a gift.  
 Thank you Lord Jesus.  
How?  
Powerful, powerful.  
Let me show you.  
There's something you say all the time.  
All the time, all the time.  
Second Corinthians chapter 13 and verse number 14.  
You say it all the time.  
You pray it everywhere.  
I want you to understand it's real.  
Look at it.  
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God.  
And that's the words.  
It's translated communion this time.  
Call in the name.  
Fellowship.  
 The fellowship of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost.  
Be with you.  
The communion of the Holy Ghost.  
What a gift.  
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  
Hi.  
So we're in fellowship with the Father, with the Son, with the Holy Spirit.  
Amazing.  
First, the Father carried out His ministry.  
Second, Jesus, the Son carried out His ministry and thought the Holy Spirit carries out His full ministry.  
But He's the first to be revealed in the Godhead.  
 For the Bible terraces in Genesis chapter 1, you read it.  
It terraces.  
He reveals it and says, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the ones.  
The Spirit of God.  
That's the Holy Spirit.  
His God's gift to you.  
 so that you can live the life of God, so that you always be a success, so that the Kingdom of God can be real to you, so that the fellowship of the Father and the Son can become real to you.  
It helps you in prayer.  
It carries out a ministry in your life.  
The Holy Spirit makes the Kingdom of God real to you.  
So now, while you're in this earth, you live as though in heaven.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
 Oh, what a life.  
You live beyond the senses because of the power and the ability of the Holy Spirit.  
Then you can do supernatural things.  
No wonder he said to his disciples, tiring in Jerusalem, until he'd be endured with power from one eye.  
 And when the Holy Ghost came, they became powerful.  
That's why when I'm talking to you now.  
See, your heart is receiving.  
Why?  
Because of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  
That's why you can understand, because of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  
That's why I can be bold to talk to a singer about Jesus, because the Holy Spirit will let him know that Jesus Christ is real.  
Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  
Can you imagine?  
We weren't there when Jesus Christ was born.  
We weren't there when he was crucified.  
We weren't there.  
 When he was buried away and resurrected or ascended, we were there.  
But we believe it and so believe it until we got to know it.  
It has become something you can't take away from us.  
Why?  
Because the Holy Spirit has made it imprinted in our hearts.  
Hallelujah.

The Holy Spirit brings to us fellowship.  
It means a communion, a drinking together, a union with you.  
 We come into a place of relationship, a oneness, an inseparable oneness.  
And you ought to enjoy that fellowship every day, every day.  
This is topical teaching highlight on fellowship.  
God is faithful by whom you were caught onto the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.  
 You were called onto the fellowship of his son, Jesus Christ.  
That means that you have been brought into a oneness, a partnership, a family union with Jesus Christ.  
 If this is true, what in the world could you ever be in need of?  
When you prayed to God and you asked Him for things, His purpose is not to give you things.  


  
 doesn't want to give you a house.  
His purpose is not to give you a car.  
His purpose is not to give you money.  
Many times we ask for things.  
A God's plan is not to give us things.  
 Because a lot of times, that's the wrong focus.  
When we're asking God for things.  
Of course, He says, ask and it shall be given you.  
Seek and you shall find.  
Knock and it shall be open unto you.  
For everyone that asks and receives it, he that seek and finds it, to him that knock at the door shall be open.  
Yes, He says that.  
 But you have to understand that as you study the scriptures, he's got a message for babies, and he's got a message for the spiritual.  
As you grow in your knowledge of God, you discover that everything you would ever long for has been given to you in his world.  
 And you discover you don't really need to ask Him for anything.  
You'd be amazed.  
There's a fellowship to which it calls us.  


  
That completely takes away from our lives the consciousness of need.  
Jesus had no consciousness of need.  
 What a place to be.  
What a place to be where you have no consciousness of need.  
Now hold this in your mind and turn to Romans 8.  
Let's begin with verse 14.  
Romans 8.  
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.  
Next verse.  
 For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of Adoption, where we cry, Abba, Father."  
Okay, next verse.  
The Spirit, now the old King James translation which we're using, uses the word itself, to read himself because the Spirit is a person, okay?  
But let's read.  
The Spirit itself's merit witness with our Spirit that we are the children of God.  
 You know what it's talking about there?  
There's a witness inside you that you are a child of God.  
When you're born again, when you have received eternal life from Jesus Christ, the Spirit God bears witness with your spirits.  
There's a knowledge way down deep inside you.  
You just know that you know that you know that he's your father.  
Hallelujah.  
And the reason for that is the Holy Spirit bears witness with your spirit.  
 He tells you on the inside, you're a child of God.  
So, there's fairly himself bear witness with our spirit that we are the children of God, because we're born again.  
Now, look at the next thing.  
And if children, he says, if this is true, that we are the children of God, that means we are heirs.  


  
If children, then heirs.  
 heirs of God in Jewish heirs with Christ.  
If so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also glorified together.  
If we are children of God, ask the Holy Spirit best witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God.  
He says, if that is true, that means what God's heirs.  
 And if we are God's heirs, he says, we are joint heirs with Christ.  
Not co-heirs, but joint heirs.  
Did you ever have a joint bank account with anybody?  
I want to tell you how it works.  
 If it's a joint account, everything in that account belongs to you as it belongs to him.  
You don't get nothing out without him.  
He don't get nothing out without you.  


  
This is what he's called us to.  
This is God is faithful by whom you were called unto the fellowship of his son, Jesus Christ, our Lord.  
 He says, we're joint heirs with Christ.  
If we are joint heirs, what in the world are you asking for?  
As a Christian, you've been called into a unique fellowship with God, and your knowledge of that oneness with Him is what truly sets you apart as a victor in life.  
You were called unto the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ.  
 What a place to be to have been brought into a wonder.  
A partnership.  
A family union.  
If this is true, what in the world could you ever be in need of?  
 This message, called to fellowship, will help you explore the profound depths of your union with the Father and give you an enriched understanding of it.

 The Word of God is God's mirror for your spirit.  
If you don't know what's there, you will never live accordingly.  
But you'd be amazed to discover what's in that book.  
It'll change you.  
I'm trying to tell you, it doesn't matter what you go through.  
In the midst of the trouble, in the midst of the darkness, in the midst of the pain, you have to say what God says.  
Give me.  
Don't give up.  
Give me.  
Don't give in.  
 The Bible says Abraham staggered notched at the promise of God through unbelief, but he was charmed in thick, giving your inner count.  
Hallelujah!  
Hallelujah!  
Master Chris, we're hearing.  
 This is topical teaching highlight and fellowship.  
Look at this.  
First Corinthians chapter 10.  
Come on, read from verse 15.  
Notice what it says here.  
From verse 15, I speak as to wise men.  
Judge you what I say.  
Next verse.  
 The cup of blessing which we bless is not the communion of the blood of Christ.  
The bread which we break is not the communion of the body of Christ.  
You see that?  
For we, being many, are one bread and one body.  
For we are all partakers of that one bread.  


  
Glory to God.  
 Let me show you some more.  
Look at this.  
Verse 18, Behold Israel after the flesh.  
That is, he says, the Israel of the Old Testament, the natural human natural Israel is referring to them now.  
And not they which eat of the sacrifices, particas of the altar.  
What say I then?  
Hmm.  
Listen.  
 that the idol is anything or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything.  
But I say that the things which the Gentiles, the heathen, sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils and not to God.  
And I would not that he should have fellowship with devils.  
So if I'm eating with people,  
 who have made sacrifices to devils, even though I'm not seeing the devils, I am having fellowship with devils.  
So he says, he warns them.  
Verse 21, he cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils.  
 You cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils.  


  
What is it teaching us here?  
It matters where we go.  
It matters where we go.  
When you find a Christian brother and a Christian sister, they have been Christians for a long time.  
Now they have a little  
 Bambino, and you carry that child, and what happens, they don't understand why his head is not standing on his shoulder.  
All the time, all the time, all the time.  
And then, every once in a while, when it looks like this, even they are scared.  
They know something is wrong with the child, but nothing is wrong with either of them.  
 Because with their faith, they have been able to suppress demonic things in their lives.  
But they have had fellowship with demons.  
Now they have passed that devil to the child.  
And they're wondering where did it come from?  
Where did it come from?  
He warned you.  
He warned you.  
 If you was a brother, you marry a sister that has demons in her life, you're going to have fellowship with demons.  
Why you and the lady may not necessarily experience any serious or severe problems with demons, very likely, because demons have been here for, I mean, from the dead, let's pass.  
They've been here.  
So they don't mind with  
 They don't mind wait till children start coming before they start manifesting themselves.  
Because if they manifest themselves, they know you have faith.  
You send them away so they're quiet.  
But all the time you've been carrying them everywhere.  
And you notice something about yourself.  
Every once in a while you are rebellious.  
The sign has been there.  
You just didn't know.  
Every once in a while, the pastor is preaching about something you get hungry.  
Why should he talk like that?  
 Then you come down again, you are nice again.  
Every once in a while, there's this manifestation of some bitterness in your life.  
Someone has wronged you.  
Every time you see him, you are upset.  
But because of God, because of God, because of God.  
 You are doing because of the... You are suppressing.  
You didn't forget.  
You are suppressing.  
So the demons are suppressed.  
But soon, those are showing up in your gym.  
Very rebellious.  
And sometimes very wicked.  
And the demons can wait till the boy is 15 years old.  
They are nice until they grow up.  
Then you just hear  
 I don't want to come to church anymore.  
I just want to tell you I'm not a Christian.  
You say, what?  
He's not scared of you.  
Why?  
Because demons are dead, talking.  
He's not talking by himself.  
He has grown with these demons.  
Head trade for Christ.  
Head trade for the church.  
Head trade!  
 And you might be making excuses for him.  
You know, the reason he hates the church is because you know the church has actually mistreated the halls.  
The church mistreated you.  
Your life changed when you came to the church.  
Now he said the church mistreated you.  
You know, the reason my son doesn't want to call the church is because for the pastor, three years ago, did to us.  
My son has not forgotten.  
How can he forget?  
When did he forget?  


  
 So I'm saying to you, I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.  
Careful.  
Careful.  


  
Because when the enemy strikes, he's a strategist.  
He looks for the best way to destroy the most.  
He goes for the most number.  
 If he knows that he can wait a little and take a whole lot of people, he will rather wait than destroy one person and get in trouble.  
So he just waits.  
What do you see if you're following Jesus and his word and listening to the Holy Ghost?  
You will have a greater strategy than Satan could ever plan.

Mastering the Testament of your faith in his death, burial, and resurrection.  
The communion is my Testament.  
 of my identification with his body and his blood.  
As we follow Christ and His Word, we surely have victory because we live not for ourselves, but for Him.  
 The church is his body.  
And this edifice is going to be a powerful superstructure.  
He's building through me hallelujah.  
I'm winning the source.  
I'm bringing the matchippers here.  
And I'm building the body of Christ.  
Somebody shout hallelujah.

Every point you are,  
 is where to start from and carry the atmosphere everywhere you go.  
Color your experience by listening to the word.  
When you're studying the Bible, you're hearing God's word, into your spirit, you're hearing it.  
And he paints a picture.  
He shows you the image, the image of God's glory.  
He shows you that glory.  
Can you look?  
Stay connected.  
Foster Chris.  
 We're here.  


  
 Adam lost his place of fellowship with God and was separated from his ultimate source.  
From then on, men over the ages have longed earnestly for the one true way back to God's presence.  
The presence of God.  
Man wanted that divine presence.  
In this teaching you'll discover, the one and only true way to God's presence, the matchless power in the name of Jesus, and who we are today as God's new divine creation.  


  
 This is topical teaching highlight on fellowship.  


  
You know the Bible says in the presence of the Lord is what?  
At his right hand there are... Lesures!  
Evermore!  
In his presence is what?  
Fullness of joy!  
 I can understand what happened to Adam and what happened ever since.  
When Adam was driven away from the presence of God because he and his wife had sinned against God, they were driven away from the presence of God.  
And then an angel, think about it, what a day.  
God always wanted to have fellowship with someone.  
Couldn't have fellowship with the angels.  
 And now he had his Adam and the Bible says how that God will go to the garden and the cool of the day.  
He'll call him by name.  
But this one time, he called him and Adam's hiding.  
Adam, where out now?  
He's hiding from God.  
God says, where are you?  
Where are you?  
He says, I can hear you.  
 No!  
We can't come out.  
Why can't you come out?  
We're naked.  
The Lord said, who told you you're naked?  
Did you do what I told you not to do?  
The woman you gave me gave me the ear.  
Black day, terrible day.  
And God said, now, that the man has become as one of us.  
 making his own decisions.  
He said, out.  
Get out of the garden.  
Go and fend for yourself since you are gods.  
This rich fellowship that he had with God was over.  
That was the beginning of religion.  
Man began to do everything he could to get that presence again.  
 Even in the days of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, you remember that make a stone a pillar.  
Jacob said, this stone shall be God's house.  
How could this stone be God's house?  
But it just tells you how they thought.  
The dream for God's presence.  
 in his presence, his fullness, understand it, fullness of joy.  
There's no joy like what you have in the presence of God.  
Adam had lost something.  
Adam had lost something.  
But now he couldn't even find his way to the garden.  
No, the presence of God was gone.  
Man couldn't find his way.  
Think about it.  
 the presence of God, man wanted that divine presence.  
It was what men wanted that made him go into all kinds of religions, all the religions of the world today, seeking the same thing, the lost presence.  
And they have no way to get back into that presence, no way, no way to get back into that presence until  
 something interesting.  
This man, Jesus, makes a startling statement.  
He says something that, you know, they had a hard time understanding it.  
He says, I'm going to the father.  
 Who is the way to the Father?  
He says, I am the way.  
This was what Adam needed.  
This was what Abraham needed.  
What Moses needed.  
What the Jewish priest who needed.  
This was what everybody needed.  
All these many years.  
The way to the Father's presence.  
 And now Jesus declares it, I am the way.  
No man comes to the Father but by me.  
There's no other way.  
I am the way.  
No man comes to the Father but by me.  
Stuckling statements.  
Stuckling.  
Stuckling.  
Stuckling.  
 I could be the way.  
I am the way.  
That's what Jesus said.  
I am the way.  
I want you to think about it.  
If Jesus is the way, no man comes to the Father but by Jesus.  
He didn't say I'm one of the ways.  
I am the way.  
Not a way.  
 The way.  


  
Okay.  
The way to way to the Father.  
No man comes to the Father, but by me.  
You can never find the Father, but by Jesus.  
He is the way to the Father.

Every day, lives are being changed because someone is taking the gospel of Jesus to them.  
For every life that has been touched, we say it's worth it.  
For the transformation it brings, we hear it.  
 In every word that is said, change is minister to people's lives because they hear words worth hearing.  
Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
This is topical teaching highlight on fellowship.  
See, Christianity is not about what we're trying to make our religion bigger.  
 We're not trying to get more followers.  
Are you following this?  
No, this is for the salvation of the world.  
Only in Christianity is their fellowship with God.  
Understand it, only in Christianity is their fellowship with God.  


  
 nor religion in the world offers fellowship with God.  
There's none.  
How could they have it?  
Who would make it possible?  
How?  
With what?  


  
Think about it.  
 How would fellowship with God be made possible in any religion?  
How are they going to make it happen?  
With who?  
By who?  
Are they going to offer their own lives?  
The lives are not clean enough.  
Are they going to slaughter an animal?  
It's not good enough.  
What can be good enough for God to appease you?  
 What can bring sinful men into oneness with God?  
What in the world would be clean enough to be acceptable to God to make such a thing happen?  
Not even the whole world was good enough.  
In all religions, they've offered sacrifices upon sacrifices, upon sacrifices.  
They've tried everything.  
 It never worked, and it never will.  


  
Only Jesus.  
Why?  
Jesus came into this world in a way no other human came into this world.  


  
Jesus came into this world.  
 Being born of a virgin, a miracle of miracles, a scientific miracle, a miracle of miracles.  
Because it is not possible that a woman should have a child without a man.  
 It is not possible.  
Hallelujah.  
So he says, in Second Corinthians chapter 13 and verse 14, he says, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, the end of communion, the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you.  
And I said that we can only have fellowship with the Father and with the Son through the Holy Spirit.  
And this is so important  
 I gave you three words coming from that same, uh, apparent word, calling onia.  
Okay?  
And, uh, these three words were, one, fellowship, two, partnership, and three, distribution.  
You know, fellowship gives birth to partnership.  
 and partnership gives birth to distribution.  


  
If you have fellowship with the Holy Spirit,  
 If you recognize the Holy Spirit, if you have fellowship with Him, I'm not talking about only speaking in tongues.  
I'm talking about recognizing Him as a person and living with Him as a person.  
Walking with Him as a person, He will bring you into partnership with Himself.  
Fellowshiping with the Holy Spirit brings you into partnership with Him.  
 It's so important that you learn this.  
If you recognize the Holy Spirit in your life, you'd be amazed at what will happen in your home and your job and your finances, everything that concerns you.  
He says, that will perfect that which concerned me.  
He perfects everything that concerns me.  
Hallelujah.  
Say it with me, that will perfect that which concerned me.  
 Yeah, that's his work.  
He perfects everything that concerns you.  
There are things you don't know about, but he knows.  
The things that concern you.  
As we are here now, there are things somewhere, somewhere in the world that concern you.  
You don't know nothing about them, but the Holy Ghost knows.  
And he's working on stuff for your good.  
 Hallelujah.  
But see, that's when you are in fellowship with you.  
Then you can play your part.  
Genesis chapter 17, verse 1.  
And when Abraham was 90 years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him, I am El Shaddha.  
 the Almighty God.  
Walk before me and be thou perfect.  
Hey, that's fellowship.  
That's what he's calling the man into.  
He calls him into fellowship.  
He says, walk in my face.  
Walk with me.  
Are you getting it now?  
And so what will be the result?  
And I will make my covenant, that's partnership.  
You walk before me and I'll become your partner and you'll become my partner.  
Are you still there, somebody?  
 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply!  
Ah, distribution!  
I just healed her!  
That means when I get you blessed, everybody here gets blessed.  
That's distribution.  
Coming to fellowship with you, and become his partner.  
And you know what?  
You will be changing the world.  
Shout out, hallelujah!  
 You can't come into fellowship with the Holy Spirit without something happening.  
It doesn't matter where you are.  
It doesn't matter what you do.  
There will be a distribution eventually.  
When you understand fellowship with the Holy Spirit, he will solve all your problems.  
He will answer every question.  
Shout out, Hallelujah!  
There is no difficulty to the Holy Spirit.  
 What you need is to understand your work with God.  
It doesn't matter what assignment has been given to you.  
It doesn't matter what the limitations have been.  
All you need is fellowship with the Holy Spirit.  
Recognize Him.  
Jesus said, follow me.  
 Follow me, and I will make you.  
Ha ha ha, I will make you.  
He said, follow me, and I will make you.  
Don't try to be.  
He says, follow me.  
That's fellowship, and I will make you.  
Fissures of men.  
There's no difficulty.  
Man hasn't made a law yet that God doesn't know what to do with it.  
 No law or no regulation can place a limit on you.  
He says he are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because Kritar is he, that is in you, that he, that is in the world.  


  
Doesn't matter which nation,  
 Doesn't matter which government or administration is in office.  
Greta, Greta, Greta is he that is in you.  
Then he that is in the world.
