title: Topical Teaching Highlights on Christian Living
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 Proverbs chapter 25.  


  
 I want to read verse 28, Proverbs 25 and verse 28.  
He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a setting that is broken down and without wars.  
Aye!  


  
What life?  
What life are you living?  
No self-control?  
You have principles in your life.  
 kind of self-control.  
Your tongue, do you just use your mouth?  
If I talk to you, my mouth, my mouth.  
They're even proud of it.  
They're proud that their mouth can pour out dirty words, terrible words.  
So if I use my mouth for you, your mouth was not given to you for cussing.  
Your mouth was given to you to build your life.  
 to build a future and to build others.  
But when you don't know, you train yourself.  
Some people just start studying bad words, terrible words, so they can use them against other people.  
I found one.  
What life do you want to live?  
Do you have rule over your spirit?  
Do you have control over your spirit?  
 Second Peter chapter one.  
And from verse five.  
And beside this, given all diligence, add to your faith, virtue.  
Wonderful.  
All right, next one.  
What's the next one?  
 Add to knowledge, temperance, under temperance, patience.  
Patience, what's patience?  
What's patience?  
Patience is simple.  
Everybody knows patience, right?  
So what is patience?  
What is patience?  
What is it?  
What is it?  
You're adding patience to temperance.  
You're adding patience to temperance to self-control.  
So what is patience?  
 Endurance, enduring, trying circumstances with calmness, right?  
With an even temper, without getting angry, without annoyance, right?  
Yes, you can endure trying circumstances, whatever they may be, without getting frustrated.  
 patience.  
So he tells us, I'm a patient person at all.  
Don't try my patience.  
No, you are.  
It's in your spirit.  
That's what God is asking you to add it to your faith.  
Now that you've got faith, add patience to it.  
Learn the steadfast calmness of the spirits.  
Put it to work.  
Add it to your faith.  
You'd be amazed at the results.  
Glory to God.  
 See, the things that God tells us to do, they're so simple.  
So simple.  
He never tells us to do difficult things.  
They're so simple.  
All right.  
The next one is what?  
Godliness.  
Look at it.  
He says, patience to what?  
Temperance.  
And to patience, godliness.  
What is godliness?  
Godliness is so simple.  
Greek is usurpier.  
It just means piety.  
 Piety.  
Glory to God.  
Reverence.  
You know what that is?  
Reverence.  
Some people are irreverent.  
Oh, God wants you to be reverent.  
Add some piety to your life.  


  
A Christian has  
 Ah, an expression of reverence.  
Remember, you're always in the presence of God.  
Never forget that.  
You're always in the presence of God and in the presence of angels.  
See, I'm always in the presence of God and in the presence of angels.  
So, I'm careful about my life.  
 Now, careful there just means doing the right thing.  
Consciously.  
Okay?  
Consciously.  
Have some piety.  
Not only when you come to change.  


  
Have some people who are just rough.  
In Christianity, you start building a character.  
You start building a life.  
 They're just some things you don't do anymore, not because they are bad, but because they are not excellent.  
Do you get it?  
No.  
You stop doing them because they're not excellent.  
You bring excellence into your life.  
Is this unto godliness?  
Brotherly kindness.  
Brotherly kindness.  
Ah.  
 brotherly kindness.  
What is brotherly kindness?  
Fraternal affection.  
You're dealing with learning to be helpful in a brotherly way, like you're helping your brothers and sisters in the world.  
Kind heartedness.  
Let me see you.  
Are you kind?  
Say it again.  
Are you kind?  
 Do those around you think you're kind?  
Do you know anybody who thinks you're not really kind?  
Did you say yes?  
Yes, sometimes there are some people who may think you're not kind, but were you really kind to them or you were not?  
 Practice kindness, practice it.  
It will not come by itself.  
You've got to practice it.  
These things are telling you to add is actually saying practice them.  
Put them to work.  
Put them to work.  
If you will put them to work, there are other things.  
 that these will cost to happen.  
And the Bible tells us in verse 8, for if these things be in you and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
Make your life a practical life.  
Are you hearing me?  
 You put this to work, you'll be amazed.  
The next five years, the level at which you'll be doing things, we far, far beyond what you're doing now.  
You just keep growing.  
Are you hearing me?  
Be successful for the gospel.  
Hallelujah.

Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
 This is topical teaching highlight on Christian living.  
Hallelujah.  
Turn to Psalm 119.  
Let me show you some things here.  
Verse 66, read.  


  
I'm touched.  
I'm touched.  
He says, teach me good judgment and knowledge.  
You know what this man is talking about here?  
 This is for I have believed that commandment.  
It's not enough to believe.  
The rest is where I already believe what else you want from me.  
This law.  
 There's more.  
Because you want the Word of God to work for you.  
There's more.  
He says, teach me good judgments.  
Good judgments.  
How to discern what is right from what is wrong.  
How to discern what is of God and what is not of God.  
How to discern the principles of the Spirit realm.  
He says, teach me good judgment and knowledge.  
Teach me knowledge.  
You know the man is saying, spiritual knowledge.  
 You know, sometimes I look at certain people and some things that if you knew the Word of God, you wouldn't do that.  


  
You know, Jesus said, you are because you know not the Scriptures.  
You are because you know not the Scriptures.  
There are things people do that put them in bondage, that destroy the work of their hands, and they don't know.  
 because they're ignorant.  


  
One of the things you must not take lightly is church attendance.  
I'll tell you, going to church is so important for you.  
It is so, so important that it must be for you a priority.  
 Because the Bible says that the church is talking about the local church.  
There it is a ground and pillar of truths.  
There you make it possible for the ministry of the Spirit in your life.  
You make it possible for the Holy Spirit to bring you knowledge and understanding.  
And judgment, sound judgment.  
I feel sorry for that man or woman.  
 Who thinks that going to church is not important?  


  
Glory to God.  
Look at that scripture again, verse 66.  
Let's read it.  
We're gonna read it into the next verse.  
Teach me good judgment and knowledge for I have believed that commandments.  
I have believed that commandments.  
I have believed.  
 Now, teach me good judgment and knowledge.  
Teach me good judgment.  
How to say what I should say and say it rightly.  
When to say it?  
You can say the right thing and say it wrongly and get into trouble.  
This is teach me good judgments.  
Let me judge correctly. 67.  


  
 Before, oh boy.  
Before I was afflicted, I went astray.  
Can you see it?  
Before your trouble began, you already went astray.  
That's why the lashes of life came on your back.  
Look at that.  
Before I was afflicted, I went astray.  
Before I was afflicted, with that cancer, I went astray.  
 Before I was afflicted in my job, I went astray.  
Where did you go astray?  
Before I was afflicted, I went astray.  
But now have I kept that word.  
You see, he's corrected himself.  
But there are those who haven't corrected themselves.  
 They haven't judged rightly.  
They haven't realized that the problem they're having is because they went astray.  
It is before I was afflicted.  
Because when the anointing comes on your life by the presence of the Holy Spirit, you are separated from affliction.  
Bibles is the Son of wickedness shall not afflict Him.  
 And so why would you not find yourself being afflicted because you went astray?  
It's not hard to know when things go terrible for people.  
It's not hard.  
Their language changes.  
You can hear in their language the way they talk.  
Their priorities change.  
They reorder their priorities.  
 And the things of the world, the things of the flesh become that dominant theme.  
That's what they want.  
Glory to God.

 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
This is topical teaching highlight on Christian living.  
The vision is chapter three.  
We will begin with verse  
 verse 18.  
Now, we've got to read it from 17 into 18 to catch the context.  
All right, so we'll go back to 17.  
That Christ may dwell in your hearts about faith and we've got that, that she being rooted and grounded in love, may be able.  
That means if we are rooted and grounded in love, it leads to something.  
It gives us something.  
People who don't work in love, people who are not rooted in love,  
 who are not firm in love, you've got to make up your mind.  
I'm going to walk in love.  
It's a decision you make that no matter what happens, I'm going to walk in love.  
I refuse to be a grudges.  
I refuse to be bitter against anybody.  
I refuse to walk in any kind of hatred.  
I will never dislike anybody.  
You see, grounded in love.  
You've got to make up your mind about such things.  
You refuse to listen to negative things about other people because you are rooted and grounded in love.  
 Confirm in love.  
When you walk in love, you're uncheckable.  
Hallelujah.  
So, this is, being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend.  
See, it gives you spiritual comprehension.  
People who don't walk in love don't have good spiritual comprehension.  
And there are lots of blessings in the love of Christ.  
 Okay, so it's easy.  
Being rooted in kind of love, verse 18, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breath and length and depth and height.  
Can you imagine?  
Look at all the dimensions, how far you can go.  
Your spiritual comprehension becomes so vast, so broad.  
Amazing.  
 And to know what the love of Christ beyond science.  
That's what it says.  
And to know the word is gynusco.  
To know the love of Christ.  
See, that's a revelation knowledge.  
To know the love of Christ, which surpasses  
 So I have Genosco.  
A knowledge that is no studied.  
You know the love of Christ.  
In a manner that surpasses science.  
Oh boy.  
And you go to the next one.  
I love it.  
That you might be filled.  
 See, you need revelation knowledge beyond science, right?  
And now, guess what happens?  
When you walk in love like this, and you have this revelation knowledge of God's love, this is the love of Christ.  
Boy, look at that next one.  
It's too powerful.  
It's too powerful.  
That he might be filled with what?  
 This is real Christianity.  
Filled with all the fullness of God.  
Not some parts of God.  
Glory to God.  
You're still there?  
Filled!  
 Look at that again, that he might be filled with all the fullness of God.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
And lastly,  
 I love this next one.  
You will look at it.  
It's so powerful.  
Verse 20.  
Verse 20.  
Oh boy.  
Wow.  
This is now unto him that is able to do.  
Now look at it.  
God is able to do.  
Is that correct?  
God is able to do.  
So unto him that is able to do.  
Exceeding abundantly above.  
 far beyond is this exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.  
But watch something according to the power that worked in us.  


  
So God's power to do is in me.  
 So I find that even though God can do anything, he wants that power working within me.  
So that I don't become a beggar.  
You see, he doesn't want me begging anybody.  
He doesn't want me begging him.  
You know, some people, they're always like this.  
Their hands are like this to beg.  
Oh, Father, please.  
You know, they're just begging God.  
And God doesn't like it.  
 The power to do is not in heaven.  


  
Either something you will not do for you, you gotta look inside you.  
Look inside you.  
 If you think that God should do something, stretch his hand from heaven to do something, he is not going to do it.  
Now, please understand this.  
You can continue like that.  
If you've been born again for a long time and you expect that God should just answer your prayer because you have not known much.  
No, he's going to ask you to grow up.  
You've got to grow up.  
Learn that he doesn't want you begging.  
Don't beg God.  
He doesn't like it.  
 How would you like your son to come to you in the morning, fall on his knees, and begin to beg you for breakfast?  
Would you like it?  
Is begging you, please give us food.  
Please, Daddy, please give us food.  
Would you like that?  
He's not a slave, is he?  
How would he come begging you like that?  
Please, I know you are my mother.  
Please.  
 Please, do you like that?  
What do you think he likes it?  
Jesus said, if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Heavenly Father give good things to them than I can?

 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
This is topical teaching highlight on Christian living.  
Philippians chapter one from verse one, let's go.  
Paul anti-muthius  
 the servant of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons.  
Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.  
 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you, for you all making requests with joy, and that wonderful making request with joy.  
That's great.  
For your fellowship in the Gospel, from the first day until now, I'm going to break some of that for you a little while later.  
 Look at verse 6, so lovely, being confident of this very thing, that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.  
Even as this means for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart in as much  
 As both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.  
Lovely, lovely, lovely, wonderful.  
For God is my record.  
How greatly along after you all in the boroughs of Jesus Christ.  
 And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgments, that you may approve things that are excellence, that he may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ.  
Being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ onto the glory and praise of God.  
Oh boy.  
 Okay, now let's read that verse from the Amplified Translation.  
Read it for me.  
Wow.  


  
 What are you saying then?  
That your love may abound yet more and more abound to abound.  
Okay?  
More and more in knowledge and in our judgment.  
The word judgment there.  
Better.  
He's talking about discernment.  
Perception.  
Demonstrate your love.  
Copiously.  
 in knowledge and discernment.  
That means that as you live a life of love, walk in love, it must be with the knowledge of God's word in discernment.  
So you see, when we walk in love, we're not stupid.  
Sometimes when people think that when you walk in love,  
 You are a naive, weak, but that's not true.  
Love never makes you naive, never makes you weak.  
But if you don't work in the knowledge of God's Word in discernment, then of course you can be naive.  
 You can be weak.  
And that would not be love.  
Because God's love is with knowledge and discernment.  
And he wants you to act that way more and more, more and more.  
Think about your language.  
How do you talk?  
How do you relate to people?  
What's your communication like?  
 Choose the right words.  
Don't use words that beat down people.  
Don't use words that hurt people.  
See, choose your language.  
Think, what's the best way that I can communicate with this fellow without destroying his self-image?  
Without destroying his personality?  
 without making him feel sorry for himself.  
You know, sometimes there are those who think that if they talk to us and make us feel bad about ourselves, they got a point.  
No.  
No.  
In Christianity, we build the other person correctly.  
We build him.  
We build his self-image.  
We let him know he has value.  
 He's a person.  
He's worth the blood of Christ.  
We don't destroy that personality.  
We're buildings.  
So what if the fellow is this and that doesn't matter?  
That's between him and God.  
 Some people have very terrible language.  
Every time they open them out and talk to somebody, they think, if I talk to you, you'll never forget.  
I like to talk to you in a way you'll never forget the good things I said.  
See, I decided that many, many years ago, what kind of life I wanted to live, what kind of language.  
I can't produce bad language.  
 It can't come out of my system.  
It's not possible.  
No.  
I can't produce such language.  
It can't come out of me.  
 Why?  
Because I put my mind in the Word years ago and began to train my mind to think right.  
You know, I would pray to God.  
I would say, oh Lord, I want to communicate correctly the love of Christ, the grace of Christ.  
Help me do it right.  
Preaching the gospel is not just when you talk to a sinner.  
Preaching the gospel with your life every day.  
 Doesn't matter who you're talking to.  
But gospel is Christ alive in you.  
Christ has come, and Christ is in me now.  
That's the message every day.  
Continually, that's the message.  
Hallelujah.  
So train yourself to say the right thing, to use the right language.  
 The word says be cautious, be pitiful.  
That means be considerate.  
Hallelujah.  
All right, so lift your love abound more and more.  
Glory to God.

Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
 This is topical teaching highlight on Christian living.  
Jesus came as the way to God.  
He is the way, the truth, and the life.  
But He is what He does.  


  
Think about this.  
 He becomes the High Priest and he makes us the way.  


  
How shall that be in the world?  
He becomes the High Priest and we become the way.  
He's gone to heaven.  
He's the High Priest.  
He's made us the way.  
We are the way today.  
 I'll show that to you.  
We are the way to do it.  
And that's why, look at Jesus.  
He came to lead man back to the presence.  
He came to lead man back to the presence.  
In God's presence, there's what?  
Fullness of joy.  
At his right hand, there are pleasures ever more.  
 The Bible says, when he died, we died.  
When he was raised from the dead, we were raised from the dead.  
Now, he's seated in God's heaven, but in the place of power.  
And we are seated together with him.  
So, but we are here in the earth.  
But our authority comes from heaven, right?  
 Okay, so today, what do we do?  
He says, I am the vine.  
He are the branches.  
What does that mean?  
We are bearing the fruits.  
Ah, look at this.  
You understand the fruits.  
Love, weakness, temperance.  
No, those ones are the ones the spirits produces in us.  
They are not the fruits we bear onto him.  
 Are you hearing me?  
We are producing what we call fruits of righteousness.  
Ah, yeah, yeah.  
That's not all.  
That's not all.  
That's just one of them.  
In fact, you know, I was going to the Scriptures and I found 12 of them.  
And I thought 12, 12 different fruits.  
My goodness that we are bearing to the Lord.  
I went over into Revelation.  
I found out the tree of life produced 12 different types of fruits every month.  
12.  
Every month.  


  
 One of them that's very beautiful, the foot of our lips, giving thanks onto his name.  
Giving thanks.  
Thanksgiving is one of the fruits.  
Can you shout amen?  
This is important.  
Think about it.  
We're producing fruit for the king.  
 Yeah.  
Did you know your offerings are part of them?  
Did you know your tithes are part of them?  
Where are your tithes?  
Where are your offerings?  
You have fruit bearing parts.  
He says, I am divine.  
He are the branches.  
Did you know that?  


  
Then think about your confessions.  
Your confessions.  
 They're confessions.  
Glory to God.  
They're producing for every month.  
Thank God we have a monthly communion service where you can review what you've been doing.  
So every month, you can look through your life.

So every month, look through these different types of fruits.  
Are you producing them and get excited?  
Hallelujah.  


  
 No one says the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.  
A tree of life.  


  
You are going from glory to glory.  
Can you shout amen?  
Refused to entertain negative thoughts.  
Are you hearing me?  
One of the things I say that likes to do is to produce fear.  
 to make you feel like things are gonna get harder for you like he owns the world.  
You know, like he owns the world.  
And sometimes you don't realize that you think you're the one thinking.  
No wonder he says, God's your heart with all diligence.  
For out of it are the issues of life.  
God's your heart with all diligence.  
Don't allow just any thought coming.  
Stop the fear.  
 Stop the unbelief!  


  
The more knowledge of negative things you have, the more fear will attack you.  
Because that's his material.  
Listen to the Word of God.  
Listen to the Word of God.  
Play the messages.  
Listen to the Word of God.  
Are you hearing me?  
I've got to listen.  
 I've got to listen, as I'm listening, I'm stretching, I'm all Lord, mama, mama, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey  


  
 Think about it.  
I am the way to the Father's presence.  
Maybe you didn't get it.  
Look at it.  
When the Holy Ghost came and got tabernacles in the quarters of my body, I became God's living tabernacle and God's moving house.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
So the house, I don't just try to drag them to go find the presence of God.  
When I come, the house of God comes.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
 We are the temple of the living God.  
We are the temple.  
 He lives in me, in every fiber of my being, in every bone of my body.  
He dwells in me.  
And I know it.  
The Holy Ghost is in me.  
Oh, blessed be God.  
As a Lord, what can I not do?  
What can I not do?  
All things are possible to Him that believes.  
And that's me.  
I can do all things through Christ that's trained in me.  
 I'm what God says I am.  
I inherit all things.  
I'm a joint heir with Christ.  
Boy, I'm rich.  
Rich.  
Rich.  
And you know what?  
The day you discover that you are the temple of God, you will find that men are bringing all the treasures to the temple of God.  


  
 Because one of the ministries of the temple is to sanctify the gold.  
And they're going to be bringing the gold into the temple.  
This is the house of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 But there must be praise in that temple.  
So you say, Brother, where is your praise?  
I have a way of your praise.  
If you're not praising God, where is that temple there?  
Because in the temple of God, there must be praise.  
There must be joy.  
Say I'm bearing fruits.  
Yeah.  
And joy is one of them.  
The vast presence.
