title: Topical Teaching Highlights on Prayer Part 1
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  
 This is topical teaching highlight on prayer.  
Now when we say a spirit of prayer, I'm not describing necessarily a second angel or spirit whose name is called prayer.  
That's not what I'm saying.  
 But the means when the Holy Spirit of God brings an overwhelming atmosphere and influence of prayer into your life.  
And what happens is you breathe  
 All of that time, and when he does it sometimes stays on you for months.  
He can stay on you for months, he can stay on you for a year, even more.  
He just experienced the spirit of prayer.  
See, that rests on you.  
 And influences you over a period of time.  
Now, does it happen when he chooses to or is there anything we can do about it emphatically?  
Yes.  
It's not just when he chooses to.  
No, it's when you, when you invite by desire, that spirit of prayer, you invite by desire.  
 You know, there are some people who say, well, the problem I have is I'm very lazy to pray.  
This has got nothing to do with being strong or lazy to pray.  
It's a matter of a burden.  
If you have something that disturbs you, you'll pray.  
I think so.  
Yeah, sure.  
When you really want something.  
So in dealing with prayer here, talking about prevailing prayer,  
 One of the things that helps us do is to maintain inspiration.  
In prayer like this, we maintain inspiration.  
If you're not praying, you lose the fevel that follows it.  
The spiritual fevel.  
 the spiritual glow that goes with it.  
There's something about the Word of God that has power.  
See, it's not in the words and how they sound.  
It's not even in the message itself that it communicates.  
No, it's in the power of the Spirit that is wrapped up in it.  
 In Romans 12, chapter 11 verse, yeah, not slotful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.  
That line I want you to see there is fervent in spirit.  
The Mafat translations is maintain the glow.  
Maintain the glow.  
 There's a glow of the Spirit in your life.  
Maintain that glow.  
How are you going to maintain it?  
By remaining in prayer.  


  
 and meditation on the world of God.  
There's something that meditation does for you.  
So when you study the world of God, meditate.  
Meditate on it so it gets into your spirit.  
That means matter it, okay?  
Say it, say it when you read it, when you study, when you hear it, repeat it.  
Repeat it again and again.  
Let it stay in your mind.  
Let it stay in your spirit.  
Let it become a part of you.  
 then the glory of it would show up in you.  
I'd like us to read something, Psalm 86 and verse number 11.  
Read it one to go.  


  
You know what that is?  
That's the next thing that prayer does for you is called focus.  
 in a new national version.  
He says, teach me your way, O Lord.  
And I will walk in your truth.  
Give me an undivided heart.  
An undivided heart.  
That I may fear your name.  
An undivided heart.  
This is what we have when we pray.  
An undivided heart.  
We have focus.  
 See, prayer helps you focus.  
Prayer helps you focus.  


  
Do you maintain a diary of prayer?  
Tribes.  
The things you're concerned about, you like to pray about in your diary, you write down what you're praying about.  
Here's another one.  
Here's another one.  
In prayer.  
 Or, we put it this way, it's more of a responsibility, a leadership responsibility, and that is praying for the spiritual growth of others, praying for the spiritual growth of your brethren, okay?  
Of your members, praying for their spiritual growth.  
I want to show you how to do that prayer.  
It's so important, it must mean a lot to you.  
 And if you deem yourself to even be at that level where you require that prayer yourself, you can pray for yourself because it's the Spirit's prayer.  
Okay, now let's go to Colossians in chapter number one.  
 So he says, for this course we also see as the day we've heard it, do not cease to pray for you and the desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will.  
Be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
See, you pray for your members that they may be filled with the knowledge of God's will.  
So when they don't know God's will, they do a lot of stupid things, a lot of dumb things, and they stray away from God.  
 So we must pray for them like this.  
 Let me read that in a newer version for you.  
Here in the ANIVs, this for this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of His will through our spiritual wisdom and understanding.  
And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please Him in every way, bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 And it's not over yet, in the 11th verse, something really beautiful.  
He says, train things with miracle work and ability.  
That's what it means all night.  
According to his glorious power, on all patience and long suffering with joyfulness, giving thanks.  
Hallelujah.  
 See, you're doing all of that, giving things.  
Giving things on to the Father, which had made us meet, be partakers of the inheritance and saints in the kingdom of light.  
Amen.  
So you pray with these scriptures.  
You pray with these scriptures for them.  
I'll show you another one.  
By the way, did you notice the  
 continuous term that he uses in his prayers.  
It's not something they prayed.  
It's something we pray.  
He says, we pray for you.  
See, they pray.  
And this they prayed always for them.  
Since the day we heard it, we have not ceased to pray.  
That's what he said.  
That this and this and this will happen for you.  
 Since the day we heard about you, we haven't seized a prayer.  
So you don't just braid 15 minutes and get up and seize all over.  
Now you're gonna braid again.  
Let me show you another prayer.  
You see this man braid, braid for the church.  
 This is the way we should pray for the church.  
And I said, you can pray this prayer for yourself.  
I did pray this prayer for me.  
I read them like that then, and I'll put my name in there.  
And I'll pray them for others, but I'll pray them for me too.  
Make sure you're not the one.  
Ephesians chapter one.  
And this time I'm reading from verse 15.  
 This is where for I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love on all the saints, sees not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers.  
See, I said it's not something he prayed just one day and stopped.  
He had been at it, watching for the result as he prayed in expectation.  
So I prayed like that, putting myself in the scripture for a long time.  
 Let me read it to you in the Amplified.  
It'll bless you.  
It'll bless you.  
Glory to God.  
So give you a little more light on this prayer in what it means.  
Glory to God.  
16, I do not cease to give thanks for you.  
Say, I do not cease to give thanks.  
Say, I will not cease now.  
 So he says, how do not Caesar give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, for I always pray to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that he may grant you.  
Did you see that?  
I always pray.  
To the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that he may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation, because it's of insight into mysteries and secrets.  
 in the deep and intimate knowledge of him by having the eyes of your heart flooded with light.  


  
If this happened to somebody who will become of that guy, who had not been coming to church, when the light of God floods his heart, there will be a change.  
So this is the scripture that happened to me.  
 And that's what happened to many of you.  
The eyes of your heart, the eyes of your spirits became flooded with light.  
He granted you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the epic gnosis of hell.  
Hallelujah.  
Yeah.

 This is topical teaching highlight on prayer.  
First Timothy 2-8, I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands.  
Get more insight about prayer as Pastor Chris teaching on the subject of prayer and its practicality.  
Be inspired as you want.  
See, our prayer doesn't change God.  
 But our prayer makes it consistent for God to do whatever he would want to do, which it was inconsistent for him to do, had we not prayed.  
See, the Holy Spirit needs me to pray through me.  
He does not pray by himself.  
 See, when he wants to pray about things that concern me, he needs me.  
He needs my mouth.  
He needs my body.  
And I've got to be yielded to him.  
You know, that's why a lot of things happen to Christians, and they wonder why?  
You don't hear that to the Holy Spirit, to use you, pray through you.  
He doesn't pray for you on his own.  
He needs somebody.  
He needs the human body, the human mouth, to speak through.  
 Because that prayer must be offered in the earth by a human being and forgot to answer it.  
He will not answer the prayer of spirits without bodies.  
Your body is your right to the earth.  
A spirit that has no body has no right to be in the earth.  
Therefore, his prayer is not heard.  
That's very important, never forget it.  
 And so you need to heal yourself.  
When you're going through difficulties, when you're going through challenges in your life, you say, Holy Spirit, use me to pray accurately because I know not what to pray for as I watch.  
See?  
And then don't keep quiet because it needs to use your mouth.  
If you keep quiet, nothing will come out.  
You have to pray.  
So you start with tongues.  
 You start praying in tongues.  
As you pray in tongues, sing and worship Him.  
Thank Him, glorify His name.  
Speak in tongues, speak in tongues, speak in tongues.  
Then you must focus your mind.  
You see, there are too many people who don't know the importance of the mind.  
The mind is a massive tool for our benefit.  
That mind is like the rudder that directs the ship  
 See, for your spirit, your mind is so important.  
If you turn your mind away from what you're supposed to be focusing on, your feeling will die.  
Can you see that?  
For whatever it is, your emotions for it, you need your emotions, your feelings, everything must come together and your mind is responsible for doing that.  
So you start by channeling your mind,  
 to your purpose, you set your mind, your mind helps you channel all the forces of your spirits in the direction of that focus.  
So you use your mind, you set your mind.  
I hear me, he says, thou will keep him in perfect peace.  
That means shalom, shalom, peace, peace.  
Whose mind is stayed on thee for he's trusted indeed.  
So God's gonna keep him in perfect peace, the peace of prosperity.  
 The man whose mind is focused on him.  
So you have to focus your mind.  
Some people are fasting and instead of focusing their mind during their fast, they are thinking about everything else.  
That fast is useless.  
You see, why?  
Because the Spirit was not coordinated towards that goal and purpose.  
 See, but if your mind is disciplined, you use your mind to direct yourself, your mind, you need it.  
So you focus it, you focus your mind.  
Now, if your mind proves a little difficult by going this way and that way, there's another tool that has power over the mind.  
It is your talk.  
 You see, if your mind is throwing this way and that way, you start talking in the direction of what you want and your mind will be focused in the direction you want to go.  
Booker James chapter number five.  
Chapter five and verse 16.  
 He says, confess to one another, therefore your thoughts, your slips, your footsteps, your offenses, your sins, and pray also for one another that you may be healed and restored to a spiritual tone of mind and hurt.  
The inest, heartfelt, see what I mean?  
It's got to get into your emotion, heartfelt.  
You see, the inest, heartfelt, continued.  
 It's not something just for us to save Him in Jesus' name and go.  
No!  
It's continued your pressing, your pressing.  
Continued prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available dynamic in its working.  
It makes tremendous power available dynamic in its working.  
That means that prayer is dynamite.  
 Satan can't stand it.  
There are certain things that must happen.  
There are certain things that we gain from our prayer like this.  
Hallelujah.  
 Prayer helps us come into the fullness of the Spirit.  
That's number one.  
Prayer helps us come into the fullness of the Spirit.  
In Acts 4 verse 31, we read it.  
He said that when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.  
When they prayed, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.  
When they prayed, they were filled.  
When they prayed, they were filled.  
When we prayed, we are filled.  
Hallelujah.  
 There are meetings where you know that something needs to change.  
And you call the whole cell, the whole church.  
So we are praying today.  
We are praying today.  
We are praying today.  
And everybody comes and we pray.  
If by the time we are in the service, we haven't received a note of victory.  
And we haven't received a word of prophecy that several of us can confirm is so.  
We are joined.  
 Till next time, we are joining the meeting now until we come again.  
So we are meeting again so and so today.  
We come back for prayer and we pray until we have that victory in our spirits.  
Why do many Christian businesses fail?  
Because they don't understand this.  
They don't understand this.  
 They don't know that there's such a thing as prevailing prayer.  
The other thing that we get as we pray is guidance.  
We read it in Acts chapter 13.  
It says, as the minister to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost gave guidance.  
Remember that?  
That's the second verse of Acts chapter 13.  
And when we pray, we  
 in a seed for the lost in prayer.  
Let me give you some scriptures that are very important for us to consider.  
Isaiah chapter 66 verse 8.  


  
For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.  
 As soon as Zion travels, if it's as soon as Zion confessed, as soon as Zion claimed, travel!  


  
That's what we call soul travel.  
In birth, you want to bring forth muscles.  
Spirit your travel in prayer.  
 Until you know that, you're not ready yet.  
You can have what you call many coming and many going, not children.  
You can have visitors to church who come in and enjoy the message and they'll go away.  
But you want to have children?  
You're going to have to travel.  
Look at it.  
It says, for as soon as Zion traveled, she brought forth her children.  
As soon as Zion traveled, not before Zion traveled,  
 as soon as sign traffic.  
So ask, ask.  
Pastore, Mrs. Pastore, where was the last time you wept for souls?  
When was the last time you wept?  
When was the last time?  
Or are you whipping that you don't like the way they're treating you?  
Where was the last time you wept?  
 For souls, maybe those who are backslading from the church, and you have not found them.  
What was the last time your eyes were turned?  


  
If it is too long ago, you need to pray.  
First, that God should forgive you.  
That something that is so important became so light in your heart.  


  
 I cry almost every day.  
Almost every day.  
Not because I want to cry.  
 Not like I just said, no, no, I'm going to cry now.  
If that's when the case, I would have even liked it.  
But it's not so it doesn't happen that way.  
It's like saying, I want to feel hot now.  
You can feel hot now.  
The circumstances must create that heat.  
You understand?  
Uh-huh.  
So it's my heart.  
As I set my heart on the things of God, and as I set my heart on the things happening in our world, and what we have to do, and the power of the gospel, all of these things, as I set my heart,  
 Those emotions just, you know, get arrested.  
And the next day, I'm vibrating there, you know, with tears, and I'm praying, with tears.  
And it happens to me every so often.  
But that is the ministry of the Spirit.  
I know that it's the Holy Ghost that is costing it to happen in me.  
 And so he causes me to pray as I should pray in a way that can affect other people.  
And then he also gives me the means to prosecute his cause.  
 And then you find miracles are happening, great things are happening.  
God is supplying all that is necessary to make it happen.  
Why?  
Because the Holy Spirit can channel His thoughts, channel His emotions to me.  
He says likewise, the Spirit helped with our infirmities.  
He says, haven't you seen it?  
Romans chapter 8 verse 26.  
 See, you'll have to let the Holy Ghost minister through you.  
Carry out his ministry of intercession through you.  
You have to yield yourself for the Holy Spirit to work through you, pray through you.  
He wants to.  
He wants to.  
He wants to pray through you so that the Father would respond accordingly because only the Holy Spirit can pray accurately.  
We don't have the best words to pray as we should.  
 But the Holy Ghost knows what to do.  
He knows what to do.  
Hallelujah.

Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
 This is topical teaching highlight.  
First Corinthians chapter 14, from verse 4, he that speak it in an unknown tongue edifies himself.  
 But either prophesied, edified the church.  
When we prophesied, we are speaking for God's message in a non-language for the church to benefit.  
But then when we speak in tongues, we may not understand what we are saying.  
What are verse two?  
The same book, the same chapter, verse two.  
 For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God, for no man understandeth him.  
How be it?  
In the spirit, he speaketh what?  
Mysteries.  
Mysteries.  
When you speak in tongues, you bring forth mysteries.  
Mysteries about your future.  
Mysteries about the work that God has given you.  
You speak mysteries.  
 And until those mysteries are brought into this world, they may never happen.  
And that's why he told us that the one who speaks in tongues, you pray that he might interpret.  
Because there are mysteries being spoken.  
And if they're not brought into the understand, then you may never walk in the light of those mysteries of God.  
Because they are hidden wisdom.  
 You are praying about your church growth.  
You're praying about the success of the ministry in that city, in that country.  
Then God, if you pray in tongues, the Spirit of God will bring the mysteries, the things you need.  
He will bring them to your spirit, but they might be spoken in tongues.  
But you need to bring them.  
And then when you speak in tongues, He also gives that ability to interpret.  
 You must pray in tongues.  
There are no shortcuts.  
There are no shortcuts.  
Speaking in tongues is the language of angels.  
It's a language.  
It's a language.  
And so when you pray in tongues.  
First Corinthians chapter 14, good verse 13.  
Let me read something to you from verse 13.  
 We're for letting that speak in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.  
Have you seen that?  
Uh-huh.  
Next verse.  
For if I pray in an unknown tongue, if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.  
You see, that's how to pray in the spirit.  
You pray in tongues.  
But your mind doesn't know what you're saying.  
That's what we read in verse two of the same book and the same chapter.  
 He says, no man understands, but in the spirit he speaks mistress.  
So he says, if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit pray it.  
But my understanding is unfruitful.  
If you don't pray in tongues, there are things that should happen for you that will never happen until you pray in tongues.  
Listen, why it's so important that you pray in tongues?  
Human prayer with human language cannot go far enough.  
Your human language is corrupted.  
 and therefore will not appeal to a Holy God.  
You have to understand that.  
So it gives us a spiritual language to communicate at the highest level.  
What you cannot say with human words, you can say in tongues.  
And the Holy Spirit, the Bible says the Holy Spirit gives you the utterance, which means you don't choose the words by yourself.  
The Holy Spirit chooses the best words.  
To appeal you to the mind of God.  
 So when you are praying, Tom, see you are praying the highest kind of prayer.  
You are praying the holiest kind of prayer.  
Growning in the Spirit.  
Does it just happen?  
Do we just say, okay, you know, maximize it?  
Oh, we told the congregation to get up and let's all start growing in the Spirit.  
Well, that's not going to work like that because it says the Spirit help us.  
 The Spirit, so it is initiated by the Spirit.  
But do we have any role to play, empirically?  
Yes.  
And I'll show that to you.  
So that you don't sit down there and say, well, you know, I thought that if the Holy Spirit is ready, He would make me grow in the Spirit.  
No, there are things you must do.  
 You know, the fire has to be set inside you.  
Inside you.  
It will not come.  
Don't say, oh God, bring the fire.  
No, stay up yourself.  
It's about desire.  
What do you really want?  
We are told that that woman that had the issue of blood, who was suffering from hemorrhage for 12 years,  
 She had suffered all... For so long, the Bible says she has spent all her living on doctors and never grew better.  
She rather grew worse than the Bible says when she heard of Jesus.  
She said to herself, if I may but taught the hem of his garment, I shall be home.  
Did she stay where she was?  
No!  
She acted her face.  
She went.  
Because her desire to be healed was very strong.  
 If your desire for a change is strong, you will see it.  
But when your desire for a change is not strong, you will not do anything about it.  
The question is, how strong is your desire?  
How strong is your desire to see real growth?  
How strong is your desire to see real growth?  
How strong is it?  
 Baba says that a million soldiers came out against Judah, and Asa cried to God.  
He said, we have no might against this multitude.  
The Ethiopians, the Lebeams, they came out against you.  
Baba says he cried to God.  
And the Lord responded and acted on his behalf.  
 You read that so many times in the Bible.  
Victory after victory.  
Victory after victory.  
Victory after victory.  
What could be done to us?  
To keep us away from victory and success?  
What is it?  
Where can they take us?  
The deepest dungeon.  
The highest heights.  
It doesn't matter where.  
 When we pray from that situation, when we pray, God hears.  
Hallelujah.  
He hears.  
He says, when the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth.  
But you haven't saturated your clouds yet.  
How do you saturate the clouds with your tears?  
With your praying.  


  
 When it's time to pray, you wake up, you're feeling sleepy.  
But there's a job that needs to be done.  
There's a challenge.  
You see, something's got to happen.  
And so even though you are tired, you're woken up, ah, because of your needs, because of the desire.  
You get up.  
It's raining, it's cold, but you're going to pray.  
There are many things some of us set to in many years.  
 It's the one we just walked through.  
We know we've taken care of those things.  
I tell people there are deposits of prayer you have to make for your future.  
But if you have not made those deposits, where do you want to draw for?  
How do you want to draw for?  
Because you want a real ministry.  
 A real ministry, the ministry of the Holy Ghost.  
Then you find that when you are talking, God is talking.  
See, when you stretch what your hand is, the hand of God.  
When you look, it's God seeing through your eyes.  
Then you start understanding.  
Yeah, you have moved to another level.  
You are watching typical teaching highlight.  


  
 What could be done to us to keep us away from victory and success?  
Where can they hide us?  
The deepest dungeon?  
The highest heights.

This is topical teaching highlight.  
Romans chapter 8 from verse 26  


  
 It is likewise the Spirit also help us our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought.  
See, we don't know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit  
 or King James translation itself.  
It's supposed to read himself, okay?  
Because the Holy Ghost is a person.  
But the Spirit himself may get in a session for us with groanings.  
You see, the victim, the Spirit also help us, help us, our infirmities.  
The right arrangement is, the Spirit bears us up.  
You see, he props us.  
 Like you're speaking in tongues like you're trying to get up, okay?  
Speaking in tongues, speaking in tongues, when the Holy Ghost props you up.  
He helps you.  
There are limitations.  
There are infirmities, weaknesses.  
You don't know what to pray for about this situation.  
And so the Holy Spirit takes over the prayer  
 That's what he says.  
There's the one your spirit is praying.  
Your spirit is praying in tongues.  
He says, if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prates.  
But my understanding is unfruitful.  
My spirit prates.  
You remember that?  
My spirit prates.  
 So it's your spirit that prays in tongues, even though the language is granted your spirit by the Holy Ghost.  
In this one, it's not your spirit that's praying anymore.  
Look at it.  
Likewise, the spirit also helped with our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we are, but the spirit himself make it in a session for us!  
 He's doing the prayer now.  
With what?  
Grownings, which cannot be uttered.  
You see, at that moment, you've been speaking in tongue, your spirit's been praying, you come to this level, the Holy Ghost takes over, and now you don't, it's no longer tongues.  
It's all deep size and groans.  
As though you're crying, you don't know why you're crying, and you're, oh, oh, oh, oh, you can't even stop it.  
No words have been formed.  
 And all you got is deep-sized and gross.  
You even have to hold your stomach.  
You don't know why tears coming out.  
There's no pain, but this crying wouldn't stop.  
Why?  
The spirit himself may get in the session for us with groanings.  
He's taken over the prayer because you don't know what to pray for as you ought.  


  
 This is the highest kind of prayer.  
And how little many Christians understand this.  
Some can live a whole year without having this experience.  
Because they don't yield themselves to the Holy Ghost.  


  
 Some are afraid of it because they don't know it.  
It's every time I try to pray.  
I find myself shaking and crying, so I don't pray, like, I don't pray far anymore once.  
I just say, Father, in Jesus' name, the most God-man was devil, living.  
And I run away.  


  
Well, this is the highest kind of prayer.  
 When you pray like this, you know you're settling things for the future.  
Oh God, Kiparando go so predella.  


  
You pray like that, you'll be amazed at your life.  
I tell people, I'll always be successful.  
I'll always be.  
 certain Christians have come to a point in their lives who is like there's no more progress.  
They've tried and tried and tried, but no progress.  
They've done everything they know to do.  
Then, frustration sets in.  
They're now being worn out because they prayed and prayed and prayed.  
It didn't work.  
They fasted and fasted and fasted.  
There was no change.  
 The prophesied there was no change.  
Professors were given over them.  
There was no change.  
And now they're wondering, can these bones leave?  


  
I'm showing you a better way.  
There's a higher law.  


  
When there's any issue,  
 Do you remember that also?  
Take it to the Lord in prayer.  
That's what you do.  
In prayer.  
In prayer.  
Don't let the matter take your attention and keep thinking what to do.  
Think, think, think, think, think, think, think.  
One minute to the Holy Ghost.  
 who make a difference.  
Five hours trying to think and all you get is worry-looking face.  
Only you, you are the only one there.  
Then you have lines here.  
 Worried, and then fear would join.  
You know, when worry is there and fear has joined.  
So there's fear, insecurity.  
There's worry, economy.  
Now, then there's hatred, your neighbors, coworkers.  
So it's like you're surrounded with trouble.  
 If you're thinking about that, your life changes.  
Every day you're either walking fast, looking around.  
What life will you live like this?  
I'm full of joy.  


  
 Let's go back to that scripture.  
I want to show you something more.  
Let's go back there.  
Romans chapter eight.  
Is this likewise the Spirit also help at our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we act, but the Spirit himself make it in a session for us with growing sweets cannot be uttered.  
Verse 27, we get it now.  
And he that's such at the heart.  
That's the Father.  
 The Father.  
He's the one who searches the hearts, says, and he that's searching the hearts, knows what is the mind of the Spirit.  
You see, you don't know because the coming has grownings that cannot be uttered.  
 But it says, God the Father, who searches the hearts, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He makes an intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  
He makes an intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  
Perfect prayer.  
Perfect prayer.  
And when this happens, look at the next verse.  
And we know.  
 that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who add the card according to his fevers.  
See how it works?  
When the Holy Ghost takes Alma like that and in a seed for you, you know that all things work together for good.  
 For good.  
No matter what the experience is, all things work together for good.  
Then you start saying it's for my good.  
Oh, go read a guide.  
It's for my good.  
You find you cannot be disadvantaged.  
It's for my good.  
You know, you can talk like this in the church.  
You come out Monday morning and if you had a job, you could have a sack letter.  
 And how do you deal with that?  
You just got a prophecy in church and then you come out Monday morning and they tell you, you lost your job.  
What you do, all things work together for good.  
To them the love God.  
To them who I have called according to his purpose.  
Then you say, I am not moved.  


  
 It come out in high-fiving others and say, it's for my God.  
It's for my God.  
I know it's for my God.  
Let's say, how do you know?  
You say, look at it.  
Romans 8 verse 28.  
Hallelujah.  
It's for my God.  


  
 Go ahead.  
High five.  
Come on, high five.  
It's for my good brother.  
It's for my good sister.  
It's for my good.

Sound waves are the essence of life, the heartbeat of creation, the very beginning of all.

 The flapping of a hummingbird.
