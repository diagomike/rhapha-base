title: Day 4 â€“ This is the Year of Lights
---
 This is 2019, the year of lights.  


  
I told you, I told you in December, you are going to shine ever so brightly, ever so brightly.  


  
 It is the year of lights.  
There are different kinds of lights.  
Some are for illumination, some are for leadership, guidance, some are for empowerment, some are for signs and wonders, signs and seasons.  


  
What's about to happen through the Church of Jesus Christ?  
 The Bible tells us, as the days get closer and closer to the return of Jesus Christ, gross darkness will cover the earth.  
He says, think darkness will cover the earth.  
He's talking about spiritual darkness.  
He says, but in the midst of this, your light will so shine.  
 The darker the darkness, the more brightly you shine.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
Sit down for a second.
