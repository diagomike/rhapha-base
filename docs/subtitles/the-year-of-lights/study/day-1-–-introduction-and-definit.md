title: Day 1 â€“ Introduction and Definition of Light
---
 I'll begin with a few verses that you are very much acquainted with.  


  
First, Epistle of Saint John chapter 1 and verse number 5.  


  
 First, a piece of Saint John chapter one and verse number five.  
Read it for me, want to go.  


  
One more time.  


  
 What did he say about God?  
He says that God is light, and in him there's no darkness at all.  
John chapter 9, St.  
John's Gospel chapter 9 and verse number 5.  


  
And I want you  
 To read that together.  


  
Who is this?  
Okay, just in case you want to know, I was talking verse three, same book and same chapter.  
 Jesus answered, neither have this man sent nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.  
I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day, the night cometh, when no man can work.  
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."  
Samadhi's Gospel, chapter 5.  
 I want you to read verse number 14.  
This is the other light of the world, a city that is set on the hill cannot be hit.  
Praise God.  
And I'm thinking  
 This is so powerful.  
God said that He is light.  
This is what His Word is telling us.  
Because Jesus said it, as long as I am in the Word, I am the light of the Word.  
And I want you to think about the audacity.  
 with which he made such a powerful statement.  
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.  
Now why did he say that?  
Because he had healed a man that was born blind.  
The man was blind.  
And a blind man can only see darkness.  
 So Jesus says, as long as I mean the word, I am the light of the word, and heal the man.  
But we read in 1 John chapter 1 and verse number 5, where he says, God is light.  
In him is no darkness at all.  
We come to the third verse that you read, and it's in Matthew's Gospel chapter 5 and verse number 14.  
Jesus said, he had the light of the word.  
That should make us think.  
 What does it mean?  
If God is light, and Jesus is light, and it says, you are light.  
What's light then?  
I think the best definition of light comes from the Bible.  


  
You can see beautiful definitions in physics,  
 But the simplest and best definition of light comes from the Bible.  
It's very simple.  


  
Glory to God.  
And so I'm going to share just a few of that with you.  
Can you turn to the book of Psalms 119 and verse number 105?  


  
 Read.  


  
The word is what?  
God's word is a lamp.  
It's a lamp.  
His word is a lamp, and then he says what?  
It's a light.  
That's powerful.  
 What is light?  
In Ephesians 5, I want you to read verse number 13.  


  
Really like you can see it.  


  
That's the definition of light.  
It's right there.  
 So what is light?  
That which makes manifest.  
That is light.
