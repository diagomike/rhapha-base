title: Day 7 â€“ Overcome Evil with Good
---
 Philippians chapter 2, go to verse 15.  
Oh, this is lovely.  
Read it for me.  


  
 that he may be blameless and hamless.  
The sons of God, without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation or nation.  
Amongumi, look at that.  
Amongumi, what?  
Ask what?  
You shine as lights in the world.  
As lights.  


  
 then talk with your dacity of Jesus.  
I am the light of the world.  
Say, as long as I'm in the world, I am the light of the world.  
Hallelujah.  
Romans 12.  
And I want you to read verse 21.  
Read for me.  


  
 you have to begin to trust more than ever before the power of good over evil.  
You know, there are more people who are afraid of evil than they have respect for good because they have heard so much about evil that they fear evil and they have no  
 They have no reverence for good.  
They have no fear is somewhat negative.  
But let's begin a reverential fear for good.  
They have no respect for good.  
They fear evil.  
 I have to tell you about this beautiful situation that gave me some understanding how people think about God and about the devil.  
So I was praying for somebody, and I said, say this after me.  
Lord Jesus, and he went to Lord Jesus, and we went through all that.  
Then I said, now, say, say then?  
Ah!  
He opened his eyes like, ah!  
 He was unwilling to say that.  
He feared Satan.  
He called God.  
He called Jesus.  
But when I said, say that, he said, ah.  
He had more respect for Satan than he had for God without realizing it.  
People fear evil.  
But we have to understand that evil doesn't have as much power as good.  
 It never has.  
It cannot.  
Evil doesn't have more power than good.  
And look what God tells us.  
In the verse he just read, verse 21, chapter 12, book of Romans, read it again, one to go.  
 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.  
Love is greater and stronger than hate.  
If they can hate this much, you can love this much.  
Thank you, my sister, you heard it.  
Are you hearing me?  
He's told us overcome evil with good.  
 The more evil they do, whoever they are, the more good you respond with.  
You will always win.  
Tell somebody you always win.  
Good has more power than evil.  
Do you realize one of the reasons young people go into evil things is because they think you can really become a hero  
 with evil.  
They think good is weak.  
And they don't like to be weak.  
So it's better to be the ringleader of a bad gang to arise in people in the neighborhood than it is to be doing good things, helping people.  
Doing the right thing.  
No, no, no, no.  
They think that's weak.  
 Because I think it's great to dress roughly and work roughly.  
I'll tell you what happened one night, many years ago.  
I was coming from one of the places I went to preach.  
I'm a teenager and I'm going back home.  
It's late in the night.  
And only few people in the street.  
 So I'm coming and walking fast, trying to get home.  
I see some guys coming ahead of me.  
So I thought to myself real quick.  
Now, if they think I'm some nice guy coming from somewhere, they might just be bad.  
And mistreat me.  
If I behave like some rough guy, they're going to find their way.  
So I changed where I was walking.  
I was coming rough.  
 Like no man's business.  
So, when they got close to where I was, they left the lane for me.  
They thought, let this mad guy go.  
You see, because people fear evil.  
They have no respect for good.  
Are you still there?  
But in 2019, Mando Grakala had a little bit of style.  
Rika Raba Sandorabohaya.  
 The Bible says, don't be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.  
Why did God say so?  
Because he knows you can.  
He knows you can.  
He knows there's power with good, and that evil is weak.  
Evil is weak.  
 Only a weak man carries a weapon to fight an unarmed person like him.  
He's a weak man.  
So he needs some weapon to terrorize someone like him who is unarmed.  
It's a shame.  
It's a testimony of weakness.  
When you hold a gun against someone who is not armed and you tell him you want his car, you're a weak man.
