title: Day 6 â€“ Children of Light
---
 Would you turn very quickly to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse number 5.  


  
Read, want to go.  
He are the children of light.  
Uh-oh.  
 Some of you are the children of light.  
Some powerful Christians are children of light.  
Some light-skinned Christians are children of light.  
What does it say?  
Hear all the children of light.  
It's talking to Christians, if you're not born again, talking to you.  
Hear all the children of light and the children of the day.  
 Oh, I love this.  
We are not of the night, nor of darkness.  
Therefore, let us not sleep as do others.  
But let us watch and be sober.  
For there that sleep, you see Pastor, that's what he says, there that sleep sleep in the night.  
But watch, watch, watch.  
He says we are not of the night.  
We are of the day.  
 Look at it.  
Therefore, let us not sleep as do others.  
But let us watch and be sober.  
Verse 5, all the children of light and the children of the day, we are not of the night, nor of darkness.  
It says, for they that sleep, sleep in the night, and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.  
Okay.  
Did you get it now?  
Yes.  
But we are children of  
 of what?  
Light.  
If you are a child of a dog, you are a dog.  
If you are the child of a cat, you are a cat.  
No doubt.  
If you are the child of a chicken, you are a chicken.  
Right?  
If you are the child of light, what are you?  
 All right?  
Just in case, just in case you think we're just adding two and two to make four.  
No, we're not adding.  
We're saying exactly what the word says.  
Efficient's chapter five.  
Are you there?  
All right, let's read.  


  
Verse eight.  
Read for me.  
Want to go.  


  
 Now, are you what?  
Because it says what?  
You are children of light.  
Look at it.  
Read it from the NIV.  
Because of that sometimes.  
I know King James' language can be a little problematic.  
Read, want to go.  


  
 You were one's darkness.  
Before you were born again, you were darkness.  
Isn't it interesting?  
He didn't say you were in the darkness.  
He says you were darkness.  
I want you to understand God's language and his perception of us.  
 He says, you wear darkness.  
You wear one's darkness.  
I'll show you another portion in a moment so you understand that.  
He says, you wear one's darkness, but now you are light.  
Like Jesus, I am the light of the world.  
Now he says, you are light.  
So he says, walk, live as children of light.  
Live as light, illuminating.  
Did you hear what I just said?  
 You are what?  
Illuminating!  
Leading!  
Empowering!  
And in for signs and seasons.
