title: Day 3 - Light Gives Empowerment,  Signs and Seasons Part 2
---
 What does it mean that you're for signs and seasons?  
Oh dear, oh dear.  
All right, St.  
Luke's Gospel.  
Chapter 10, let's read verse five.  
When you enter, all right, let's read the King James then.  
And into whatsoever house he enter, oh, look how Jesus, how Jesus guides.  
He even tells them what to say.  
 and how to say it.  
He says, and into whatsoever house he enters, first say, first say, peace be to this house.  
What does that mean?  
You are bringing to that house a season of peace.  
 Whether I've been in trouble, whether I've been in crisis, whether I've been turmoil.  
When you say peace, it means you are bringing a new season.  
I bring you a season of peace in your life.  
You may have been troubled in your life.  
You may have been in darkness, in problems, crying, having tears and pain, but I bring you a new season in your life.  
He says, first say, peace.  
 Peace be unto this house.  
I bring you a season of old man to Karabasaya.  
We are for signs and seasons.  
Can you shout amen to somebody?  
Look at verse 6, verse 6.  
And if the son of peace be there,  
 Oh, I like this.  
And to explain this to you, it's so powerful.  
And if the son of peace be there, your peace, your peace shall rest.  
But your peace, how could you have peace?  
Because you are the light of the world.  
You are for signs and seasons.  
 Did you notice he didn't say you pray for peace to be upon them?  
No, he says in your peace, you came with peace.  
Your peace shall rest upon that house.  
Because light is for signs and seasons.  
You are bringing the season of peace.  
 Now can you imagine throughout 2019, every home you go to, you carry a season with you.  
You are bringing changes, you are bringing peace, you are bringing love, a season of love, a season of victory.  
Can you shout amen to somebody?  
What a life.  
 Look at verse 9, verse 9, Jesus still talking, look at verse 9.  
And then he says, and heal the sick that are there.  
Ah, it's season of health.  
They've been sick, they've been in pain.  
This is in the last few months, this is what we've been going through.  
In the last few days, this is what we've been going through.  
 And now you come, and you say, peace be upon this house.  
Then he says, heal the sick that are there.  
Did you notice he didn't say, pray for the sick?  
He said, heal the sick that are there.  
He says, your peace, your peace, you are rest upon them.  
Heal the sick that are there.  
I come with a season of healing.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.  
 What a year, what a year, what a year.  
What a year.  
We are for signs and seasons.  
Can you shout amen something about it?  
Signs and seasons.  
Say, I know who I am.
