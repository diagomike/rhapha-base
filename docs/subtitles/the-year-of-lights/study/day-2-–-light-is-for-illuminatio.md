title: Day 2 â€“ Light is for Illumination and Leadership
---
 in Genesis, let's begin with Genesis, Genesis chapter 1 and verse 14.  
Read for me.  


  
 God said, let them be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years.  
That's powerful.  
That's really powerful.  
John, chapter 1.  
St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 1.  
Now I want you to read verse 9.  


  
 One more time.  
That was the true light.  
The true light, God's Word, the true light that illuminates everyone, every man that comes into the world.  
Four important things the Bible shows us about light.  
 Number one, light is for elimination.  
Elimination.  
And elimination produces what?  
Clarity.  
Refinement.  


  
Innovation.  
 Sound judgment.  


  
Elimination.  
When you're illuminated, you have clarity.  
You have clarity.  
Refinement.  
You have innovation.  
You have sound judgment.  
 Praise God.  
Number two, light gives leadership.  
I want you to go to Daniel chapter 12, and let's read from verse number three.  


  
 Are you there?  
And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.  
Now, this is so powerful.  
Look at it.  
They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament.  
 And they that turn many to righteousness as the stars.  
That means they shall shine as the stars.  
They shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and they shall shine as the stars forever and ever.  
They that be wise says, shall shine.  
Now, the word that's translated, shine here in the Hebrew, is zahal.  
 And it means to admonish, to one, to teach.  
Can you imagine that?  
To inspire, to send out light.  
Oh, that is leadership.  
That's leadership.  
So light gives what?  
Leadership.  
Light gives guidance.  
Guidance.  
It gives guidance.  
 You remember the star that led the wise men to where Jesus was.  
You remember that?  
When they learned that a king had been born, they said, we have seen his star, and we have come to worship you.  
They saw he's star in the east, but when they got to Jerusalem, they didn't find any star.  
The star disappeared.  
 until Herod gave them instructions to go to Bethlehem.  
But the baby was no longer in Bethlehem, and the star showed up and led them to where the baby was.  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
John chapter 8 and verse 12.  
St.  
John's Gospel chapter 8 and verse number 12.  


  
 Read for me.  


  
Yes.  
I am the light of the world.  
He that follows me.  
 He that follows the light, the light leads, the light guides.  
Praise God.  
He that follows the light shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of light.  
Just I am the light of the world.  
You follow me, you follow the light.  
The light will lead you.  
The light will guide you.  
Praise God.  
Somebody who's gospel chapter 28 and verse number 19.  


  
 He says, go ye therefore and teach our nations.  
I told you when he says, they that be wise shall shine.  
The words translated from Zaha'a, which means also to teach.  
So he says, go ye therefore and teach our nations.  
Jesus is saying, go ye therefore and shine to our nations.  
Go and shine to our nations.  
 admonish all nations, inspire all nations.  
Wow.  
Wow.
