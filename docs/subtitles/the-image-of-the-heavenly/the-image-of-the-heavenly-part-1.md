title: The Image of the Heavenly Part 1
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirit.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 You are shining and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 I perceive that this bit of God wants me to impress these truths to your partners.  
You've got to look into your spirit for the future.  
Now that you're born again, what can your spirit do?  
What can you do?  
What's inside the package?  
Not later.  
Not when we get to heaven.  
 Now, in this time, he gave us the authority.  
He sat down.  
We are in his place today as he is.  
So are we in this world!  
Glory to God!  
My reflection is for the glory of God.  
That means I am the glory of God.  
Hallelujah.  
That's my name.  
I want to look at something.  
I told you're going to move to a new level today, right?  
 Are you ready for it?  
I want to look at the image of the heavenly.  
I want to look at that.  
The knowledge of God that you have  


  
 will determine the kind of relationship that you will have with God.  
And ultimately, it will determine the quality of your life, the quality of your life.  
All Christians don't live the same quality of life, even though they have the same life of Christ.  
 The quality of life that you live depends on the relationship that you have with God, which depends on the knowledge of God that you have.  
Where is God?  
David had a great relationship with God, an extraordinary relationship.  
But it was based on what he thought about God.  
 Not just what he taught, what he taught was based on the revelation that he had.  
You know, God is far removed from our thinking.  
He's far removed from our imagination.  
He, he relates with our spirit.  
We don't imagine God.  
See, he relates with our spirits.  
We have to have a revelation, a spiritual revelation of God.  
 Because God is a spirit.  
The Bible says God is a spirit.  
And the reason we can know God like that is because we also are spirit beings.  
You are not the body that you see.  
You are not a physical body.  
Your body is your house.  
Your body is your domicile.  
That's where you live.  
 Your body is not you.  


  
And it's so important that we know this.  
Your body is not you.  
Your body is your house.  
God gave you a body to function in the earth.  


  
So your body is the outward man.  
 your body and its senses.  
See, this is the outward man.  
There is an inward man.  
Now, that inward man is the real you.  
It's called the inner man, the inward man, or the hidden man of a heart.  
 Okay, let me give you a few scriptures to help you get this clearly.  
This is the High Life Conference, right?  
Okay, and in the High Life Conference you learn a lot of scriptures.  
Okay, so let's go.  
The first one will be Romans 7, and I want to give you verse number 22.  


  
 Can you read that?  


  
After what?  
So there is what?  
There is an inward man.  
Go to 1 Peter chapter 3.  
1 Peter chapter 3, read verse 4.  


  
 One, two, go.  


  
Great.  
All right, in the first one that you read in Romans chapter 7 and verse 22, you saw the term the inward man.  
 He said, I delight after the law of God.  
After what?  
The inward man, he says.  
The inward man.  
In his inward man.  
And Peter, that's what Paul called the human spirit.  
 the man that's inside, the real man.  
And that's what Peter called the hidden man of the heart, the hidden man of the heart.  
That's what you just saw.  
And then we can read from Romans chapter 2 in verse 28.  
Romans chapter 2 from verse 28.  
 For he is not a Jew, which is worn outwardly, neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh, verse 29.  
 Read verse 29, but he's a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is not of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of man but of God.  
So you see inwardly there, he refers to the heart, the spirit.  
So you see that inward, heart, spirit,  
 Okay?  
So the inward man is the hidden man of the heart.  
And that is the human spirit.  
He's talking about the human spirit.  
That's the hidden man of the heart.  
That's the inward man.  
Tell somebody there is an inward man.  
And that's the real you.  
And that's the one that really counts.  
Praise God.  
 All right.  
So when a man is born again, it is that spirit that is born again.  
It's not your body that's born again.  
It's your spirit that's born again.  
That's the hidden man, hidden inside this physical body.  
Now, don't try to think, you know, those of you who study biology, you're thinking now, if you dissect a human being, what part of him does this inward man live?  
 You could think in Connolly.  
The man is a spirit.  
And the reason man is called a spirit is because of the characteristics of the term itself.  
The reason God is called a spirit is because of the characteristics of the term itself.  
 Because in the physical world, the characteristics of spirit are related to the characteristics of wind.  
How do you catch the wind?  
You can catch the wind.  
You can shape the wind.  


  
 You see that?  
So, the atlens cannot relate with spirit from their perspective, because everything about the spirit takes the nature of that which is shapeless, which you cannot contain, you know, it just beggars description.  
 And so Jesus communicating with man's understanding, he says to them, God is a spirit.  
So they can understand you can figure him out with your mind.  
Like you can figure the wind out with your mind.  
You know you can feel the wind.  
You know the wind is real.  
You know the force of the wind.  
You can see its effects.  
What you can catch it.  
 You can't keep it.  
You don't know where it's coming from.  
You don't tell, you can't tell its destination, or you can tell it direction at a particular point in time.  
Where does it live?  
You don't know.  
So to know the wind, in all of its nature, you have to become wind.  
 You see it?  
And so the Bible tells us that man also is a spirit.  
God is a spirit, man is a spirit, and so to recognize God, you can only do that from the perspective of your spirit.  
That's why those who have received the nature of God can know God.  
 You say, how can you receive the nature of God?  
That's what Jesus meant when he said you must be born again.  
Born again means born a second time.  
That means born not of the outward, but of the inward.  
So when you were born of your parents, your physical body came out.  
But now he tells you the human spirit needs to be reborn and that that can only be reborn through the Word of God because the Word of God is spirit.  
 Hallelujah.  
So he says, that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.  
Then he said, mother or not that I said unto you, you must be born again.  
Why?  
Because you see, Jesus was talking to a man named Nicodemus and the man was a ruler of the Jews and he was enlightened in all of the law.  
But he didn't know this.  
 any marvel at what Jesus was saying.  
And Jesus said, don't marvel, because to know this, you've got to be born of the Spirit.  
So there's where it begins.  
You cannot even understand spiritual realities until you're born again.  
So if you're thinking, I don't understand this, you can't understand until you're born again.  
You have to first believe  
 And you can believe because the Bible says with the heart man believes.  
You can believe.  
When you believe and you're born again, then something else happens.  
Romans chapter 6.  
Hallelujah.  
I'll read verse 11.  
Romans chapter 6 and verse number 11.  


  
 Have you seen it?  
Likewise, reconhearsal yours to be dead indeed on the sin, but alive under God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
 alive under God.  
He says, recon yourself to be dead, indeed, under sin.  
Count yourself dead to sin.  
Why?  
Because Jesus died in your place.  
You died in Christ.  
If you died in Christ, then you died unto sin.  
Can you see that?  
But something happened.  
God raised Jesus from the dead.  
And now you've come out alive with him.  
When you're born again, that's what happens.  
He says, count yourself alive unto God.  
 You're alive to God.  
Recon yourself to be alive to God.  
Say, I'm alive to God.  
I'm alive to God.  
You see, I'm awakened to God.  
I have a God consciousness.  
I understand the realities of God.  
I'm alive to God.  
You see, when you're alive to God, you know the things of God.  
The things of God have become real to you.  
 You're not an ordinary person.  
So when we talk about the things of God, you know them.  
You're alive to God.  
But one who's not born again, he's not alive to God.  
Said again, I'm alive to God.  
I'm alive to God.  
So I can understand the things of God.  
See, I can understand the things of God.  
Of course, I'm alive to God.  
 Now, if you used to think, well, I don't know these things, but you know you're born again, the Word of God tells you, don't think like that.  
Don't say, I can't understand these things.  
I don't know these things.  
He says, recon yourself.  
That's why he says, recon yourself, recon yourself to be dead to sin, but alive to God.  
Recon it to be so.  
Count it to be so.  
 So you ought to say, I'm alive to God.  
Don't say, well, I don't understand.  
No, I understand the things of God.  
Jesus said it is given to you to understand the mysteries of the kingdom.  
Because you belong in the kingdom.  
So it's your lot.  
It's your inheritance to understand the things of God.  
Because you're born again, you got a life of God in you.  
 See, I'm alive to God.  
What I'm doing to you right now is simple.  
I'm just holding the mirror of God up to you.  
That's what I'm doing.  
That's what I started doing last night.  
That's what I'm doing now.  
Holding up the mirror of God so you can see something.  
Come on here.  
Did you look at a mirror today before you came here?  
I trust you did.  
And when you looked into that mirror, you saw me.  
 You saw who?  
Who did you see when you looked into the mirror?  
You saw yourself?  
Absolutely.  
Okay.  
Okay now.  
The Book of James.  
James in chapter number one.  


  
 And we're going to read from verse 22 down.  
You're ready for this?  
We'll begin with verse 22.  
It says, but be it do us of the word and not hear us only deceiving your own selves.  
It says, if you're here only, you are deceiving yourself.  
Now, the word deceiving yourself really is an interesting Greek word that means overthrowing yourself.  
 See, he says, you overthrow yourself.  
Now, I can take some time to explain that later on, but hear this.  
He says, be, do us of the word and not hear us only, deceiving your own selves.  
 For if any, if any, verse 23, for if any be a hearer of the words and not a doer, he's like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass.  
Did you hear that?  
He says, if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer, he's like a man who's looking at his natural face in a mirror.  
 Verse 24, for he beholdeth himself and go at his way and right away forget it what manner of man he was.  
He says, a man who's not a doer of the word, but a hearer only is as a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror.  
And when he turns away from the mirror to go, he forgets  
 Now, look at this as the manner of man, the kind of man that he was.  
Not just his image, but the kind.  
I like the choice of words here.  
He forgets the kind of man.  
When you look in the mirror, what kind of man do you see?  
What kind of man do you see?  
 When you look in the mirror, what kind of man do you see?  
What kind of person do you see?  
You see, a lot of times we look into a mirror, and all we're trying to think about is what the hair looks like, what our eyelashes look like, and what, you know, and we're trying to make up this.  
But there's more to see in the mirror.  


  
What kind of person do you see when you look at a mirror?  


  
 Wonderful.  
So much to see in a mirror.  
So much to see in a mirror.  
But if you're a doer of the word, you don't forget the caring of men that you saw in a mirror.  
 Now look at it, he's talking about the word of God here, and he says, a doer of the word, not a hero only, a doer of the word, a doer of the word.  
The one who doesn't do the word is like the man who looks at himself in a mirror and forgets the kind of man, the kind of person that he was when he looked at the mirror.  
 But a doer doesn't forget.  
A doer doesn't forget the manner, the kind of person.  
What kind of person are you?  
What kind?  
What kind?  
What type?  
James chapter 1 verse 18.  
 Now, notice we read from verse 22, okay?  
So this man is dealing with a context of quality here.  
He's dealing with a context of quality of personality here.  
So hold it in your mind.  
He's coming from somewhere, okay?  
Go back to James and we're looking at verse 18.  
 verse 18 of his own will begot he us he gave birth to us with the word of truth that's the gospel of Christ it's called the word of truth  
 of his own will begot he asked with the word of truth that we should be a kind, a type hallelujah, a kind of first fruits of his creatures.  
He gave birth to us that we should be a kind, a kind, a type, he's dealing with quality of personality, a kind of first fruits of his creatures.  
 So we are a kind of first fruits of his creatures, first fruits.  
What's the meaning of first fruits?  
It means the first and the best, the first and the best of God's creatures.  
So when we were born again, we came up with a new kind of life, a new type of man, the first and the best of God's creatures.  
 Say, I'm the first and the best.  
I'm the first and the best.  
Now, I'll show you some.  
If you're born again and Satan can still deceive you to make you believe you need deliverance from Satan and his little demons.  
What you need deliverance from is unbelief.  


  
 Not the demons.  
Can I go again?  
If you're already born again, and you know that you're born again, and you have this idea because of your experiences, I know there are experiences, but the reason you have those demoniacal inferences is because of your unbelief.  


  
 If you're born again, and hear me well, if you're born again, you are a type of first fruits of God's creatures.  
Therefore, you are superior to Satan and his demons.  


  
If you still need deliverance from him,  
 It's because you don't believe God.  
What you need deliverance from is unbelief.  
And the only cure and deliverance from unbelief is the word of God.  
Are you still there?  
What I'm sharing with you, it doesn't matter how many demons have got you bound up.  
It doesn't matter how many demons  
 have been living even inside your body or even in your mind.  
If you listen to what I'm sharing with you, this word that I bring to you will get the demons out.  
If you receive the word into you because the word of God is light, the darkness cannot stay.  
No demons can remain if you listen to these words.  
After this meeting, you will not need deliverance from anything.  
 Are you listening to this?  
Doesn't matter that they've been tormenting you in the night.  
You're unable to rest.  
Doesn't matter that they've been tormenting your body.  
Doesn't matter what they've done to you.  
If you can receive the word of God into you, no demon can keep you bound.  
And no demon can remain in you.  
 Hallelujah.  
This is wonderful.  
This is nice.  
Wow.  
Okay.  
That's not a good point.  
We just, we just saw.  
Second Corinthians in chapter number three.  
And we'll read in verse 18.  


  
 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 18.  
But we all, somebody said, we all, not just some of us, but every one of us.  
We all, we're open face.  
That means on the urge.  
We're open face, beholding us in a glass.  
That's the word again for mirror.  
 Behold in us in the glass, the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the spirit of the Lord.  
 He says, but we all with open face be holding us in the glass.  
Every one of us taking away the unbelief, the mask of unbelief, the veil of unbelief and doubt and fear and confusion.  
He says, take away that veil.  
Take away the veil, take away the mask and look at the mirror of God.  
 He says, beholding us in a glass, the glory of the Lord.  
And I think this is wonderful.  
This is awesome.  
Wow.  
I don't know if you've seen that.  
He says, we all, without the mask, without the veil,  
 looking at the mirror of God to see the glory of God.  
I thought, I thought that you see me when I looked at the mirror.  
What do you think?  
I thought you should see you when you look at the mirror.  
I thought it should read like this.  
We all with open face beholding as in the glass our real faces or our real selves.  
 But that's not what he says.  
He says, beholding as in the grass, looking as in the mirror, the glory of the heart.  
I changed.  
He says, as we look at this mirror of God, we behold the glory of God in the mirror.  
And I'm thinking, hey, look here.  
What is he saying?  
 He's saying that when I look at the mirror of God, I see the glory of God.  
But I thought when I looked in the mirror, I was supposed to see me.  
But yeah, when I look at the mirror, I truly see the glory of God.  
But that don't look like me.  
This is one mirror that looks strange.  
You look in the mirror, you see something else.  
And I'm thinking, this couldn't be the mirror.  
I thought I bought a mirror.  
So I look again and, uh-oh,  
 What I see, when I look that way, I see something.  
But I look at me.  
No, I look that way.  
Look at the mirror.  
And I see, it's glorious.  
No, I said, that's not me.  
Then I look this way.  
I think this is me.  
But I take the mirror.  
Think about it.  
Imagine that you looked in the mirror this morning before you came.  
And you know that mirror.  
You brought it out of your bag, and you held it up like this, and then, uh-oh.  
 You thought, this something is strange here, this is weird.  
Oh, not this mirror.  
This is God's mirror.  
You look at it, you see something different.  
You actually see the glory of God.  
And you think, look, this could, no, don't look here.  
Don't look here.  
 When you want to look at yourself, and you want to see yourself the way God sees you, look at his mirror, look at his word.  
What does God think about me?  
Not what do I think about me.  
I want to think what God thinks about me.  
I shouldn't think what others say about me.  
I don't care what they think.  
They're not a factor.  
They can't change me.  


  
 The fact during my life is Christ.  
And I'm going to look at His Word.  
I'm going to depend on what He thinks about me.  
And what He thinks and what He says is what counts.  
Hello.  
How you getting this?  
 But we all, we'd open face behind us in the glass, the glory of the Lord, the glory of the Lord.  
That means when I look at the mirror of God, I see the glory of God.  
And that's my reflection.  
And God says, my reflection is called the glory of God.  
That means I am the glory of God.  
That's my name.  
I am the glory of God.  
I am the glory of God.  
 You better begin to think that way.  
Because you see, you're going to live that way if you think that way.  
Now, the only reason you think that way is because God said so.  
Because, you know, this is not positive thinking.  
This is word thinking.  
Word of God thinking.  
Glory to His name forever.  
 But look at, this is the beauty.  
Look at it.  
He says, but we all will open face behind us in the glass, the glory of the Lord.  
I changed.  
The word is metamorphol.  
That's the Greek from where the English gets metamorphosis from.  
You know, a change in quality.  
Look at this.  
He says, I changed.  
He says, as we look at the glory of God in the mirror, we are changed, transfigured into the same image.  
 You see that?  
The more we look, the more we are changed into the image that we see in the mirror, which is the glory of God.  
The more we look at the glory of God, the more we are changed.  
You know what?  
This is why I can tell you that in this conference, you will surely be changed.  
 Because every session, I'm holding up the mirror of God to you.  
You see, more clearly and more clearly all the time, more clearly all the time.  
The glory of God increasing in your life, more clearly all the time.  
My goodness.  
Hallelujah.  
We are changed from glory to glory.  
I told you you heard that sound from glory to glory.  
We are changed into the same image.  


  
 You know, a lot of times people go to church and they don't hear these things.  
Some people have been in church 40 years, 40 long years.  
They never heard these things.  
Then how would you live the life of glory if you never heard these things?  
 If every Sunday you're standing up to sing, just as I am without one plea.  
If that's all you keep singing.  
You can sing it once when you come to Christ.  
After that you don't need to sing it again.  
Or the famous prayer of the humble.  
 Now, great God, Redeemer, we come to you once again.  
We come to you.  
When did you leave?  
Last week, you came.  
And when you were through with prayer, you didn't say, Father, we shall excuse you now for next week.  
You didn't say that.  
Every time you want to pray, I come to you.  
You come from where?  
 Where have you been?  
You see, our religiosity has come to that point where we don't even know what we say in our prayer.  
A lot of people pray, they don't even know what they said.  
You asking, did you pray yesterday?  
Oh, yes, I did.  
What did you pray about?  
Don't remember.  
You see that?  
 That's why you don't get the answers, because what you asked for wasn't really important to you, and you weren't looking out for an answer.  
That's why you don't remember.  
You're so used to talking, talking that you don't even know the things you say.  
Can you go to see the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and forget what you told him?  
You wouldn't forget that, but this one is greater than that.  
 You just talk.  
Me?  
Oh, God.  
Son, just go help me, Lord.  
Help me.  
Help me.  
Help you for what?  
You can't even help me.  
My life is so miserable.  
Help me.  
The reason your life is so miserable is because you will not listen to his word.  
Hallelujah.  
I'll never be miserable.  
 Come on, glory to God.  
I am the glory of God.  
Yeah, I know who I am.  
I think that way and I talk that way and I live that way.  
I am the glory of God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
 So what am I gonna do then?  
I keep looking at the mirror of God.  
I keep looking because the more I look, the more I'm changed.  
The more I look, the more I'm changed from glory to glory.  
So my life is of an ever-increasing glory.  
You're seeing me now, but in the evening time, I'm gonna be even more glorious.  
You see that?  
And then next week, I'll be even more glorious.  
 I live a life of an ever increasing glory.  
Ever increasing glory.  
I'm changed all the time.  
I get better all the time.  
More glorious all the time.  
More glorious all the time.  
Why?  
Because I keep looking at the mirror of God.  
Because the Bible says the more we look, the more we are changed.  
Wow.  
Hallelujah.  
You're still there?  
 All right, move to the next form.  
I said, we're talking about the image of the heavenly.  
That's what I'm talking about.  
So I moved to the next one here and we're beginning here with first a piece of saying, John chapter four, verse 17.  
 He said, hearing, hearing, in this, hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment.  
In the day of judgment, we're going to have boldness.  
We're going to be bold in the presence of God.  
Some people are going to have to be very afraid because they didn't recognize him.  
 They didn't know him.  
But hearing his love made perfect that we may have born this in the day of judgment because, because, because hallelujah as he is so we in this world.  
Did you notice it says in this word?  
 Hey!  
Glory to God.  
So are we in this world.  
Not later.  
Not when we get to heaven.  
 Now in this time, as he is, so am I. As he is, so am I. As he is, so am I. Okay.  
Okay.  
Hold on now.  
Let's go back to talking glory.  
Hebrews chapter 1.  
We're going to read from verse 1.  
Hebrews chapter 1.  
From verse 1.  
And I want you to see this.  
 He says, God, who at sundry times and in diverse manners, speaking time pass unto the fathers by the prophets, verse two.  
Having these last days spoken on us by his son, whom he, by his son, is talking about Jesus, whom he had appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the words.  
Okay, verse three, who?  
Being the brightness of his glory, the brightness of God's glory, Jesus Christ.  
 being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his present Ayaka Baba Ya!  
Oh, Rabandele Gebosa!  
Ay!  
Ay, ay, ay, ay.  
This is too much.  
This is too much for religion.  
This is real, brother.  
See, sir, this is real.  


  
 He's talking about Jesus, who be in the brightness of God's glory and the express image of God's person.  
In other words, if you wanted to know what God was like, you looked at Jesus.  
He was the express image of God's person.  
No wonder he said, he that has seen me has seen the Father.  
Shout him in somebody.  
 He said, if you have seen me, you have seen the Father, because He's the express image of the Father's person.  
Go back to that verse three, you were still reading.  
Yeah.  
Who be in the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person?  
In a poem in Hayakiah.  
A poem in, a poem in all things by the word of His power.  
Oh God.  
You know you can hold all things in your family by the word of your power.  
 that power that you have received from Christ.  
You can hold up everything in your business by the word of power.  
You can hold up everything in your finances by the word of power.  
That's authority, upholding all things, upholding all things, upholding all things by the word of these power.  
 when he had by himself pushed our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high.  
That means he sat down.  
That means Christ is not working.  
Why?  
Because he gave us the authority.  
He sat down.  
We are in his place today as he is.  
So are we in this world.  
Glory to God.  
Hey.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 You understand this now.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  


  
Second Corinthians chapter, chapter four.  
 We're reading from verse 16.  
Mm-hmm.  
Second Corinthians chapter 4, from verse 16.  
For which course?  


  
 For which course we fade not, but there are outward men perish.  
In other words, you can bruise this outward man.  
You can beat it up if you want to.  
You can beat him in, beat him if you want to.  
But my inward man is renewed day by day.  


  
 Doesn't matter what I go through in my physical body, but my in what man is renewed day by day.  
I am the glory of God on the inside.  
I am greater than what I am on the outside.  
All right, go to first Epistle of Saint John chapter three.  
Remember what it just said.  
 Know the outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.  
We'll go back to that, that question after this.  
First John chapter three from verse one, we'll read it into verse two.  
Verse one.  
Oh, behold, somebody said behold.  
 Stop, let me tell you what John is saying here.  
John is saying, see, ah!  
He says, look, see, what manner of love the Father had lavished upon us, bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 He says, brothers and sisters, look, behold, this man is stared on the inside.  
No wonder the apostles were the kind of people the way, the kind of men the way.  
They were extraordinary.  
These were their thinking.  
These were their ideas from God.  
These were the revelations they got from God.  
No wonder they were so powerful.  
No wonder nothing could put them down.  
 We've been reading Peter.  
We've been reading Paul.  
Now, look at John.  
He says, behold, what manner of love the Father has lovelies to pronounce that we should be called the Technon of God, the sounds of God.  
We are the very sounds of God.  
We came out of Him.  
He says, therefore, the world doesn't recognize us because it didn't recognize Him.  
 Since the world doesn't know us because it knew him not, verse two.  
Beloved?  
What a description.  
Beloved?  
Hallelujah.  
Can you get this?  
He calls you beloved.  
That means, hey, thou who I loved of God.  
Beloved?  
Hey.  
Now.  
 Somebody said, no.  
Not later.  
Not when I get better.  
Beloved.  
Beloved.  
Beloved.  
Beloved.  
Beloved.  
He's talking about me.  
Beloved.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
He's talking about me.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
 Beloved, knew are we the sons of God?  
It does not yet appear what we shall be.  
In other words, when you look at us on the outside, we don't look like all this glory we talk about.  
But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.  
For the Bible says, in the twinkling of an eye, we shall be changed.  
 And this corruptible chapudon incorruptible.  
And this morality chapudon immortality.  
Hi.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Wow.  
I told you about that part.  
This is for which course we faint nods.  
 Though I hout what man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.  
For our light affliction, which it was for a moment.  


  
Go there, go there, go there.  
Second Corinthians chapter 4.  
Go to verse 16.  
I was taking you into verse 17.  
And I would take you from 17 into 18.  
 Go there, verse 16, so we can come into 17 properly.  
For which cause we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day, 17, 4.  
 17, for our light affliction, which is but for a moment.  
Work it for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.  
18, 18, why we'll look not at the things which are here, but at the things which are not here, for the whole world I've got.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Whoo.  
Hey.  
 Wow!  
Ayayayay!  
Hey!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  
Oh!  


  
 It says for our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us, works for us.  
It says no matter what we're going through.  
 The problem is for a moment.  
But why we're going through the trials.  
Why we're going through the pain.  
Why we're going through the temptations.  
He says they all work for us.  
A far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.  
Why we'll look not at the things which are saying.  
Oh, we are not looking at our circumstances.  
We are not looking at our challenges.  
Because they are temporary.  
They are temporary.  
They are temporary.  
 Oh, glory to God.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Oh, the things which I've seen, I've bought for a moment, they are temporary.  
Hallelujah.  
 But those things that are not seen, with the optical eyes, they are eternal.  
Shower him in, somebody.  
Hallelujah.  
Now.  
Now.  
Let's get to the climax of this.  


  
 Speaking tongues, man.  
Let's speak in tongues.  


  
 Amen.  


  
Let's get to the climax of this.  
We're looking at two portions of the Bible.  
The first one, second Peter in chapter 1.  
Second Peter chapter 1.  
Verse 3.  


  
 according as He's divine power.  
And I want you to notice the tenses, whether they're past tense, present tense or future tense.  
According to He's divine power, hath a given unto us.  
He's already done it, hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of Him.  
Look,  
 He's granted us, granted us all things that pertain to life and godliness.  
Everything for me to have a great life, he's already granted it.  
Everything for me to have a godly life, he's already granted it.  
He's granted on to us all things that pertain on the life and godliness through the knowledge of him, through the hypnosis, full knowledge, absolute knowledge.  
 It comes by revelation through the knowledge of him, the absolute knowledge of him that has called us to glory.  
Glory there is excellence.  
He's called us to glory, excellence, greatness.  
He's called us to glory and virtue.  
All right, I could pitch for a whole month on this verse alone.  
But come on, verse four.  
Look at verse four.  
Who are you by?  
 You know, this thing is getting too much.  
Sometimes, you know, you read the Bible, you shout, shout, shout.  
You laugh, laugh, laugh.  
Then you start crying.  
You know, all emotions just come together.  
Whereby are given unto us, exceeding, exceeding, exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be, hey, ya, gah, bah, bah, bah, bah.  
 that he might be partakers of the Divine Nature.  
You know, when I studied this passion years ago, I knew that something was missing because the more I studied it, the more I felt something was missing.  
Something was missing.  
He says that he might be partakers of the Divine Nature.  
 On the one hand, it was being a part participating in the divine experience.  
But I thought, yes, God is saying participating in the divine experience, but something leads to it.  
How can we participate in the divine experience?  
The divine experience here means like you're doing things together with God.  
So I thought, maybe I should look at this thing more seriously.  
Then I found out there was a limitation in the translation, no wonder.  
Let's go back there.  
 Go back to that scripture.  
Verse four.  
Quibai are given unto us, exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers.  
Write down the word partakers there.  
Partakers of the divine nature.  
Now, the divine nature.  
 That's another thing to write down.  
Those are the two areas that got my attention.  
The first one, he says, partake us, but he got it from coin or nose, which means, which means associates.  
It means associates.  
This is wonderful.  
This is, this is, this is, this is extraordinary.  


  
 It refers to a fraternity.  


  
Then, it goes divine nature.  
But it was Theos Fusios, which means he's not talking about divine nature.  
He means God-kind.  
He wasn't talking about divine nature.  
The word expresses God-kind.  
 Like you say, mankind.  
I think when the translators saw that, it got too big.  
And they probably were at it.  
The actual Greek says it.  
He says, associates of the God kind.  


  
He says, through those promises,  
 Through this knowledge of God's Word, He brings us into a place where we become associates of the God kind, the God kind.  


  
Now I see it.  
No one that Jesus said in prophetic language, when you're starting the book of Hebrews chapter 2, it is I and the children which God had given me.  
 are for signs and wonders.  
The Bible says he is not ashamed to call them brethren.  
It is because those who are sanctified and the one who sanctifies them are all of one.  
 No one at the Bible says that we are heirs, joint heirs.  
This is where heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.  
Joint heirs, joint heirs, not co-ass, but joint heirs.  
There's a difference between co-ass and joint heirs.  
 Co-S means that we share that account 10%, 90%, or 50, 50, or 40, 60, or 35, 65, or 30, 70, whatever we are co- S of that whatever that inheritance is.  
But joint S means I own 100% together with you.  
 You are in the 100%.  
The 100% belongs to me as it belongs to you.  
You don't get it without me.  
I don't get it without you.  
We are together as one.  
Can you shout him in somebody?  
So the Bible says that we are heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.  
 See how loving he is.  
He chose to share all of his glory together with us.  
No wonder the Bible says that he is the head and we are the body.  
We answer the same name.  
The head is called Christ.  
The body is called Christ.  
Oh, glory to God.  
This is marvelous.  
This is marvelous.  
 Associates of the God kind.  
Mantakabaya.  
Associates of the God kind.  
Oh, glory to God.  
No wonder the Bible says we have arrived.  
We have arrived in Zion, the city of the heavenly Jerusalem.  
The general assembly of the first bond  
 This general assembly says a registered in heaven.  
Our names are all there.  
Registered in heaven.  
And Papa God is a part of it.  
The Bible says he is.  
Jesus is a part of it.  
Think about all of those who are named here in this general assembly.  
The general assembly headed by the firstborn.  
 Jesus Christ.  
Regists that in heaven are sausages of the God count.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Can you see why?  
If you're suffering, you're suffering for nothing.  
If you're suffering by choice, it's fine.  
But you should know that you chose to.  
Don't let Satan pin you down.  


  
 You can make a choice of the kind of life you wanna live, but let it be your choice.  
Don't be hemmed in by society.  
Don't be hemmed in by the economy.  
Don't be hemmed if you are the seed of Abraham!  


  
You know, I'm the seed of Abraham, I refuse to be broke.  
I'll never be broke.  
 Because I'm the seed of Abraham.  


  
I am the seed of Abraham.  
Say it like you mean it.  
I am the seed of Abraham.  
I refuse to be broke.  
 You know, you can hear about the economy.  
And lots of people are scared.  
They're thinking about, what are they saying?  
What are they saying?  
I don't care about what the ECB thinks.  
I operate a different economy.  
Listen, Jesus was very quiet.  
 Could anybody have been more quiet than Jesus?  
He was so quiet.  
He was loving and kind.  
No one could be more loving than Jesus, but Jesus was tough.  
When he raised Lazarus from the dead, did you hear him saying, was he?  
Was he?  
Could you please come out?  
Was he?  
He didn't do that.  
The Bible says.  


  
 The Bible says he's too close to the entrance of that cave.  
He's a liar!  
Hallelujah.  
Jesus was tough.  


  
Can you win the shout?  
Did you read about when Jesus ran?  
 It's in the book.  
He ran.  
You think he was doing like this?  
He was not a warm.  


  
The Bible says when the Holy Ghost came on him, he ran!  
On another occasion, the Bible says Jesus was dancing in the Holy Ghost.  
How's the Bible says?  
 Jesus was dancing in the Holy Ghost.  
And what made him dance?  
He looked at his disciples.  
He was having a conversation with them.  
He said, Father, I thank you.  
You have hidden these things from the wide and prudent.  
He was rejoicing that the revelations of God were hidden from the wise and prudent, but revealed to babes.  
And he was excited.  
Now says he danced.  
 What kind of a man do you think Jesus was?  


  
Blessed are the poor in spirit.  
Go see Jesus about to go into the temple in Jerusalem.  
He finds them money changes.  
They turn this place into a business place.  
He said, hold on a minute.  
 He walked around, got some whips, and came back high, high.  
And the Bible says he turned our tables upside down.  
Jesus.  
He was tough.  
I said, what kind of man you think he was?  
Hallelujah.  
 So you can't play cool there and think this is Christianity.  
The devil's beating you and destroying your life and your death.  
I don't know what's going on.  
Please pray for me.  
Pray for you.  
Don't you understand what the word says?  
You have God little children and I've overcome them because Greta is key.  
That is in you.  
That he, that is in the world.  
 Hallelujah.  
You refuse to be oppressed.  
You said, devil, I'm not going to take this from you in the name of Jesus Christ.  
Get out of my family.  
Get out of my business.  
Get out of my finances.  
Get out of my body.  
Hallelujah.  
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  


  
Hallelujah.  
She was celebrating the word.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
All right.  
Let's take this final scripture here.  
 I told you, it's the climax of this.  
I mean, we've come to the point, associates of the God kind.  
I mean, what gets better than that?  
First Corinthians chapter number 15.  
So, I'm showing you now what we call hidden scriptures.  
Did you notice that first one?  
You have to study to discover that.  
 to discover that we are called as such aids of a God kind.  
And what the Bible shows it and several other places that are in direct to you.  
See, so let's go to this one.  
First Corinthians chapter 15.  
And I want to begin reading from verse 40.  
And I want you to catch the context.  
 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial, but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.  
You know, celestial, okay, heavenly, and then there's the terrestrial.  
Verse 41.  
 There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differed from another star in glory.  
That's true.  
And that also refers to God's children.  
The Bible says those who turn many to righteousness shine as stars.  
Praise God.  
 So, and Jesus is called the son of righteousness.  
You say, who is the moon?  
The moon is not included.  
Why?  
Because the moon is not a light.  
Okay, verse 42.  
So also is the resurrection of the dead.  
It is sown in corruption.  
It is raised in incorruption. 43.  
 It is sown in dishonor.  
It is raised in glory.  
It is sown in weakness.  
It is raised in power.  
44.  
It is sown in natural body.  
It is raised in spiritual body.  
There is a natural body.  
And there is a spiritual body.  
Stop!  
Hold on there!  
 He is ascending in this revelation.  
He says to you, there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.  


  
Let it soak, let it soak, let it soak.  
Okay, verse 45.  
 And so it is written, the first man Adam was made a living soul.  
The last Adam was made a quickening spirit.  
Stop for a moment.  
This is wonderful.  
He says, the first Adam, you remember the Bible says that God breathed into his nostrils the bread of life and the man became a living soul.  
 Adam, the first Adam.  
Now the last Adam is the second Adam.  
He's called the second Adam.  
He's called the last Adam.  
That's Jesus Christ.  
When you were born of your parents, you were born after the first Adam.  
 When you were born again, you were born after the last Adam, Jesus Christ.  
And let me say this, the Bible tells us that your life is healed with Christ in God.  
In Colossians chapter 3 verse 3, your life is healed with Christ in God.  
Did you hear that?  
Your life is in Christ.  
 Your life is in Christ.  
It's here with Christ in God.  
So your life, the life you have now is not the life that you came with from your mother.  
It's not the life you came with from your father.  
Understand this.  
Maybe you don't realize it.  
But when you were born again, your life took on a new meaning and a new parentage.  
 Jesus Christ is now your root.  
You were cut off from the first Adam by death.  
That's why it says, recon yourself to be dead indeed on the sin because the first one died on the sin.  
Now you are connected, born from the second and last Adam.  


  
 He says, what so ever is born of God overcomes the world.  
What so ever is born of God overcomes the world.  
Why?  
Because the first one was terrestrial.  
The second one is celestial.  
The first life was terrestrial.  
 The second life is Celestia.  
We'll see it in a moment.  
Let's go again.  
Back to verse 45.  
And so it is written, the first man Adam was made 11, so the last Adam was made a quickening spirit, a life-given spirit.  
That's what it means, quickening spirit, King James.  
Verse 46.  
 How be it?  
That was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural.  
And afterward, that which is spiritual.  
In other words, it was the natural that came first.  
Being the spiritual came afterward.  
All right?  
The natural first atom.  
The spiritual, second and last atom.  
All right.  
Now, verse 47.  
The first man is of the earth.  
Etti.  
Oh, ta ke bon de la mugidada.  
 The first man is of the earth, eti.  
The second man is the Lord from heaven.  
I want you to look at it again.  
The first man is of the earth, eti.  
And the second man is the Lord from heaven.  
No one that Jesus said, I am from above, ye are from beneath.  
Can you see it now?  
Hm, 48.  
 Say, man, g'day.  
I says, the eti, such are they also that are eti.  
If you're not born again, he's talking about you.  
You see that?  
He's talking about you.  
If you're not born again, he's talking about you.  
He says, I says, the eti, such are they also that are eti.  
There are those who are eti.  
They're called etlings.  


  
 As is the ethic, such are they also that are ethic.  
And as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  
Look, look at the context.  
As is the ethic, such are, such are, such are.  
They are presently there, such are they also that are ethic.  
 And as is the heavenly, such are they also, that are heavenly.  
Okay.  
Now, the big thing.  
Are you still there?  
Yes!  
Turn to someone close to you and say, I hope you are born again.  
Because if you are not, the Bible says you are at sea.  


  
 Now, you know, the translators remember this is why the Bible tells us to search the Scriptures and Paul tells us to study, study the Word.  
So don't leave things to just go by.  
And that's why some of us who are anointed to bring the Word of God to God's people.  
Bible says He gave some apostles and some prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists.  
 for the perfecting of the saints of the work of the ministry.  
So there's an anointing for us to know these things, search these things, recognize these things, and also be anointing to communicate them.  
Hallelujah.  
Okay, now here's what I want to show you.  
Go to that next verse.  
Can you see 49?  
As we have born the image of the Etsy,  
 We shall also be in the image of the heavenly.  
No, something's wrong.  
He just told us, he just told us, such are they also that are heavenly.  
 Now, you might think that, oh, maybe this refers to what he told us in 1 John 3 verse 2, where he said, we may not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when you shall appear, we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is.  
And that could be enough for us to think, oh, that's cool.  
That's nice, but no.  
 When you study closely, you find this is not what he says, even though this is nice.  
I mean, this is big, this is wonderful, but it does look like a promise.  
And then I go in and I find it's not a promise.  
I'll show it to you in a moment.  
I study the original and I find something's wrong with the translation.  
 Now go back.  
I try to find out.  
Am I the only one that thinks like this?  
Or some of the translations, did they get to see this?  
I found out many of them got to see this.  
Okay, let me go again.  
And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear.  
 the image of the heavenly, we shall also.  
I like it, but I'm starting it and I find that's not what it says.  
Okay, go to the Amplified Version now.  
First Corinthians chapter 15 and verse 49, Amplified, let us see.  
And just as we have born the image of the man of dust, so shall we.  
Did you notice?  
So shall we, then he stops and says, I'm so let us also be.  


  
 Can you see that?  
Now, in several other translations, they go straight to what it actually says.  
The Amplify tries to marry part of what you saw not King James because a few others decided to put it that way because it seems too big.  
It's like, is this my responsibility?  
Can he be telling me?  
 bear the image of the heavenly.  
Absolutely.  
Absolutely.  
So, look at it.  
It says, just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, that is the effy, it says, so let us also bear the image of the man of heaven.  
Now, this is, I told you, you see, the climax is usually not very shouting.  
The climax is deep thinking.  
 Now, wonderful.  
You know, stop thinking.  
How can I do that?  
Because it says, let us also bear.  
And that tells you why they weren't sure that that's what it should be.  
Let us also bear means it's my job.  
It means I got to do something about it.  
Because it says, let us also bear.  
If he had said,  
 We will bear.  
Then we look up in the sweet by and by God's going to do something about it.  
Okay.  
But it says, let us.  
So the image of the heavenly, the image of the man of heaven.  
How do I bear that?  
To bear it really means holding thoughts.  
It means to put on.  
It means to communicate.  
Are you following this?  
 What the Bible has already told us that?  
To put on Christ.  
And it says that those who are born again have put on Christ.  
Then it tells us to put on the new image of the new nature.  
How can I do that?  
It's by accepting what God has said about me.  
I've got to accept it.  
What God has said about me.  
 If the Bible says, you are a new creation, then I say, I am a new creation.  
I don't have to feel like it.  
I don't have to look like it.  
If God has said it, my answer and my response is, yes, so am I. If he says, greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world, then I say, yes, greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.  
 Of course, he already said, ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them.  
So I'm not trying to overcome them.  
He says, ye have overcome them.  
That's what he says.  
In 1st John chapter 4 verse 4, ye have overcome them.  
He says whatsoever is born of God, overcomes the words.  
And when he says whatsoever, it's amazing that  
 Many of the translations chose what is right by saying whatsoever rather than whosoever.  
Because the accurate word there is actually whatsoever.  
Why?  
Because it's got nothing to do with humanity or personalities.  
It's got to do with whatever proceeds from God.  
To say whatsoever is born of God.  
 Whatsoever.  
Like the Bible says, so mightily grew the Word of God and prevails.  
The Word prevails because it was the Word of God.  
Everything that comes from God prevails.  
Whatsoever is born of God prevails.  
Whatsoever is born of God overcomes the Word.  
I'm born of God.  
I overcome the Word.  
And when I face situations,  
 staggering opposition, I take the words, I take the word into my spirits.  
And as I take the word into my spirits, I proclaim the word from my spirits and it prevails because whatsoever is born of God, the word prevails.  
I put it in my lips.  
See, the word of God on the lips of a man of faith will produce eternal results.  
 Can you say me?  
I'm a victor in this life.  
And I look around me and I can see that I can effect changes everywhere and anywhere.  
All I need is to set my focus, my attention on that.  
You know why sometimes when you pray, it looks as though you didn't get what you wanted.  
 and things can just pass by because your focus wasn't there.  
In the realm of the Spirit, you've got to set your focus on the place you want changed, the thing you want changed.  
Not only your words, there must be a focus.  
For example, in joining in the Spirit, you don't need someone to take you from here to there.  
You want to go from here to there in the Spirit.  
You turn there, you set your focus and you are there.  
 And that's how journeys are made in the Spirit.  
It's your focus.  
Once you turn your focus there and set your focus there, if you heed it, you are there.  
Start understanding this now because it's so important.  
You see, in the Book of Acts chapter 3, a beautiful story, Peter and John going into the temple at the hour of prayer.  
 The Bible tells us, as a winnion, the saw man who was important in his feet.  
Never walked from birth.  
And he was placed there every day.  
Now the man was about 40 years old.  
Peter had met the man before.  
According to the Bible, Peter had been to that sin temple with Jesus before.  
And if they laid that man daily at the gate,  
 And he's been there for years like the Bible churches, and the most have encountered him before.  
But on this occasion, Peter says to him, look on us, but the words give us your attention, because he can't receive the miracle without the attention.  
Can you see the importance of focus?  
That's the way it is.  


  
 I love you.  
Now, what are you going to do?  
It's time to pray.  
And you are going to use what you've learned.  
You're going to use the word of God that you have learned.  
You're going to use the word that's come into your spirits.  
See, the word of God has been deposited in your spirits.  
You're going to use it.  
You're going to use it.  
See, we're moving into  
 another dimension of operation in the Spirit.  
The Church of Jesus Christ will be glorious in these last days.  
There's no doubt in my mind.  
No doubt in my mind.  
He's coming for a church without sport, without wrinkle, without blemish, or any such thing.  
But a church that's glorious, hallelujah.  
And we are that church.  
 We are the churches coming for.  
Can you say hallelujah?  
Say I'm glorious.  
The next time someone says, how are you?  
Say I'm glorious.  
Glorious.  
I'm glorious.  
I'm glorious.  
I'm shining.  
I'm shining.  
Are you shining?  


  
 Stand up and let's shine more.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Speaking other tongues.  
Praying the Holy Ghost.
