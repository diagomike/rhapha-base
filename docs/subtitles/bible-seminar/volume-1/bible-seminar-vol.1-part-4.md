title: Bible Seminar Vol.1 Part 4

 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirit.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Mabel is yours.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
You know, the only material that God gave to build your spirit is his word through the power of the Holy Spirit.  
If anyone ignores the word,  
 There's no hope.  
The Bible says he that despises the word, the word of God shall be destroyed.  
It's the only hope.  


  
So every child of God must open his heart to the word and receive the word.  
The Bible says we should receive the engrafted word.  
 which is able to save our souls.  
And that salvation is talking about, it's not from sin.  
It's not trying to bring you into salvation afresh know.  
It's talking about the preservation of salvation of the human soul.  
 the outworking of salvation and the human soul.  


  
So take it seriously.  
Go for it voraciously and apply it to your personal life.  
Act upon it.  
 To make relevant changes.  
It's the only way.  


  
You have to make an effort.  


  
Make an effort.  
To act on his world.  


  
 Don't ignore it.  
Use it for your benefit.  
You know, sometimes there are individuals who without really saying it in adequate speech.  
They act without realizing it.  
They act in with worldly wisdom.  
They think they are so smart.  
 Or the more they play that game, the worse their life becomes.  
And the remaining that foolishness without knowing it, they keep playing that game and their life keeps going down.  
And then they start making bad decisions.  
They start making the wrong decisions and they don't realize it.  
Life just goes worse and worse, but they will not know.  
 What does the Bible say about them?  
He says, they know not.  
Neither will they understand.  
They walk on in darkness.  
He said, but I have said he are gods.  
And all of your children are the most high, but it shall die like men.  


  
He said, they know not.  
Neither will they understand.  
They walk on in darkness.  
Hallelujah.  
You still there?  
OK.  


  
 So yesterday, we got to talk about dealing with inner conflicts, inner conflicts, conflicts with the end.  


  
Such that instead of enjoying our lives, we find that we're not enjoying anything.  
We're just going through the motions.  
 That's what happens to a lot of people, they go into emotions.  
They're just doing things, but they're not happy.  
And they don't mind telling God, Lord, I'm not happy.  
But the trouble is they are frustrating themselves without realizing it.  
God doesn't have the responsibility of making you happy.  
 He doesn't have the responsibility of making you joyful.  
What he did was to put joy in your spirit.  
Already the other day, it's one of the features.  
When you were born again, joy came in the package.  
Joy came in your recreated human spirit.  
The born again human spirit has joy within it.  
 It's up to you to live your life joyfully.  
God is not going to make you any more joyful today than how he made you joyful when you were born again.  
He doesn't have the responsibility of doing more.  
Incidentally, no one in the whole world has the responsibility of making you joyful.  
 All that job is yours.  
So whether you enjoy your life or you don't enjoy it is actually your business.  
It's a choice.  
Say this with me.  
Live enjoyfully is my choice.  
 Now, that's important.  
It's real.  
Live and joyfully is your choice, is your personal choice.  
Joy has nothing to do with what's happening to you or around you.  
It's got nothing to do with what others are saying to you or what they're doing to you.  
It's got nothing to do with your experiences.  
You can be joyful in the midst of trouble.  


  
 Joy has expressions.  
See, you can say, I'm joyful and then not express it.  
No, you don't have joy then.  
Joy has expressions.  
Laughter is an expression of joy.  
Praise when you're praising God.  
Praise is an expression of joy.  


  
Singing.  
 Singing songs of praise, songs of joy, and songs of thanksgiving are all an expression of joy.  
You know, you can sing songs of depression.  
I mean, people have got that.  
They sing songs of unhappiness.  
But the Bible says, is everything all right?  
He says, sing sounds.  
Sing praise.  
 Then he says, are you going through problems?  
He says, pray.  
You can sing sounds.  
Hallelujah.  
There's a logic you can do for yourself.  


  
Book of James.  
Chapter five.  


  
 Verse 13, is any among you afflicted?  
We read that the other day.  
He said, are you ill treated?  
He says, let him pray.  
Read the rest of it, want to go.  
You see that?  
He says, is any Mary?  
Let him sing sounds.  
Is any happy?  
Are you happy?  
He says, sing sounds.  
 There's an expression.  


  
Remember, if you are not joyful, if you are not happy, you cannot make others happy.  
You cannot make others joyful.  
That means you cannot preach the gospel.  
 It has nothing to do with your experiences, with what you are going through.  
The Bible tells us next, chapter 16, when you read from the 25th verse, the Bible tells us about Paul and Silas, how that they were in prison.  
All right?  
Persecuted for preaching the gospel.  
Things went all right.  
But then it tells us at midnight,  
 they began to pray and sing praises unto God.  
And the other prisoners heard them.  
The result of that was a miracle.  
God shook the prison up and broke their bands and set them free.  
But look what happened.  
There were saying in praise to God in that condition, in that situation.  
 Job, chapter five.  
The Book of Job, chapter five.  


  
At the structure and famine, he says, what thou shalt laugh.  
That's what he said.  
What he's telling you is those things will have no effect on you.  
 they will have no effect on you.  
Those things will have no effect on you.  
You know, in our lives, many times we try to, we try to help God, you know?  
Have you ever thought about it?  
Or we try to help God?  
 Imagine that you knew what your life, you had a vision.  
God spoke to you.  
God ministered to you about your dreams, about your visions, about your future, about something nice that he wanted you to do, about a project, whatever it is.  
Do you realize sometimes  
 If we're not careful, we're trying to play God.  
We're even trying to help him out.  
In the Bible, there are several situations where people try to help God out.  
And I wonder how you have helped God so far.  
 Many help God.  
The problem, there's not a wrong with helping God.  
The problem is that it's the cost.  
It's what it will cost you.  


  
It's what it will cost you.  
I pick a lady that helped God out one time.  
You remember Abraham?  
Abraham?  
 had a vision from God.  
The Lord spoke to him and said, you're going to have a son.  
And Abraham was old already.  
His wife was old.  
And now God comes in very late to say, you're going to have a son.  
And he thought, how could he?  
It appears God has forgotten our age.  
 Why not so young?  
I'm about a hundred.  
Well, God said, nevertheless, you're going to have a son.  
Sarah realized that the Word of God had to come to pass.  
In that God had forgotten how to make it happen.  
So she said, I know what to do.  
 Why don't you take Hager?  
Because I think that God forgot how old I am.  
And I understand, take Hager.  
And from Hager, you can have a son.  
So what happened was Abraham took Hager and actually had a son, Ishmael.  
 A miracle that happened.  
Sarah has performed it for God.  
It worked.  
It didn't take long before Sarah became frustrated by the miracle she performed.  
She became very upset, very unhappy, very frustrated with this miracle that she performed.  
 I'm still looking for a way out.  
What does the Bible tell us about that story?  
Turn to Galatians.  
Chapter four.  
I want to start reading from verse 22.  


  
 for this reason that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond made the other by a free woman.  
But he who was of the bond woman was born after the flesh.  
But he of the free woman was by promise.  
Was he saying?  
 that the one that was born of the born woman was according to natural processes, biological processes, everything was normal, everything was going to work out.  
He was biological, so he says, was of the flesh, of the senses.  
But the one by the three women, which was Sarah,  
 He says he was by promise.  
They had to act on the word.  
They had to live on the word because it was naturally impossible for that child to be born.  
They had to be a miracle.  
They had to be faith on the word that God gave to them.  
So he says to us in verse 24, which things are an allegory.  
What is he saying?  
 This story about Abraham in his two sounds, worn by Hagar, that's Ishmael, and the other by Sarah, and that's Isaac.  
He says, this is an allegory.  
You see, he says they represent two covenants.  
There's an allegorical teaching here.  
 They represent two covenants.  
He says, God's speaking to us in a story form.  
In other words, when you read the story, God's got a message behind the story.  
It didn't just happen.  
There's a message behind the story.  
He says, they represent two covenants.  


  
 And guess what happened?  
Sarah created out of trying to help God because God said you're going to have a son.  
And she figured out she had a way of making it happen.  
And she tried to make it happen.  
It costs her terrible problems.  
She became frustrated.  
She became unhappy.  
 And she established something that she would not be able to control.  
What was it?  
Ishmael came in, and Ishmael was said by God to be a man who will be against others, and others will be against him.  
In other words, he'll be a terrorist.  
And that's what the Bible says.  
And that was the beginning of terrorism in the world.  
Sarah made it happen.  
She walked a miracle.  


  
 And all of those nations that are sponsoring terrorism in the world today came from HEGA, a cut sea of sera's miracle.  


  
You see, there are actions  
 that lead to regrettable extremities, just because we were trying to help God bring His word to pass.  
When God speaks His word to you, His word brings you hope, right?  
The three things that God's word ministers, the word of God ministers faith, the word of God ministers hope  
 The Word of God means to us, love.  
You know, God and His Word are one.  
And the Bible says, the Word was God.  
And of course, continues to be God because He has not changed.  
Then it says, God is love, right?  
 Okay, so God's word, ministas love.  
God's word, ministas hope.  
God's word, ministas faith.  
Many times when people hear the word of God, they get the first thing that the word gives them.  
The first thing that the word gives is hope, which is like, oh, there's a light in the tunnel.  
I think  
 Oh, if I can embrace this message, something's gonna happen.  
Maybe some good will come out of it.  
So, hope is ministered.  
That's the first thing that you get.  


  
Then, the other two will come from your action.  
Faith is the response of the human spirit.  
 to that hope that God's Word has ministered.  
Love is the way we act upon it, the way we live by the Word that God has given to us.  
Now here is the important thing.  
When the Word of God ministers hope to you, you have a choice to mix it with faith and love  
 to mix it with faith and love to produce results.  
Then it will produce the results that God wants.  
If you don't mix it with faith, you will have the same result that Sarah had.  
Sarah had the word of God, and at that moment in her life, she didn't mix it with faith.  
The word brought her hope.  
 And she decided she could work on it from the standpoint of hope.  
And you know, when it's about hope, all you do is look into the future and expect that something's going to work out somehow.  
It turned out it didn't work out as she expected.  
She got her son all right.  
She got the result.  
She wanted.  
 Somehow, but it turned out to be not exactly what God wanted, because it cost us something.  
Even though the Word of God eventually was fulfilled in her life at a great price.  
That's what I'm talking about, at a great price.  
You see, you try to help God do things.  
You try to help God make His Word come to pass.  
It may still come to pass, but at a great price.  
 It will cost you much more than it should have been if you had mixed his word with faith and love.  
Sarah didn't mix God's word with faith at that point in her life.  
It took her a while longer.  
It took her a while longer to begin to live by faith, to begin to act by faith.  
 But it cost us so much.  


  
Was that all?  
No, there was more.  
There was more.  
See, we have more allegory good teaching in the word from this man's family.  
When you read from Book of Genesis, maybe I should give you a background.  


  
 And I just mentioned two covenants represented by these two boys, Eishmel and Isaac.  
Life went on beautifully, even though there were problems later on in the future.  
But we're coming to another scene  
 another setting.  
And we find Isaac, a wonderful man, a prosperous man, a great man.  
And there's a story about him and his little family that's so instructive.  
 A story of spiritual insensitivity.  


  
A story of frustration.  
Are you there?  
Yeah.  
A story of competition.  
A story of favoritism.  
And lastly,  


  
 story of deception.  


  
We'll see how this played out.  
And you can ask, do these things happen within us?  
Many times you find people who have inner conflicts.  
So much is going on inside their hearts.  
So much.  
 The first story is about two covenants.  
This is a story about two nations.  
Let me explain to you what happened.  
All right.  
Let's read some stuff here from the Bible.  
Genesis chapter 25.  


  
 Are you there?  
I will read from verse 21.  
And Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was barren.  
Now, here again, you know, the same thing that happened to his own father's family.  
Sarah had been barren.  
 Now, that problem has come, has crept into his own family now.  
He's married a godly wife, but she's buried.  
So he praised a god.  
He  
 entrates the Lord for his wife because she was barren, and the Lord was entreated of him, and Rebecca, his wife, conceived.  
And the children struggled together withing her, and she said, if it be so, why am I thought, why am I like this?  
What's going on?  
And she went to inquire of the Lord.  
She prayed to God, what's happening within me?  
Why the conflict?  
The Bible says there was a conflict.  
 She had what?  
An inner conflict.  
It's an inner conflict.  
Yes.  
And she says, why?  
Why the inner conflict?  
And the Lord said unto her, two nations are in thy womb.  
And two manner of people shall be separated from thy powers.  
 And one people shall be stronger than the other than the other people.  
And the aridah shall serve the younger.  
Who's talking?  
Who's he talking to?  
God's talking to Rebecca.  
 Rebecca hears the voice of God clearly.  
God says to her, there are two nations in you.  
See, you got this inner conflict and you're trying to find out, why do I have this conflict?  
God says, yes, inside your body.  
You got two nations.  
And one will be stronger than the other.  
This is the heir that shall serve the younger.  
God's given a clear vision about our future.  
 about how children and what's going to happen to them.  
She knows their future.  
God has spoken.  
And when the time came in the next few verses, the Bible says she delivered twins.  
The first one to come out was called Esau because he came out red, looking red and hairy.  
So he was called Esau.  
 who became the father of the Edomites.  
Okay.  
The second one, Jacob.  
And you know, Eso became a wild man.  
He was rough and tough and strong and bold.  
He was manly, masculine, v-chested.  
You get it?  
 And he was daddy's man, daddy's boy.  
The other one was a gentleman.  
Mr. Smootz.  
He was Smootz.  
Had no hair.  
Very little hair, didn't it?  
Mommy's boy.  
 Always running around mom.  
Not many dads like mommy's boy.  


  
And so, let's read.  


  
 Verse 28, no, no, 27, so you can catch it.  
He says, and the boys grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field, and Jacob was a plain man.  
I told you, mister Smoothes, dwelling in tents.  
He liked to stay in the house.  


  
 And verse 28, and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison.  
Look at that.  
Look why he loved him.  


  
But Rebecca loved Jacob.  


  
Story of favoritism.  
Competition.  
 Isaac loves Isa, Rebecca loves Jacob, so you find Daddy loves the first born, right?  
Isa.  
Mommy loves second born Jacob.  
And Daddy likes to see what Isa brings from the field.  
He enjoys  
 You know, hanging out with Iso.  
He likes his venison.  
This guy goes out to hunt.  
He's tough.  
But Mommy has a vision.  
Mommy remembers what God said.  
And Mommy's watching over Jacob.  
 She loves Jacob.  
So life goes on in an interesting way.  
Now verse 29, and Jacob saw a pottage, and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.  
 Anisa said to Jacob, feed me, I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint.  
You see, Jacob had learned to cook because he was always with mom.  


  
All right.  
Anisa said to Jacob, feed me, I pray thee with that same red pottage for I am faint, therefore was his name called Adam.  
 And Jacob said, sell me this day thy birthright.  
How did he know about this kind of thing?  


  
Look at this young guy.  
How did he know about this kind of thing?  
To say that to his older brother.  
What in the world have he been listening to?  
Okay, so he says here, sell me your bet, right?  
And Jesus said, behold, I am at the point to die.  
 And what prophets shall this birthright do to me?  
Have you heard those people that say, is that what we eat?  
Have you heard them?  
Very, very vulgar, very, very low standard.  
Their communication is so base, so worthless.  
It's so base, it stinks.  
Don't talk like that.  
That's Israel's language.  
Don't talk like that.  
 No wonder they're that way.  
I've never heard a responsible person talk like that, only those who have gone the way of Iso.  
And that's exactly Iso's language.  
Is it birthright I would eat?  
So stick it.  
Give me food.  
So does birthright for lunch?  
 And Jacob said, sweater me this day.  
And he swore on to him, and he sold his birds right on to Jacob.  
As far as God was concerned, he sold it.  
Because he gave him the food, and he ate it, and he used his mouth.  
Bird's right is not in a cotton.  
It's not in a box.  
Don't you understand?  
It's not in a bottle.  
So the guy thought he was smart.  
He read the story later on he thought he could eat his cake and have it.  
 Oh God was there, and he heard it, by thy words thou shall be justified, and by thy words thou shall be condemned.  
Nobody was there when they did it, but God was there.  
Verse 34, then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of letters, and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way.  
Thus Esau despised his birthright.  
 What a story.  
What a story.  
What a story.  
Okay.  
What follows?  
Something strange happens.  
The day comes.  
You read the whole story for yourself.  
You go into  
 even into the next chapter.  
And you see this whole thing unfold.  
Isaac is now an old man.  
He's so old, he can only see by the spirit.  
And so he calls his first son, Esau.  
He says, Esau, I want to bless you before I die.  
And I want to give you the  
 blessing of my father Abraham.  
So go and get me some of that stuff that I enjoy.  
Go get it so that my soul will be stared and I'll bless you.  
Here's a problem.  
Look at this man.  
Even though a great man of God, he's going to be stared through his senses.  
And his senses are about to deceive him.  
 Don't rely on your senses.  
Isaac did an disgusting dearly.  
He said, go.  
Go and get me.  
The venison that I love so that my soul will stay and now bless you.  
And his son dashed out and mama heard about it.  
Rebecca.  
 Rebecca heard it.  
She said, what?  
That blessing is supposed to go to Jacob.  
So she's going to place much of going to do something about it because God said it.  
You see it?  
God said it.  
Didn't, didn't Isaac know?  
I don't think Isaac was ignorant of this.  
 for his favoritism, sometimes we're gonna act in spite of what God said.  
Because I love him so much, I'm gonna give him the blessing of Abraham.  
That's how in churches we can even make a deacon, we can make a deaconess, we can make a pastor, because we like you so much.  
Even when God's hand is not on you,  


  
 There are things that people are asked to do, even when they don't have the ability for that.  
They don't have a calling for it.  
And so he says, I want to bless you before I die.  
He didn't even call Jacob.  
You see, Jacob was not on his mind.  
He was going to give this blessing to Esau.  
Mama heard.  
 Rebecca heard.  
And she called Jacob.  
She said, quick!  
She was smart.  
She knew how that thing tasted.  
She said, don't worry.  
We'll fix it for daddy.  
And then you take it to him because he wants to bless your brother.  
Take this thing to him.  
The boy said, Mom.  
What if, now, look at this woman.  
She's going to take a risk.  
This is a terrible risk.  
And she knows it.  
The boy said, Mom,  
 What if daddy finds out and I get me a curse instead of a blessing?  
She said, don't worry.  
If there's any curse, it will be on me.  
See that?  
She's going to take a risk.  
Don't worry.  
How many times has that happened when there's a guy in the house, a young guy wanting to travel out of the country?  
 Who does he tell?  
Mommy.  
Daddy doesn't want him to travel out.  
Daddy wants him to finish his school.  
So he tells Mom.  
Mom connives, colludes.  
And says, don't worry, we'll do it.  
And she doesn't tell Daddy.  
Helps him travel out of the country.  


  
 That is looking for him.  
She pretends she doesn't know what's happening.  
She joins him to be looking for... for Juneau.  


  
And you know what?  
Oh, it cost Rebecca something.  
After this whole thing, she never saw Jacob again.  
Once Jacob fled for his life.  
 That was the last time she saw Jacob.  
And that's what has happened in many families like that.  
The guy went to Russia.  
Mommy never saw him again.  
Whether he's in prison, they don't know.  
Whether he's dead, they don't know.  
What has happened to him, they don't know.  
Fiveritism, competition, insensitivity,  
 Deception.  
So she got the boy.  
She got Jacob to come.  
And the boy said, Mom, you know, my brother is hairy.  
Dad is a smacked man.  
My brother is hairy and I'm smooth.  
He's going to feel me.  
And he will know I'm not the one.  
She said, don't worry.  
She got animal skin.  
 and put on Jacob and said, don't worry, go, go like this.  
And the boy went.  
When he got there, the father said, my son, you are back so soon?  
He said, he lied.  
God was so gracious.  
God was so gracious.  
 Soon as I entered the bush, the animal came out.  
And I killed it.  
And here I am.  
Daddy said, wonderful.  
He said, but just now when you answered me, you sounded like Jacob.  
Who are you?  
He said, Daddy, I'm Iso.  
He said, let me touch you.  
He touched him.  
He felt hairy.  
 He said, hmm, my son really, yes.  
Then he said, let me smell you.  
Because, you know, he's a... Daddy knew he didn't have his butt very frequently.  
He had his smell from the bush.  
You know what I'm talking about.  
So Jacob pretended to be  
 Iso, and his father said, yes, you are the hand of Iso, but the voice of Jacob.  
And he went on and blessed him, and blessed him, and blessed him, listening to the blessing that he gave to Jacob.  
And you can understand what Isaac had planned.  
Isaac was sure that Iso, the firstborn,  
 should inherit all of the Abrahamic blessing.  
He said, I've given you plenty of corn and wine, and all your mother's children will be under you.  
Nations will bow to you.  
He says, your authority is yours everywhere you go.  
 By that, in his mind, he had placed Jacob under him in spite of what God said the elder shall serve the younger.  
This is what favoritism does.  
Irrespective, he was insensitive to God's spiritual plan.  
And when he gave all his blessings to Jacob, without knowing he thought it was hisa,  
 Now, my son, you can go.  
Soon as he went out, he saw King.  
Daddy, I'm back.  
The Bible says that Isaac trembled greatly.  
He trembled greatly.  
Why?  
He knew he had done something terrible.  
He trembled greatly.  
 I was as he shook greatly.  


  
He said, who came here?  
Who are you?  
I am your son, Iso, your firstborn Iso.  
He said, who came here?  
Someone has told him your blessing.  
He said, Daddy, what?  
He said, your brother came here.  
 and deceived me, and I have given him the blessing, and ye he shall be blessed."  
Jesus said, Daddy, at least one blessing should be reserved for me.  
He said, Son, I have given him everything.  
I have made him your Lord.  
Daddy?  
 Not even one, bless it.  
Oh, please bless me.  
Oh, say something.  


  
That is it.  
In your life, you will suffer to live.  
The only way you be successful is through your life's struggle.  
That's what I said to him.  
That you will live by your soul.  
 But that other guy will live by the blessing.  
So you will live by your sword.  


  
Then he said, there will be a lot of hardship.  


  
He says, finally, you will break loose from his authority.  
 Well, that's about all.  


  
He wept.  
The Bible says, though he who sought it with tears, there was no place of repentance.  
Hmm.  
Let's look at this.  
And Mitty has come in.  
 Jacob flees for his life.  
His mom says, come on, come on, come on.  
Your brother is angry.  
He says, he's going to kill you.  
And he says, I'm going to kill him.  
He says, Mark, my words, Daddy, I'll kill him.  
And Daddy, now, too old to do anything about it.  
Mommy says, Jacob, flee for your life.  
Your brother is going to kill you.  
So he disappears.  
 And now, of course, Iso and Mummy enemies.  
Daddy and Mummy enemies.  
Iso and Jacob enemies.  
Family scattered.  
The son, she loved so much, she will never see again.  
It's over.  
What a story.  
What a conflict.  
 The blessing would have still come to Jacob.  
Have they just functioned correctly?  
God had spoken.  
Isaac should have followed what God said.  
But there was favoritism.  
So this will not allow the right decisions to be made.  
 Don't take from someone what God has given to the person.  
We should walk by revelation.  
Walk by revelation.  


  
You see, this was supposed to be a story of hope.  
And it would have come to pass.  
 If they had mixed it with faith and love, but it mixed it with something else.  
Turn to 1 Thessalonians chapter 1.  
1 Thessalonians chapter 1, and I want to read to you verse number 3.  


  
 Remembering without season your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.  
See patience of hope.  
When God speaks to you, when God has given you a vision, when God is given a direction in your heart, let there be patience, the patience of hope.  
And then you can have the work of faith  
 and the labor of love.  
To be patient.  
Don't rush into anything.  
Be patient if hope has gone.  
If it is a hope from his word, then it gives you patience.  
The patience of hope.  
 makes it with the work of faith and labor of love.  
As you work, as you serve the Lord, serve the Lord in love.  
Work in love.  
And function by faith.  
 You know that the Word of God will come to pass in your life.  
You are what God says you are.  
You're living according to His Word.  
You're acting by faith.  
You're living by faith.  
Your hope is set before you and you are patient until the manifestation of the same.  
But why this is awaiting?  
You walk in love towards others.  
Irrespective of how you are treated.  
Praise God.  


  
 Look at Galatians chapter 5, verse 6.  
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision or valid anything nor on circumcision, but faith which worketh by love.  
Faith which worketh by love.  
 That's what matters to God.  
That's what matters in Christ Jesus.  
Faith that functions by love.  
Glory to His name forever.  
Faith that functions by love.  
You know, there's some things you look at in, and they help to instruct you about the things of God.  
Let me look at the certain situation in the Bible.  
 You know, people who have hope and don't mix it with faith and love.  
They can be desperate.  
Like Sarah was desperate.  
Like Rebecca was desperate.  
And sometimes the desperation can lead to enmities.  
Like we saw how that Sarah brought enmity into our family.  
Rebecca brought enmity into our family.  
 And this is how many people have brought enmity into their lives with other people.  
Now you have people you don't like to talk to, you have people you don't, you just can't sit down with, you keep carrying some imagination that they are your enemies, that they don't like you, but you are the one that doesn't like them.  
But you just know they don't like you, why?  
You put A and B and C together,  
 to calculate that they don't like you.  
What really, you are the one that doesn't like them.  
Yeah.  
Did they ever tell you they don't like you?  
No.  
It's the way they treat me.  
Mm-mm.  
It's the way you receive that treatment.  
There are two different things.  
What I say to you and what you hear from me may not be the same.  
Your interpretation may be different.  
 I said, people who have hope without faith and love can be desperate and sometimes wicked and destructive.  


  
In Acts 26, we find something.  
Paul gives a story of his experience.  
 You remember that he had gone to Jerusalem to preach the gospel.  
And he thought that when his people got to hear about this Jesus, everything was going to be all right, but he was wrong.  
Anyway, even the apostles said to him, if you shave your hair,  
 join those who are fasting and they see that you are fasting according to the law.  
They'll let you go.  
They were wrong.  
Paul went to Jerusalem and someone raised an alarm.  
Look at the man that causes everybody to go against our law.  
Then they said, where is he?  
Where is he?  
Where is he?  
It's Paul.  
 The Bible says they caught him and they gave him the beating of his life until he was rescued by the soldiers.  
Well, let's see what happened.  
He appealed to Caesar.  
He had to be transferred to Rome.  
Now, on his way to Rome, first he was brought to the governor.  
A new governor had come in.  
Festus.  
 had taken the place of Felix, the former governor.  
And the King Agrippa came to visit.  
And so Fester said, I have a strange prisoner here.  
I would have said him free because I've looked at everything.  
He did nothing wrong.  
But I have some confusion about their law or some things that they said he did that I can understand this stuff.  
 Can I bring him out to you?  
The king said, oh, yeah.  
I'd like to listen to him.  
So they brought out Paul.  
So can we enter there now?  
OK.  
Acts up to 26.  
Just going to read a few verses now.  
I want you to notice what Paul says.  


  
 From verse 1, chapter 26, the Book of Acts.  
Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself.  
 then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself.  
You see what I like about this?  
Paul was just acting like Jesus.  
Jesus didn't lose his composure.  
Sometimes when we're in trouble, we become upset and unhappy and out of composure.  
Don't even know what to say.  
No.  
 Jesus knew the words to speak.  
Paul was composed.  
He knew exactly what to say.  
He kept his cool.  
He was calm.  
He was collected.  
Nothing was going to drive him crazy.  
Listen to him.  
Then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself.  
I think myself happy King Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things where I am accused of the Jews.  
 Especially because I know thee to be expats in all customs and questions which are among the Jews.  
Listen to his address.  
How cautious.  
Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.  
My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem know all the Jews.  
It says they know, they all know about my manner of life before now.  
 which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify.  
That after the most joyless sect, that means the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.  
And now, this is what I want you to say.  
And now I stand and I'm judged for the hope of the promise made of God onto the fathers.  
 onto which promise are twelve tribes instantly.  
That means constantly serving God day and night.  
The same hope, the promise they hope to come, the promise they are expecting.  
For which they serve God day and night.  
It says, for which hope seek, King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.  
 Why should it be thought that thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead?  
That's a point.  
He said, our people believe they hope that the Christ would come.  
They have a hope for Israel.  
The hope of the Messiah.  
He said, King Agrippa, this is the reason for my bonds because I believe  
 what they hope for.  
Meanwhile, night and day, they are serving God for this same hope.  
He said, why should you think a thing incredible that God should raise the dead?  
They have hope, but no faith.  
Their expectation has come, but they will not accept.  
He says, this is the reason I'm in prison.  
I've done nothing here.  
 It's for that hope.  
You know, sometimes we persecute people who fulfill our dreams.  
Here is something you've been trying to do.  
You've not been able to achieve it.  
There is another fellow probably younger than you.  
Probably maybe he doesn't even respect you that much.  
Then he comes in and fixes the thing.  
He becomes person and non-gratter.  
 Just because he got it right and you didn't quite get it right.  
Now it's competition.  
Now you're angry.  
Now you don't like to see him.  
Are you different from these people?  
No.  
Your frustration has been manifested.  
Your anger has been manifested.  
You have hope, but no faith.  
And now you can't even walk in love.  
 This was why they arrested Paul.  
They wanted Paul dead.  
They said, he's not fit to live.  
Kill him.  
They said, away with him.  


  
Competition.  
These competitions that drive us crazy because of our insatiable desire for constant reassurances.  
 You know what I mean by that?  
We want others to continually reassure us of their love, of their faith in us.  


  
And people like that make a lot of enemies.  
Because there's someone else who probably  
 is doing what we would have liked to do.  
He is the manifestation of my dream.  
See, what I want to be, he has become.  
Now I'm angry.  
Now I'm frustrated.  
I'm pained.  
I don't like to see him.  
 You see, one of the biggest revelations, I said, one of the biggest because it's so big.  
For me, I've not even started to exploit it because it's bigger than any, let me say it.  
I've told you before, but the thing is, it's too big to be comprehended in a natural way.  
God said to me,  
 He said, I create a yawns.  
Can I explain that?  
Let me break it down.  
I was teaching you something about a yawns, a cause of life, you know, Warren's destiny.  
And God said, I create destinies.  
That is to say, I'm not limited.  
If I have a destiny for this man, and I reveal that this is the destiny that I have for him, he says, I'm not limited.  
 to the definition of that destiny.  
It says, I can create a new destiny.  
Now, there's a difference between changing one's course and giving the person a totally new destiny, which means even though God had this plan, even though this plan was a good one, God can create a totally new one.  
How big he is.  
 And when you have an understanding of that, how would you be jealous of someone else?  
It just cannot arise.  
Even when you have failed and everything has gone bad, if you can trust in that God that raises the debt, if you can trust the one who can create new destinies, new aeoms,  


  
 Then you can't be pained by the fact that someone else took your place.  
God can create a new place.  
Hallelujah.  
He can create a whole new place.  
So you see, the whole thing comes back to us.  
It's about how we react.  
It's about the choices we make.  
 It's about how we think.  
God's not a problem.  
He's not limited.  
He's not limited.  
Do you realize only the word of God can give an old man a new life?  
An old man.  
I mean, the guy is already old.  
 But logically, hey, this way, that way, that way, they plan out his life.  
The only thing that gives a man a new life, an old man, is the Word of God.  
A man, at a certain age, cannot change his character.  
You realize that?  
His character is formed, but the Word of God can change his character.  
No matter how old,  
 He can be 90 years old and have new habits cutsy of the Word of God.  
When the Word of God is introduced into him, introduced into his mind, his mind is renewed, his way of thinking is renewed, he's 90 years old.  
But he's thinking differently.  
Why?  
The power of the Word to change a man's mind.  
Hallelujah.  
 be renewed in the spirit of your mind.  
How?  
By the Word of God.  
The Word.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Oh, glory.  


  
 You can make your life worth living.  
You can.  
You can make your life worth living.  
You know, when the sitting things, some seven things that affect unhappy people, that create unhappiness within them, that create this inner conflict, judgment.  
When people are judgmental, you know, they judge others.  
 They don't listen to them.  
They don't give them a chance.  
They judge them.  
I know him.  
He doesn't respect me.  
Okay, can we ask him?  
No, don't ask him.  
You've judged him.  
You don't even want to give him a chance.  
They can't even give him a chance.  
No, he does it every time.  
He does it every month.  
He does it every year.  
What if he has change?  
No, he can't change.  
 We can't give him a chance.  
And we are.  
Okay, let me give you the next words.  
Hatred.  
You know, hatred is of the flesh.  
When you hate someone, it's fleshly.  
And the child of God should not hate anyone.  
No, no, no, I don't hate him.  
Well, hatred, you know, there are manifestations, there are expressions of hatred.  
 If you're expressing it like this, if it backs like a dog and looks like a dog and it's like a dog, it's a dog.  
In other words, the expressions matter.  
You say you don't hate, but you're bringing out all the attributes of hatred.  
Judgment, hatred, bitterness, how bitter are you?  
 And you know, these things log within you and make you unhappy.  
Let me explain something to you.  
Years ago, in the Bible days, and Isaac experienced the same thing.  
In the Bible days, when an invading force came in to take your land, one of the ways of frustrating you was to stop up your wares.  
 They went to your wares where you got water from.  
Because water was a kind of a spring of life.  
So they went to your wares and it stopped up your wares.  
They put dirt into your wares, closed up your wares.  
You see that?  
They closed up your wares.  
Now, do you realize that in your spirit you have this wares of living water?  
Do you know that?  
 You know that in your spirit are these wells of salvation?  
You realize that?  
Now, if Satan wants to ensure that the joy of Christ is not expressed in your life, that the happiness that you should live with which you should minister to other people is not expressed in your life, all he has to do is to use this dirt of judgment and hatred and bitterness to stop up your wares.  
 And you find that you can express yourself happily because you're judgmental.  
See, there's hatred, bitterness, jealousy.  
Jealousy.  
These are those silent, silent treatments that you give to some people.  
But it's because you're jealous.  
Nothing she ever does is appealing to you.  
 You even struggle to please her.  
You even have to struggle.  
You fight within you.  
You have to go beyond your resistance to say hello to her.  
You understand, it's even an act of faith for you to greet her properly.  
It's a fight within you.  
You have to now go.  
Hi, hi.  
Your hair is nice.  
The inside you use this bitterness.  
You resent doing it.  
You don't like to do it, but you have to do it.  
Your hair is nice.  
 And then when you finish like, I mean, you went through a lot to make that happen.  
And then she doesn't even appreciate it very much.  
That bites you.  
You feel like, God, Jesus, forgive me.  
Why is your life like that?  
The unhappiness is back to you, within you.  
Why?  
Why?  


  
 Jealousy.  
Jealousy.  
And you know sometimes the people who are jealous of, the people who are bitter against, don't even know.  
And they don't even care.  
And they are so happy with themselves.  
You know they don't care about us.  
And that pains.  
Because we want them to know we don't like them.  
Then in your heart, when they get into trouble, that's good.  
 And when God sees that, He frees them from trouble.  


  
Then you come out of trouble and you're not happy about it.  
You're secretly happy when they fail.  
Secretly happy when they are rejected.  
Secretly happy when they are pained.  
And God sees your heart.  


  
 When you bow your knees to pray, and God is telling you pray for him or pray for her, you just say, it's better for me to keep quiet.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, walk in love.  
 I told you, I can't have someone I don't like.  
It's not possible.  
Why?  
Because I've made up my mind a long time ago in the Word of God.  
I can't have someone I don't like.  
Listen, I didn't say I don't have someone I dislike.  
Are you getting me?  
I'm not saying I don't dislike anybody.  
That's not what I'm saying.  
Why?  
That is too low.  
 No, I can't stoop down to be arguing whether I dislike someone or I don't dislike someone.  
No, I'm going up to the higher one.  
That means I like anyone, everyone.  
What about those who mistreat you?  
That don't mean nothing to me!  
Because you can't hurt me.  
You made me streak me, but I can't be hurt.  
I can't be hurt.  
Why?  
Because I know more than anybody hears that what I am God made me so.  
 And so if anybody doesn't like it, he's got to fight with God.  
And that's got nothing to do with me.  
So that makes me free.  
I can't be resentful.  
I can't be bitter.  
If someone does something against me, it doesn't mean anything to me.  
Why?  
Because, hey, come on.  
No one will come see the pastor, Chris, if not because of what the Holy Ghost has done in his life.  
Nobody will think about me.  
 Nobody, nobody, nobody would remember me.  
I was a very quiet little guy.  
Very quiet, I played on my own.  
If I was in the room, you didn't know it.  
I was very quiet, yeah.  
So nobody would have cared.  
I would not have been anything.  
So for someone to criticize me, my goodness, who am I?  
You mean they criticize me?  
Wow, I must be something.  
 Hallelujah.  
See, me?  
They even talking about me.  
You know, they think, if you say something bad about Pastor Chris, Pastor Chris feels bad.  
No, he doesn't.  
He wonders that you would even take time to think about it.  
Yeah.  
Because God called me.  
God anointed me.  
God sent me.  
And I know.  
See, I know.  
 So as soon as any fabric is gotten, that's between him and God.  
I don't care.  
Leave them alone.  
Let them have the fact with God.  
But I'm going to enjoy my life.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm going to enjoy my life.  
I don't enjoy every moment, every day.  
That's what it is.  
And that's what it's supposed to do.  
 Think about what others think about you or what they say about you.  
They don't count.  
They don't matter.  
One day you're going to stand before Jesus Christ and you will answer for yourself.  
You will answer for yourself.  
And they will not be allowed to question you.  
And they will not be allowed to make any comments.  
It's all about Jesus.  


  
 Glory to God.  
So why don't you enjoy your trip of life?  
Enjoy it.  
Relish the moment.  
Enjoy it.  
Enjoy yourself.  
What?  
Enjoy yourself.  
Enjoy what you look like.  
Yeah.  
Enjoy you.  
Be glad about you.  
 Yeah.  
You don't have to feel like laughing just before long you will laugh more.  
Say ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
 You say, I'm a success.  
Payama.  


  
Listen, have you heard of what they said is raining now?  
You say, I'm the one.  
I'm the one.  
Ha, ha, ha.  
Whoo.  
I'm the one.  
Hallelujah.  
Say, I'm the one.  
I'm the one raining.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Yeah.  
Have you heard of something that is raining?  
Say something.  
It's me.  
Yeah, I'm the one.  
I'm the one.  
I'm the one.  
I'm raining.  
I'm raining with the king.  
I'm raining with the king.  
I'm raining with the king.  
I'm raining with the king.  
I'm raining with the king.  
I'm raining with the king.  
I'm raining with the king.  
 Hallelujah.  


  
Yeah.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to His name forever.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hm.  
Hallelujah.  
 So I said, judgment, hatred, bitterness, jealousy, resentment.  
Have you written that down?  
Resentment, unforgiveness, and finally competition.  
These are seven things you must not allow in your spirit.  
Charge them and send them out of your heart.  
Don't give them a place in your life.  
 Let me tell you something, every person that relates to you whether good or bad was placed there in your journey of faith, placed there by God for your benefit.  
Whether they are helping you  
 All they think that it gives you doesn't make any difference.  
It's all part of the same plan of God to promote you.  
Therefore, be happy about them irrespective of who they are, whether they play, see, where I said the playwright of many years ago,  
 The world is a stage where men and women are actors.  
They have their entrances and their exits.  
You know, on that stage of life, everyone has this role.  
Some are to play the good guys, some are to play the bad guys, or resolve in the script.  
 And you are the warning focus.  
So whether they play the good guys or they play the bad guys, one thing is certain.  
You will come out victoriously.  
So let them do what they've got to do.  
 But you've got to do what you've got to do.  
They have their roles.  
You have your role.  
Go back to the script and find everyone's role.  
You will find the bad guys in the script.  
You will find the good guys in the script.  
But choose your own part and act it out.  
Did you hear me?  
Don't try to act another person's role in the script.  
 Look for your role in the script.  
And play yours.  
Don't get concerned.  
Say, they've got to do what they've got to do.  
If they're going to dislike you, that's their role.  
They're going to hate you, that's their role.  
They're going to be angry with you, that's their role.  
They've got to do what they've got to do.  
 But you've got to do what you've got to do.  
That's what the three Hebrew boys said.  
They said, oh, Nebuchadnezzar, we don't care about answering you in this matter.  
You do what you've got to do.  
Set up your fire.  
Light your fire.  
They said, well, we will not bow because we have our own role.  
Our God is able.  
If he doesn't who play our role, we still will not bow.  
 And Nebuchadnezzar said, all right, I'm going to do what I've got to do.  
You do what you've got to do.  
You've got the strongest men in the army to throw them into the furnace.  
Haven't been made seven times harder.  
And once they were cast in, they went and said, oh, let go of me.  
No.  
They went into the fire, fell down, being bound, hands and feet.  
But then the bands broke.  
 and burnt.  
They got up walking in the midst of the fire.  
The Fort man joined them.  
And Nebuchadnezzar had them blow his mind.  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
Say, I've got to do what I've got to do.  
As they've got to do what they've got to do.  
I play my role.  
And I'll play fine.  
I know the script.  
 I will walk according to the script.  
Oh hallelujah, shout amen to somebody.  
Glory to God.  
Magnify God.  
Worship Him.
