 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Praise God forevermore.  
In one simple sentence, what would you say you've learned so far?  
What?  


  
To enjoy your life, right?  
Yeah.  
 Yeah, that's what we're talking about.  
God wants you to enjoy your life because if you're not enjoying your life, you cannot help someone else enjoy his life.  
See, Jesus sent us to preach the gospel.  
He called it gospel.  
Gospel means good news.  
And if it's good news, it means it produces good things, right?  
If it produces good things,  
 then good things ought to make us happy, and joyful, and prosperous, and successful, right?  
Sure.  
Sure.  
So if we understand the gospel of Jesus Christ, we realize that  
 The man died to give us something, not to take something away from us.  
He died to give us something.  
He said, I am come that they might have and enjoy life.  
And you know, that's the part of it that most never got.  
To have it in the hold.  
To have it and enjoy it.  


  
 Enjoying your life is not about going for a game show.  
Enjoying your life doesn't mean that you're going to the beach.  
It doesn't mean that you go for winter shopping.  
Enjoying your life doesn't mean that you're taking a walk with friends or something of that nature.  
It means enjoying every moment.  
Enjoying where you are.  
 What you're doing, whether you're working or playing, whatever it is, you enjoy it.  
You take pride in yourself because you're a child of God and God is fulfilling his dream through you.  
 And some need to realize we're not all the same, and we will not approach life the same way.  
What is strain us to someone may be easy for another.  


  
What may be expensive to a certain person over here may be cheap for another.  
 We're not all the same.  


  
One prays to God with a lot of shouting.  
Another one prays to God, calmly.  
The same God hears them, right?  
There are those who must pray for several hours every day if they're going to feel all right.  
 There are some who may not spend that long in prayer, and they'll still be alright.  
But for those who will not pray at all, they got a problem.  


  
Some people feel guilty if they don't study up to five chapters of the Bible every day.  
 The conscience be bruised, the conscience be wounded because they didn't make five chapters in a day.  
They're used to making five chapters every day.  
And when they miss that, they got a problem.  
They're sad, they're frustrated, they're unhappy.  
Some others can't even go full chapter, except if it's Psalm 133.  


  
 You see, so the fact that you are not exactly like someone else and you're not putting in as much effort as someone else doesn't mean something is wrong with you.  
You've got to recognize that.  
We're not all the same.  
 And the way your faith operates may not be the way another person's faith operates.  
And you have to learn to accept yourself first.  
Until you learn to accept yourself, you cannot make improvement on yourself.  
 We should make improvements.  
We should grow.  
The Bible tells us to grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  
So we should grow in grace.  
We should grow in understanding, grow in knowledge, but not with frustration.  
Growth is like a journey.  
 And while you're on the journey, you can enjoy the journey, enjoy the process.  
While you're learning to go from studying half a chapter to studying three chapters a day, while you're learning that, you can enjoy your life between half a chapter and three chapters.  
Rather than getting frustrated, thinking something wrong with you,  
 and not able to make what you want your dream.  
Your dream might be to pray a certain number of minutes or hours every day.  
You wanna make that happen for yourself.  
We're talking about 15 minutes a day when we pray, right?  
And some people can't even, they said they didn't know 15 minutes was so long.  
Because every three minutes they check the time and they can't imagine what?  
 It's still three minutes.  


  
For some others, that's too short.  


  
Whatever you think about it, you would always want to do a little more, right?  
Even if you were spending three hours in prayer, you'd want to do a little more because if you truly enjoy your fellowship with the Lord,  
 you'd want to do more of it.  
So if you ever want to add anything to what you do to your progress, don't do it out of frustration.  
 You know, years ago, I was shown in church about people who fight all the time.  
Their life is a life of fighting.  
They're struggling all the time.  
You see, when they went through school, it was through prayer and fasting and casting out devils that they passed their exams.  
 When they were going to graduate, they needed prayer and fasting and casting out of devils to graduate.  
And then to get a job, it was prayer and fasting and casting out devils to get a job.  
Then they wanted to get married.  
It was prayer and fasting and casting out devils they got married.  
After that, to have the first child prayer and fasting, casting out a devil.  
And then the second child didn't come.  
And they started again praying and fasting and casting out devils.  
You see, their life is a life of war.  
That's all they've known.  
 They're battle ready all the time.  
It's fight and fight and fight.  
They haven't understood how to walk in their inheritance in Christ Jesus.  
And so sometimes when they see people like us who seem to have everything just going easy without having to struggle, they say that can't be real.  
Something's wrong.  
That can't be real.  
They think something's wrong.  


  
 I don't think that Jesus gave up so much to leave us still fighting.  
What do you think?  
Do you think he did so much to leave us still fighting?  
Fighting for our health, fighting for our peace,  
 Fighting for our success?  
Fighting to be happy?  
Just fighting all the time?  
It's all war with God.  
Fighting!  
No.  
No.  
Change your way of thinking.  
No.  
God loves us.  
Hallelujah.  
 It does.  
He does.  
Glory to his name forever.  
OK.  
I want to read you a portion of the Bible.  
Samadhi's gospel chapter number 18.  
Samadhi's gospel chapter number 18.  
 I want to read from verse one.  


  
At the same time came the disciples on the Jesus saying, who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?  
What a question.  
Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?  
 And Jesus called a little child unto him and said him in the news of him and said, Verily, I say unto you, accept ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.  
Remarkable.  
I want to read it to you from the amplified version so you can know where we got the  
 the points we want to raise from, okay?  
From the Amplified, it's a reason.  
At that time, from verse 1, at that time the disciples came up and asked Jesus, who then is really the greatest into kingdom of heaven?  
 And he called a little child to himself and put him in the midst of them and said, truly, I say to you, unless you repent, change, turn about, and become like little children, notice what he says in parenthesis.  
He says, trusting, lowly, loving, forgiving.  
Those are the four important virtues I want to talk about.  
 how important they are, because Jesus said, except to become that way, you cannot enter the kingdom of heaven.  
So we're again from verse three.  
It says, Jesus said, truly, I say to you, unless you repent, change, turn about, and become like little children, meaning trusting,  
 lowly, loving, forgiving, you can never enter the kingdom of heaven at all.  
Did you know these are all?  


  
That means don't even think about it.  


  
 So in the fourth verse, he says, whoever will humble himself, therefore, and become like this little child trusting, lowly, loving, forgiving his greatest in the kingdom of heaven.  
Wow, wow, wow.  
Oh, he's given us something to measure our zeroes with.  
 Am I trusting?  
You see, to be trusting and to be gullible are not the same.  
There are gullible people who think they are trusting.  
Children are not gullible.  
Children are trusting.  
There's a difference between being gullible and being trusting.  
Being gullible means that you're easily persuaded.  
Children are not easily persuaded.  
 Children trust your character.  
They trust the person.  
You see, adults can be gullible because they reason out what you say to trust it.  
They don't care who's behind the words.  
They don't care about the character of the man who's talking to them.  
That's why the public can be deceived by politicians.  
 See that?  
Because the public can be gullible.  


  
And they can trust the politicians.  
And then the politicians failed to deliver.  
And then they voted in the next time.  
Because they said last time we made a mistake.  
 vote again this time or make sure we do what we said.  
And then they vote back in and the mistakes just continue.  
So the public can be gullible.  
Children are not gullible.  
They are trusting.  
They trust the character.  
They believe in you.  
See that?  
 That's the difference.  
And that's what Jesus is talking about, that you've got to believe in God, like a child, believe in his character.  
If you hold a child up on the balcony and as someone else whom he trusts to stand down here and catch him, you trust.  
He will ready to let go because he trusts the man down there.  
 Because he knows him.  
He doesn't know whether he's got the power.  
He just trusts that that one will not let him fall.  
So he'll be ready to go.  
But the adult needs the calculations.  
And you can calculate for him and mislead him.  
And then he'll let, OK, I'll go.  
He's gullible.  
And then he'll fall down and get wounded.  
 Because it's Godable.  
So Jesus is not advocating for us to be gullible.  
He's advocating for us to be trusting.  
All right?  
We can trust the character of God.  
Do you want to know the character of God, study the Bible?  
His character is revealed in his word.  
Praise God.  
Okay.  
The more you study the word, the more you are acquainted with God's character.  
So he says, trusting.  
 What is it to be lonely?  
It means to condescend without condescending.  
You know what that means?  
You can condescend without being condescending.  


  
 It means to be humble.  


  
Children are not high-minded.  


  
They've accepted themselves in, they've accepted other people at face value.  


  
 Are you following this?  


  
Then it says, loving.  


  
What is it to be loving?  
 Simple appreciation with benevolence, looking for the good of others.  
See, that appreciative, benevolent, characteristic that seeks the good of others.  
That's what he's talking about, that's love.  


  
 And then he says, forgiving.  


  
Can you pass over a warrant?  
Can you let someone else go free who's offended you?  
Can you overlook hurts?  
Are you gonna record them?  
Wait for the next time.  
 like a lady wouldn't forget what the husband did to her in 1962.  


  
And it was 1996.  
She wouldn't forget.  
And she said, I'll never forget.  
And she couldn't forget.  
And you'd be amazed the kind of thing that she's talking about.  
 He was angry with her somewhere and left her there and walked away.  
And she would never forget it.  
They went on a visit.  
Trouble came.  
He got angry and left her there and walked away.  
She later went and met him at home, not like he never came back.  
No, but she would never forget how he walked out on her.  
 1962.  
It's 1996 and she will not forget.  
You know what I'm talking about?  
It's the way some people are very unforgiving, intolerant.  
They're pained.  
Pained deeply.  
They can't forget.  
 It covers the things that control that character.  
And that's why a lot of people look very unhappy in life.  
They look much older than they really are.  
I think I should show you one scripture.  
And looking at this, I'm hoping to help you learn to heal in our conflicts.  
 See, the reason sometimes we have problems with other people is not because they are what they are and we've got problems between our character and their character.  
No, it's because we've got inner conflicts.  
And we are being, when we are unable to resolve our own inner conflicts, we thank our anger and frustration on other people.  


  
 And then you find protracted quarrels, protracted enmities.  
Even when they reconcile today, just give them a month or two, they're back to enmities.  
Because they have inner conflicts on result.  
The problem is not outside, the problem is inside.  
 So even when you bring them together and reconcile them, give them a little time.  
The problem will come back.  
Because the problem is not really between the two of them, it is inside.  
They need inner healing.  
Are you still there?  
OK, let me read you a scripture.  
I said, you can only make others happy when you are yourself happy.  
 You can make others joyful when you are joyful.  
You can make others successful when you are successful.  
I can make people successful because I'm successful.  
I have success inside and I've transpired to other people.  
That's what Jesus sent us to be.  
Yeah, we should be effective.  
That's what he wants.  
And that's what each one of us should be.  
 Irrespective of our assignments, irrespective of where we live, what we do.  
Okay.  
I want us to read.  
Proverbs.  


  
Chapter 17.  


  
 In verse 22, chapter 17, verse 22.  
Are you there?  
I read to you from the King James verse, a merry heart do it good like medicine, but a broken spirit dry at the bones.  
You know, there are people who want to put on weight, they can't put on weight.  
No, they can't.  
They're too sad to put on weight.  
They're too unhappy to put on weight.  
It doesn't matter what they eat.  
 Mm-hmm.  
You might just be sitting down here and thinking, maybe that's why brothers and sisters.  
But who says that might not be the problem?  
It just could be.  
Who knows?  
I mean, if you're eating all you need to eat, as much as you need to eat, and it's not working, chances are, you're not a very happy person.  
Say, I know I'm very happy.  
 Maybe you're not a very happy person.  
Maybe you're not.  
Oh, is happiness measured by our size?  
Is it that those who are biggest are happiest?  
Suddenly not.  
No, that's not what I'm talking about.  
OK, let me read you from the Amplified.  
It says, a happy heart is good medicine.  
Wow.  


  
 If some people knew that that is a good cure for cancer, if they knew, they would apply it.  
But many are not away.  
Cancer triumphs and thrives, where people are sad and focusing on the cancer and trying to fight the cancer, and worrying with the cancer, saddened by the cancer.  
That promotes the cancer.  
 Because cancer has life from bitterness, anger, resentment, and so on.  
But cheerfulness, laughter, you know, laughter is an expression of joy, is one of the earliest, fastest, quickest expressions of joy.  
How many people have cancer and laugh?  
 Not many.  
And yet the Bible says, in the face of destruction, thou shalt laugh.  
So he says.  


  
But not many know how to laugh when they've got trouble.  
When they have a problem, they don't laugh.  
Well, laugh is a healer.  
It's curative.  
 Look at this.  
He says, a happy heart.  
How do you know somebody is happy?  
How do you know?  
How do you know?  
The expression is on his face.  
He's in his words, in his tone of voice.  
You can tell he's happy.  
He's exultant.  
You can tell.  
And he says, that happy heart is good medicine.  
 And a cheerful mind works healing, a cheerful mind.  
Do you have a cheerful mind?  
You see, you don't pray for this happiness.  
You don't pray for this cheerfulness.  
You put them to work.  
Learn to make yourself happy with the Word of God.  
 Remember, the foot of the spirit is what?  
Love?  
And then the next one?  
Joy.  
Joy.  
So it's in your spirit.  
When you're born again, you've got joy in your spirit to think, well, what if someone is not joyful?  
If you're not joyful, one of two things.  
The first one is, maybe you're not even born again.  
Because if you're born again, it's automatic.  
It's one of the features in the package.  
It's there.  
 Okay, maybe you're born again and still you're not joyful.  
The only other reason is you're ignorant.  
And God says my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge.  
Ignorance.  
You're ignorant of what you've got inside.  
You're not putting it to work.  
Put it to work.  
 If you're ignorant, you may not be able to operate something.  
See, I was trying to operate something one time.  
And this glass was something that's covered with a large glass, you know?  
And I'm frosting it and trying to open it.  
And I'm trying.  
And it's not opening.  
And I start getting frustrated and angry.  
Oh, why would these people make this kind of a thing without a handle?  
I'm used to holding the thing, pulling it out with a handle.  
And it wouldn't open.  
I tried every way.  
I said, what is all this nonsense?  
 Now I'm getting angry with a manufacturer.  
These brainless people.  
So I finally booed it out.  
And I said, look, look at this stupid thing.  
This is sad.  
How could I do it like this?  
So now I found how to do it.  
So every time I want to do it, and then my fingers, I said, how could these people do this thing to be so difficult?  
So one day,  
 I was attending to something else, and someone just walked there, pushed it, and it opened.  
I thought, dear Lord Jesus, I was so embarrassed.  
I couldn't say what I'd been experiencing.  
I was so quiet.  
I said, wow.  
He just pushed it, and it opened, and did his stuff, and you know, I said, look at me.  
Ignorance.  
See what I mean?  
 refuse to be ignorant.  
Learn something.  
If you learn it, if you learn to put it to work, it'll produce results.  
And you'll be happy with yourself.  
You'll be fulfilled.  
See, I was frustrated with that thing.  
I thought the manufacturer had some brainless, you know, somebody who, where did they get him from?  
But that was the problem.  
I just needed some information.  
And without information, you can't go very far.  
 You'd be angry with other people, but you are the problem.  
Your ignorance overrides everything.  
It's the same thing in life.  
That's how we do other people.  
Hallelujah.  
You're still there.  
I wonder what you're thinking.  
 All right, let me show you something.  


  
In Philippians chapter four, I'm gonna read from verse six.  


  
From verse six.  
He says, be careful for nothing, but in everything, how many things?  
 How many things?  
Does that include home, work, right?  
Everything?  
Everything.  
Health, money, relationships, everything.  
 Okay, just be careful for nothing.  
But in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanks giving, let your request be made known under God.  
And the peace of God which pass it all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  
Now, I want to read that to you from the amplified version.  
Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything.  
Don't fret about anything.  
 Don't fret about anything.  
I told you about the dread of tomorrow and the regret of yesterday.  
The dread of tomorrow.  
Well, having the general meeting tomorrow.  
It won't you know what everybody has done.  
Tomorrow hasn't even come.  
You're already fretting.  
You're dreading the meeting that's coming tomorrow.  
You're already shaking.  
You already know that you're going to be a victim.  
 And what is he telling you?  
Do not fret or have anxiety about anything.  
But in every circumstance, hallelujah.  
 And in everything, by prayer and petition, definite requests, not, oh, help me, Lord, help me, Lord, help me, Lord, oh, Lord, help me, that's not definite.  
Help about what?  
Oh, God, help me, help me, intervene, intervene, help me.  
He says, definite requests, say exactly what you want.  
Most people never really make a request.  
 They complain.  
Your prayer should not be complaints.  
What requests?  
Definite requests.  
Say definite requests.  
Yeah, what do you want?  
 I studied the life of Jesus in his ministry.  
Always, he asked, he wanted to be sure what they wanted.  
The blind man is crying.  
Son of David, have mercy on me.  
Son of David, have mercy.  
We can do anything.  
No, he said, what do you want?  
He knew the man was blind.  
The man was already crying.  
Have mercy on me.  
Mercy for what?  
He said, what do you want?  
He said, I want to receive my sight.  
Good.  
Definite request.  
And the Lord said, receive your sight.  
That was it.  
 Be definite.  
Be definite.  
God wants your faith, and faith must be definite.  
Praise God.  
Tells somebody fate must be definite.  
Sure.  
So he says, we thanksgiving.  
I like it.  
We thanksgiving.  
 When we pray to God, when we make our requests, we can thank Him ahead of it because we've got faith.  
You see, faith puts us in the position of possession.  
When we make requests to God, definite requests to God in faith, we actually took a whole of that which we have asked for.  
 And that's why we can thank Him.  
See, we are not thanking Him that He is going to do it.  
Faith is thanking Him because we are heard and we are answered.  
That means we got what we requested.  
That's what we're thinking.  
Definite requests with Thanksgiving.  
 You make your requests known to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Now look at verse 7.  
 is that in God's peace shall be yours.  
That tranquil state of a soul assured of its salvation through Christ and so fearing nothing from God and being content with its athlete, lot of whatever sort that is, that peace which transcends all understanding shall garrison and mount God over your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
 the peace of God.  
He says, we'll take charge.  
Mount guard.  
It'll let nothing else come in when you act like this.  
He says, the peace of God will overrule for you.  
Hallelujah.  
Okay.  
Now, let's look at something.  
Sometimes we find our minds are going through lots and lots of thoughts.  
 You almost can't sleep sometimes.  
You can be on your bed, toss and tone from going this way and that way.  
You want to sleep, you turn on the lights and turn off the lights and then you're thinking, you just can't sleep or thinking about that problem.  
You know, there are people who have what you call problem fellowship.  
 Can I explain it to you?  
They fellowship with their problems.  
They don't fellowship with the Holy Ghost.  
They don't know about that.  
They don't fellowship with the Word of God.  
No, they don't know about that.  
They fellowship with their problems.  
They keep ruminating over their problems, sinking through their problems, even muttering.  
Have you ever seen some people?  
 They're not talking to anybody.  
They're just on their own.  


  
And they're not insane.  
They just... Then...  


  
 It'll be nice if it's all positive.  
I mean, you can think positively.  
But if all you think about is one problem after the other, someone hurts you.  
You don't like what's going on.  
And you're thinking about how you're going to make some trouble for them too.  
You're going to be very stubborn so they know you too.  
You're tough.  


  
 the manifestation of inner conflicts.  
In a conflict stop people from sleeping at night, they get arrested at night.  


  
They finally fall asleep and then wake up suddenly to continue the problem in their minds.  


  
Conflicts on resolved.  


  
 You see, let me read something to you.  
You want to do the word you got, right?  
A Christian is one who lives by the word.  
He is a word doa.  
 You understand he does the word, he lives the word.  
The word of God rules your mind.  
Whereas you have been thinking this when you're thinking, I'm gonna act this way, I'm gonna do it this way, then the word of God comes to you.  
You study the word, you search the word, and you find the word wants you to act differently.  
You put away what you were thinking and you think this way.  
That's the way to renew your mind and subject your mind to the word of God.  
 See, so you let the word rule.  
You live according to the word.  
So I wanna read something to you.  
That's verse eight.  
I read it from verse.  
No, no, that's right, I already told you, verse eight.  
Okay, it says, finally, brethren and sisters, can I just make a little punctuation here?  
 The word brethren is a plural, an old English word plural for brother.  
It's an old English word plural for brother.  
 So you may not find it in, today is English, and that's why some make the mistake that I want to try to explain incorrect.  
When they say, I was talking to one bread drink.  
It's not a word for church.  
It's an old English word.  
It's not a church word.  
 I know it's not in the English you studied in school.  
You understand what I'm talking about?  
It's not something we use in our society.  
We're controlled by King James.  
When we use King James, we come to this kind of things.  
So you can say, I was talking to one brethren and he told me, one brethren, you can have one brethren.  
In new English, it would mean one brothers.  
Isn't that such a thing as one brothers?  


  
 So the language didn't include the feminine gender a lot of times.  
And we can understand that.  
So when you read it and you come to brethren, you understand it included both of them.  
But don't see it as a religious word for Christian people.  
 OK, because you're only here in church.  
You never hear brethren at work.  
You never hear in school.  
You're only here in church.  
So we think it's a church thing for God's people.  
All right, finally, brethren.  
He says, whatsoever things are true.  
Whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just,  
 Whatsoever things appear.  
Whatsoever things are lovely.  
Whatsoever things are of good report.  
If there be any virtue.  
And if there be any praise, think on these things.  
 He tells us what to think about, the kind of thoughts we should allow in our hearts.  
Now that doesn't mean that some of the thoughts may not come to you, but when those other thoughts that don't measure up to this come to you, you don't let them stay with you.  
Because they'll change your character.  
God showing you how to build a strong godly character.  
 He says, these are the things you think about.  
These are the things you can dwell your mind on.  
Outside of this, let your mind stay there.  
Already from the amplified, all right?  
I'm making you like the amplified.  
 For the rest, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is worthy of reverence and is honorable and seemingly, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely and lovable.  
 Whatever is kind and winsome and gracious.  
If there is any virtue and excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think on and weigh and take account of these things.  
Fix your minds on them.  
Can you see that?  
These are the things you can fix your mind on.  
So if you're trying to sleep at night and your mind is on,  
 Some terrible debate.  
Somebody said something to you.  
Some pain you endured on the day.  
That wouldn't measure up with this.  
Don't fix your mind on that.  
Change your thoughts.  
So what if you're trying to change your thoughts?  
And the thoughts just wouldn't go?  
Oh, come on.  
I thought you received the Holy Ghost.  
That's one of the things it came to help you do.  
It came to help you achieve focus.  
 Anything you want to focus your mind on by the power of the Holy Spirit, you can.  
He's your helper.  
He's your helper.  
Yeah.  
You know, one of the things that people could ask about, how can I put the power of the Holy Spirit to work?  
How can I?  
You know, it's not like you.  
 You're gonna put your hand on something and switch it on, you know?  
When we talk about the power of the Holy Spirit, it's not like we've got a physical switch.  
And so we're thinking, okay, how can I put that to work?  
How can I put the power of the Holy Spirit to work?  
It's very simple.  
The first thing is, do you recognize that you have the Holy Spirit in your life?  
Do you say yes?  
Okay, if you do,  
 Then, whatever he tells you to do, do it.  
If he says, praise God instead of mourning, praise God instead of weeping, praise God instead of being bitter, then praise God.  
Whatever he tells you to do, do it.  
That's the secret.  
And then, when you do what he says to do,  
 You will be doing it by His power, even though you didn't realize that it was by His power.  
Then put this way so you can understand it better.  
They are in Cana of Galilee.  
They've run out of wine.  
It's a marriage ceremony.  
And married a mother of Jesus is there.  
Jesus also was invited to the ceremony.  
 No more wine.  
And they're thinking what to do because they still got a lot of guests.  
Now, Mary comes to Jesus and says, they don't have any more wine.  
And the Lord says, all right.  
And you know what?  
Mary gets the servants.  
 and says to them, she already knows this thing.  
She says to them, whatever he tells you to do, do it.  
That's what Mary tells the servants.  
She says, whatever he tells you to do, do it.  
Then Jesus, my goodness, Jesus does these servants and says to them, okay, come this way.  
 fill these water parts with water.  
And their eyes bulge out of the sockets.  
You know why?  
Because those water parts were the water parts by the door where people washed themselves before coming in.  
It's not clean.  
It's dishwater.  
So Jesus has filled them up with water.  
So  
 But Mary said, whatever he tells you to do, do it.  
So to fill them up with water, then he says... He says, all right, take a glass and take it to the master of ceremony.  
He doesn't even start to try it and find out what it's like.  
Take it straight to the boss.  
 So Mary said, whatever he tells you to do, do it.  
So the guy takes it straight to the master of ceremony and gives it to him.  
The man looks at it, tries it.  
He drinks it.  
And he says, man, oh, man.  
He turns to the celebrate.  
He says, it's amazing what you did today.  
You kept the best wine for the last.  
 And the servant, the Baba says the servant knew where the water was from.  
He was amazed because he knew where the water was from.  
Now here's what I want you to notice.  
When the water turned into wine.  


  
The sacred is in doing what God tells you to do.  
 I remember the story of Oral Roberts in a healing service.  
And he was tired.  
The meeting had ended now.  
And he is ready to quit.  
And the lady comes with her son.  
And beckoning the man of God to please help, please heal my son.  
The boy couldn't walk.  
Oral said, I'm tired.  
I've got to go.  
 Oh, please pray for my son.  
She actually said, just touch him.  
And he said something.  
He said, I'm too tired to believe.  
I'm too tired now to have faith.  
The lady said to him, I'm not asking you to believe.  
 I'm just asking you to pray.  
She said, you do the brain and let me do the believing.  
And R said, OK.  
And touched a guy and mumbled some words and went away.  
Came back the next day.  
And the one who was conducting the service was taking the testimony.  
 And the first one he calls up is a little boy who could walk and was here yesterday.  
And he had the boy running up and down the platform.  
And all was amazed.  
And he remembered the words of the woman.  
You do the praying.  
How do they believe it?  
Come on here.  
Are you still there?  
Yeah.  
Yours is to do what God called you to do.  
 That's it.  
When we pray, the one who needs something has the responsibility of believing.  
For example, he says, and they shall lay hands on the sick and the sick shall recover.  
He didn't say, and they shall lay hands on the sick and try to believe for them.  
No, they are already believing once.  
My believing ones shall lay hands on the sick.  
 So, believing wants is not talking about believing about the prayer.  
It's not talking about believing about the healing.  
It's not about believing in Him, Jesus.  
So it says, the signs will follow them.  
They shall lay hands on the sick and the sick shall recover.  
So, their responsibility is to lay their hands.  
It's to honor the words.  
That's why when you study in the New Testament, after the  
 Resurrection of Lord Jesus Christ, you don't find the church being excited to have faith.  
Jesus talked about faith, they gave all the teaching about faith, before his crucifixion.  
After his resurrection, we're not told to have faith.  
We're not counseled to have faith.  
Why?  
Because faith was dared to us when we received the Gospel.  
 Since God has dared to every man, Romans chapter 12, verse 3, the measure of faith, the measure of faith.  
Not a measure, but the measure.  
Every one of us got the same measure when we received Christ into our hearts.  
Christ came into our spirits, into our hearts, into our lives with the quality and quality of faith that we require for a successful life.  
 And then you now put that faith to work.  
You act your faith.  
You put your faith to work.  
You stretch it.  
Do it.  
Use it.  
And grow it is up to you.  
But the smallest amount of faith, that small amount of faith that you got, that basic amount of faith Jesus said was powerful enough to move mountains.  
To do the impossible.  
Hallelujah.  
 Are you still there?  
Glory to God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
So did you notice what to think about?  
Hmm?  
Hmm.  
Think on these things, he says.  
I want to read that same portion to you from the living Bible.  
I love the living Bible.  
 You know why?  
It's so sweet.  
As a young Christian, that was the Bible that I used most of the time, because it spoke everyday language to me.  
All right, can I read that to you?  


  
I read from verse six, all the way to verse eight.  
 Don't worry about anything.  
Instead, pray about everything.  
Isn't that fresh?  
Tell God your needs.  
And don't forget to thank him for his answers.  
I like that.  
You know, when it says, we Thanksgiving, it sounds big.  
But when it says, don't forget to thank him.  
 That's simple.  
Then he says, if you do this, you will experience God's peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand.  
His peace will keep your thoughts and your hearts quiet and at rest as you trust in Christ Jesus.  
Then he goes, and now brothers, as I close this letter, that's what King James is finally, brethren.  
So he says, and now brothers, as I close this letter,  
 Let me say this one more thing.  
Fix your thoughts on what is true and good and right.  
Think about things that appear and lovely and dwell on the fine, good things in others.  
Dwell on the fine, good things in others, in other people.  
Can you find something good in other people?  


  
 Frustrated people can't look for good things in other people, because they're frustrated and they can't find good things in the MCRs.  
They should always pick on others.  
You say, so and so is so nice.  
You say, but he's very fat.  
Why?  
So and so is so nice.  
But he doesn't dress well.  
 So and so is so nice.  
But I don't like the way he does some things.  
He says, always, they interject and say something negative into it.  
So if you tell them, oh, that person is so nice.  
He says, but he smears somehow.  
Always the something negative that comes out of them.  
I'll show you why.  
It's in the book.  
 But now, see, the Word of God's telling you, he says, dwell on the fine, good things in others.  
Listen, this is not about other people, it's about you.  
What we're dealing with here is not how you can make other people happy.  
It's about you living a successful life.  
This is about you and not about others.  
 The reason it tells you to dwell on the fine good things in others is not because of them, it's because of yourself.  
So you can be prosperous and so successful and be that man or woman that God planned for you to be.  
He's talking about you.  
You're not doing it for them.  
When you learn to compliment good things in other people, it's not about them at all, it's about you.  
It's about building a strong, positive character.  
 That's what it's about.  
It's about learning to notice those good things that God has placed in other people.  
It's about you building yourself.  
It's about you being joyful.  
You're not doing it for them.  


  
You know, sometimes we think that it's too much, you know, it's too expensive for us to pay a compliment.  
 It's too expensive for me to say, oh, I like your necktie.  
It's too expensive.  
I can't give it because I'm going to make him happy.  
If I say that dream, he's going to be too happy.  
You see, my compliments are expensive.  
I don't give them out easily.  


  
But the result of that is you keep  
 a frustrated mind.  
Your life will become frustrated because you're not letting an outflow of good things, an outflow of good things, an outflow of good things.  
Hallelujah.  
Think, just think about all you can praise God for and be glad about.  
Think about all you can praise God for and be glad about.  
 Hey!  
When you close from work, what thoughts go through your man?  
Is it all the terrible things that happen?  
No!  
He says, think about all you can praise God for and be glad about.  
What are those things you can praise God for and be glad about?  
Dwell on them.  
Dwell on them.  
Instead of having the responsibility of trying, you know, you can try so hard to please other people, even your boss.  
 You may be trying hard to please someone.  
And it becomes frustrating when you're trying so hard and your efforts are not rewarded.  
You're ignored.  
Again and again.  
You're ignored as though you're not there.  
But you're trying hard.  


  
You say, what should I do?  
Should I stop trying?  
 Yes, start enjoying your work.  
Start enjoying it.  
Understand that being successful is not about pleasing other people.  
It's about bringing out the best in yourself.  


  
Listen and listen hard.  
You know why some people prefer a small church?  
 When a church is growing, they leave.  
They can't stand a large church.  
Why?  
Because they shine when people are few.  
The moment the church is growing, they leave.  
Because they feel they'll become insignificant.  
Because they feel they'll be recounted by others.  
 They can't stand it.  
They can't stay in a large church.  
They can't stay in a place that's growing.  
It outgrows them too quickly.  


  
Because they think that except they are known on one and one by the bus, they will never have progress  
 They would never be recognized.  
But they are wrong.  
Very wrong.  
Let me tell you something.  
Do you realize that sometimes those who are closest to the boss are the last to get a promotion?  
A lot of times they are not even considered.  
They are often the last to be considered.  
Until you become a leader, you may not know.  
 You may not know that that's actually what happens.  
They're not the first to be considered.  
It's not those who are close around you that are the first.  
No, they're often the last to even get it.  
I'll tell you something about progress, promotion, recognition.  
You need to realize that your uniqueness  
 is such that no one in the world could ever be like you.  
It's not possible for you to be... to be hidden because it's a crowd.  
No.  
 Follow the principles of Jesus.  
He said, let your light so shine.  
That's what he said, your light.  
Let your light so shine.  
He didn't let your voice be so loud.  
He didn't let your voice be so loud.  
He said, let your light so shine.  
Did he say before the boss?  
No!  
Before the king?  
No!  
 Let your light so shine before the lead us.  
No.  
Let your light so shine before men.  
Wherever.  
It doesn't matter who they are.  
Let your light so shine.  
Where was Joseph?  
When the king was told about him, where was he?  
In the prison.  
In the prison.  
 The King heard about him while he was in the prison.  


  
Are you in this place?  
Follow the simple principles of Jesus.  
If you want to know anything about success, listen to Jesus.  
He has all the principles.  
 He said, let your light so shine before me that they may see your good works.  
And they will promote you?  
No.  
He said, they will give glory to God.  
Where does promotion come from?  
God.  


  
When things start happening because of you and others have been affected, it'll be difficult for that thing not to be known.  
 in the process of time.  
It'll be hard.  
Just do what you do.  
Whatever it is, he says, let your life so shine before men that they may say your good works and glorify your father that's in heaven.  
That's what matters.  
Don't be a man, please, huh?  
Do what's right.  
 It will speak for you.  
It's just a matter of time.  


  
So one says, oh, brother, you missed your opportunity.  
So no, I don't miss opportunities.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm on God's timetable.  
I run on God's schedule.  
Hallelujah.  
I may not be on a man's schedule, but I'm running on God's schedule.  
 Hallelujah.  
No, I don't miss opportunities.  
I'm running on God's schedule.  
Ho, ho, ho, hallelujah.  
You getting it?  
All right.  
Mm-hmm.  
Okay.  
Moving right along, right?  


  
 I wanna show you something.  
Somebody's gospel, chapter 12.  


  
Again, I'm gonna read to you from the living Bible.  
And this is verse 35.  


  
 This is so important.  
I said, where do people get some of the terrible things they say?  
Where do they get them from?  
Why do they say the kind of words that are hurting, hiding?  
Why?  
You know the Bible tells us that  
 We are feigned in many things.  
And this is what even men are feigned not in words.  
The same is a perfect man.  
Your Christian maturity is measured in your speech.  


  
 But let's look at something here.  
This is very, very interesting.  
Verse 35, a good man's speech reveres the rich treasures weeds in him.  
Oh, glory.  
Before we go on that, can I remind you of something Jesus said in St.  
John's Gospel, chapter seven, when you read from verse 37 to verse 39, the Bible tells us in that last great day of the feast that Jesus spoke, okay, from the temple grounds.  
He spoke out loud.  
 Do you remember?  
When I talked about the Holy Spirit, let's read it.  
I want to show you that first and we'll come back to this.  
I said, John chapter 7, from verse 37.  
 He says, in the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thirsts.  
 Let him come unto me and drink.  
He that believe it on me, as the scripture had said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
But this speck he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified.  
So he was talking about the Holy Spirit.  
He says, out of his belly, he that believe it on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
 Rivers of live in water.  
Live in water.  
Rivers of live in water.  
Out of his belly shall flow.  
Rivers of live in water.  
Oh.  
Oh, what comes out of you?  
What comes out of your belly?  
He's talking about your innermost being.  
What comes out of you?  
Tell me.  
What comes out of you?  
 For some people venom, it's venom that comes out when they speak.  
You wonder where they're being.  
I remember when I was a kid in school, my first day in this school, my first day in class, in this particular school, I had a terrible experience.  
 I think it took God's miracle to keep me from the trauma that I would have experienced because of that particular day.  
You know, I was in class sitting by this guy.  
I was new.  
First day.  
I don't know whether he was new or not, but it paired us to sit together in class.  
 For no reason, this guy told him to me, and he began to insult me.  
God, he spoke.  
Horrors.  
The guy said terrible words, things I never imagined in my life.  
Such bitter words, obscenities.  
 He spoke and spoke.  
I was shocked and amazed at him.  
I was looking, I couldn't even reply him.  
Why, I was so stoned by the bitter words that came out of him.  
I look back now.  
It was like I was listening to the devil.  
I've never heard anybody curse like that.  
He cursed.  
What about you guys?  
 I was eight years old.  
Think about it.  
Eight.  
He was someone maybe about the same age.  
And yeah, he was talking to me.  
He cursed.  
He cursed.  
He was cursing at my parents, your mother, your father.  
He said words.  
I mean, he cursed my brothers and sisters, my whole home.  
He was cursing.  
And I was amazed.  
I was looking at him.  
 I came from a different background.  
We couldn't curse.  
I was stunned.  
Venom.  
What could have, I've thought about it, what could have made that little guy as young as he was?  
Probably eight years old too.  
What could have made him so bitter and enraged and so dirty?  
 How could he have been so dirty?  
Where in the world did he come from?  
God, where are they being?  
Where did he get those words from?  
You know, when I went home, I couldn't tell anybody what I heard.  
The words were too dirty, I couldn't repeat them.  
Till this day, I can't repeat those words.  
They were too terrible to have come from a little guy like him.  
 Even today, an adult would hardly.  
I mean, you have to be possessed of a devil to use those words as an adult.  
And this little boy had them in abundance.  


  
He didn't need a breathing space.  
He just went on and on and on and on and on.  
Praise God.  
 Do your words come from?  
What do you have in you?  
That's what I'm talking about.  
He says, out of his belly shall flow rivers of live in water.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
If you have rivers of live in water flowing out of you, you make others have life.  
Do you understand that?  
You bring healing to others.  
You bring courage to others.  
You bring hope to others.  
You bring strength to others.  
Rivers of live in water.  
Now let's go back to  
 who weren't read in Matthew chapter 12, from verse 35.  
And I'm reading from the living Bible.  
He says, a good man's speech reveals the reach treasures within him.  
Hey, there are treasures within you.  
Now look at this, an evil-hearted man is filled with venom.  
 and his speech reveals it.  
Oh, oh, an evil-hearted man is filled with venom and his speech reveals it.  
See that?  
And I tell you this, that you must give account on judgment day for every other word you speak.  
Your words now reflect your fate then.  
 Either you will be justified by them or you will be condemned.  
Reach treasures within you.  
Either you are full of venom or rivers of living water.  
Do you have living water in you?  
And don't forget what James said.  
Sweet water and bitter water cannot come off the same fountain.  
 Don't forget, it's one or the other.  
You can't have a mix.  
You can't have a mix.  


  
I can't talk dirty.  
No.  
I've got rivers of living water.  
I've got living water in me.  
Rivers of living water.  
Hallelujah.  
They flow in abundance.  
Glory to God.  
 Have you been there when somebody who's frustrated tried to make you pull out venom?  
You say, I don't have venom.  
I can't talk like that.  
I don't have venom.  
And they're producing venom.  
And you say, no, no, no, no.  
I don't have venom.  
I got rivers of living water.  
Living water.  
Ha, yah, yah, yah.  
Living water.  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus, live in water.  
He said, what if someone offended you?  
Hey, Jesus said offenses will come.  
Of course, offenses will come.  
But we're talking today about resolving inner conflicts within you.  
And you know what?  
I'm out of time.  
 So let's pray, glory to His name forever.  
Go ahead and talk to the Lord.
