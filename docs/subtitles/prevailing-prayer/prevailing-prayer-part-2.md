title: Prevailing Prayer Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 You are still watching the International Cell Leaders Conference with the Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
In this segment, learn the importance of focusing your mind in the direction of what you want.  
Also, Pastor Chris teaches on how persistency and prevailing prayer cannot be overemphasized.  
Be blessed as you watch.  
You must focus your mind.  
You see, there are too many people who don't know the importance of the mind.  
 The mind is a massive tool for our benefit.  
That mind is like the rudder that directs a ship.  
See, for your spirit, your mind is so important.  
If you turn your mind away from what you're supposed to be focusing on, your feeling will die.  
 Can you see that?  
For whatever it is, your emotions for it.  
You need your emotions, your feelings.  
Everything must come together and your mind is responsible for doing that.  
So you start by channeling your mind to your purpose.  
You set your mind.  
Your mind helps you channel all the forces of your spirits in the direction of that focus.  
So you use your mind.  
You set your mind.  
 I hear me, he says, thou will keep him in perfect peace.  
That means shalom, shalom, peace, peace.  
Whose mind is stayed on thee for he trusted in thee.  
So God's gonna keep him in perfect peace, the peace of prosperity.  
The man whose mind is focused on him.  
So you have to focus your mind.  
Some people are fasting and instead of focusing their mind during their fast, they are thinking about everything else.  
That fast is useless.  
 You see, why?  
Because the Spirit was not coordinated towards that goal and purpose.  
But if your mind is disciplined, you use your mind to direct yourself, your mind, you need it.  
So you focus it, you focus your mind.  
Now, if your mind proves a little difficult by going this way and that way, there's another tool that has power over the mind.  
 It is your tongue.  
You see, if your mind is showing this way and that way, you start talking in the direction of what you want and your mind will be focused in the direction you want to go.  
You getting it?  
Now once your mind goes in that direction, your emotions will start because God needs all of that.  
 Hey, somebody said, you can't be emotional with God.  
But God gets emotional.  
He said, he that seated in the heavens shall laugh.  
Laughter is an emotion.  
Anger, God gets angry.  
Anger is an emotion.  
Joy is an emotion.  
And God expresses joy.  
It's an emotion.  
See, when Jesus danced, it was an emotion.  
When Jesus wept, it was an emotion.  
 See, so that's so important.  
It's so important that you gather your emotion.  
When you bring your emotion together, oh, your spirit is affected, then your spirit is now in the condition that is consistent for God to work.  
You are now in the position, the situation where the spirit of God can minister to you in a way that you can receive and keep  
 You know God talks to many of us every day.  
But our emotions are not towards Him.  
And so we don't receive what He says.  
We might even think, oh yeah, I think I heard that.  
I thought God talked to me.  
But as long as your emotion is not toward Him, it makes no difference.  
It has no power over you.  
It doesn't work for you.  
But when it can speak to you, then your emotions are channeled toward Him, then you receive it in the core of your nature.  
And then it produces results for you.  
 Are you there?  
This is what we call prevailing prayer.  
Now let's go to the scripture where he talks about it.  
Look at James chapter number five.  


  
Are you there?  
 In chapter 5 and verse 16, he says, he confess your thoughts one to another and pray one for another.  
Confess your thoughts one to another.  
Doesn't mean I'm coming to meet you and say, I want to tell you my sins.  
 No, because I've offended you.  
So I tell you that I offended you.  
And I say to you, this is what I did against you.  
I'm so sorry.  
And you tell me how I do, you know.  
So then we iron it out there.  
That's what he's talking about.  
So he says, and pray one for another that she may be healed.  
Then he goes, the effectual  
 fervent prayer of a righteous man availed much."  
Now, to capture what is said in there, it's better to read it from the Amplified Translation.  
So I'm going to read it to you from the Amplified Translation.  
You got the Amplified up there?  
Okay.  
 He says, confess to one another, therefore your thoughts, your slips, your footsteps, your offenses, your sins, and pray also for one another that you may be healed and restored to a spiritual tone of mind and hurt.  
The earnest heartfelt, see what I mean?  
It's got to get into your emotion, heartfelt.  
You see, the earnest heartfelt continued  
 It's not something you say, Father, save Him in Jesus' name and go.  
No!  
It's continued your pressing, your pressing.  
Continued prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available dynamic in its working.  
It makes tremendous power available dynamic in its working.  
That means that prayer is dynamite.  
 Satan can steal it.  
You know, as a pastor, as a sales leader, you are tired of these 25 members for three months.  
You are tired of having these 1,200 members for how many months?  
You say, Father, it's time to move.  
It's time to move.  
It's time to, this kind of prayer, you don't preach, just now, three minutes and say, well, the 15 minute prayer pastor said, we should pray for 15 minutes.  
 No, that 15-minute prayer is not enough.  
I know you want to see a change.  
When you start praying like this, your whole body will be vibrating.  
I'm telling you, you feel the current of electricity all through your being.  


  
You know what a soul is?  


  
 No, you listen to some of the talk shows.  
You listen to some of our cell leaders, effective cell leaders telling you.  
You heard them.  
You heard them.  
And of course, I know that many of you are like that too.  
Okay?  
Many of you are like that.  
I mean, we've looked through the records.  
I know many of you are like that with lots of testimonies we've got.  
But that's what it is.  
The value of a soul.  
Hear that lady who said she told her members, follow me, I'm thinking you out.  
That's like Jesus.  
 Jesus took his disciples out and taught them how to win souls.  
That's the way it is.  
I told you, I started out going through the streets.  
I went from house to house to win souls.  
I went from house to house.  
I went knocking on doors.  
Some people welcomed me, some people were angry and chased me away.  
I warned me, never come near you.  


  
 But I kept doing it.  
I went to the hospitals.  
See, whoever could find people gathered, or I couldn't get in a taxi or a bus without preaching.  
Once I was inside, I started preaching.  
Far as along with the driver, I started with him.  
And that was those days when several people went out a taxi cab.  
Nowadays, I understand just one person and they go.  
Well, they had everybody in there, and you preached.  
 Something like it.  
Look, driver, if this man doesn't stop, I'll calm down.  
If he doesn't stop, I'll calm down.  
So put some work on this.  
He didn't tell us everybody would accept it.  
Some will, some won't.  
But that won't stop us.  
We must preach it.  
We must tell it.  
I went to school, preached the word.  
So I'm still at it today.  
 It's the most important thing in the whole world.  
Hallelujah.  
Yeah.  
And then after winning souls, you must retain them.  
How can you win souls and just let them go?  
Then you are a cell leader.  
This cell member, you invited this cell member, he said he's not coming.  
Why?  
He says he's not coming.  
What are you going to do?  
There are some cell members who can't even visit them.  
They keep escaping.  
 I was like that as a young guy.  
Let me tell you what happened to me in school.  
There was his brother who always used to come and lead us to the fellowship.  
And it was early in the morning.  
About 5.30 a.m.  
and a king.  
Brother Christian.  
He's trying not to disturb other people.  
Brother Christian.  
And I got up.  
I got my clothes on, okay?  
Jump down.  
 Double bonk, you remember?  
Jump down and got my things ready.  
Followed him and then went to the other bed and tapped that guy and then went up and went to that side and tapped the other guy and then we're all sneaking out, we're going to pray, you know?  
So they thought we were all enjoying it.  


  
So... So one day I planned for him.  


  
 I woke up earlier and I shifted to another bed.  
So I stayed with my friend there and I was watching him as he came.  
He looked, my bed was empty.  
He moved around, looked around, looked around and went to the other guy and walked that one up and I was watching him all the time.  
 Until he left.  
And when he left, I jumped down, went back to my bed.  
So during the social gathering one Saturday night, I wanted to dance.  
So who were all dancing?  
I was dancing in that, brother.  
As I was dancing like that, I was watching.  


  
 So, you know, I made sure he didn't see me.  
I kept hiding and hiding until he left.  
You know, these people just won't let you go.  
Now I was a Christian.  
Don't you understand?  
I was.  
Very born again.  
But you see, I was beginning to love the world.  
 I wanted to go in that direction, and his brothers won't let me go.  
Don't let me go.  
One day, the teacher spoke to me.  
He asked me, you're born again.  
I said, yes.  
He said, but I don't see you in the fellowship.  
I said, because those people, they don't do what they preach.  
He said, why?  
 And I started bombasting them, saying nasty things about them.  
Then he said to me, since you know these things, why don't you go there and teach them?  
I wasn't very happy with his answer.  
You see.  
But when I think today of all those people who helped me,  
 particularly a young gentleman who was always praying for me.  
God, I'm grateful.  
That they didn't leave me.  
You see, thank God they didn't let me go.  
They wanted to make sure I was in the fellowship.  
So when I became a cell leader, I knew those tricks very well, because I had played them.  
 And I was merciful because I could see those who were dodging the meetings.  
I could see they were just like me the way I was.  
So I started praying for them because somebody prayed for me.  
So I was praying for them because I knew that because others prayed for me, I was standing.  
If I would pray for others, they would be standing.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
So you never give up on anybody.  
Don't let Satan have anyone.  
Don't let Satan have anyone.  
He may be angry with you swearing and cursing.  
Don't worry.  
Don't worry.  
The master that we serve was Spatham.  
They hated him.  
They put a crown of thorns on his head until he was bleeding.  
 And it's said to him, come down from the cross if you're the Christ.  
What did he say?  
When I come down.  
Was I what he said?  
When I come down, you're all going to roast.  
Was I what Jesus said?  
No!  
Father!  
I promised to revenge.  
Was I what he said?  
No!  
 He said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.  
So that time I was dodging and watching that brother, I knew not what I was doing.  
See, I thought I was smart, and that's how some of them think they're smart.  
There are many of you here today.  
You were dodging your cell leader then, but here you are today as a cell leader.  
Glory to God!  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
Prevelling prayer.  
We pray until we prevail.  
We pray until in our hearts we know that we know that we know that it is done.  
You will know.  
Somebody said, how long should I pray?  
Pray until you know in your heart it is done.  
When it is done you will know.  
It may take days, weeks, months.  
Don't worry.  
 The day it is done in your spirit, you will know.  
There will be what we call a note of victory.  
Instead of a burden, suddenly you will start laughing about it.  
Instead of a burden, you start singing, you will know.  
You will know inside you it is done.  
And at that moment, it will be time to take the next step.  
We'll talk about that step, but first, let's complete the easier prayer.  
 Hallelujah.  
Still on the International Cell Leaders Conference with the Man of God, Pastor Chris, what happens when we pray?  
When we pray, we are filled with the Spirit and also guided by the Spirit.  
Prayer helps us come into the fullness of the Spirit.  
Learn more about prayer in this insightful segment of the International Cell Leaders Conference with the Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
God bless you.  
 When we pray, this prevailing prayer, there are certain things that must happen.  
There are certain things that we gain from our prayer like this.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory.  
This is the reason the all-time Christians used to call it.  
They would say that they are prayer warriors.  
 I don't quarrel with that terminology.  
There's no reason to be a prayer warrior.  
But that's what made them call it prayer warrior, because they were warring, fighting for souls.  
You get it?  
So they say, I'm a prayer warrior.  
They say, we are prayer warriors.  
Don't quite like the term, but I'm trying to show you why they thought that way.  
 Hallelujah.  
Okay, so when you hear someone saying I say prayer warrior, don't worry.  
Don't worry, just keep quiet.  
But now you understand, maybe that's what he wants to say.  
But for some, they think that that means fighting with God.  
They're going to make God do it.  
I just told you, you're not going to make God do it.  
You are the one doing things that make it consistent for him to operate normally.  
 Hallelujah.  
Prayer helps us come into the fullness of the Spirit.  
That's number one.  
Prayer helps us come into the fullness of the Spirit.  
 He said, be not drunk with wine when his ex is bought me filled with the spirit.  
In Acts 4 verse 31 we read it.  
He said, when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.  
When they prayed, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.  
When they prayed, they were filled.  
When they prayed, they were filled.  
When we prayed, we are filled.  
Hallelujah.  
 There are meetings where you know that something needs to change.  
And you call the whole cell, the whole church and say, we are praying today.  
We are praying today.  
We are praying today.  
And everybody comes and we pray.  
If by the time we are in the service, we haven't received a note of victory.  
And we haven't received a word of prophecy that several of us can confirm is so.  
We are John.  
 Till next time, we are joining the meeting now until we come again.  
So we are meeting again so and so today.  
We come back for prayer and we pray until we have that victory in our spirits.  
Why do many Christian businesses fail?  
Because they don't understand this.  
They don't understand this.  
 They don't know that there's such a thing as prevailing prayer.  
You have to sow your seeds.  
But sowing your seeds is not enough.  
Understand Christian consciousness.  
Hallelujah.  
The other thing that we get as we pray is guidance.  
We're ready to enact chapter 13.  
 He says, as the minister to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost gave guidance.  
Do you remember that?  
That's the second verse of Acts 13.  


  
And when we pray,  
 We in a seed for the lost in prayer.  
Let me give you some scriptures that are very important for us to consider.  
Isaiah chapter 66 verse 8.  
Isaiah chapter 66 verse number 8.  
Read it.  
Hm.  
Hey, hey.  


  
 Have you seen it?  
Read it like you understand.  
Read it.  
Want to go.  
Start again.  
Mm-hmm.  
Mm-hmm.  
Mm-hmm.  
Uh-huh.  
For as soon as Zion prevailed, she brought forth her children.  
As soon as Zion prevailed.  
It is as soon as Zion confessed.  
 As soon as I unclined, travel.  


  
That's what we call soul, travel.  
In birds, you want to bring forth muscles.  
Spiritual travel in prayer.  
Until you know that, you're not ready yet.  
You can have what you call many coming and many going, not children.  
 You can have visitors to church who come in and enjoy the message and they will go away.  
But if you want to have children, you are going to have to travel.  
That's why you have some churches.  
You say, oh, when we had such and such a program, 5,000 people came.  
Everybody has gone back.  
The church is not growing.  
They spend money, money, money.  
But the church does not grow.  
 then the cell, where they will buy all kinds of refreshments to lure people to attend.  
After they have finished eating all their refreshments, they will go.  
And the people don't come back.  
Why?  
Because the leaders think that as soon as we refresh them, we will have children.  
No.  
As soon as Zion travilled, she brought forth her children.  
As soon as Zion travilled,  
 Traveled.  
Pastors onto your eyes, no tears.  
You cannot have real children.  
You have visitors to change.  
Same thing for the cell member.  
They made you a cell leader.  
Then you come back and say, my cell members don't come.  
I was given 10 people, only two are coming.  
 You are given ten people.  
Who do you think will account for those eight?  
You think it's your password that will account for them?  
It's you.  
Jesus will hold you responsible for the eggs that you can't find.  
In your own interest, go and find them.  
Go and find them.  
You know what the soul is?  
Coming back to tell us, I have five members.  
They don't come.  
They don't like to come.  
They don't like to come.  
They don't like to come.  
Say, I don't understand myself.  
They don't come.  
He said of you to be weeping.  
 You should be whipping.  


  
If you get into your room, lock yourself and be crying.  
That you have not found them.  
Cry!  
If you couldn't cry, when you wanted to cry, cry that you could not cry.  
Let me tell you something.  
Listen.  
Let me tell you something.  
 Several years ago, I had an experience in the things I thought I should have been moved about.  
This should have brought me to tears.  
And I thought, so I was so dry-eyed, I said a crying that I could not cry.  
I was crying for myself.  
I felt sad for myself that such a thing did not move me.  
 I was crying.  
How could I be unmoved?  
I said, Father, I'm so sorry.  
Forgive me.  
How could I be unmoved?  
Have I come to this level?  
I was crying to God.  
Crying that I did not cry.  
And then, of course.  
Oh, like the old saints who said the heavens broke.  
And my soul was blessed.  
What a fountain.  
 See, so what I'm saying to you is this, you need to understand that this is serious business.  
We're all talking about souls here, or dealing with something very serious.  
Look at it, he says, for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.  
As soon as Zion travailed, not before Zion travailed, as soon as Zion travailed,  
 So ask, ask Pastore, Mrs. Pastore, when was the last time you wept for source?  
When was the last time you wept?  
When was the last time?  
Oh, are you weeping that you don't like the way they are treating you?  
 You know, there's so much cannality in the church.  
People who rather cry, the way they were treated by the OSHA, by Brother So-and-so, by Pastor So-and-so, somebody mistreated me.  
I can't imagine what the hell is it?  
Oh, you're feeling bad for yourself.  
Where was the last time you went?  
For souls?  
Maybe those who are backsliding from the church, and you have not found them.  
Where was the last time your eyes watered?  


  
 If it is too long ago, you need to pray.  
First that God should forgive you.  
That something that is so important became so light in your heart.  


  
I cry almost every day.  
Almost every day.  
Not because I want to cry.  
Not because I'm going to cry now.  
 If that were the case, I would have even liked it, but it's not so.  
It doesn't happen that way.  
It's like saying, I want to feel hot now.  
You can't feel hot now.  
The circumstances must create that heat.  
You understand?  
So it's my heart.  
As I set my heart on the things of God, and as I set my heart on the things happening in our world, and what we have to do, and the power of the gospel, all of these things, as I set my heart,  
 Those emotions just, you know, get arrested.  
And the next thing, I'm vibrating there, you know, with tears, and I'm praying, with tears.  
And it happens to me every so often.  
But that is the ministry of the Spirit.  
I know that it's the Holy Ghost that is causing it to happen in me.  
 And so he causes me to pray, as I should pray in a way that can affect other people.  
And then he also gives me the means to prosecute his cause.  
 And then you find miracles are happening, great things are happening.  
God is supplying all that is necessary to make it happen.  
Why?  
Because the Holy Spirit can channel His thoughts, channel His emotions through me.  
He says, likewise, the Spirit helped with our infirmities.  
He says, haven't you seen it?  
Romans 8 and verse 26.  
Put it up there, let's see, let's read it.  
Romans 8 and verse 26.  


  
 He says, likewise the spirit also helps with our infirmities.  
For we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the spirit himself, the old King James says itself, is supposed to be himself.  
Make it in a session for us with groanings which cannot be ordered.  
With groanings which cannot be ordered.  
Verse 27.  
 And he that such of the hearts, nor what he's the mind of the spirit, because he make it in the session for the saints, according to the will of God.  
And when we pray like this, the 28 verse then says, and we know that all things work together for good to them, the love of God, to them who are the card, according to his purpose.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Glory to God.  
 As soon as Zion traveled, she brought forth her children.  
Zion traveled.  
Look at Psalm chapter two, Psalm two and verse number eight.  
He's talking about the same thing here.  
Psalm two, verse eight.  
He says, ask of me.  
 and I shall give thee the heathen, the heathen."  
Can you see that?  
Those who don't know God, ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for that inheritance and the autumnal spots of the earth for that possession.  
You're going to ask.  
You're going to ask.  
 And not asking, it's not standing by the Father I ask for the hidden Jesus name.  
I receive, no!  
This hidden is something about you're going to have them come as spiritual children.  
That means you're going to have to travel to give birth.  
Give birth.  


  
 See, you'll have to let the Holy Ghost minister through you.  
Carry out His ministry of intercession through you.  
You have to yield yourself for the Holy Spirit to work through you, pray through you.  
He wants to.  
He wants to.  
He wants to pray through you so that the Father would respond accordingly because only the Holy Spirit can pray accurately.  
We don't have the best words to pray as we should.  
 But the Holy Ghost knows what to do.  
He knows what to say.  
Hallelujah.  
Stir yourself to take a hold of God in this concluding segment of the International Cell Leaders Conference with the Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
Be elevated to higher realms of prevailing prayer as Pastor Chris teaches on the importance of soul travails.  
Stay tuned.  
Oh glory to God.  
 Now, go to the next portion we're going to read sitting in line with this Galatians chapter 4, this time verse 19.  
Galatians chapter 4.  
 My little children, you see, this is the New Testament now.  
Paul knew what it was to travail, travail in birds.  
Look what he says.  
My little children, talking to the Galician Church, of whom I travail in birds again, again.  
He already did it before they were born again.  
Now look at it, he's doing it again because they're going canal.  
 See, the going kanna, he says, haven't been going into spirit, and you now meet perfect by the flesh, that's the third chapter, he charged them.  
So now he says, oh, for my travail in birth again.  
See, because they're not living right, he's going back to prayer.  
He's going back to prayer.  
And not ordinary prayer, travail.  
 He says, I travel in birds again until Christ be formed in you.  
I'm gonna be praying, he says, I'm gonna travel in prayer until Christ is shown alive in you.  
Can you see this is labor, brother?  
Now you can understand why he says, we are called laborers together with God.  
This is labor, not just wearing off suits.  
See what I mean?  
 Being a good pastor is not dressing fine.  
That's just our camouflage.  
It's just our cover for all the crying we do.  
And people don't get to know that.  
So look at us looking nice.  
But there's much more.  
There's much more.  
 my little children, of whom I travel in birth again, until Christ be formed in you.  
So this is not all testament and stuff.  
No, you gotta pray.  
You gotta travel.  
You wanna bring forth children, spiritual children.  
You wanna bring forth children.  


  
Nothing about the crowd, Rachel.  
Give me children, oh, I die.  
 You haven't come to this point.  
You haven't come to this point where you become angry with yourself for spiritual stagnation and bankruptcy.  
You want to see children.  
How could you have been like this for all these years?  
How many souls have you led to Christ?  
How many can you call your spiritual children?  
My God, this is not acceptable, you say?  
It's time to fast.  
It's time to pray.  
It's time to travel until I bring forth children.  
 And when you are prayed like that, oh, you will be filled with the Spirit.  
You will be filled with the Spirit.  
And the next thing will be the guidance of God when you spoke to Philip and says, join yourself to that chariot.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Join yourself to that chariot.  
And the Holy Ghost, that's leading you here.  
You tell you exactly what to do.  
And you put the words in your mouth.  
Why?  
Because you have traveled.  
 Traveils in birth.  
Now that's the release.  
He was at picking those sinners, those souls that must come to you.  
He'll guide them to you.  
He'll guide them to you and you'll guide you in their part.  
He will arrange the circumstances, but he will not do that until you travail, until you win the rights to reproduce.  
 You've got to win the right to reproduce.  


  
You find that this is more than invitation.  
It's more than inviting someone for the meeting.  
This is winning source.  
This is winning, winning and retaining.  
When you win, they will stay.  
Why?  
Because you've traveled in birth.  
 You travel in birds.  
When you travel in bird like this, if anything ever happens to that guy, to that sister, to that one that you led to Christ, you won't take it lightly.  
How mean you are out?  
Did you ever see that chicken fight in a hawk?  
I saw it one time.  
A hawk came down and wanted to pick that little chick.  
Mother hand came out and fought, fought for her chicks.  
 Oh dear, she won't let one go.  
That's the way you become.  
When you have led people to Christ, you won't let the devil take any one of them, because you knew what it was for you before you led them to Christ.  
And they in turn are doing the same thing, leading others to Christ, excited about winning souls.  
Glory to God.  
Say, I'm a soul winner.  
Say again, I'm a soul winner.  
Yeah.  
 So we're in a day where we have, you know, just push the button and then we get this done.  
Push that button and we get this.  
In fact, we have to push buttons now and we talk.  
And when we say that thing happens, okay?  
Yeah, voice recognition.  
Thank you.  
But let me tell you something.  
In the spiritual realm, the principles have not changed.  
So trivial.  
As soon as Zion traveled.  
 Once that traville is there, something will happen.  
Yvonne, as soon as Zion travilles, she brought forth.  
Ministry is born out of this kind of circumstances, out of tears and crime.  
That's where it's from, traville.  
 Until you know it, until you know it.  
So just if you know what I'm talking about, you experience this in Dubai.  
You know what I'm talking about.  
Before you could start seeing the kind of habits that's going on now, you had to travel.  
Am I right?  
That's what it is.  
That's what it is.  
That's what I actually know what I'm talking about.  
Because you experience these years, right?  
Until that thing happens, you can't have it.  
It doesn't come cheap.  
 It doesn't come cheap.  
You can't start that kind of church in Abba without soul travail.  


  
It's tears.  
It's like pain.  
But you stare yourself to take a hold of God.  
Like Jacob when he said to the angel of the Lord, he says, I will not let you go until you bless me.  
I will not let you go.  
 and you are praying, you're not going to let go until in your spirit you know that you know that you know that you know that you know that you know it is done.  


  
There's no major outpouring that has taken place in this world without this.  
 There's none.  
There's no major move of the Holy Spirit that wasn't preceded with soul travel.  
There's none.  
There's none.  


  
And if you're not doing this, your Christianity will be up and down.  
 It'll be according to the senses.  
Sometimes you're happy, sometimes you're not happy.  
Then from time to time, you feel like, what am I doing?  
You feel dry.  
But those who are into this don't have a dry day.  
You don't have a dry day.  
They are workers together with God.  
There's always something to do.  
God is always saying, this is the next step.  
There's always something to do.  
I'm never at a loss as to what to do next.  
No.  
 No, I'm fooling the network, in the spiritual network, between God, angels, and the saints.  
We're there.  
This world is ours.  
Hallelujah.  
And we will fill it with the knowledge of the glory of God as the waters cover the sea.  
Can you say, May, come what may, we will be standing.  
 The Scripture says in Habakkuk 2.14, For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.  
The Word of God burn mightily in the hearts of every cell leader present at this conference, as they return to their stations with renewed zeal and vigor in carrying out the Lord's work.  
Truly, the Word of God is as a burning fire shut up in our bones.  
 you.
