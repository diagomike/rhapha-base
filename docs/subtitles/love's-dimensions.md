title: Love's Dimensions
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 to be praised the Lamb of the Lord.  
And unto you, I lift my voice in praise the Lamb of the Lord.  


  
 And what need to be praised among the Lord.  
And unto you, live in my voice and pray.  


  
 O chihuahua, glorious!  
And what eager to be praised!  
The land on the road!  
And on to you!  
And in my voice of praise!  
 one more time Lord you are glorious  


  
 And what we are, and what we need to be brings away, for the truth.  
And art to you, I need my voice and brings away.  


  
 You are the lamb upon the throne, the lamb upon the throne.  
You are the lamb upon the throne of Lord, the lamb upon the throne.  


  
 The land upon the throne.  
And we wash it.  
We love you.  
We honor you.  
 There's none like unto you, O Lord.  
But land upon the throne.  
Thank you, O Lord.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Praise God.  
Thank you, O Lord.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory.  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
You may be seated.  
Hallelujah.  
The Lord is here, right?  


  
It asks you to open anywhere.  
Where?  
Chapter.  
I didn't give you a chapter.  
You couldn't figure that out.  


  
 I want to read a portion of the Bible, Ephesians chapter 3.  
Something in there that the Holy Spirit wants to get across to the church.  
I believe we will find ourselves  
 in that place where God wants us, but a flight of the Spirit, when we key in to His message in this portion of the Bible.  
I'm reading from the 14th verse.  
For this cause, I bow my knees onto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
 of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in a man that Christ may dwell in your heart's bad faith.  
 that ye being rooted and grounded in love, hosts.  
Now, I could preach for a whole month, every day on that portion we just read.  
And we already have shed quite a bit on that.  
That's on several of our tapes.  
I hope you've been able to get some of them.  
But I want to take a step farther  
 from the 18th verse says, may be able to comprehend with our saints.  
I want you to notice what it says because it's so powerful.  
May be able, see he's praying, but we may be able to comprehend with our saints what is the bread and let and debt and height  
 and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge that he might be filled with all the fullness of God.  
This is wonderful.  
I'd like to, I'd like to read it to you.  
 from the new century version, because it puts it in the, what I'll call the straightforward way, so you can see it plainly.  
Can we read?  
And I pray that you and all God's holy people will have the power to understand the greatness of Christ's love  
 how wide and how long and how high and how deep that love is.  
Christ's love, he says, is greater than anyone can ever know.  
But I pray that you will be able to know that love.  
Then you can be filled with the fullness of God.  
Boy.  
 Three things here.  
He says, I want you to comprehend that love, the dimensions of that love.  
He says, that love surpasses scientific knowledge.  
To know the love he uses the Greek word, gynosco, which surpasses it.  
Use it in other words, nusses.  
 That's mental knowledge, mental comprehension.  
Says, to know the love of Christ is by revelation.  
It's a spiritual experience.  
He says, that knowledge surpasses scientific or mental knowledge, mental understanding.  
Then he tells us something big.  
 He says, when you get to know that love, you will be filled with all the fullness of God.  
So being filled with all the fullness of God is dependent on our comprehension of the dimensions of love.  
Did you see that?  
Wow.  
I read it again to you.  
I read it again to you.  
 And I pray that you and all God's holy people will have the power to understand the greatness of Christ's love.  
How, why, how long and how high and how deep that love is.  
Christ's love is greater than anyone can ever know, but I pray that you will be able to know that love.  
 You see that?  
Then you can be filled with the fullness of God.  
Oh, Hallelujah.  
Oh, Hallelujah.  
My goodness.  
Now I get the picture.  
Now I understand why I should be so full of the anointing of God's Spirit.  
Now I can understand.  
 Because of the understanding of that love of God, I see it now.  
See what I mean?  
I'll begin this by explaining to you the dimensions of love, because the Bible says we've got to know that to be filled with the fullness of God.  
 We've got to know that.  
Now, can we read again from your King James version?  
Are you there?  
Okay, we're reading from that 18th verse, and I want y'all to read, since your children of King James want to go.  
What is the breath?  
 What is what?  
The bread, and then length, and depth, and height.  
He's talking about the dimensions of love, the breadth of love.  
What is its coverage?  
How wide is that love?  
Who does it include?  
John 3 16 for God, so love the world!  
 that he gave his only begotten son, that who so ever?  
What is the breadth of Christ's love?  
How wide is it?  
Who does it include?  
Can you comprehend that love?  
Who does it include?  
He told us, God so loved the world.  
Not the world of things, but the world of me, everybody.  
 For God so loved the word, to give His only begotten Son.  
Not anybody who believes in Him.  
Question day, and can I love everybody.  
You see it?  
That's what He's talking about.  
Not only, not only to hear about the love, but for us too.  
Gino's got that love.  
It's a revelation.  
You get to know it.  
And when you know it, you become a part of it.  
 He says that we might be filled with all the fullness of God.  
What's the purpose of being filled with the fullness of God?  
We'll come to that.  
We'll come to that.  
How wide is that love?  
Who does it include?  
Can I really love everybody, genuinely?  
Can I?  
That's the question.  
Can I love everybody?  


  
 In St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 1, verse 16, the Bible says of his fullness, have all we received in grace for grace.  
We have received of Christ's fullness.  
He's the one that's so full of God.  
He's like God.  
He is God.  
One with God.  
In him, the fullness of God wears badly.  
 the totality of deity, tabernacles in Christ.  
And the Bible says, we have received of that fullness.  
And did he run dry when we got out of you?  
No, he run dry.  
Now he says, we can be filled with his fullness.  
 I've been trying to explain, you know, why that term is used in the Bible, fullness is a Greek word, Pleroma.  
Pleroma means the maximum capacity required, the maximum capacity.  
It refers to everything that ought to be present in its totality.  
So to be fair to the fullness of God means nothing short of all that  
 Isn't the personality, the totality of his being?  
To be filled with the pleroma of God, the completeness.  
Is it possible, emphatically yes, for Jesus was a man?  
The Bible says the man Christ Jesus.  
If he could be filled with God, I can be filled with God.  
 Now he tells me it is dependent on my ability to comprehend the agape of Christ.  
 not the Philadelphia, which is the brotherly love that we experience.  
Brotherly love is, you know, a share with you.  
So the Bible says, let brotherly love continue.  
He encourages us.  
Let brotherly love continue.  
Learn to share among yourselves that is Philadelphia.  
Brotherly love.  
Let it continue, he says.  
That's wonderful.  
We share together.  
 I got a chair here, so I was a con con share with me.  
So we bought, share it.  
I got something to eat and we share it.  
Agape is not Philadelphia.  
Are you hearing me?  
It's different from what I call filio, from where you get Philadelphia.  
Brotherly love.  
Do you understand?  
 Agape is self-giving.  
Agape is not sharing.  
Agape is, I give it to you.  
I sacrifice mine for you.  
I give it to you.  
That's Agape.  
He says, if we can comprehend the Agape of Christ, the love, the self-given love of Christ, we will be filled with the fullness of God.  
 How wide is it?  
What's the breath of Christ's love?  
Who does it include?  
Can I really love everybody?  
It includes everybody, everybody.  
Oh, everybody?  
Can I, can I, can I have that in my life?  
Can I truly love everybody?  
Can I really do that?  
Yes, if you must be fair with all the fullness of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 Oh boy.  
He actually alludes to the staring of God in your life.  
I want you to understand that.  
Because when you receive the Holy Spirit of God to live in you, you ought to receive God a mighty to live in you.  
 But then, Paul wrote a letter to Timothy and he says, stay up the gift of God that is in you.  
And there he wasn't talking about a gift of the Holy Spirit, one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, some of the gifts of the Holy Spirit.  
No, he was talking about the gift of the person of the Holy Ghost himself that I come to live with in us.  
He says, stay up that person of the Holy Ghost, that God nature in you.  
Stay up that divine personality.  
How can you do that?  
 That's what he's calling being filled.  
So he's not only in your spirits, but he's in your soul and in your body.  
He's in every fiber of your being.  
He's in your thinking every day.  
He's in every finger in your hand, every toe of your foot.  
He's in every strand of your hair.  
Are you listening to me now?  
Fill with the fullness of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 That's what God wants for us because, you know, it's what you've got that you can share.  
You can give what you don't have.  
What you have is what you can minister to others.  
A minister is a giver.  
He's got something to give.  
And if you don't have it, you can't give it.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, praise God forevermore.  
He didn't say of some of what a God He gave to us.  
He says of His fullness.  
 One can only receive of your fullness.  
If you're not full of it, they can get out of it.  
Because you just don't have enough.  
See what I mean?  
The breath of love.  
What is its coverage?  
How wide is it?  
Who does it include?  
Wow.  
The length of love.  
How far can it go?  
 How far can your love go?  
Can it pursue the worst of sinus?  
Can it go after the worst failures?  
Can it, how far can your love go?  
The length of love?  
How, how far can it go?  
Can it be stretched limitlessly?  
Can it, can your love be stretched?  
 Peter said to Jesus, master, how many times should my neighbor fame me and I forgive him?  
Seven times, is that enough?  
Seven times?  
So the eight time I kneel him?  
And Jesus said, no, Peter, 70 times, seven times.  
That's how many times?  
490 times a day?  
 You have to be a devil to count the next one after that.  


  
Hallelujah.  
How far?  
The length of love.  
I said, can it pursue the worst of sinners?  
Paul said I was injurious.  
 He said, I was the worst of the bunch.  
But he saved me.  
He saved me.  
His love reached out for me.  
I was the worst, I said.  
But his love reached out for me.  
How far can your love go?  
To what length?  
When will it stop?  
Somebody said, I've forgiven many times.  
I'm tired of this.  
How far can it go?  
 You want to be filled with all the fullness of God?  
Then comprehend the love of Christ, the length, how far can it journey?  
How much can it forgive?  
Hallelujah.  
The next one.  
What's the next one?  
The height.  
Is that the height or the depth?  
Glory to God.  
 the depth of love.  
How deep is the love?  
The deepness here refers to intensity.  
All right?  
The intensity of love.  
How intense is your love?  
How intense is the love of Christ?  
How deep is it?  
In chapter two book of Ephesians,  
 Reading from verse four, he says, but God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, had quickened us together with Christ, by grace he has saved.  
Hallelujah.  
God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were deep, dead in sins.  
He didn't love us when we became good.  
 He loved us when we accepted Him.  
He loved us when we were dead in sins.  
Even, he says, even when we were dead in sins.  
His great love with which He loved us, the intensity of that love.  
How His heart burned good love for us.  
No wonder this is for God so loved.  
Hallelujah.  
 How far can your love go?  
How far can your love go?  
Do we have the capacity to love that much?  
It reminds me of a story in the Bible.  
I want to read it to you.  
You know, sometimes I feel that there's a lot of people who don't understand what love really is.  
And yet, without it, without  
 the manifestation of that love in your life.  
There's too much you will never know of God.  
Too much you will never know.  
Sometimes you have to ask yourself, what do I really want to be?  
What do I really want to be?  
Don't forget, we're all  
 what we may enjoy in this earth.  
We're all what we may be in this earth.  
The most important thing is our personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  
That's what counts with God.  
I'll get to that in a moment.  
 But when I read the story, I've read it for years.  
And every time I read it, I'm stared in my spirit.  
And I think, dear God, how could this be?  
It's about two young men in the Bible that helped us to know how the love of God gave me that strong.  
I want to read this story to you.  
 There are many verses, so you better be ready.  
Get your Bible close to you now.  
You ready?  
Okay.  
You're wondering where, right?  
You already know.  
As a two young man in the band.  
Not Peter and Paul.  
Second Samuel.  
I'm reading to you from verse one, chapter one.  
Second Samuel.  
 So nice to see you.  
Ready?  
From verse one.  
Now, soul was what?  
Chapter one.  
Second Samuel, chapter one.  
From verse one.  
Are you there?  
Wasn't that what I see?  
Okay, just to be sure.  
 All right, from verse one, you give me the first statement there.  


  
Okay, I see why you didn't get it.  
I'm reading to you from King James, huh?  
Okay, I get to King James in a moment.  
I was reading from the new century.  
Now Saul was dead.  
 When I read that you were wondering, what was I seeing?  
Okay, okay.  
Let me get to your King James in a second.  
Now came the past after the death of Saul.  
When David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites and David had a boat,  
 Two days in Ziklag, it came even the past on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes ranked and upon his head.  
And so it was when he came to David that he fell to the earth and did obeisance.  
And David said unto him, from whence comest thou?  
And he said, out of the camp of Israel, my escaped.  
Can I give you the background?  
Now Israel was at war.  
 And David was a young man at this time, even though Samuel had come and anointed him to be king of Israel.  
But Saul was still king.  
 And David fled for his life because Saul was out against him.  
Saul wanted to kill him because Saul found out that somehow there was something about this David that seemed to indicate that there was some royalty in his life.  
And he wanted his dynasty to continue.  
He wanted his son, Jonathan, to become king of Israel.  
 So he hated the gods of this guy, David, even though he had liked him.  
The only reason it was out against him now was because he said, if I don't kill David, Jonathan, my boy will never become king.  
So David must die for Jonathan to become king after me.  
That's all.  
He really liked David.  
Before this time, he was in love with David.  
He loved the guy.  
 until a demon began to trouble him.  
And now he hated David with a passion.  
One time he went out seeking David 3,000 men, some of the best soldiers in Israel, to seek out David and kill him.  
And so David couldn't join the Israelite soldiers, the Israelite army at this war and help fight against their enemies.  
 So Saul led Israel to war.  
And Jonathan was with him.  
Jonathan, the good guy.  
Okay.  
Have you got in the background?  
 So now somebody's come from the camp of Israel where the war has been and come to seek out David.  
And David sees the guy and says, hey, where are you coming from?  
He says, I'm coming from the camp of Israel.  
You know the war has been on.  
And so David wants to know from you.  
How's the war?  
What's happening there?  
Are you with me now?  
 Okay.  
And David was formed.  
David said unto him, how wait the matter?  
I pray to tell me.  
And he answered, that the people are fled from the battle.  
And many of the people are also fallen and dead.  
And Saul and Jonathan, his son are dead also.  
Now remember, the reason, the reason David is here is because Saul wants him dead.  
 So, virtually, he should be wah, he's dead, wah, wah.  
He ought to be shouting now, hey, and others should come, hail the king, hail the king, hail the king, because now he can become king.  
The enemy of his soul is dead.  
He ought to reward this fellow and say, thank you for bringing me the information.  
 But David wants to be sure.  
So you're still there?  
He tells him, Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.  
Verse five, David said unto the young man that told him, how knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?  
How do you know?  
And the young man that told him said, as I, where am I?  
Verse six, right?  
Okay.  
 And the young man that told him, said, as I happened by chance upon Mount Gilbore, behold Saul leaned upon his spear and loaded chariots and husband followed hard after him.  
And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called onto me.  
And I answered, here am I.  
 And he said unto me, who at thou?  
And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.  
And he said unto me again, stand I pray thee upon me and slay me.  
Now this guy is reporting the story to David.  
This was what happened between King Saul and himself.  
He says, King Saul was desperate.  
The enemy was out against him.  
He knew he couldn't escape.  
And he wanted me to kill him so they wouldn't get him.  
 Verse 8, and he said unto me, who at thou?  
And I answered him, I am an American.  
He said unto me again, stand, I pray thee upon me, and slay me, for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet holding me.  
 So I stood upon him and slew him because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen.  
And I took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them either onto my Lord.  
He says to David, I brought the crown, the crown of King Saul to you.  
And the bracelet on his head, I brought them to you because he asked me to kill him and I did.  
I knew he couldn't live.  
So that's why I did.  
And I brought this to you knowing you would become king.  
 You, I mean, there ought to be some dancing, right?  
Then David took hold on his clothes and tore them on.  
And likewise, all the men that were with him stopped.  
This was not the attitude of those men before now, I tell you.  
Because one time they, when Saul came out to seek them, and they escaped from Saul, it came nighttime and Saul was sleeping in the trench.  
 And David and his men came close, so his men were all sleeping.  
And one of David's men said, hey!  
He said, Master, can I strike him?  
I wouldn't do it twice.  


  
David said, are you crazy?  
Don't you know who he is?  
 David said to him, listen, David said to him, do you think anybody can touch the Lord's anointed and get away with it?  
He said, Fab, be it from me that I should touch the Lord's anointed.  
He said, let's get out of here.  
Let's get out of here.  
You know, that guy was like, what?  
We're out here because this man wants to kill us.  
 Now the Lord has delivered him into your hands.  
Let's kill him."  
David said, never.  
Not the Lord's anointed, not me.  
And David went away and all his men went with him.  
You know, they thought they had been so bitten, not by anybody but David.  
How excellent his mind was.  
How he honored the anointing of God.  
 He said, can you can you can you can you strike the Lord's another and get away with it?  
You can't get away with it.  
 So he wasn't looking at Saul the evil man, Saul the murderer, Saul the hater.  
He wasn't looking at that.  
Saul the rejected of that.  
He wasn't looking at that.  
Saul the senor.  
He wasn't looking at that.  
He was looking at the fact that this man was anointed of God.  
No matter what he has done, leave him alone.  
Incidentally, that's what a lot of God's children don't have the sense of understanding because most of them have never been taught.  
 Is this touch not man-anointed?  
Where with your hand your tongue or your pen?  


  
And David was being proved by God if he could handle such great anointing.  
David was being proved by God.  
I wonder how many times God has tried to prove you.  
 I wonder how many times you reached out your tongue to touch the Lord's anointed.  
I wonder how many times.  
You still there?  
Most of the words that way.  
Here he was sleeping.  
The king was sleeping like a baby.  
He was trying to kill him.  
 Let me tell you one of the things that God showed me one night.  
Don't ask me whether in the body or in the spirit, I cannot tell.  
But I was on the platform, standing somewhere, wherever that platform was, God only knows.  
And there was a man of God preaching and then praying  
 And while he was doing that, he was behaving in a second way.  
And God said to me, many will take that and make him and laugh and make fun of what he's doing.  
Then he said, now I'm telling you, never do it.  
 I was wondering, I've never done it.  
Why is it telling me never do it?  
Well, I haven't done it.  
So why is it telling me never do it?  
So I said, all right.  
And I wrote it down.  
When I woke up, I saw it.  
I had written it.  
I wrote down everything.  
 It was in the Spirit and He had it in the body.  
There are things that only the Holy Spirit can teach you.  
So He can separate you from others.  
There are certain things you see and you shoot, act like you never saw them.  
Because the Bible says the foolishness of God is why the men, you don't know where the power is.  
 That's working in that man.  
That thing you may be laughing at.  
Maybe where the glory is.  
But because you don't know, you can make fun of it.  
Well that's by the way, just wanted to let you know, the Holy Spirit can teach you things like this.  
And the Holy Spirit had to prove David, if he could handle the anointing of God's Spirit.  
In a way that Saul himself never knew.  
 You still there?  
Whew.  
We are in verse 11.  
Then David took hold on his clothes and rent them.  
He taught them.  
And likewise, all the men that were with him, they had learned something now.  
They couldn't rejoice that soul was dead.  
They had to act like David.  
They acted like David.  
They thought like David now.  
They had been trained.  
 and they moaned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel because they were fallen by the sword.  
Oh, oh, oh, what thinking?  
Oh, oh.  
I wonder what comes to our minds when we hear of some of the believers in something happened to them.  
 I wonder how he reacts.  
Is there something to learn from this great man of God?  
And David said unto the young man that told him.  
Can you imagine?  
Until evening time, he fasted.  
That man was confused, the young guy who brought the news.  
And you know he lied to David.  
He lied because the way it saw died was not the way he reported it.  
He was not the one that killed saw.  
 He lied, he wanted to be paid.  
So he hurried and brought the news, expecting some reward.  
And he brought the crown too.  
David said unto the young man, verse 13, the man that told him, whence at thou, and he answered, I am the son of a stranger and a malachite.  
And David said unto him, how was thou not afraid?  
 to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the laws that note it.  
He asked him, how were you, you know, till evening time, the whole day David was thinking, Saul is dead, Jonathan dead, he wept.  
Finally in the evening he called the young man, he said, come here, where are you from?  
 You see the question because he had asked him before.  
And the man had mentioned about three times here that he was an Amalekite.  
So this was not what David was concerned about.  
He was like, where did you come from?  
What kind of mentality do you have?  
Where are you from?  
The man said, I am the son of an Amalekite.  
That was not the question.  
He said, how come?  
 that you were not afraid to stretch for your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed.  
How come you were not afraid?  
How?  
Oh.  
And David called one of the young men and said, go near and fall upon him.  
And they killed him.  
And David said unto him, thy blood be upon thy head.  
For thy mouth are testified against this saying, I have stained the Lord's anointed.  
 Now, I've acted like I was there, right?  
Yeah, because I've done it in there.  
Oh, verse 17, and David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.  
Also, he begged them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow.  
Behold, it is written in the book of Joshua.  
Verse 19, the beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places.  
How are the mighty fallen?  
 Tell it not in God's.  
Publish it not in the streets of Askelon.  
Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice.  
Lest the daughters of their uncircumcised triumph.  
When something happens to a minister of God, the first people to publish it around the world are other Christians.  
They are like this Amalekite.  
Who are they from?  
What in the world are they learned?  
What in the world have they been taught?  


  
 He said, tell it not in Gats.  
Gats where Goliath came from.  
Don't let them hear that soul is dead.  
Publish it not in the streets of Askelon.  
He said, lest the daughters of the fittest things rejoice when they hear that soul is dead like this.  
He wept.  
Oh.  
 What did he call him in that verse 9?  
In the beauty of Israel he slain.  
He called him the beauty of Israel because there's where the anointing was.  
He said the beauty of Israel is slain upon the high places.  
How are the mighty fallen?  
Oh, verse  
 He mountains of Gilber, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings.  
For there the shield of the might is vily cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.  
 from the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Junnet and Taunnet back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.  
Saul and Junnet and were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their debt they were not divided.  
They were sifted and eagles.  
They were stronger than lions.  
He daughters of Israel.  
We pover Saul, who clothed you in scallops, were delights who put on elements of gold upon your apparel.  
 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle?  
O Jonathan, thou were slain in nine high places.  
I am distressed for thee, my brother, Jonathan.  
Very pleased and hast thou been unto me.  
Thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.  
How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished?  
 You know, there's lots of scriptures about Jonathan and David, and I appreciate if you can read them for yourself or on occasion.  
For the Bible says, Jonathan loved David as his own soul.  
It's amazing, amazing.  
Because he loved David as his own soul.  
Several times the Bible reports that.  
How can you love somebody as your own soul?  
 David said his love surpassed the love of women.  
This was not the love of women.  
This was someone who loved David genuinely.  
The Bible says he's trending David's heart in God.  
Jonathan did.  
He said one time to David, he said, you will become king and I'll be next to you.  
 That made his father so mad.  
He called him one day.  
He said, Jonathan, you are still running around with that rascal?  
Don't you know that as long as the son of Jesse lives, you will not be king?  
And the young man said, but I don't care.  
He will become king.  
Ah!  
Sol took the javelin and threw it at the boy he wanted to become king.  
He almost killed Jonathan.  
 for his love for David.  
No, I want to show you what human love is like.  
Human love is selfish.  
He wasn't trying to fight for Jonathan.  
He was trying to fight for himself.  
So his son, not because Jonathan was Jonathan, but because was his son.  
So that his name would become a big name.  
 Because now Junnetan says, I don't really care about it.  
Like David the King, God wants him to be King.  
What?  
And now he wants to kill the very guy he wanted to be King.  
He attacked him with a javelin.  
To kill him.  
He narrowly missed him.  
 And listen, the speed of that javelin wouldn't have spared Jonathan.  
I guarantee you that.  
Because you see, this guy Saul was head and shoulders above everybody else in Israel.  
He was the biggest guy physically.  
He had the human strength.  
The Bible says he was sweeter than eagles.  
That guy was strong.  
He was a man of war.  
So when he threw that javelin, the Bible says it went into the wall.  
 That's for the guy who wanted to make king.  
What a gift.  
Are you still there?  
I said, how intense is your love?  
How intense is your love?  
You ought to be feeling the fullness of God?  
Then intensity of your love must become like his.  
That great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in saints.  
The great love with which he loved us.  
 even when we were dead in sin.  
Oh, thanks be unto God.  
Hallelujah.  
And what's the next one?  
Height.  
Is it right?  
How high is talking about the loftiness of the character of your love?  
How lofty  
 In character is that love.  
How excellent is it?  
Does it exceed human witness?  
Does it overlook human failures?  
Does it function at God's high levels of excellence?  
What kind of love do you have?  
How high is your love?  
How high is it?  
How high is your love?  
 How high is your love?  
Is it so high that bitterness of others can drown it?  
How high is your love?  
Can it accept others?  
Who don't accept you?  
Can it speak well of others who speak evil of you?  
How high is your love?  
How excellent is your love?  
That's what he's talking about.  
 Sometimes we love those who love us and hate those who hate us.  
Why did you do this?  
Well, what about what he did to me?  
What about what he did to me?  
Am I the only one?  
Okay, why don't you forgive?  
Or you let him or so forgive?  
Am I the only one that should be forgiven?  
He'd choose you forgive.  
Do you want to be filled with all the fullness of God?  
Then you must be different.  
Let others think like that, not you.  
 How you see you there.  
Head others think like that.  
Stay at the high level of love that thinks differently, that talks differently.  
And you'll be amazed at the workings of God in your life.  
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
Love is magnetic.  
I can explain that to you.  
Love pulls others to you because everybody wants to be loved.  
Everybody wants to be loved because everybody thinks he's lovely.  
But you know, you wonder, what about those who come into sight because  
 to hit their lives.  
No.  
No, the Bible says no man ever yet hated himself.  
 When you see someone who kills himself, because he says, oh, I hate my life.  
If you hate your life, continue the suffering then.  
Why do you kill yourself for hating yourself?  
No, if you really hate yourself, continue the suffering and say, I'm suffering, I love, I suffer, I love it.  
No, but he goes to kill himself because he loves himself so much and doesn't want to continue the suffering.  
So he takes his own life.  
He hates to see himself suffer because he loves himself.  


  
 No man ever yet hated himself.  
Alleluia.  
How high is your love?  
What's the character of your love?  
What is it like?  
Can you look at others and see them with the eyes at which God sees us?  
Can you be so full of compassion as Jesus was?  
Perhaps as he was full of compassion.  
 You know, if you ever get to know the love of God, you'll be amazed at the kind of person you will become.  
That's true, very true.  
Let me show you something in Psalm 32.  
Glasses Psalm 32.  
Hallelujah.  
I am glad  
 I am blind.  
I am blind to my love.  
 I am glad.  


  
I belong to my Lord.  
I am glad.  


  
 Hallelujah.  


  
He says here in verse 7, Psalm 32, thou at my hiding place, thou shall preserve me from trouble, thou shall compass me about with songs of deliverance.  
 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go.  
I will guide thee with my eye."  
Oh, hallelujah.  
Look at this.  
It shows us how God cares.  
How close he really wants to be with us.  
How close?  
If we could comprehend the love.  
Let me show you another thing.  
Turn the Proverbs chapter eight.  
 Proverbs chapter 8.  
Now when you read the whole chapter 8 of the book of Proverbs, you'll understand he's talking about wisdom.  
 Wisdom says, before God created anything, I was with him.  
Wisdom, wisdom is the word of God.  
In the beginning, what's the word?  
The word was with God.  
So that whole chapter eight really gives us a good picture of wisdom, the word.  
And you know the word became flesh and dwelled among us.  
But here, from verse  
 from verse 28, so he can get in context.  
When he established the clouds above, when he's trending the fountains of the deep, when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment, when he appointed the foundations of the earth, then I was by him as one brought up with him, and I was daily, his delight rejoicing always before him.  
Now, this is nice.  
He says, I was so close to him.  
I was always with him.  
 The Word says that.  
The wisdom of God says that.  
Then, strikingly, He goes on, verse 31, rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth.  
And my delights were with the sons of men.  
Uh-oh.  
The Word of God.  
The Word of God tells us how He was always with God.  
 always in fellowship with God, never separated from God, loved to be there.  
And he was God's delight, the father's delight.  
Then he says, I rejoice in his habitable earth.  
That tells you there are inhabitable parts of the earth.  
I don't know what some people are doing there.  
 Every now and then, they tell us, there's a tornado, there's air quick, there's this and there's that, and they're still there.  
I always say to myself, what are they doing there?  
Don't they understand the viruses, there's habitable Earth?  
What you know, you know, human beings, they like to conquer everything, and that's nice.  
So, so...  
 Wisdom says, I, my rejoicing, I rejoiced in the habitable earth, in his habitable earth, in my delights were with the songs of men.  
Oh, what he was always happy about, his pleasures, his excitements, all of that he enjoyed when he was with men, with human beings, how he loves us.  
That's not what religion tells us.  
 Legion gives us the impression, God, God, God's dad of us.  
God's just waiting for judgment, they're wondering if he can fix everything.  
That's what many people think.  
But he loves to be with us.  
That's what we just read.  
My delights are with the sounds of me.  
That's my joy, to be with them.  
I like it over here.  
That's what he's saying.  
 I've always been in heaven.  
I've always been with God.  
I've been everywhere with Him.  
This is what I like it over here with human beings.  
That was there.  
I like it with them.  
I like it over here in His habitable earth with human beings.  
How He loves us.  
What a picture of love.  
What a picture of love.  
 Hallelujah.  
You know, when you study about the character of love, the excellence of love, you can read about that in 1 Corinthians chapter 13, most of you know it.  
1 Corinthians chapter 13, when you're reading from verse 4, all the way to verse 8, some of you have memorized that portion of the Bible.  
But I think it's better when you act them, right?  
Better when you act them.  
 And one of the things you can do for yourself is make a study and in trying to have all those words in that portion of the Bible defined for yourself.  
Just to be sure, I'm not just assuming that you know where I'm talking about.  
Can you go there now?  
First Corinthians chapter 13.  


  
 In our read from verse 1, I told you the emphasis will be from verse 4 to verse 8.  
 but let's get the right context from verse one.  
He says, though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels in half not charity, which has been wrongly translated, a charity here in the King James Version is agape, it means love.  
I am become a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.  
Though I speak with tongues of men and of angels in half not love,  
 He says, it's empty.  
He didn't say you wouldn't speak in tongues.  
He says, you can speak but in terms of men and terms of angels.  
But without love, he says, empty, useless.  
And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, sort of uncle, remove mountains and have not love, I am nothing.  
 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, love, it profited me nothing.  
Love, suffer it long.  
That doesn't mean love so fast for a long time.  
 So it's always better to read this portion in the amplified version.  
So I want to read it to you from the amplified version.  
Somebody says, I'm full of love, because I've been suffering for a very long time.  


  
We're all his thermal endurance.  
He says, love endures long and is patient and kind.  
Love never is envious.  
 Not bars over with jealousy.  
Some people boil over with jealousy.  
They just can't stand some other fellow.  
They can't stand the success of somebody else.  
If you say something nice has happened, they say, really, tell me about it.  
And you say, so and so and so and so, did it.  
Really.  
Really.  
Did he?  
 It changed the excitement just because he was the one that did it.  
Is that why you're happy?  
Oh yeah, so one so said this and it was wonderful.  
But I said it the other day and nobody was happy.  
No!  
 Let your love, I said, how high?  
What is the height of your love?  
How lofty in character is it?  
How excellent is it?  
How is it?  
Can you rejoice about everybody?  
Oh boy, I told you, I have not met somebody that I didn't like.  
I've never met someone I didn't like.  
It was not automatic.  
I trained myself with the Word of God for that.  
I've met up my mind years ago.  
There'll be nobody that I don't like.  
 Yeah, because I found out he paid the same price for everybody.  
Everybody.  
No one was more expensive than the other.  
We were paid for with the same blood of Jesus Christ.  
And the manifestation of God through your life is that value that you give to everyone else.  
Are you still here?  
Where is God?  
 He's his love endures long and his vision and kind.  
Love never is angels, no boys of our jealousy.  
He's not boastful of vain glorious, does not display itself.  
Hallelujah.  
It is not conceited, arrogant and inflated with pride.  
It is not rude.  
You know, some people are rude, rude.  
He says, love is not rude.  
Hallelujah.  
How?  
I like this.  
 He says, and does not act on becomingly love.  
God's love in us does not insist on his own rights or its own way for his not self-seeking.  
It is not self-seeking.  
It is not self-seeking.  
It is not touchy or fretful.  
Why do we have so many problems between husbands and wives?  
Because they're self-seeking.  
Each person warns his own way.  
 It's hard.  
How can you be happy?  
How can you be fulfilled when you want your own way?  
You know, somebody said years ago that men and women coming to marriage with Chisel and Hammer.  
They're planning well when I get married to her, I'll Chisel hang to shape.  
And what he doesn't know is she's coming with her own Chisel and Hammer.  
 to make you the man she wants you to be.  
Why you are thinking you're gonna make her the woman of your dream.  
It's not gonna work.  
No, it's not gonna work.  
How many things to tell you?  
You still there?  
Yeah.  
 Love is not self-seeking.  
Love is not self-seeking.  
And it is not touchy, touchy.  
Every leader thinks, ah, ah, ah.  
Every leader, you'll offend it.  
You'll offend it about everything.  
Why are you so offended?  
You don't want me to go in that direction, are you?  
Pastor, just preach on other things.  
I know that's what you're thinking now.  
You don't want me to just take off on that.  
I'll spare you for this moment.  
 Yeah, because, you know, people, you can rejoice in Christ.  
And when you hear everything, but then you come home and all the frowns return.  
You were happy in church until you got home.  


  
Why?  
Because you know you've come to the ark enemy of your soul.  
Now, here is the devil now.  


  
 Two people who were in love.  
It's amazing.  
Now, they don't like each other.  
No, I do.  
I just don't like the way he acts.  
Yeah, I do.  
I just don't like what she says.  
Continue.  
You know, I was told one time, a young couple, I was told,  
 The guy and his wife were fighting.  
Somebody said, Pastor, you got to do something.  
This two have been fighting.  
They're fighting each other.  
They might just destroy themselves.  
I said, let him find it out.  
They told us the other day, I do, I do.  
Let him find out.  


  
He's that Christianity?  
It's not.  
 It's not.  
No matter what you think about it, someone said, well, if two people who are married, after some time, they no longer satisfied with each other.  
And they said, this one wants to go his own way.  
Everybody can go his own way.  
You see, you don't even understand Christianity.  
You don't understand it.  
It just means you don't understand it.  
It takes two people who are married to stay together.  
 It takes one to destroy it.  
That's all.  
It takes one to destroy it.  
The choice, you cannot understand spiritual authority until you are only the authority of the word.  
Until Christians understand  
 that when you say that you are getting married to somebody, there is no outing option.  
What of if he doesn't treat me right?  
It doesn't matter.  
What of if he's going to kill me?  
He can't.  
There's no outing option.  
Why is that difficult to understand?  
 You know, you can become uncomfortable.  
You're so uncomfortable.  
I'm not happy.  
I'm no longer happy in this house.  
I'm happy everywhere else, except I can't even pray here.  
I can't.  
Oh.  
Then Holy Spirit, my patience has been tested.  
Oh.  
Oh.  
 I can't continue.  
Then you go to pastor, pastor, Mr. Pastor.  
I know what I've gone through.  
I can't continue.  
I can't continue.  
That means you don't understand what you entered.  


  
There is no outing option.  
There is no room for the discussion.  
 Do you understand?  
Do you understand?  
Look, I have a question.  
Why should two Christians, who are married, have problems about staying to get irrespective of what's happening?  
Why?  
Because, listen, we have pastors here, right?  
Now, we have some members of the church come to us and say, Pastor, my husband bits me, bits me, bits me silly.  
 He says, I must not go to church, but I always have to sneak and come to church.  
But when he finds out, it's hell at home.  
And then we pastors, we say, don't worry, just continue to pray for him.  
One day a miracle will happen.  
Don't worry, just continue.  
Two weeks time, she comes again.  
Pastor, look at the marks on my body.  
 He beat me last night and beat me, beat me, look at, look at.  
Oh, don't worry.  


  
So we pray, pray, pray in tongues and pray and say, don't worry.  
The Lord will see you through.  


  
 It's either we lied about the Lord or it's true.  
Now if it's true that the comfort we shared or extended to them was real, why is it that when it comes to ministers, I can't just imagine  
 What she was saying, and there's a, I can't just imagine what he was telling me.  
I can't, I can't take it.  
I can't, nobody can take it.  
And nobody can tell you to take it.  
Why don't we act like Paul, who says, we comforted others with the comfort with which we are, there's a comforted of God.  
The same words.  
We can tell a sister to remain in a marriage, who's married to a wicked, terrible fellow.  
 And then all this one has to say to us is one thing, and we are mad.  
Why do Christians have no patience with themselves?  
The patience that we preach to them to have with other people does God command patience more for others than for his kids.  
He says, do good unto all men, especially to them of the household of faith.  
 Be smart.  
Are you still there?  
Yes.  
I know, even if you went on suspension during that last part of it.  
I'll drag you back.  
You're still here?  
Yes.  
OK, OK, OK.  
So if you've, you know, you coming for this conference is nice.  
You're like St.  
Peter and St.  
Paul together, you know.  
Come back at the chair.  
Once you go back home.  
 You're wired now.  
One puts on the TV on this station.  
They don't say, what about the other station?  
Why can't you watch another station?  
I think the two of you buy double remote controls for the TV.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Be filled with his love.  
Understand his love.  
Are you hearing me?  
Love.  
Do a study on it and practice it.  
Don't have it as a sermon.  
Have it in your life.  
Be full of it.  
Let it burn in your heart.  
Let it burn in your spirit.  
Be the manifestation of that love.  
 24 hours a day everywhere you go.  
Make it real.  
Hallelujah.  
Make it real.  
Be full of it.  
The love of God.  
Decide to swim in his love.  
The love of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 Can you love with the love of God?  
He says, if we have that love, if we understand it, we can be filled with all the fullness of God.  
You know, I was telling you something.  
He tells us in John chapter 1 verse 16 of his fullness, have we received?  
 we've received of His fullness, all right?  
So we're filled with His fullness, all right?  
When we're filled with His fullness, we can, others can receive of our fullness.  
That's ministry.  
He's so full of God.  
You are so full of God.  
 And so, others who come to you can receive of your fullness.  
Because you see, we represent Him.  
We're like Him.  
Hallelujah.  
You are the minister of the gospel.  
That means you've got something inside you to give.  
You'd have something to give.  
It's there.  
 It's where I'm not, you can trust it.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Well, we're going to continue on that message.  
We haven't finished it, but the Holy Spirit, you know, He's in this place, right?  
Amen.  
Hallelujah.
