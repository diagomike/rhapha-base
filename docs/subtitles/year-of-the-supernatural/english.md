 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.

I would love to listen to your voice.  


  
 All my will, all my will, all my will.  


  
 You're my wisdom, my health, and my love.  
But I, that's who you are.  
Oh, yeah, yeah, it does, yes, sir.  
Oh, I love you.  
I love to be with you.  


  
 Well... Guess what?  
It's 2018!  


  
 Welcome!  
Welcome to 2018!  
Happy New Year!  


  
 Welcome to 2018!  
Well, go ahead and give God praise!  


  
 Thank you Lord.  
Praise God.  
Look at the person next to you.  
 and say Happy New Year.  
Look at the one on the other side and say Happy New Year.  
Look at the one behind you and say Happy New Year.  
Happy New Year.  
Praise the Lord.  
You know, the year  
 means nothing without the word of God.  
God's word is your light.  
God's word is your light.  
God's word is your direction.  
God's word is your instruction.  
And I want to take a few minutes to tell you what the Lord has shown me.  
 about 2018.  
And it's very, very important because he's not only telling us what the year is for us, but also giving us direction, guidance, in a way to go so that it will be for us everything that he has said.  
 Many times when we hear the word bless, not many understand what it is.  
When we say, God bless you or I am blessed.  
If we don't understand the things that the Word of God tells us, we'll never be able to apply them  
 to our personal lives and we can shortchange ourselves and not get the benefits of what his word gives us.  
Hallelujah.  
So I want to explain that to you what it means to bless.  
 And I want you to write it up so you don't forget it.  
It's simple, but don't forget it.  
It means to cost to prosper, to cost to prosper.  
All this is coming from the words in the Greek translated bless or even the Hebrew translated bless.  
 It means to cost the prosper, to favor, to evoke successful outcomes.  


  
It also means to infuse with abilities.  
So when you say, God has blessed me,  
 Oh, when God says, I will bless you.  
What is saying is, I will cost you to prosper.  
What is easiest?  
I will favor you.  
I will evoke successful outcomes.  
That means successful results.  
The things that concern you.  
 What it says, I bless you.  
It also means that you infuse into you divine abilities.  
Hallelujah.  
 That's what it means.  
So you can see how important this is.  
So when God called Abraham and said to him, I will bless you and make you a blessing.  
Now you can understand the power of that.  
He was saying, I'm gonna cost you to prosper.  
I'm gonna favor you.  
I'm gonna evoke within you and about you and for you successful outcomes.  
So that no matter what you do, no matter what happens to you or with you,  
 turn out for your good.  
And he also meant, I'll infuse into you special abilities.  
Wow.  
Wow.  
So that's what he said to Abraham.  
No wonder Abraham was successful everywhere he went.  
He wasn't successful by the standards of the word.  
He was far beyond them.  
 He wasn't successful by human abilities.  
No, he was far beyond that.  
He was different from others because God blessed him.  
God favored him.  
That's divine favor.  
That's what it is to be blessed.  
You know, what a lot of people require today in their lives is a blessing.  
 Many people need to be blessed.  
They're trying.  
They're struggling.  
They're working so hard by all human standards.  
They are putting in every effort.  
They're working very hard.  
But they need an edge.  
Divine blessing.  
That divine blessing changes everything.  
Where the maximum result is five.  
For everybody, you get more than that.  
 because of the divine element of blessing.  
This is the farthest anybody can get.  
But when you are blessed, you go beyond it.  
Not by your ability, it just happens.  
It just happens.  
No one can go through that place.  
But when it's you,  
 You're able to go.  
Did you know that we're supposed to work in such blessings, but many, many Christians have never been educated about these things.  
They struggle like others.  
They try so hard like others.  
They even beg God about it, because they don't know how to operate in these things, how to live in this dimension.  
 this struggle for a long time, a very long time.  
I have seen many Christians suffer for a long time.  
It was one of the things I wanted to study to find out, why do people suffer for so long?  
And I looked into the Bible, I found some people who suffered for a long time, like the man who was sick for 38 long years.  
And when Jesus got to him, he said to the man, do you want to be well?  
 The man has suffered 38 long years and the Bible says Jesus knew that he had been in that case for a long time.  
And the dialogue that ensued between them helped me to know why people suffer for a very long time.  
I could see it from there because the Lord guided me to study that man's case and a few others and see why do some people suffer for a long, long time?  
 It's not supposed to be.  
And as a child of God, that's not supposed to happen.  
No, the things that we can face are persecutions, no problem, because even in the midst of persecution, you win.  
You're full of joy, but suffering with sickness, suffering with defeat, lack of success, failure in whatever it is,  
 No, no, no, no.  
God never wants you to come to that position where you are depressed, saddened, broken down, crushed.  
No matter what happens, there's a blessing in your life that you always put you over.  
And this 2018, the spirit of God is determined  
 to take you on and show you this way and life of absolute success and absolute mastery.  
Oh, you are going to see it.  
Hallelujah.  
You're going to see it.  
You're going to see it.  
So start getting yourself ready.  
You're going to see it.  
Amen.  
Okay.  
 Are you ready?  
So now you've understood blessing.  
Let me take you to something that happened in Bible days.  
God told the children of Israel when they were on their way to the promised land in the wilderness.  
He said to them, I'm going to give you manner from heaven, manner will fall.  
 This was the food they were eating.  
There was no food in the desert.  
God had to give them food from heaven.  
He dropped down manna from heaven.  
And he said to them, six days you are to labor.  
On the seventh day is a day of rest.  
So I don't want you working.  
I don't want you gathering manna on that day.  
 So on the sixth day, I will give you twice as much manner.  
Now, here's the interesting thing.  
Every other day, he said, don't gather manner and keep for the next day.  
Because if you keep it for the next day, it will go bad.  
You couldn't keep it for the next day.  
You took as much as you wanted to eat for that day, because the next day, it will come again.  
 But on the sixth day, he said, gather twice as much because you're not going to be gathering tomorrow.  
So he empowered the man to stay for the next day.  
Can you see the power of God?  
On the sixth day, God put power into the manner to stay to the next day.  
That's wonderful.  
 Now he's teaching them something, teaching them something, and then they come into the promised land.  
When it got into the promised land, he taught them another thing.  
He said, every seven years, you must allow the land to rest.  
So you can cultivate your land, sow your crops, harvest your land, six years.  
 But under 70 years, he says, don't plant anything.  
Don't harvest anything.  
A whole year.  
The 70 years, he says, I don't want you planting anything.  
So how are we going to feed?  
He said, under 60 years, I'll give you twice as much.  
He said, I'll bless your land so much you'll have abundance.  
You'll have enough for the next year.  
 God is showing His power.  
Imagine the orange tree that would have produced 150 fruits every year.  
On the sixth year, we produce 300 fruits.  
Suddenly, it's empowered to do beyond what it will normally do.  
This was what the children of Israel were enjoying.  
 He was there no more life because God said so.  
Tell somebody because God said so.  
He said because God said so.  
Now here was the next thing.  
Then he said, every seven weeks of years, you know what that means?  
That means seven years times seven.  
That's 49 years.  
 That means every seven years and seven years, seven times.  
He says, the 49th year, he would now sound a trumpet for the 50th year.  
He says, the 50th year, now I want you to notice something.  
Remember, the 49th year, he says, 70 years.  
 from the 777.  
So for the 90s is 78.  
Now he says, the 50th year is the year of Jubilee.  
And he says, in the year of Jubilee, I don't want you to plant anything.  
I don't want you to harvest anything.  
No working.  
So what are they going to eat?  
You think it should be the previous year.  
 which is the 49th year, but the 49th year is a 70 year.  
So they're not supposed to plant anything.  


  
So they've got two years of not planting anything, the 49th year not planting, the 50th year not planting.  
God said that 60 year before the 70 year,  
 which will be what?  
That 48 years.  
He said, I will bless you and give you three years of harvest in one year.  
He said, I'll give you three years of harvest.  
Don't bother.  
Three years of harvest.  


  
 So that by the time your crops will be getting ready in the 90 year, you still have from the old stock.  
Now, this is all in the book.  
You can read it for yourself.  
Leviticus chapter 25, just read for yourself.  
I'm gonna read you one verse right there.  
Leviticus chapter 25.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Let's read verse 21.  


  
 Look at what God said.  
He says, I will command my blessing upon you in the 60 year.  
I will command my blessing upon you in the 60 year.  
And it shall bring forth fruit for three years.  


  
Can God do this?  
Is he lying?  
 What all he needed to do was to command his blessing.  
That's all he said.  
He said, I command my blessing upon you.  
I need to bring forth fruit for three years.  
Your land will produce fruit for three years.  
Can you imagine?  
I mean, how many of you could go on leave for three years?  
No, P. No, but with this knowledge, you can now understand it.  
You can now understand what God is saying.  
 And these were people of the old contract.  


  
Did you hear me say the old contract?  
Hahaha.  
Old contract.  
Likabarasataya.  
Landoroboziparababababaya.  
Aya.  
Monta Carrazé.  


  
 You know, when things are happening like that, Mantoko Zibra then... I used to do that.  


  
 He said, I will command my blessing upon you in the 60 years.  
And it shall bring fruit for three years.  
It shall bring fruit for three years.  
So God is able to make it happen.  
That's why he said so.  
That's why he said so.  
It shall bring fruit for three years.  
 Say, God can do it.  
Say again, God can do it.  
Say, God cannot lie.  
He can do it.  


  
You know, in the days of Nebuchadnezzar, let me show you some.  
Daniel chapter 1.  
 Go to the book of Daniel, chapter one.  
I want us to read, you know, the king wanted certain young men trained, and he got them from several countries, and they brought them in there.  
And among them were  
 Four Hebrew boys, Daniel, and then you have the ones that we know more popularly as Shirdrak, Mishaq, and Abednego.  
They were actually named so by the custodian of the Unix.  
 But here's what I love.  
On the day that they were brought to be examined by the king, I want us to read Daniel chapter 1 verse 20.  


  
 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them, he found them, he found Daniel, Shirdrak, Misha, and Abedne go 10 times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all Israel.  
They were 10 times better.  
Why?  
Because God had blessed them.  
God had blessed them.  
 with supernatural intelligence.  


  
They were found ten times better.  
Say it again, ten times better.  
Ten times better.  
Say it again, ten times better.  


  
 You know, when the Holy Spirit of God touched the life of David, the power of God came on him when Samuel the prophet, anointed him to become King of Israel, but he was a young man.  
 So the spirit of God was upon his life.  
His father sent him to take some food to his brothers who were at war and to find out how they were doing.  
He got there and heard Goliath threatening the armies of Israel.  
And David, you know the story, David turned out  
 slaying Goliath of gods.  
Here's what I want us to read.  
Saw himself, saw the king of Israel at the time, was a great man of war.  
But when he faced Goliath, he was scared to death.  
He was afraid.  
He was so afraid.  
But David, the young man, 17 years old, had no fear of Goliath.  
 and sleutian.  
The difference was the spirit of God had departed from Saul, and the spirit had come upon David.  
So Saul was now an ordinary man, and David had the supernatural.  
Let's read.  
First Samuel chapter 18,  
 Verse 6, we'll read it into verse 7.  
And it came to pass as they came when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine that the woman came out of our cities of Israel, singing and dancing to meet King Saul with reverence, with joy and with instruments of music.  
Read verse 7.  


  
 What were they seeing in the Spirit?  
Ten times more.  
Ten times more.  
They were seeing it in the Spirit.  
They could have said 12.  
They could have said six.  
But they were seeing something.  
Even King Saul didn't like what they were singing.  
He didn't like it.  
The Bible says from that day forward, he was jealous of David and angry at him.  
They said Saul had slain his thousands and David, his ten thousands,  
 He only killed Goliath.  
But when he did, what happened to the Philistine army?  
They fled.  
They all fled.  
They couldn't wait.  
17 year old boy, standing and the whole army is running away from him.  
As he holds the head of Goliath in his hand, Saul had slain his thousands and did it his 10,000.  
 something about what the spirit of God does in our lives.  
Are you still there?  
I want to show you something else.  
Hey guy, chapter 2.  
We're going to read quickly from verse 1.  


  
Look of hey guy, chapter 2  


  
 I'm reading from verse one.  
In the seventh month, in the one and 20th day of the month, came the word of the Lord by the prophet Hagia, saying, speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shaltiel, governor of Judah, and Joshua, the son of Josidek, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying, who is left among you?  
Now they had returned from where they had been scattered.  
 Now they're back in their land.  
And they were commanded to build the temple.  
And they had trouble after trouble, lots of difficulty in building God a house.  
And gradually everybody gave up and said, I do another things.  
So here the prophet says to them, who is left among you that saw this house?  
 in her first glory, the building, the temple.  
But it's so poor.  
It's not going on well.  
There are no resources.  
There's so much disturbance.  
They don't even know whether to go on or not.  
And now they have two prophets, Professor Heger and Zechariah.  
 But heger goes, who is left among you that saw this house in our first glory?  
And how do you see it now?  
Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?  
Yet now be strong.  
Hallelujah.  
 Be strong goes the river, say it, the Lord.  
And be strong, O Joshua, son of Josidek, the high priest.  
And be strong, O ye people of the land, say it to the Lord, and work for I am with you, say it to the Lord of hosts.  
 According to the word that I confident with you when you came out of Egypt, so my spirit watched the difference.  
So my spirit remained among you, fear ye not.  
For those who had a lot of hosts, yet once, it's a little while, and I will shed the heavens and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.  
And I will shed all nations,  
 What does he mean by shaking?  
He's not talking about the vibration.  
He's not about physical vibration.  
He says, he will shake them.  
That means he would travel them, he will stare them up, things will begin to happen.  
They'll be shaken, economically shaken.  
Why?  
Because of what's next.  
I know it's... Look at it.  
And I will shake all nations.  
And the desire of all nations shall come.  
 What's the desire for our nations?  
He's not talking about Jesus.  
The nations are not desiring Jesus.  
There's only one thing that moves the nations to date His mind.  
He says, in our filled His house with glory.  
Set the Lord of hosts.  
The silver is mine.  
And the gold is mine.  
Set the Lord of hosts.  
Somebody say hallelujah.  
 He says, the cell by his mind and the gold his mind said, the glory of this lot of house.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Not the glory of the lot of house, but this lot of house.  
The glory of this lot of house shall be richer than of the former.  
 He said, how many of you saw the former house?  
How many of you saw the former glory?  
He says, this one that's looking wretched to you.  
This one that doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  
He says, the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former.  
And in this place will I give peace.  
 Did you see that?  
He says, in this place, will I give peace?  
When God gives peace, it doesn't matter what's happening outside.  
They cannot trouble you.  
If not over yet, then the next one, the other prophet, takes on his prophecy and he starts.  
Zechariah chapter 4,  
 Verse 6.  


  
We begin from verse 6.  
Then he answered and speck unto me saying, this, who's talking to him?  
The angel of the Lord is talking to Zechariah.  
He says, this is the world of the Lord unto Zerubbabel.  
He's given him a message for Zerubbabel.  
All right?  
What does he say?  
Not by might.  
 This is the same as the Riverbell that Heger was prophesying to.  
He says, this is the word of the Lord unto the Riverbell saying, not by might, nor by power, not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit.  
Say it to a lot of hosts.  
 Not by might.  
Nor by power.  
But by my spirit, say it to a lot of hosts.  
Who are thou?  
Oh, great mountain.  
Before the Riverbell, you shall become level ground.  
You shall be leveled.  
You shall be a plane.  
 And he says, the river bell shall bring forth the headstone, the capstone.  
In other words, you know when you finish building the building.  
Now you set the capstone.  
That means at the end of everything.  
He's saying, the river bell, you're going to see the capstone in his head.  
You're going to see it.  
In other words, this building, let's see it.  
You'd see it right here.  
 Ho, ho, ho, mama, mama.  
Who are thou great mountain?  
Before the river bell thou shall become a plain, and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings?  
Crying, grace, grace, grace.  
Do you understand?  
He has finished the building, and in shouting it happened by grace.  
It's our grace.  
When you say how much did he cost?  
Grace!  
 What did you do to get it?  
Grace!  
Glory to God!  
Grace, grace, grace!  
Moreover, the world of the Lord came unto me, saying, the hands of the riverbell have laid the foundation of this house.  
His hands shall also finish it.  
And thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you.  


  
 It's called grace.  
It's called grace, brother.  


  
It's called grace.  


  
 Lindo Rogobo, Satara Mandilegibaya, Lagasatara Kabasiti.  
It's called grace.  
Let me show you one more.  
Ezekiel chapter 47.  
In verse 12, it's coming from a long portion in  
 There are so many beautiful things there, but I want to take you straight to verse 12 so that you can just get a picture of this section.  
I'll show you.  
Use the NIV to be simpler because it's long and King James.  
Fritries of all kinds who grow on boats, banks of the river, their leaves will not wither.  
 No, will that fruit fail?  
Every month there will be, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them.  
Now, if you understand what's talking about here, this water's coming from the sanctuary.  
And it says, because the water that's flowing to these trees  
 The water that's coming, flowing to these plants, is coming from the sanctuary.  
He says, their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail, and their bare fruit every month, and their fruit will serve for food, and their leaves for healing.  
 Because the water that's coming to them is coming from the sanctuary.  


  
The water is coming from the sanctuary.  
Do you remember that also?  
You have made me a sanctuary.  


  
 So with the Holy Ghost, I'm a living sanctuary.  
What now says, what are you issued from the sanctuary?  
 And when that water issued from the sanctuary, he brought life to these plants on the banks of the river.  
And every dead thing that this water touched, the Bible says, came to life.  
He says, because the water came from the sanctuary.  


  
Hey, my brothers and sisters,  
 St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 7.  
Let's read from verse 37.  
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, amen first.  
Let him come unto me and drink, soraka basattara maya.  
Let him come unto me and drink.  
Huh, next.  
 He that believe it on me as the scripture had said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water rivers of living water rivers of living water  
 Live in what?  
What does it mean by live in what?  
Next verse.  
But this speck he of the spirit, which they that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified.  
Can you see that?  
 He says, let him come to me and drink.  
Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
How can this river flow out of your belly?  
How did it come out?  
You drink of the Holy Ghost.  
 Do you understand?  
The day you received the Holy Ghost, you drank of the Holy Ghost.  
That's what he was saying.  
He that believed in me as the scripture had said.  
Out of his belly.  
Said, if any man thirst, come to me and drink.  
Come and drink.  
And out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
 How do you pull out these rivers?  
How do they come out of you?  
They come out in words.  
They come out in words of life.  
For Jesus said the words that I speak unto you, they are spirits and they are life.  
 They are spirits, zerakaba, ababa, ababa.  
Do you understand now?  
The words that we speak haven't drunk of the Holy Ghost.  
Those words are spirits.  
Those words are life.  
The issuing from the sanctuary.  
Issuing from the sanctuary.  
Are you ready for 2018, my brothers and sisters?  
 Do you understand what is about to happen in 2018?  
Do you understand what the Spirit of God is telling us about?  
The waters issue from the sanctuary and everything the waters touch come to life.  
Every tree produces results, produces fruits, bears, fruits.  
Can you think about this?  
 Something is happening.  
You know, in entering into this year, the Lord has determined something for us.  
Because, see, let me remind you of something.  
When Jesus came, John the Baptist, who went ahead of him, told the people, he said, don't keep saying your children of Abraham without serving him.  
 He says, because God is able, if you will not obey Him, if you will not do His words, He is not going to be disappointed.  
Out of these stones, God is able to raise up children unto Abraham.  
And He did.  
He did.  
He did.  


  
For you are living stones.  
 He raised of these children onto Abraham from the stones.  
I wish I had time for that tonight.  
Hallelujah.  
Are you still there?  
It means that the Lord was determined to bring His Word to pass because it was time.  
This is the time to favor Zion.  
The set time has come.  
The set time, because there is a set time.  
 And when that set time comes, everything starts working together.  
Everything starts working together to bring to birds what God has said, what God has determined in the realm of the Spirit for your information.  
This year will mark 70 years since the creation of the state of Israel.  
 And as you know, 70 is a special number.  
70 is a special number.  
Something is happening in the realm of the spirits.  
And that's why it's reflecting in the earth.  
 It's reflecting in the earth.  
There are seven times you've ridden your Bible.  
The Bible tells us how that Jacob was sleeping and he had a dream.  
There was a lot of reaching up to heaven from the earth.  
And he said, I saw angels ascending and descending upon it.  
There are special times and special places where angels  
 that are sending and descending, doing something.  
They are working.  
Something is happening.  
And right now, that is happening in the spirit.  
And throughout this year, it's a special time that falls in line with God's spiritual calendar.  
Are you hearing me?  
I'll give you an example.  
 Saul is going to arrest as many Christians as he could find.  
Nobody is witnessing to Saul, but suddenly he is his name.  
Saul!  
Saul!  
Who are the persecutors thou me?  
Jesus speaks from heaven by himself.  
He addresses the man from heaven.  
The supernatural had to come in.  
 Are you still there?  
This time, Jesus was not waiting to send somebody.  
The heavens didn't wait to send somebody to go win that soul.  
Heaven in a van right away.  
So much so that for him to receive the Holy Ghost, the Lord appeared to a man named Ananias and said Ananias, get up from here.  
And you go down to the street called straight and lay your hands on a man called Saul.  
 And I said, I know that man, he's been making havoc on the church.  
The Lord said, go.  
He's a chosen vessel under me.  
I've knocked him out.  
Go media.  
The heavens got into the evangelism.  
That was a special time.  
Do you understand what I'm talking about?  
Brothers and sisters, we are not alone.  
 I said, this year is a very special year.  
While we are doing something, some more will be getting done.  
Are you hearing what I'm telling you?  
You are supposed to be packing things over here.  
You are hoping that when you finish this one, you go over there to finish that one.  
But by the time you're finishing that one, that one is completely ready.  


  
 You're going to be finding money, money that you didn't know where it came from.  
Because of the Ministry of Angels.  
Are you hearing me?  
Oh, somebody said, yeah, those things might be wishful thinking, then you don't know the God I'm talking about.  
Then you don't know the Bible that I hold in my hand.  
Then you don't know the Holy Ghost that ministering through us.

There's nothing stopping us.  
These are the last days.  
These are not poor, my spirit upon our flesh.  
And your songs and your daughters shall prophesy.  
They're going to speak words of power.  


  
 There's an intervention this year.  
There's an intervention from the heavenlies.
