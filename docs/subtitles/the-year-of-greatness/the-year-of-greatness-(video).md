Peace and faith proclaim great eyes, he that is in need, that he that is in the world.  
He is going to yell, greatness.  
No one can stop it.  
The Lord will begin to magnify you from glory to glory, throughout 2014.  


  
 As the curtains of the year 2013, the year of favor drew to a glorious close.  
Millions around the world breathed with excitement and expectation as they eagerly awaited the Rima word for 2014.

Are you ready to get in the world?  
 The minutes finally ticked into seconds and the spontaneous sounding of fireworks heralded by a joyous eruption of praise from the congregation signaled it was 2014.  


  
 Happy New Year!  


  
 Take the Lord.  
Take the Lord.  
Take the Lord.  
The high point of the meeting was when the man of God gave the message of the years.  
As they had chapped to sixty, I read from verse one.  


  
Only a few weeks ago, in the mountains,  
 of November, the Lord spoke to us when we were in a national pastors and partners conference, and the Lord said to us, this scriptural, this book, this chapter, this portion, Isaiah chapter 60, is this will characterize  
 your life, your ministry, this year.  
And so I want to read to you this very portion that he said, we are in at this time.  
This is where we're at.  
It is arise from verse 1, shine for thy light is come.  
 and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.  
For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness to people, but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee."  
 You see, there may be trouble in the world.  
There will be gross darkness in the world.  
He says, but the light of God will shine upon you.  
Hallelujah.  
So no matter what happens around the world, don't be moved because God's glory is upon you.  
Can you say, man?  
 and the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and king to the brightness of thy rising hallelujah.  
Lift top by the eyes round about and see, all they gather themselves together, they come to thee, thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed to thy side.  
Then thou shall see and flow together, and thy heart shall  
 fee and be enlarged, that means you exhort, you be scared, you be encouraged, that's what he's talking about.  
And it says, because the abundance of the sea shall become valid unto thee.  
The forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee.  
The molotage of cameras shall cover thee, the dronedaries of Midian and Ephah, all they from Shiba shall come, they shall bring gold and incense, and they shall show forth the praises of the Lord, shout Amen.  
 And the flocks of Kida shall be gathered together on to thee.  
The rams of the bayou shall minister unto thee.  
They shall come up with acceptance on my altar.  
And I will glorify the house of my glory."  
You know what he's telling you?  
He's telling you these represent different nations.  
He's saying that people from different nations will come to you.  
Glory to God.  
 Who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doors to their windows?  
Surely the eyes shall wait for me and the ships of Tasha's first to bring thy sons from far their silver and their gold with them unto the name of the Lord thy God and to the holy one of Israel because he had glorified thee?  
And the sons of strangers shall build up thy words, amen?  
And their kings shall minister unto thee, amen?  
Glory to God.  
 Could a verse 11, therefore thy gates shall be opened continually.  
This shall not be short day nor night.  
That men may bring on to thee the forces of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought for the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish.  
Yay, those nations shall be utterly wasted.  
The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee.  
 the factory, the pantry, and the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious.  
Hallelujah!  
The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee, and all day that despised thee shall bow themselves down a thy source and thy feet, and shall call thee the city of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.  
Hallelujah!  
 Oh, look at verse 15.  
Where as thou hast been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency.  
A joy of many generations.  
Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shall suck the breast of kings.  
And thou shalt know that I, the Lord, am thy Savior, and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.  
For brass, I will bring do.  
 For iron I will bring silver, For wood brass and for stones iron I will also make thy office as peace, And thine exactors' righteousness.  
Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, Wasting all the structure within thy borders, But thou shall call thy war salvation, And thy geeks praise, shut him in!  
 The sun shall be no more daylight by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee, but the Lord shall be unto thee, and everlasting light, and thy God thy glory shall amen.  
Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself, for the Lord shall be thy everlasting lights, and the days of thy money shall be ended.  
 Thy people also shall be all righteous.  
They shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planning, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.  
Amen.  
Then look at this one.  
This is wonderful.  
A little one shall become a thousand and a small one, a strong nation.  
I, the Lord, will hasten it in His time.  
Hallelujah.  
 Glory to God.  
Okay, now, follow this.  
This is wonderful.  
Are you listening to me now?  
Notice that last part of it is a little one shall become a thousand.  
And a small one, a strong nation.  


  
Glory to God.  
 Don't forget it, don't forget it, don't forget it.  
Now look where he takes you, I want you to see this.  
For he is what the Lord said to me so specifically, as I'm going to read it to you, listen to this.  
Just your chapter number three, and I'm reading from verse one.  
Hallelujah.  
And as I prepare to read this portion,  
 Wherever you may be participating with us in this service, it's also possible that you might even be here.  
You know, when we talk about Jesus, we're not talking about religion.  
We're not just trying to make people feel happy about themselves.  
Jesus is truly the Son of God who came to this world  
 to give us salvation, to bring us to the Father.  
If you haven't received Him into your life, receive Him tonight.  
And He will impact your spirit, will eternal life.  
Eternal life doesn't mean a life that doesn't stop.  
It's much more than that.  
 It's God's indestructible, imperishable life.  
It is the very nature of God, the essence, the real essence.  
It is the life that was in Christ Jesus when he came here.  
The very life of God.  
He said to us, as my father has life in himself, so has he given to the son to have life in himself.  
 If you receive Jesus into your heart, you will receive that life that you could never have otherwise.  
Men needs to have the life and nature of God.  
And until you have it, you don't know what it is.  
Only Christ gives that life.  
It's not in any religion.  
It's not an religious leader.  
 No amount of incantation will bring it to you.  
No amount of meditation will give it to you.  
No amount of good deeds will give you the life and nature of God.  
That's why Jesus had to come.  
The stories that he came to die, that we may live.  
And God raised him from the dead to prove him to be the Son of God with power.  
 And one day, this Jesus will judge the world.  
Tonight, make up your mind.  
At this beginning of 2014, you will give your heart to Jesus.  
When I make that call tonight, get ready to give him your heart and your all.  
Otherwise, what this message is about will make no sense to you.  
 It will not help you because it is given to those who are in Christ Jesus.  
So with that, I want to read to you what the Lord said to me here.  
From Joshua chapter three, I begin from verse one.  
And Joshua rose early in the morning.  
 And they removed from Shatim and came to Jordan.  
You know, he was leading the children of Israel after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord.  
And at this point, they were close to the Jordan.  
And while they were there, God spoke to Joshua.  
They're supposed to go through the Jordan.  
How are they going to get there?  
A miracle had to happen.  
Why don't you see this?  
 Verse 2.  
And it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host, and they commanded the people, saying, when you see the act of the covenant of the Lord, your God, and the priest, the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place and go after it.  
Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about 2,000 qubits by measure.  
Come not near unto it, that he may know the way by which he must go.  
 for you have not passed this wave heretofore, that means before.  
And Joshua said unto the people, sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do one as among you.  
Hahaha, hallelujah!  


  
 And Joshua specked onto the priest saying, take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people.  
And they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.  
And the Lord said unto Joshua, this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.  
And the Lord said, verse seven,  
 The Lord said unto Joshua, this day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of our issue.  
And the Lord said unto Joshua, this day will I begin to magnify thee.  


  
 This is what the Lord is saying to us.  
This day, which begins this year, and therefore this year, this day, this week, this month, this year 2014, the Lord will begin to magnify you  


  
 in the sight of others.  
And they will look at you and wander and say, Who are these?  
These are they that have been filled with the Holy Ghost.  
These are they that are walking in the light of God.  
These are they that are walking by the power of the Holy Ghost, walking in the Word of God, manifesting the victory of Christ.  
 These are the who proclaim great eyes, he that is in me, that he that is in the world.  
These are God's chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people.  
And you will show forth the praises of him who has called your darkness into his marvellous light.  
 2014, God has said it is the year of greatness.  


  
And He will magnify you.  
 This is the year of your greatness.  
And that greatness will begin.  
This is from this day, I'll begin to magnify you.  
In the sight of the people, they will look at you and wonder, hallelujah.  
 He will make your wonder to your generation.  
He will make your wonder to your words.  
You will be a wonder in your nation.  
You will be a wonder in your city, in your town, in the continent, and in the whole world.  
It is your year of greatness.  
You are the seed of Abraham.  
 Greatness is in your spirits.  
It will not be taken away from you.  
Hundarabashekabundalagratoskei shataramande.  
Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.  
He said unto Abraham, I will make you great.  
And he made him great.  
 It is your year of greatness.  


  
It is your year of greatness.  
This is your year.  


  
This is my year of greatness.  
Haha.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 It is my year of greatness.  


  
He said, this day will I begin to magnify you before the people  
 And they shall know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.  


  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Now go ahead and tell five people, this is my year of greatness.  


  
Make your confession.  
Make your declaration.  
It's your year.  
It's your year.  
 It's your year!  


  
Who's here of greatness is this?  
Who's here of greatness is this?  
Who's here of greatness?  
Who's here of greatness?  
Come on, somebody!  
It's your year!  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Can I show you something?  
Can I show you something?  
Now, can you go again to that Joshua chapter three, verse seven?  
I want you to notice something.  
I want you to notice something.  
Go back to that verse.  
I want you to notice something.  
The Bible says, and the Lord said, who said,  
 The Lord said unto Joshua, this day you have to try to be great.  
Is that what he said?  
This day you will be great if people make you so.  
This day you will be great if somebody helps you.  
This day you will be great if somebody likes you.  
God said.  
 Look at it.  
Look at it.  
And the Lord said under Joshua, this day we are I. I begin to magnify these.  
So cabarabaya.  
God said to Joshua, I will begin to magnify you.  
He says, I will begin to magnify you.  
God said he will do it himself.  
 There are those who may look at you and think you will not amount to anything.  
There are those who will look at you and think that you don't have the advantage.  
There are those who will look at you.  
They will size you and think you cannot become anything.  
 Brother, sister, it is your year of greatest.  
It is your year of greatest.  
No one can stop it.  
The Lord will begin to magnify you from glory to glory, from glory to glory throughout 2014.  
He will go from glory to glory.  
He will begin to magnify you.  


  
 Hallelujah!  
Tell another five people, this is my year of greatness.  
Confess it.  


  
 Glory to God.  
All right, finally.  
Finally, I want you to turn to Proverbs 4, verse 18.  
But the path of the justs is as the shining light that shine it more and more on to the perfect day.  
 The way of the wicked is as darkness.  
They know not at what they stumble.  
Just and wicked are two very important words that you find in the Bible.  
The just there he refers to the one that God has made just by his justification.  
 for no man could be just before God, but he justified them.  
He gave them justification.  
And so he says, the part of the just, the road for the just, your life's journey is as the shining light  
 And God says it shines brighter and brighter and brighter and brighter on to world the perfect day.  
So what?  
This year for you in Christ Jesus, this year can only be better than last year.  
This is your story.  
This is your path of life.  
 Then the word wicked, he uses the word wicked to describe the man that doesn't recognize the grace of God, the love of God, the message of his redemption.  
That's why he calls him wicked.  
 The man whose heart isn't going after God, not because the man killed somebody, but because the man ignored God, who has put everything out to show us that he lives.  
God describes those who ignore him as wicked.  
So he says, but the part of the wicked, he says, he's has darkness.  
 Then it says they know not at what they stumble.  
They don't even know what's making them stumble.  
They don't even know.  
They're ignorant.  
Right now.  
 if you haven't been born again.  
If you haven't received salvation into your life.  
At this moment, wherever you are, if you're at home in your house, I want you to come close to the TV set and kneel before it.  
If you're watching on the internet, go on your knees in the front of your computer.  
And if you're using a handheld device, go on your knees right there, holding that device.  
 wherever you are.  
And if you're in a church or a viewing center, I want you to find your way to the front of the altar right now.  
And those of you who are here in this auditorium, if you haven't given your life to Christ, just like the others that I'm calling now, wherever you are, I want you to stand up on your feet.  
I want to lead you into salvation right now, right now.  
It's your moment.  
It's your moment.  
 to let God describe you as the wicked, because you ignored the love of God.  
He says, the way of the wicked is as darkness.  
They know not at what they stumble, but the path of the judge is as a shining light that shines brighter and brighter onto the perfect day.  
You want to receive salvation tonight, wherever you are, stand up on your feet, wherever you are in this auditorium, stand up so I can lead you.  
 into salvation right now, the Bible way.  
And if you're already standing with your hands... Several of the auditorium in the churches and viewing centers and many watching at home receive salvation and begin their transcendent life in Christ.  
On the first day of this glorious year, 2014, the man of God also took time to pray for all the participants.  
And I bless you tonight.  
 with God's word, that it is your year of greatness.  
And a lot of begin to magnify you from this day, everywhere.  
I pray for your family.  
I pray for your work.  
I pray for all those who are acquainted with you, who are associated with you, where you work, where you school, where you live,  
 I pray for those who are connected to you, that God's blessings will rest upon you and them in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
If you're a student, I pray for your success in your academics.  
I pray that God will guide you in your studies.  
I pray that He will inspire you.  
 with ideas, increase your intelligence in every way.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus, I pray for your health that you be healthy and strong in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
But at this 2014, you were walking health in Jesus' mighty name.  
I pray for your finances.  
I pray that miracles will happen.  
 I pray that God will multiply your seed soul.  
He will bless your labor, the labor of your hands.  
Whatever that work is, that's your business, that's your trade, your career, your job.  
I pray that there will be increase in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Receive this prayer.  
Receive it into your life.

I pray for progress in your country, in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
 May God give you wise and understanding leaders, patriotic leaders in Jesus' mighty name.  
Amen.  
Amen.  
Hallelujah.
