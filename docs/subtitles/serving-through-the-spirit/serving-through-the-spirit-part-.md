title: Serving through the Spirit Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 Life is meaningless without the person of the Holy Spirit.  
Never take the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in your life likely.  
It's the most important thing in your life.  
The most important experience you could ever have.  
The indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.  
And many live a life of frustration because they ignore Him.  
 What will your life be like if you opened up for the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ to be manifested in you every day?  
What life would you live if the grace of Jesus Christ were to be expressed in your life?  
But grace is the gift of God that has been given to us freely through the Spirit.  
 This grace brought us untold abilities.  
This grace has made us more than conquer us.  
This grace has made us absolute success, never a failure.  
 From this teaching by Pastor Chris titled, Serving Through the Spirit Part 2, you discover what it means to serve God with a perfect heart and a willing mind as they are the key to serving through the Spirit.  
So what we do for God through the Holy Spirit is much more acceptable to God than what all the angels could do.  
God bless you.  
Whatever we do for the Lord,  
 except it is done through the Spirit.  
It's truly worthless.  
Nothing that you do for God really matters.  
Think about it.  
What in the world could you do for God?  
What could you do for God?  
Nothing.  
He's got more angels than there are people.  
 And the angels are more powerful than human beings.  
So if God wanted to do anything and he needed someone to do it, he could get his angels to do.  
He doesn't need us to do them.  
But the thing is, he created us in his image.  
He made us in his image and in his likeness.  
 and made it possible for us to be filled with the Holy Spirit, something that the angels cannot enjoy.  
So what we do for God through the Holy Spirit is much more acceptable to God than what all the angels could do because of the Holy Spirit, because of the Holy Spirit.  
Never take  
 The indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in your life, likely.  
It's the most important thing in your life.  
The indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit is the most important experience you could ever have.  
The most important thing in your life.  
That divine presence.  
Never take it lightly.  
 You know, to some people is just an experience or is more than that.  
There are those who don't know the significance of this indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit.  
Life is nothing without the Holy Spirit.  
And if you get to know the Holy Spirit, you have it made.  
 Your life takes on a real meaning when you discover the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  
You remember, in second Corinthians, the words of the Apostle Paul, 13th chapter, and reading from  
 The 14th verse.  
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all and everybody said amen.  
Amen.  
Hallelujah.  
It says the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Grace refers to  
 That divine favor that he brought to us, the Bible says, the law came by Moses.  
What grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.  
Grace, favor, divine favor.  
Actually, favor is one of the lowest synonyms of the word grace.  
Because you see, grace is more of a  
 A gift.  
You understand?  
It is the gift of God.  
It is the glory of God that is given to you and resides in your spirit and is expressed on the outside.  
It refers to all of the beauty of God delivered to your spirit, to your heart.  
 and made to be evident in your life.  
It is the ability of God given to you.  
This is what makes the fullness of God available to your spirit.  
What it says, grace, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
This is what He brought.  
It says the law came by Moses.  
 You must do this, and you must do that.  
If God's going to accept you, you must do this, and you must do that.  
That's the law.  
The commandments of God must be fully obeyed for his blessings.  
That's what Moses brought.  
So he says, the law came by Moses, but grace and truth.  
That means grace and reality came by Jesus Christ.  
How things have changed.  
 how God accepts people, not for what they do, but for what Christ did.  
And you know, it wasn't that Christ stopped the terror of God, not necessarily, even though it's true.  
But the fact is, it was God working in Jesus that that grays to us.  
 So it was God, God the Father who sent Jesus to bring us that favor.  
Since the grace of Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God in the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you.  
So he's saying, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  
The love of God be with you.  
And the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you.  
That's what he's saying.  
 What will your life be like if you opened up for the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ to be manifested in you every day?  
What life would you live if the grace of Jesus Christ were to be expressed in your life?  
Remember the words of the Apostle Paul to Timothy.  
 He said, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.  
In other words, take advantage of the grace that is in Christ Jesus.  
Not many understand that.  
And yet we say that prayer all the time.  
At the close of the meeting, we say, let us share the grace.  
We think we're told to share the grace, so we share the grace.  
 That's nobody said.  
So we say, let's share the grace.  
We're actually saying, let's recite the prayer.  
So we go, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the sweet, fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  
So to us, we are just pronouncing the benediction.  
But there's so much in here.  
What a prayer, yet what an instruction.  
 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  
And no wonder he ended it by saying amen.  
Hallelujah.  
It's a prayer.  
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  
He said be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.  
Can you take advantage of that grace?  
This grace brought us untold abilities.  
 This grace has made us more than conquer us.  
This grace has made us absolute success, never a failure.  
And how have we taken advantage of this?  
I said, grace is the ability of God at working here.  
Grace is the gift of God working in you.  
Hallelujah.  
He has made us able  
 And Paul said, I can do all things through Christ, which strengthen it me.  
I can do.  
I can do.  
What a mentality.  
I can do.  
I can do.  
I have the spirit of excellence.  
I can do.  
And when I do it, nobody can do it like me.  
Hallelujah.  
I can do.  
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  
So what?  
 Then I become strong in that grace.  
I take advantage of that grace.  
Hallelujah.  
You know, we're praying and asking for things all the time.  
And we haven't even taken advantage of that which has been made available to us.  
It's a mystery, sometimes to me, the way, you know, things go with a lot of people.  
I wanna, hey, why don't you just look at it in the book?  
It's here in the world.  
 Look what has made us.  
I like the expression when you study in the Book of James, the fifth chapter, where he talks about Elijah, the prophet.  
Let's look at it.  
Book of James, verse 17, chapter 5.  
Look at the thinking of these apostles of God.  
We just talked about what Paul said.  
Now, look at James.  
James says that Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are.  
 Look the way they thought Elijah was just like us and he prayed and got an answer.  
We can pray and get answers.  
That's what he's saying.  
That's what he's saying.  
Look at it.  
He's easy.  
 Elias, that's Greek for Elijah.  
Elijah was a man subject to light passions as we are.  
In other words, he could be hungry, he could get tired, anything that you could feel Elijah ferret, that's what he's saying.  
 fears could come to him, doubts could come to him.  
Don't think that just because you got faith, doubts cannot attack you.  
Doubt can come, but that's why the Word of God resides in your spirit and you can stand against doubt and fear and unbelief and win.  
He says Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are.  
Yet he prayed and got an answer.  
 The idea is, hey, you can pray too, and get an answer.  
That's what he's saying.  
Hallelujah.  
He says, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ in the love of God, the love of God.  
Oh, you know, you studied in the fifth chapter of the Book of Romans, the terraces, the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.  
 I carried the love of God in me.  
You see, I can never be bitter.  
There's some people who live in bitterness, they're bitter because somebody did something against them, they're unhappy, you know, and that now controls their life.  
Every day they're thinking about what that fellow did to them, what the love of God should be working in your heart.  
 The love of God.  
The love of God.  
Glory to God.  
He wants you to experience the love of God every day.  
But you can't experience the love of God in isolation.  
The love of God wants to flow through you.  
That's the way you experience the love of God.  
The love of God passes through you.  
 It works through you.  
Can't stop at you.  
You experience the love of God by extending the love of God.  
You pass it on.  
That's the way you experience the love of God.  
 You know, here's a man, here's a sinner, think about it.  
And someone comes to talk to you about the love of God, and he's listening.  
And he's touched because the message of love has come to him.  
And he says, oh, I didn't know God loved me so much.  
That's the message of love.  
Now he responds by saying, thank you.  
But then,  
 The love is not working yet until he turns to someone else to say, look what the Lord has done for me.  
And then now that love starts working.  
You see it?  
Now is that's working.  
He's got to tell somebody else.  
Otherwise, he hasn't opened his heart to it.  
When you receive God's love,  
 Your past God's love, if you don't pass it, you lose it.  
You see it?  
Love can't stay there.  
That's what he says, don't quench love because love can be quenched.  
If you're not going to quench it, hey, when you use it, quench.  
It means that love works like fire.  
 If you're gonna keep fire on, what do you do?  
You keep putting material to burn.  
More material to burn.  
More material to burn.  
If you don't add more material to burn, love quenches.  
Right?  
So there's got to be somebody else to get that love and someone else and someone else and someone else.  
And the more we share it, the more we pass it on,  
 The more of it we experience, the love of God be with you.  
Then it says, and the communion of the Holy Ghost.  
Wonderful.  
The communion of the Holy Ghost.  
The word is coenonia.  
It means fellowship.  
It means a participation.  
It means partnership.  
See?  
 Communication, oneness, unity, all of this, and transportation.  
He says, is the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you?  
I told you.  
It's the most important thing.  
 And here is that fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  
See, he didn't say the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
He didn't say the fellowship of God.  
He said the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  
Which means the Holy Spirit is here for us to relate with.  
 Because the Father is in heaven.  
Jesus is in heaven.  
It's the Holy Spirit that's here.  
He's here.  
So we talk to Him.  
We talk with Him.  
We have fellowship with Him.  
Don't ignore the Holy Spirit in your life.  
Don't ignore His voice.  
There's frustration.  
 outside the Holy Spirit.  
Life is frustrating outside the Holy Spirit.  
The many Christians who are frustrated, they're frustrated at home, they're frustrated at work, they're frustrated by the finances, they're frustrated in many, many areas in their lives.  
But they are Christians.  
So what's the reason for the frustration?  
 They may peek on several things and say, this is what happened to me, this happened to me.  
They may try to bring forth several reasons for their frustration.  
They're wrong.  
There's one reason they're frustrated, ignoring the Holy Spirit.  
Hey, think about it.  
The Holy Spirit knows what to do about everything, everything.  
 He knows what to do about everything, everything.  
But when we ignore Him, we complain, we think someone else is our problem.  
We think, well, this is not working for me because of so-and-so.  
So many times we destroy our friendships and relationships.  
 Because we think that other fellow is our problem.  
And they are not.  
A Christian who knows the Holy Spirit never cares about what someone else did against you.  
Never.  
Nobody else could be a facto.  
There's one facto.  
 for your success, the Holy Spirit.  
If you would know him, you would miss the best in life, and you would struggle your way through.  
If you'd know him, let me read something to you.  
First Chronicles in chapter 28.  
These are some of those scriptures that shaped my way of thinking.  
 many years ago.  
This was the occasion in which David called his son Solomon, and he was around enough, his work, David was.  
He knew the time for his departure was at hand, and he was now going to give a charge to his son Solomon.  
 And now he speaks, listen, verse 9.  
And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart.  
 and with a willing mind.  
He said, know the God of your father.  
He's talking to Solomon and serving with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the Lord's search at all hearts and understand it all the imaginations of the thoughts.  
If thou seek him, he will be found of thee.  
But if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off forever.  
 Did you see that?  
He's serving with a perfect heart and a willing mind.  
A perfect heart and what a willing mind.  
A perfect heart and a willing mind.  
Do you know that not many people serve the Lord with a perfect heart?  
Some people serve Him with a willing mind but not with a perfect heart.  
 And some people serve him with a perfect heart without a willing mind.  
He wanted to serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind.  
David was the greatest king among all the kings of Israel.  
And he knew what it was.  
You remember God's testimony of David?  
He said, he's a man after my own heart.  
 So much so that he was honored for Jesus to be called the offspring of David.  
So David has a special place with God.  
So this is the man that helped Solomon make the right choice.  
 So Solomon told us, my father told me wisdom is the principal thing.  
Therefore, get wisdom.  
So on that night, when the Lord came into Solomon's room and said, what do you want me to do for you?  
He said, give me wisdom.  
Because David taught him that wisdom is the principal thing.  
Therefore, get wisdom.  
And with all that I get in, get understanding.  
That's what he has got for.  
It was David who told him.  
 And now, look at the other things that David told you.  
He says, serve him, serve God with a perfect heart and with a willing mind.  
Why?  
He said, because the Lord searches all hearts and he understands all the imaginations of the thoughts.  
Nothing goes through your thoughts that God doesn't know.  
He understands your imaginations.  
 He says, if thou seek him, he will be found of you.  
But if you forsake him, he says he will cast you off forever.  
I brought that in because I was talking about ignoring the Holy Spirit.  
Too many Christians ignore the Holy Spirit.  
They reject his voice.  
Most of them without realizing it because they've never been taught about the Holy Spirit.  
 They've never understood the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  
They've never known His voice.  
We call it that still small voice.  
Very easy to ignore, very easy to reject.  
His voice is never strong against you.  
Always that still small voice of love  
 that tries to calm you and guide you in God's path.  
There's always a voice of love, his voice, his voice.  
He will never accept your stubbornness.  
Have you heard some Christians say, I'm very stubborn.  
The voice of the Holy Spirit, if you listen to him,  
 He talks to you about everyday issues.  
He gets involved in everything that concerns you.  
Sometimes he tells you the way you talk to that man was not good.  
I apologize to him.  
He said, never.  
You see, you know what you do?  
You wound his tender compassion.  
You suppress his voice.  
 After a while, you don't hear that voice as loud as you used to.  
Very distant voice.  
The Bible shows us that it's very easy to wound the Holy Spirit.  
The Bible says that they vexed the Holy Spirit in the wilderness and he turned to fight against them.  
He's own people.  
That's the way he is.  
That's the way he is.  
 The Bible says, God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.  
You see, someone that's humble, always moving forward.  
You think he has no abilities as good as you.  
You are, I mean, you know you.  
You are so gifted.  
You have all the abilities, but you can understand why this fellow who can't rank with you just keeps moving forward.  
This is the reason.  
 He says, God elbows the proud.  
Every time he resists you, then he gives grace to the humble, grace.  
Every little thing this fellow does upwards, the Holy Spirit moves him upwards.  
Every little thing, he noises that thing abroad.  
That's what the Holy Spirit is.  
Then you find people without abilities.  
 And you see, so and so, you mean Jim is now this, you mean Sarah is now this, it offends you, because you know them.  
You know them, these guys don't have nothing.  
They couldn't rank with your egoistic mind and your erudite brain.  
 And that's the way it is.  
God resists the proud.  
The Holy Spirit moves away from him because he talks to proud men.  
No, so the vexed the Holy Spirit.  
He becomes their adversary because he resisted.  
So you think the devil is the one working against you, but you are actually fighting with God.  
 says, the vexed the Holy Spirit, and he turned to fight against them.  
That's what David is teaching Solomon about, God here, about the Holy Spirit.  
See, the Father is different from the Son and different from the Holy Spirit in their ministries.  
They're not the same.  
See, the Father has the ways, His ways of ministry,  
 The Son has his ways of ministry.  
The Holy Spirit has his ways of ministry.  
You remember what Jesus said?  
You know, one time they came around him and they said, well, he's casting out devils by the prince of demons.  
 They said it was the devil that gave him power to do what he was doing.  
And Jesus warned them.  
He said, let me tell you something.  
If you want to say anything against the Father, go ahead.  
No problem.  
He forgive you.  
If you want to insult the Son, that's your business.  
He'll forgive you, but I warn you, saying nothing against the Holy Spirit, because you will not be forgiven in this world, knowing the world to come.  
That's the way the Father and the Son protect the Holy Spirit, because of who He is.  
 because of his tender compassions, because of the way he loves.  
He is the one through home.  
The father and the son carry out their work.  
Everything they want to do for men, they need the Holy Spirit.  
And he goes ahead and carries out the work.  
 This is the humility of the Spirit.  
You talk about God being humble, you're describing the Holy Spirit.  
God cannot humble himself except through the Spirit.  
You see that?  
Because God's so great.  
He takes the Holy Spirit.  
Even Jesus when he was to be born.  
The Word, the Bible says the Word of God became flesh.  
How?  
Matthew chapter 1 verse 18, the Bible says that Jesus Christ  
 was a child, called him the child of the Holy Spirit.  
He took the Holy Spirit to make the word, says the word was made flesh.  
That's a Greek connotation, was made flesh.  
The word was made flesh.  
How about the Holy Spirit?  
 It was his ability.  
And when Jesus was to offer himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins, he was chapter 9, verse 14.  
The Bible says that he presented himself, he offered himself through the eternal spirits.  
That's the holy spirits.  
Otherwise, it would have not been acceptable to God.  
The holy spirit had to make Jesus acceptable to the Father, even his resurrection.  
 The Bible says he was raised up by the glory of the Father.  
The Holy Spirit was called there, the glory of the Father.  
The Spirit of God came upon the body of Jesus, overshadowed that body of Jesus, and brought him back to life.  
This is if the Spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you.  
He that raised up Christ, the Holy Spirit raised up Christ,  
 So he's called a glory of the Father.  
And you know what he did?  
Something beautiful.  
The Holy Spirit has never been given a name.  
The Father has been given names and names and names.  
You read the Old Testament.  
They called him by so many different names.  
And when the Son was born, he was called a name.  
The Holy Spirit has never been given a name.  
In the Old Testament, he hid behind the Father.  
In the New Testament, he hides behind the Son.  
 I want to let you know why the Father and the Son are so protective of the Holy Spirit.  
They will not take any insults against the Holy Spirit.  
Jesus said, warn you, every sin against the Father can be forgiven.  
 Every sin against the Son can be forgiven.  
Every blasphemy against the Father can be forgiven.  
Blasphemy against the Son can be forgiven.  
But every sin or blasphemy against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven.  
In this world, no in the world to come.  
That's heavy.  
He made it clear.  
He's done mess with the Holy Ghost.  
Just letting you understand, this awesome personality  
 that the Father graciously permitted to dwell among us.  
And when we meet like this and this Holy Spirit is present, that's why I tell you, and I say it in church, I want God's will be careful when we're in meetings together.  
There are certain behaviors that wound the Holy Spirit, that offend the Holy Spirit, live your life in such a way as not to offend the Holy Spirit.  
 You see, you may not sin against the Holy Spirit.  
You could offend the Holy Spirit.  
You could warn the Holy Spirit.  
You could vex the Holy Spirit.  
There are things we do that make him withdraw.  
And we have to be careful in our lives.  
If you find a group of Christians talking and saying things against ministers of God withdraw, go away from there, because they don't know what they do.  
 Go away from that.  
Never be a part of such things.  
The most frustrated Christians are among such people.  
I know what I'm telling you.  
You leave them because they don't know what they're doing.  
So don't insult them.  
Leave them.  
And do what God called you to do.  
You see it?  
 and you find your life prospering, you're making progress and they can understand why?  
Live your life in such a way as to bring honor to the Holy Spirit.  
See, all of His presence in your life.  
Oh, Kabbah shalom ante kebuhr sateki, this is your sotam.  
Li brakos o prakala manda shaladas.
