title: The Spirit, The Power and The Anointing Vol. 1 Part 2
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
You are watching the International School of Ministry Ministries Network Conference with the Man of God, Pastor Chris, where over 5,000 ministers from over 145 nations of the world gathered to be Todd God's word.  
 Pastor Chris had been teaching the ministers on the importance of the correct interpretation of the Scriptures.  
As you keep watching, you will learn about the law of the double portion.  
Watch as Pastor Chris explains the biblical interpretation of this subject, reiterating to the ministers about the power reciting in a believer.  
Be enlightened as you watch.  
Are you understanding what I'm saying?  


  
 Then you have in the church some of this teaching about double anointing.  
It's so crazy.  
Double anointing, triple anointing.  
And how that some people have more anointing than other people.  
Can I tell you something?  
It's not true.  
It's not biblical.  
It's not biblical.  
 But the place where they get that teaching from is this crazy idea about Elijah and Elijah.  
Because Elijah said to Elijah, give me, let a double portion of your spirit rest upon me.  
And they don't understand what that means.  
He wasn't asking for two times what you have.  
How can someone give you two times what he has?  


  
 Elijah was not a fool.  
Elijah was not a fool.  
He knew exactly what he was asking for.  
He wasn't asking for, give me two times the anointing on your life.  
He couldn't have asked such a stupid thing.  
Because Elijah couldn't give it to him.  
 Now, of course, when he asked what he asked, Elijah did say, you have asked a hard thing.  
He didn't say an impossible thing.  
He said, a hard thing.  
Now, if he meant, give me twice what you have, he wouldn't say you have asked a hard thing.  
You say you asked an impossible thing.  
But because Elijah knew what Elijah was asking for, he said, you've asked a difficult thing.  
If you see me,  
 When I'm taken away, you got it.  


  
Now, why do people say that Elijah got twice the anointing of Elijah?  
How come it's not Elijah that's coming again?  
Why is it Elijah?  
Since Elijah has twice the anointing.  
 Glory to God.  
Yeah, because something is wrong with that understanding.  
The reason they say that Elijah had doubled the anointing of Elijah is because they said they counted the number of miracles.  
Terrible.  
And that the number of miracles by  
 Elisha was twice the number of miracles by Elijah.  
When did we start measuring the amount of anointing by the number of miracles?  


  
And even when I've asked them, how did they count their own?  
Because when you counted it's not like that, it's not correct.  
They're wrong with the count.  
Most people who say that never counted, they heard somebody else say it.  
 and they have written, I mean, they've stated their case, they have never counted.  


  
You cannot measure the anointing on the man's life by the number of miracles.  
If you could count Elijah's own and count Elijah's own, what about those of us whose miracles you cannot count?  
So what happens to us?  
 What I mean is the miracles are so many, they are so big and they are so many.  
So how are you going to measure us as to which anointing is more than the other?  
That is nonsense.  
Let me show you what Elijah was asking for.  
Deuteronomy chapter 21, verse 17.  


  
 Let's start from verse 15.  
Follow this reading, you will understand.  
If a man have two wives and one beloved and another hated, let's say a man has two wives, he loves one, he hates the other.  
And they have born him children, but the beloved and the hated.  
And if the first born son be has that was hated, if the wife that was hated has the first born son,  
 Next verse.  
Then it shall be, when he make it, his son shall inherit that which he had, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn.  
He must not put the son of the beloved one instead of the son of the hated, who is actually the firstborn.  
God is bringing what?  
Justice into family.  
Watch.  
 But he shall acknowledge the Son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he the Father has for he is the beginning of his strength.  
The right of the firstborn is his.  
This is what Elijah was asking for.  
I want to explain it to you.  
Let's look at it like this.  
Can I get?  
 six handsome men out here.  
One, two, yes.  
Three, four, five, six.  
I've got six handsome men here.  
Thank you.  
Watch now.  
Imagine that these are six songs.  
And the father wants to divide his inheritance.  
 So he says, God is telling the man, divide the inheritance into seven places.  
So if this is the first son, he gets two potions.  
 then each one gets one, one, one, one, one.  
Of the farthest inheritance, this is the law of the double potion.  
He says the right of the first bone is his, the right of the first bone.  
Which means he becomes his father's representative.  
At the passing of his father, he takes the title.  
Are you following this now?  
 This is the law of the double posture.  
So what Elijah was asking Elijah for was this.  
Elijah was ahead of the school of prophets.  
And if you had read the story, all the prophets were aware by revelation that Elijah would be cut away.  
But they didn't know exactly how.  
And they were saying to Elijah, to Elijah, are you aware that your master is living?  
 Are you aware?  
And you say, don't disturb me.  
I'm aware.  
Now, all these prophets were watching.  
Who's going to be the next point man of Israel?  
Who is going to be the next head prophet?  
Who is going to be the next leading prophet?  
They're not aware.  
Elijah is leaving.  
Who is next?  
 Who will take his place of leadership?  
They didn't know who.  
And now Elijah says to Elijah, ask what you want before I am taken away.  
Elijah says, let me have the right of the firstborn.  


  
 That means let me be the next man.  
Let me take your place.  
And so Elijah says, you've asked a hard thing.  
If you see me, because it will take the eyes of that prophet to see me.  
If you see me when I'm taken away, you have it.  
Guess what happens?  
 The whirlwind of God came and took Elijah away, and Elisha saw him and cried, my father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the husband thereof, and the mantle of Elijah fell, and Elisha took it.  
The other prophets did not see Elijah.  
So when Elisha came,  
 They said, let's look for your master.  
We are looking for him.  
Can we help you find him?  
Elijah knew they didn't see him.  
He was the only one who saw him.  
 So Elisha was asking for the right of the first bone, not for twice what Elijah had, because the law of the double portion was for the father to divide what he had, not what someone else had.  
He said, divided into portions.  
Elisha said, a double portion, a double part of your spirit, a double part.  
 And this is the teaching of the scripture on the law of the double posture.  
Thank you.  
God bless you.  
Hallelujah.  
All right.  
So you find that many somehow are thinking that what they need is more power or more anointing.  
 So they're asking God for more anointing.  


  
Let me show you the difference between what God gave you and what you're asking for.  


  
When the Holy Spirit came to live in you, He came as a person.  
 not as a fluid.  
That is to say, not as water, not as oil, not as vapor, not as smoke.  
He came as a person to live in you.  
He came without measure.  


  
He came to live in you, to make his home in you.  
He didn't come as a measure to give you a part of himself.  
 You have received the Holy Spirit without measure.  
That was the difference between the Messiah and the prophets of old.  
Upon the prophets came the Spirit.  
But Jesus, the Bible tells us the Holy Spirit came upon Him for the purpose of living in Him.  
 That's the same thing about you.  
The Holy Spirit came upon you that he might live in you.  
John chapter three verse 34.  
So in John chapter three verse 34, for he whom God has sent speak at the words of God, for God giveth not the spirit by measure unto him.  
 The Holy Spirit didn't come into your life like it did in the Old Testament prophets.  
He came upon them, but he came to live in you.  
He lives in you as a person in his totality without measure.  
Now, let me tell you the difference, what people are asking for.  
You know, the Bible tells us the shadow of Peter,  
 When people came and brought their sick so that the shadow of Peter could come upon them, they were healed.  
Then Paul laid his hands on hand achieves an apron and imparted the hand achieves an apron with the presence of the spirits.  
That is sometimes what you may call an impartation or you might even call the anointing of the spirits.  
 Are you getting it now?  
It is an impartation of the presence of the Spirit, not the passing of the Spirit.  
The person of the Holy Ghost was not in the handkerchiefs.  
The person of the Holy Ghost was not in the shadow of Peter.  
The person of the Holy Ghost was not in the hem of Jesus' gamete.  


  
 Are you following this?  
So, when a man that is full of the Holy Spirit ministers to you, maybe lays hands on you and impacts you with something that is God, what does he have?  
The Holy Ghost, the power of the Holy Ghost, the gifts of the Holy Ghost.  
 Then that imputation might come on you and stay for a while, as did the handkerchief.  
Because God's purpose is that what you have inside you is enough.  


  
What you have inside you, the Holy Spirit,  
 the Holy Spirit.  
So it's like this, I may teach you something, but until you receive what I've taught you into you and make it your own and live by it, it will not work consistently.  
In the same way, if I were to minister to you,  
 until and unless you make contact with that Holy Spirit that is inside you and work according to the power that work it in you.  
It will not last for long.  
It won't be long before you are looking for another anointing.  


  
 Because if the anointing could be transmitted to a handkerchief, it can be transmitted to your body.  
I remember a young guy who came among us, just ministering along with us.  
When he went back, everybody he touched went under the power.  
He couldn't understand it.  
Another fellow only sat, just years ago, he just sat on the bed and left.  
An anointing followed him.  
Everyone he touched fell down.  
He couldn't understand it.  
 But it didn't continue.  
It was the invitation, like you put the anointing on the handkerchief.  
It's not the spirits.  
It's not the person of the spirits.  
But just like you call a rub-off, you see, it's a rub-off.  
It's a rub-off.  
Like I can rub myself on him, and particles from my own clothes will come on him.  
 And I could hug him, and my smell would be on him.  
And somebody could continue to say, ah, were you with Pastor Chris?  
You see?  
Hallelujah.  
Don't allow yourself, ignore that which God has put in you.  
 Understandness, the Holy Spirit that came into your life is the same Holy Spirit that Jesus had.  
The same.  
The same Holy Spirit that the apostles had.  
The same Holy Spirit.  
Does He give you more power?  
No!  
 You are the one to work that power to its maximum.  
It's up to you.  
The Bible tells us that the power of the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles.  
Book of Acts 4.  
Acts 4  


  
 I want to read verse 33.  
Verse 33, read one to go.  
Which what?  
With great power.  
Gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all.  
Tell me something.  
Where did they get great power from?  
The Bible says power came upon them.  
Jesus said you shall receive power.  
He didn't say you shall receive great power.  
What?  
 You remember that?  
He said, you shall receive power.  
When the Holy Spirit comes upon you, He didn't say you shall receive great power.  
So where did they get great power from?  
Somebody said, well, the power increased.  
The power did not increase.  
They got all the power they needed because the giver of the power was inside them.  


  
 If you catch this, if you catch this, if you catch this, if you catch this, this is so important, so important.  
When you received the Holy Spirit, what did you get?  
 You know, I told you before, how I used to ask people when you received Christ, when you became born again, you received salvation.  
What did you get?  
Some of them didn't know they got something.  


  
They didn't realize they got something.  
What did you become?  
 When you receive salvation, when you receive Christ Jesus to leaven you, what did you become?  
What did you become?  
Did you know there was a change?  
Or did you think you were still the same person just because you felt the same way?  
What are you looking at?  
Because you have a house, you think you have one house, so that house there, that is your house, is that all you know of yourself?  
 Because you have an amount of money in the bank, you think that that's all you have?  
Is that the way you measure you?  
Is that all your words?  


  
 When the boss is looking unto Jesus, the term is looking away unto Jesus, the author and perfecter of your faith.  
What is it you've got?  
Who are you?  
What have you become?  
When you receive Christ, what did you become?  
If any man be in Christ, he is, he is a new creation.  
He is.  
 He is a new creation.  
He is a new creation.  
All things have passed away.  
All things have become new.  
 What does that mean?  
What does that mean?  
Something has changed.  
What does that mean?  
What did Jesus come to do?  
All over the world, I like to tell them what Jesus came to do.  
He didn't come to give us religion.  
He didn't come to make us feel nice.  
He didn't come so he could answer our prayers.  
That's what he came to do.  
He came to do much better than that.  
 Much better than that.  
He came to make us one.  
Come.  
That's what he came to do.  
He came to receive us into himself, to make us one.  
The brothers as we are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.  
Don't let your eyes, your physical eyes deceive you.  
 You are more than what you see.  
You're more than what you see.  
Understand this, understand this.  
Jesus said, you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.  
And the Holy Spirit came upon you.  
And when He did, He brought you power.  
 Power to do what?  
He said, you shall be my witnesses.  
That means you produce proof of the heavenly kingdom.  
That's who you are.  
You are representing Jesus now.  
You're representing Him, meaning everything that Jesus did you can do.  
Because everything that Jesus was, you are.  
And thank God, He still is.  
Everything that He is, you are.  
 He's gone to heaven and you are here in his place.  
And he says, as my father has sent me, even so send I you.  
I represent Jesus.  
That's who I am.  
I represent the Son of God.  
That's who I am.  
That's who you are.  
How could you have less power?  
How could it happen to you?  
How?  
 Who told you that you have less power?  
Thank you.  
Where did you hear it from?  
How could you have less power when he sent you to act like him?  
Somebody thinks, oh, all of us together, when you put us together, then our power will equal Jesus.  
That's nonsense.  
Jesus said, I and my father are one.  
What about you?  
 So you say, I am all the Christians of the world.  
Is that your case?  
I am my father or one.  
Say, I am my father or one.  
Say again, I am my father or one.  
One more time, I am my father or one.  
Where's your father?  
Where's your father?  
Are you serious?  
Where's your father?  
He's in you?  
 More to come on this special teaching called from an epic-making gathering of over 5,000 pastors and leaders from over 145 nations of the world.  
As a Christian, you have all the power you need.  
Everything you require for life and godliness has been given to you.  
 In the concluding part of this teaching, Pastor Chris admonishes the ministers to put the power they have in them to work.  
Keep watching and get ready to be uplifted in your spirit, soul, and body.  
Tell me something.  
Where's your father?  
Uh-uh.  
Are you sure?  
St.  
John chapter 10.  
 If you mean this, this could be really serious.  
Really serious.  
Are you sure of this?  
Oh.  
Saint John chapter 10, how many of them should I give you?  
Lots of, lots of wonderful verses here.  
 Okay, let's pick a simple one.  
Read verse 30.  
Read verse 30.  
Again.  
One more time.  


  
Is that true for you?  
 Say, I am a father of one.  
What does that mean to you?  
What does that mean to you?  
I am my father of one.  
What does that mean to you?  
No, you know that sometimes some people think only legally.  
They say this is a legal, this is a legal understanding.  
 the legality of the redemption.  
I understand the legality of the redemption, and I understand the vitality of the redemption.  
Well, let me show you something.  


  
Goerson looks good for chapter 9, verse 1.  
Then look chapter 9, verse 1.  
Let's see what Jesus did here.  
Then look chapter 9, verse 1.  
 Ready for me, want to go.  


  
Stop.  
He gave them what?  
Power and authority.  
Over all devils and the key of diseases.  
What in the world?  
What in the world is this?  
He gave them power and authority.  
 He gave them what vital power, the dynamic ability to cost changes.  
And then he gave them what authority, delegated power.  
That means there was a vital power and there was a legal power.  
He gave them boats.  
 And remember, this was before they even received salvation from Jesus Christ because it was not yet possible to be born again at this time.  
Which means they had not yet received the Holy Ghost.  
So what happened here?  
How did Jesus give them power and authority?  


  
Both.  
 He gave them power and authority.  
Power and authority.  
Both.  
Did He give you less?  
What could He have given you?  
 Now, let's look at this.  
When Paul laid his hands on the handkerchiefs and aprons, the Bible says, when those clothes were taken to the sick, the demons went out of them, and the sickness is departed from them.  
That was not authority, that was the dynamic power, vital power, spiritual energy.  


  
 Do you understand?  
Because he laid hands and he didn't talk to the handkerchiefs.  
And the handkerchiefs were not animate.  


  
The handkerchiefs had no sense.  
The handkerchief didn't know something happened.  


  
But the power of God was infused into them.  
 And the handkerchief didn't know, but the demons knew.  


  
The power of God, when you receive the Holy Spirit, that's what happened to you.  
The power, the ability of the Holy Ghost came into you.  
You may not know it like the handkerchief.  


  
 You may not feel it.  
The handkerchief didn't feel anything.  


  
Don't think that when the power of God comes into your life, you must shake.  
You may not shake.  
When the Holy Spirit came into you, He came with all the power.  
Any shaking you will do now will be according to the power that is already inside you.  


  
 What does the Bible say we should do?  
Stay up the gift of God that is in us.  
Stay up.  
Hallelujah.  
He didn't say ask for more.  
He didn't say ask for more.  
Don't ask for more.  
By asking for more, you are declaring that you don't have enough.  
 And since God is not going to answer that prayer, you're going to get weaker and weaker.  
Oh God, give me more power.  
Please.  
Give me more power.  
Please.  
I need more power.  
I need more power.  
But He already gave you all the power you need.  
I need more power, please.  
So I have all the power I need.  
Hey!  
I have all the power I need.  
 Go away to God.  
Go away to God.  
Sit down for a second.  
You have all the power you need.  
What God's people need to understand is that everything that they require for life and godliness has been given to them.  
You don't need anything from heaven.  
 He's all been granted you.  
What is God asking for now?  
He's saying, put what you have to work.  
That's what you need.  
What you have.  
In the oil testament, he would say, and the Spirit came upon David.  
And then David did whatever he did.  
And the Spirit came mightily upon Samson.  
And Samson did what he did?  
The Spirit came upon them.  
 In the New Testament, he says, Peter failed with the Holy Ghost.  
Feared from heaven, no!  
From inside!  
Feared!  
 in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 18, be not drunk with wine, wearing his excess, but be fair with the spirit.  
How?  
Speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.  


  
 You know, what many Christians are doing is, after they have received the Holy Spirit, they are praying there.  
Oh, Father.  
Oh, Father, please do something.  
Father, do something.  
Do something, please.  
You're begging him?  
He don't sponsor low flops.  
He don't want you flopping.  
He doesn't want you begging him or begging anybody.  
 You are the king's kids.  
Say, I refuse to beg.  
Yeah.  
Kings don't beg.  
Hey, you know, there's another sit down.  
Let me tell you something.  
There's this idea that, you know, when I was, when I was, I've been a Christian a long time.  
 All right?  
And if you've been a Christian that long, you definitely will come across a whole lot of stuff.  
And I did.  
And I learned some of the stuff.  
But as I studied the Bible, I learned them.  
They said that there are three unknown things you need in your life.  
Because David had three unknown things.  
 You know, he was anointed before his brethren.  
I know that I've studied it.  
Then he was anointed at Ziklok.  
He was anointed.  
And then he was anointed for all Israel.  
Three anointings.  
So they tell you, you need to have the three anointings.  
Otherwise, you will not succeed.  
 So what?  
Many of our God's people start praying, oh God, I need an anointing number two, an anointing number three.  
Always being confused by, you know, they're tossed about with every wind of doctrine.  
The need three anointings, the person who is teaching you about the three anointings.  
What has he done with the anointings?  
Liberka satire.  


  
 three anointing, then some are told, you need to have the anointing of a priest, then you have to have the anointing of a prophet, then before you can reign, you need the anointing to reign, then they start seeking the anointing to reign, anointing to reign, brothers and sisters.  
These things are dangerous.  
They are dangerous.  
 There's good knowledge from the Bible says knowledge puffs up what love edifies.  
There's a lot of good information you can have in the Scripture to enlighten you about what God has done, what he did in the past, how he works through the New Testament, all of these things and the future, then find out what is God's plan for the church.  
 The church is not like the Old Testament folks.  
Don't relate the church to the Old Testament.  
They're not the same.  
Don't relate the church to Israel.  
They're not the same.  
They're not the same.  
You don't need the three unknown teams.  
After all, he perfected forever with one sacrifice.  
They had many sacrifices.  
 He did only one sacrifice of perfect forever.  
If they needed many anointings, why do you need men?  
Let me show you something very simple from the scripture.  
What leads to your reigning?  
Is there an anointing to reign?  
Hey, hey, hey.  
An anointing to reign.  
When the Holy Ghost came into your life, that's when you received the anointing to reign.  
Why did you look for another one?  
 Okay, let's look at it.  
Let's look at it.  
Romans chapter 5 or 17.  
If that is not good enough, I don't know what else you want.  
Romans chapter 5 or 17.  
For he by one man's offense, dead, rained by one, much more, dare we to receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness.  
Shower in life.  


  
 Put the amplified.  
Put it in the amplified.  
Amplified translation.  
For it, because of one man's trespass, laughs offense, dead rain through that one.  
Much more.  
Much more surely.  
Will those who receive gods of a flowing grace on merit favor and the free gift of righteousness, putting them into right standing with himself, reign as what kings in life.  
 There is only when they are anointed to reign.  
There we receive abundance of priests and of the gift of righteousness.  
Showering in life as kings.  
That's all.  
That's all.  
When did you become priests?  
I mean, it's almost praying, oh God, I want to receive the launching of a priest.  
The launching of a priest?  
When the Holy Ghost came into your life, He made you a priest.  
 1st Peter chapter 2.  


  
Are you here?  
From verse 5.  
 He also has lively 11 stones, a built-up, a built-up of spiritual house, an holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  
Did he say, when you get the anointing of a priest?  
When the Holy Spirit came into your life, he anointed you to be a priest.  
 On to God.  
Now you are offering spiritual sacrifices.  
Don't do verse 9.  
Verse 9, same books, same chapter.  
Read.  
But ye are, ye are, not ye shall be, ye are, a chosen generation, a royal priesthood.  
Look at it.  
You are royal priests.  
That means king priests.  
That's royal priesthood, king priests.  
 So you have the anointing of a king and a priest.  
You already have.  
Don't seek it.  
Don't ask for it.  
Don't pray for it.  
Don't beg for it.  
Don't sow seeds for it.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm a king.  
I'm a priest.  
I'm loaded.  
Hallelujah.  
So I'm not seeking for power.  
 I'm full of power.  
That's it.  
I'm full of power.  
In tomorrow's meeting, we're going to be talking about how to move into these things that we have said.  
How can you actualize them?  
Because you can actualize them.  
That is Christianity.  
Christianity is actualizing the promises of God.  
Hallelujah.  
That's the beautiful part of it.  
 That's Christianity.  
Christianity is living in the promises.  
Living in the promises of God.  
That's Christianity.  
Some people have to prophesying them in the future.  
I'm living in them.  
Living in God's promises.  
That is Christianity.  
Living the word.  
That's Christianity.  
Acting the word.  
Doing the word.  
That's Christianity.  
Not seeing it ahead.  
 No, no, we are there now.  
We have arrived.  
He says, here come onto Mount Zion.  
You're not on your way.  
You have come.  
You have arrived.  
You are there now.

Let me tell you here.  
He says, a little one shall become a thousand.  


  
 Listen, let me tell you, when you go back after this conference, you are going to be a burning fire!  
You are going to be a burning fire!  


  
 You remember what Jesus said about John?  
He said he was a bone in the shining lights.  
A bone in the shining lights.  
I am a bone in the shining lights.  
Ah!  
I said, when you get back, a bone in fire.  


  
 The ministry of the Holy Spirit.  
Glory to God.  
Are you still here?  


  
I'm a girl in the shining lights.  
Oh, glory to God.  
No wonder he says, count it all joy.  
When you go to dive as test,  
 He said a thousand shall fall at your side.  
Ten thousand at your right hand, but it shall not come near you.  


  
 Glory.  


  
Lastly, let me show you something last for tonight.  
So, let's go to chapter 5 or 17.  
Let me just show you this for tonight.  
So, let's go to chapter 5 or 17.  
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Hey.  
Use the King James Version.  
 And it came to pass on a certain day.  
On a certain definite day, it came to pass as he was teaching.  
Oh God, as he was teaching.  
Jesus was teaching, he says, there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which would come out of every town of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem.  
Read the rest.  
And what?  


  
 The power of the Lord was presence.  
Did Jesus have to struggle to heal anybody?  
The Bible says Jesus was teaching.  
As He was teaching.  
The power was presence.  
As He was teaching.  
 The power was present.  
What was the power waiting for?  
The power was waiting for anybody with faith.  
Anybody who would believe what Jesus was teaching.  
If anybody would believe, the power got to work on his or her behalf.  
The power was present.  
Did you know that many times when you were preaching and teaching, the power was present?  
 The power was present.  
The power was present.  
Say I refuse the fear.  
 As the first thing of the conference drew to a close, the man of God left the ministers in a time of faith-filled confessions, admonishing the ministers on the utmost importance of lifting up their hands.  
Lift your hands, lift your hands.  
You know what you're doing right now?  
You know?  
Isaac said, I lifted up my hand to God.  
It matters when you lift your hand.  
 Say, Father, my hands are lifted in victory.  
My hands are lifted in victory.  
Listen, look at me.  
Put your hands down.  
Listen, listen to this.  
The lifting of the hand is a vow.  
Do you know that?  
The lifting of the hand is a vow.  
The lifting of the hand is a powerful symbol.  
 of resoluteness, the powerful resolve.  
When you lift your hands to God, whatever it is for which purpose you are lifting your hands, you are saying, Lord, by you, by your grace, by your power, it shall be as I have said.  
It shall be as I have said.  
 That's the meaning.  
That's why parts that I will that men pray everywhere, lifting up all their heads.  
Because by lifting your hands, you are saying, this is sealed.  
This is settled.  
It shall be sold.  
It cannot be all times.  


  
The nations are ours.  
We're walking in the glory.  
 in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Open your mouth and thank Him.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank Him, thank Him, thank Him, thank Him.  
Indeed, over 5,000 pastors and leaders spanning across 145 nations of the world present at this meeting were transformed with revived visions and increased grace to take the nations for Jesus Christ.  
Hallelujah.
