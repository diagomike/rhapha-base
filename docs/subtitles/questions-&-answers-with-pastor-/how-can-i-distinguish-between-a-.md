title: How can I distinguish between a false prophet and a prophet of God
---
 to be a Muslim from, if I don't get it right, I just tried, okay, from Uganda.  
There pass the Chris, how can I distinguish between a false prophet and a prophet of God?  
Number one, a prophet of God draws people to God and not to other gods, but to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
And draws people to the world, not to himself,  
 or to some other God.  
And then the things that he says come to pass.  
Now that's a little tricky because sometimes you have a true prophet who makes mistakes because there are some who have made mistakes and don't forget that  
 You are not made a pastor or a prophet or an evangelist because you are perfect.  
You see, so sometimes some of them can make some mistakes.  
I don't want you to judge them with the mistakes.  
 Because sometimes out of enthusiasm, or that's over-enthusiasm, or the expectations of those who are around them, they can do or say things that they're not supposed to do, and then some might not even be living right.  
And so, things go wrong because they're not paying attention to the Holy Spirit.  
But that doesn't make them false prophets.  
See, a true prophet can make mistakes and say the wrong thing.  
As a true evangelist,  
 consider wrong thing, you know.  
So sometimes there are problems like that.  
So there are other distinguishing factors.  
Does he walk in love?  
A key.  
A key.  
Walking in love of Christ is very important.  
Then the consistency of the Word of God in his mouth.  
 Because as you have a false prophet, you can have a false pastor.  
You can have a false teacher.  
And then the Bible also talks about false brethren.  
So it's not only false prophets.  
There are false prophets according to the Scriptures.  
There are false teachers according to the Scriptures.  
And there are false brethren according to the Scriptures.  
And you want to know all of this in the same way.  
Sometimes not immediately.  
See, you may not know immediately.  
 Sometimes it takes a while, but you will see certain things consistently, especially faltering on the Word of God, consistently, is a major sign.  
Faltering on the Word of God consistently is a major sign, is a major sign.  
And then there are other problems that make it very difficult.  
You've got the  
 the use of material mediums.  
Incidentally, there are true Christians, true pastors, prophets, evangelists, teachers, and so on, including apostles.  
There are truths that have been misled into the use of material mediums.  
See?  
 praying through certain things.  
They've got some cloth to pray through.  
They've got some water, some holy water to pray through.  
They've got all of this stuff.  
And they are problems because a true prophet shouldn't use them, but some of them have used them and some are using them.  
 So it becomes rather difficult to distinguish between them for some people, especially when you understand that sometimes some of these ministers have come from a background where there were children and grandchildren of priests and priestesses, Juju priests and priestesses.  
So some of these things they have carried over into Christianity and they're using them.  
So I'm saying  
 That's not enough to condemn them because they're using some things out of the ignorance.  
And someday soon they learn from those mistakes and stop using them.  
So that's why that's not enough to tell that they have force.  
 But if you listen to the Word of God that's taught you, that's the most important.  
Go to the scriptures for yourself.  
Go to the scriptures for yourself and listen to what they say and compare what you're hearing to what is in the Word.  
Okay?  
And that will help you because if that minister continues to falter on the Word of God, you got to know something is wrong.  
 Something is wrong.  
So that's the biggest sign.
