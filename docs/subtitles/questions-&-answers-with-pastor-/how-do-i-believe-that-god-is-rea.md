title: How do I believe that God is real
---
 Ketongguno from India.  
He says, Dear Pastor Chris, I have been hearing that God is real, but I'm finding it very hard to believe.  
I just don't know what to believe and how to believe.  
I have been reading the Bible, but I don't understand what I'm reading.  
Also, I've been praying, but I don't know to whom I am speaking.  
What do I do?  
First,  
 There's a little bit of history that you got to get.  
Almost 2000 years ago, a man named Jesus was born of a virgin.  
And he declared that he was sent from God as God's son.  
His birth was a miracle birth because he was born of a virgin.  
 And then he also told us by several molecular science that he came from God.  
And he brought a message from God.  
And the Bible tells us how that he died for us as a sacrifice.  
He was buried the third day  
 God proved that he was truly from him by raising him from death.  
Jesus was raised from the dead as proof that he was from God.  
After his resurrection, he ascended in the presence of 120 people who saw him.  
 The Bible tells us more than 500 people saw him after his resurrection.  
Now this Jesus ascended physically to the clouds to heaven.  
One more proof that he was the Son of God.  
 This Jesus being proved by God Almighty, because when you say you don't believe there's a God, you have to understand everything in nature couldn't have come accidentally.  
There's too much order in nature to have come as an accident is impossible.  
You have to deceive yourself.  
And another beautiful thing is every human being has the capacity  
 to believe in an unseen God, everyone.  
It is natural to human beings to believe with their hearts.  
It is natural.  
So, believing is a choice.  
And that's why we talk about Jesus because he was more than a religious leader, God Almighty,  
 whom he came to declare, test the fire of him through his births, through his miraculous life, through his death, which he commanded.  
That's another miracle.  
He gave up a ghost.  
He gave up his own spirit at his death.  
And then by his resurrection, from the death, from the dead.  
And finally, his ascension into heaven.  
He didn't just vanish.  
 He ascended before the eyes of those who were watching him and through the clouds.  
And the biggest part of all of this is that God vested power into His name.  
Such that almost 2000 years after all of this happened, His name still has power today.  
His name still has power.  
At His name, miracles happen.  
 at his name, Demon Stremble.  
His name still has power today.  
So if you will believe in this Jesus of Nazareth, he will impact to you eternal life.  
You don't have to see him with your optical eyes first.  
You can believe with your heart because his name still has power today.  
So if you will believe this little information we've given you,  
 and accept that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  
You have eternal life, the life that He gives.  
You can receive that into your heart.  
And then all of your sins that you've committed will be forged out of your heart.  
The nature of sin will be gone because that's the reason they came to die for us to wash our sins away.  
 and settle that with God Almighty.  
So we could have eternal life.  
So this is very important for you.  
The simple information, but very, very powerful.  
Very, very powerful.  
We trust you have been blessed.
