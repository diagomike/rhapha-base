title: Heaven In You
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 Do you have a Bible with you?  
All right.  
Turn to the book of Ephesians in chapter number four.  
I'm going to begin reading to you from verse eight, and then you will take off from there and read some more.  
 You ready?  
Okay.  
From verse 8, wherefore he say it, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men.  
That means he led captives in his train.  
So much to say about that.  
Now that he ascended, what is it?  
But he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth.  
 He that descended is the same also, that ascended up, far above all heavens, that he might feel all thanks.  
All right, you read verse 11 for me. 12.  


  
 Beautiful.  
Let me read that to you.  
What is just right?  
And he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers.  
Did he say, and several others?  
Did he say, and anybody else?  
No.  
 apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers.  
Why and what for?  
Verse 12, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.  
I'll explain that in a moment.  
 Till, verse 13, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God onto a perfect man, onto the measure of the statue of the fullness of Christ.  
 that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to one fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive.  
But speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head, even Christ, hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
This is very, very instructive.  
 In that 11th verse, now the first two verses I read to you, first three verses, eight, nine and ten.  
He was talking about the fact that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead.  
And not only was he raised from the dead, he also ascended into heaven.  
But that he did something.  
He gave gifts to men.  
 Now this time he's not talking about some ability for just everybody, but he's talking about ministry gifts, human beings who are gifts.  
Meaning that the five offices that he mentioned here are gifts of Christ to his body, the church.  
He says apostles, prophets,  
 Evangelists, pastors, and teachers.  
These are gifts.  
In other words, when you have a pastor, that is a gift to you.  
A teacher of the gospel is a gift to you.  
A prophet, an apostle, an evangelist.  
He said he gave some.  
So in some places,  
 Some Christians would be given an apostle.  
Some would be given a prophet.  
Some would be given an evangelist.  
Some would be given a pastor.  
Some would be given a teacher.  
Some could be given more than one of them.  
And one man could have several offices.  
For example, Jesus had several offices.  
In fact, he had all of these offices.  
 The apostle Paul had several offices.  
He was a prophet and a teacher, and then he became an apostle, and he also pastored.  
He was an evangelist.  
So these are several offices.  
Timothy became an apostle, but he was first a pastor.  
 Do you understand this?  
So one man could actually have several offices.  
Now what we're talking about here is the purpose for these offices.  
We'll go back to verse 11 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints.  
 for the perfecting of the saints.  
He gave these offices for the perfecting of the saints.  
He didn't say he gave you another brother or sister in Christ for the perfecting of the saints.  
He didn't say he gave you a friend for your perfecting.  
He didn't say he gave you your mother or your father for your perfecting, even though all of these are beautiful and given to us by God as a certain level of gifts.  
But these are not the ascension gifts.  
Are you listening to me?  
 These are not Christ's ascension gifts.  
There are special offices, not because somebody said he hears, but everyone who's an apostle or a prophet or a pastor or teacher or evangelist is separated onto the gospel by the Spirit of God.  
There's an anointing on him that separates him from others.  
And there are signs that go with him that prove his office.  
 Because for every office, you ought to have necessary credentials.  
And the credentials that we have in ministry are spiritual.  
Hallelujah.  
Now, the first thing we saw there in that 12th verse, he says, for the perfecting of the saints.  
The word perfecting comes from a Greek word, catatismus.  
And what does it mean?  
 It means to be fully dressed.  
It means to be fully finished.  
It also means to be fully equipped.  
The Bible says to put on the whole hammer of God.  
And how are you going to put it on?  
You would not even know about the hammer of God until you're taught, until you get to know from the Word of God.  
 And how do you put them on?  
Through faith, fresh to hear.  
Next you accept and dust and confess it and walk in the light of it.  
And these are all in the ministry of a pastor or a teacher or any of those five to teach you or bring you to that place where you are fully dressed, fully furnished, fully equipped for your life.  
The many Christians who are not fully dressed,  
 even though they're physically dressed.  
But spiritually, they're exposed.  
And so they can be easily attacked by the enemy and so they find themselves either in the hospital one day or they're knocked out and something happens in their physical body or on their job or something.  
They're being attacked by the adversary.  
 Now, the problem is not that you are attacked.  
The problem is that you are injured.  
To be attacked is not a problem because you have the whole armor of God.  
And you can always deal with the enemy if you are well-dressed.  
But if you are not well-dressed, you'll be a victim instead of being a victim.  
That's why you need such ministries in your life.  
 Now, I know there are people who say that every Christian needs all of these five offices.  
No, he didn't say he gave everybody an apostle, everybody a prophet.  
He says he gave some.  
It depends on Christ.  
He's the one that chooses.  
What office is the man or woman of God that he calls into your life?  
That depends on him.  
You don't choose who your man or God is.  
 If you don't wake up to say, okay, well, anyway, this is going to be.  
No, how does a man of God come into your life by bringing the word to you that uplifts your life, that shapes your life and shapes your future?  
And there is a knowing within your spirit that there is a connection between you and that man of God.  
That's what happens.  
 So you see, he's given these offices for the perfecting of the saints that we should be well-dressed.  
Make sure you write it down.  
Well-dressed.  
That's number one.  
Well-funnished.  
Number two.  
Number three, well-equipped.  
That's why the Greek, he used the word catatismus.  
Perfecting.  
 The next part of it says, for the work of the ministry.  
For the work of the ministry.  
That means you are actually called to do the work of the ministry.  
Your highest calling in life is not to be a politician, even though that is good.  
Your highest calling in life is not to be a medical doctor, even though that is good.  
Your highest calling in life is not to be anything in this world, even though all the nice things you might choose in trade or any career will be wonderful.  
 The highest calling for every Christian in life is the work of the ministry.  
The more you mature in the things of God, the less the things of this word matter to you.  
The more you find us have drawn into the Spirit to become aware of the things of the Spirit.  
 Let me say something to you that I hope will be of benefit to you immediately.  
Well, but if you don't get to grasp it immediately, don't worry.  
So now later it will be.  
Paul tells us how that in 2 Corinthians chapter number 12, it tells us that he was, he was transported.  
He was transported into the thought heaven and heard  
 Words that are not, is that not proper for men to speak.  
They're not able to speak those words.  
They're beyond their understanding, beyond their grasp, because they will not understand on this realm of life.  
He said it was a third heaven.  
Well, if there's a third heaven, there must have been a second heaven.  
There must have been a first heaven.  
 And many times we are told that the first heaven is the atmosphere immediately above us.  
And then the second heaven is where you got the heavenly bodies, the galaxy, you understand?  
All right.  
Then the third heaven is where God dwells.  
Well, the picture seems OK, but not entirely right.  
 If you look at what the Bible says, for example, turning into the book of Revelation, where he talks about a new heaven and a new earth.  
He wasn't talking about the various chatter in the atmosphere.  
He also talked about, for the first heaven and the first earth are passed away.  
He must be dealing  
 with realms of life.  
He must be dealing with things that could have been located in the spirits or in the physical.  
The first earth, for example, in the physical.  
Now, the Bible churches, there was a pre-adimite word.  
 Now, that preadimite word was dominated by Lucifer.  
He was given the authority.  
He was God's vice-regent over that old word.  
In other words, he was in charge of the first heaven over the earth.  
Now, what's the need for the heaven?  
 The heaven actually is the spiritual realm that controls the earth.  
You got to understand the earth cannot function without a heaven.  
The earth has to be controlled by a heaven.  
Heaven is a spiritual realm.  
It is the abode of spirits and spiritual activity.  
 And they actually control the things that happen in the physical world.  
Now, we know the story, how that Lucifer fell, and he was thrown out.  
And because he was thrown out, he came to the earth, thrown out of that first heaven, came to the earth.  
 He had been controlling things in the earth.  
He was in charge of that heaven over the earth.  
And then when you read in Genesis chapter 1 and verse 1, he tells us in the beginning, God made the heaven and the earth.  
He created the heaven and the earth.  
Then he says, the earth was without form and void.  
And darkness was upon the face of the deep.  
 not because God created a formless earth or an empty earth, but because of that judgment, this happened.  
Now, there's so much for us to share about that in various scriptures to show all that to you, but that's not the point.  
The point is this.  
There was, therefore, another heaven.  
 in that heaven had to be controlled by angelic beings, but seemingly controlled by rebellious spirits, rebellious beings, and the need for men to be saved, because the heaven over them has been dominated now, taken over by spirit beings.  
 You remember in the days of Daniel when he fasted for 21 days.  
He didn't need to fast the whole 21 days.  
He was praying to God.  
And the Bible says that when Daniel prayed, an angel was sent from heaven with the answer to Daniel's prayer.  
But he was held up in the heavens.  
He was held up in the heavens by  
 angelic beings, particularly the Prince of Persia.  
And he said, the Prince of Persia, we stood me for 21 days.  
And Daniel kept on fasting and asking for what he was asking for, for 21 days.  
Finally, when the angel got through, because he was helped by another angel, an archangel, Michael, when he was helped,  
 And Michael had to engage those demons, those angelic beings, those principalities of evil.  
In the heavenly realms, the Bible tells us this angel that was sent to Daniel arrived at Daniel's and said to him, the first day, 21 days ago, the first day that you began to pray, your voice was heard in heaven.  
And I was sent with the answer.  
 He said, but I was stopped by the Prince of Persia until Michael the Archangel came to help me.  
And when I'm through with you now, I'll go back to the fight because it's still on.  
Are you listening to this?  
So much to tell you about that.  
But here's the point.  
This is the part of him that excites me.  
 Paul said, I knew a man about 14 years ago, whether in the body or out of the body, I cannot tell.  
But he said, such a man in Christ.  
He said, I knew a man in Christ.  
Not a man that looked this way, that he said, I knew a man in Christ.  
Meaning what called the fact the man was that he was in Christ.  
He said, such a man who was taken to the third heaven and heard  
 Great words, awesome words that are not fit for this word.  
He said, in such a man will I glory.  
But when you keep reading the next few verses, from that 12th chapter of Second Corinthians, you're reading to verse six and into verse seven, you understand Paul was actually talking about himself.  
He was the one that was cut up into the thought heaven.  
 Where is this thought heaven?  
You have to understand something about the realm of the Spirit.  
Did you read that when Jesus was being baptized at the Jordan River by John the Baptist, he heard a voice that spoke to him.  
 John heard that voice.  
Jesus heard that voice.  
And the voice said, this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.  
The voice spoke from heaven.  
Jesus also made some very interesting statements.  
 For example, one of them he said, even the son of man which is in heaven, referring to himself.  
I thought he should have said which was in heaven.  
He said which is in heaven, and he was on the earth.  
Which is in heaven?  
How can you say which is in heaven?  
Another time he said, before Abraham was I am.  
He didn't say, before Abraham was I was.  
If he said before Abraham was I was, it would mean he preexisted Abraham.  
But that's not what he wanted to say.  
 That's what they thought he was going to say.  
But he said, before Abraham was, I am.  
That's not very good English, you understand what I'm talking about.  
Of course, he didn't speak English.  
This was translated for us.  
But they understood that he brought it into the present tense.  
And said, before Abraham was, I am.  
What he actually made was he used the words that God used when he called his name to Moses.  
When Moses said to him,  
 Whom shall I say, sit me?  
Your name, God said, I am.  
My name is I am.  
Full rendering is I am that I am.  
So when Jesus said, before Abraham was, I am the Jews understood.  
He had first said, Abraham rejoices in my day.  
They said, you're not yet 50 years old, have you seen Abraham?  
At that time they were still laughing at him.  
They said, he's crazy.  
 Then when he said before Abraham was, I am.  
They said, did you hear him?  
He is saying he is the Elohim, El Shaddai, the one before whom Abraham pounced.  
He is saying he is God.  
So the picked up stones.  
They said, we'll kill you now.  
He said, why do you want to kill me?  
 What have I done?  
What evil have I done?  
They said, no, you haven't done any evil both for blasphemy.  
You being a man, make us thyself God.  
And Jesus escaped.  
Hallelujah.  
Who was Jesus like?  
What was he like?  
Jesus said, my father is with me.  
 And yet the Father spoke from heaven.  
And Jesus had the Holy Ghost.  
Who's the Holy Ghost?  
The Holy Ghost, Spirit of God.  
The Holy Ghost is the one who proceeds from the Father.  
The Holy Ghost is the one who carries.  
Listen, you've got to understand this.  
God never lives His throne.  


  
He never leaves His throne.  
 Understand something, throne is more than a chair.  
When the king gets up from the chair to go to bed, has he left the throne?  
The throne is an office.  
You get it?  
The throne is an office.  
And so the Holy Spirit, being the Spirit of God, is also the Spirit on the throne, because he's the Spirit of God.  
 He's the one that brings you the presence of God.  
You will never know the presence of God until you know the Holy Spirit.  
He's the one that brings you the presence of Jesus who died 2,000 years ago and God raised him from the dead.  
You'll never know he's alive until the Holy Spirit brings you His presence today.  
And that's the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  
 And that's why we tell people they've got to receive the Holy Spirit.  
We're not talking about a shaking, you know?  
It's more than a shaking, and it's more than a tongue.  
You understand?  
I know some of you have received the Holy Spirit and you speak in tongues, but maybe not enough.  
You just say, come on.  
Get on.  
Get on.  
Get on.  
That'll not get the job done.  
Get off some more.  
For vocabulary, you understand?  
Hallelujah.  
 We tell people they've got to receive the Holy Spirit because the Christian life is not possible without the Holy Spirit.  
What was Jesus like?  
Jesus was in the earth with the heavenly life.  
Get this.  
He was in the earth with the heavenly life.  
So he could say, I am not of this word.  
Oh, where are you?  
 Heaven.  
He said, I came from above.  
Then he said to the others, here from beneath, they said, but we knew when you were born.  
He said, I'm from above.  
 Because He brought to this world a life that was from heaven.  
Jesus was at home in heaven, as He was here in the earth.  
Oh, come on.  
If you catch this, you are made for life.  
I'm telling you, if you catch this, I'm sharing with you now.  
You got it.  
It's powerful, it's important.  
Jesus was at home.  
 In heaven, while he was here on the earth, as he was, he was living in two worlds at the same time.  
And one was more real to him than the other one.  
And guess which one was more real to him?  
The heavenly life was more real to him.  
To many people, this world he is more real than the one  
 in the Spirit.  
Oh no, it's because you've not been taught.  
It's because you've not been trained.  
You see, that's why you think that way.  
Glory to God.  
So there was a real place of heaven.  
And so Jesus could say, my father, above.  
I came from above.  
 So there was a real place above.  
You say, where's above?  
Spiritual, but geographical location, above.  
So when you pull it like this and say above, it doesn't mean that if you take an airplane and shoot, that's what we're gonna get there.  
No, it's in the spirits, but in the realm of the spirits, it is above.  
We have this consciousness in our spirits, glory to God.  
 that we are citizens of heaven.  
Philippians chapter three, verse 20, tells us that we are citizens of heaven.  
Glory to God.  
We are citizens of heaven.  
That's what we are.  
So what did Jesus do?  
Jesus came here with a part of that heaven.  
I wish you get a glimpse of this.  
 He came with as much heaven as he could share.  
He came with as much heaven as he needed to live by, as much heaven as he could bless the world with.  
Let me explain this in a simple way.  
If you are from the United Kingdom and you are  
 the ambassador of the United Kingdom in South Africa, you will be living in your house like you were in the United Kingdom.  
Everything necessary for a life in the United Kingdom will be made available to you.  
Are you listening to me?  
Even though  
 That house where you live is situated in South Africa.  
Now, when you come out of that house, you have all the rights of a diplomat from the United Kingdom.  
That okay?  
But you may meet with people who are in South Africa and deal with them as South Africans.  
But you know that you are from the United Kingdom.  
 So guess what?  
Guess what?  
You can only help people with as much UK as you can bring in here.  


  
So, what's this?  
When you get into the embassy, the rules of the United Kingdom apply.  
Yet there is a country called the United Kingdom.  
 away from you, but you have brought as much life of the UK to this place, as much as you can, as much as the rules allowed.  
Same thing with Jesus, as much as the rules allowed, he brought heaven, he.  
Oh, come on, come on, come on.  
Are you getting this?  
 Okay, now he's what Paul was talking about.  
Well, can we read it?  
Second verse chapter number 12.  
I'm reading to you from verse two.  
He says, I knew a man in Christ about 14 years ago, whether in the body I cannot tell, or whether out of the body I cannot tell.  
God knows, such in one to rob to the sword heaven.  
 And I knew such a man weathering the body or out of the body.  
I cannot tell God knows how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to order.  
It is not lawful.  
He said, I heard unspeakable words, not lawful for a man to order.  
Lakeabahasataya.  
 Could he be saying that the words were wrong?  
Oh, no.  
Oh, no.  
You couldn't have something wrong in God's heaven.  
He heard on speakable words.  
He says, and it's unlawful for a man to order the Mount here.  
He didn't mean unlawful up there because they ordered them there.  
That's why you hurt them.  
He's talking about unlawful down here.  
Oh.  
 Oh, imagine if you were a South African Saint to America, or not America, that would be too good for that.  
Let me put it this way.  
Let me put it this way.  
Imagine if you are a South African and you were a Saint to Zimbabwe is too close.  
 It's too close, but they're in a kind of state.  
I would have liked to use that, but you know, they're getting better now, all right?  
Yeah.  
Yeah.  
Let me think of... You know, I want to be careful because, you know, there's a lot of people from every country here.  
OK, let's just say some country somewhere.  
 That wasn't so nice, you understand.  
A country not so nice.  
And you had to stay there 20 years.  
And you were the South African ambassador.  
You have all the beautiful rights and all the nice things that South Africa would give to you to live better than others in that country.  
 And then, after 15 years of being there, you traveled to South Africa for the first time.  
And you look at the changes.  
 Oh, South Africa looks wonderful to you.  
Oh, you've got to go back, you know.  
You've got to go back to that other country.  
But because you've got five more years to be there.  
And you look at it and you're like, wow.  
Now, when you go back to that country, you say, I was in South Africa.  
It was just so beautiful.  
It was just so wonderful.  
You know, you say, I couldn't contain myself.  
 Because South Africa in 15 years had changed so much.  
And you have been in this poor country somewhere outside for so long.  
Even though you were given all the nice things that South Africa could give to you in the embassy.  
Are you getting it now?  
So Paul was taken to the third heaven.  
 The third heaven is not a heaven that's going to come.  
The third heaven therefore exists because Paul had been there.  
Are you hearing this?  
This is glory, glory, glory.  
This is Shandara Bakaya.  
Oh, glory to God.  
This is the heaven that we are a part of.  
But we are ambassadors down here.  
 Yeah, you got it So Paul Paul traveled up there and heard words Let me give you an example of the kind of things that Paul heard because I know what he's talking about Are you hearing me?  
 Now, let me give you, let me give you, you know, down here, if you wanted to eat something, you would say, I want to eat.  
Are you hearing this?  
Now, you don't say, I want to eat in the thought of heaven.  
You say, I eat.  
Are you following this?  
If you were in a restaurant here and you said, I eat, there was things I'm wrong with you.  
And you said to the waiter,  
 I have a drink.  
You didn't say, get me a drink.  
You say, have a drink.  
Can you say, excuse me?  
You say, have a drink.  
Now, in the third heaven, when you say, have a drink, the drink gets there.  
Are you following this?  
Are you listening?  
There's a different language.  
 And he said, I heard all of them speakable words.  
Which it is not lawful for a man to order.  
It is not lawful down here.  
Look at Jesus when they brought news to him about Lazarus.  
He waited until Lazarus died.  
When Lazarus died, he said to his disciples, gentlemen, Lazarus sleeps.  
 He says, Lazarus sleeps.  
And I want to go and wake him up.  
They said, no, Master, if he sleeps, that's all right.  
When he couldn't convince them, he said, I mean, he's dead.  
You see, he had to come down to their level.  
He's dead.  
Oh, they said, oh, OK, let's go and douse him.  
See, they couldn't get his language.  
 He came into the little girl's room where the little girl that was dead.  
When he got there, he said, she's sleeping.  
The monas began to laugh at Jesus.  
They said, we always said he was crazy.  
Because this man talked differently.  
Then he said, little girl, I say to you, arise.  
Did you get up?  
Jesus was different.  
 He was different.  
He brought as much heaven as they could contain.  
As much of it as they could understand.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Who is a Christian?  
A Christian is more than a religious man.  
Who is a Christian?  
A Christian is more than one who goes to church.  
Who is a Christian?  
A Christian is one.  
 who's born again, who has been translated by that birth into the kingdom of God, and who lives now in heaven in the earth.  
Are you catching this?  
 He is wrong with as much heaven as he can carry.  
That's why Paul said to Timothy, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.  
How much grace can you take?  
There which receive abundance of grace, and that the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ.  
There which receive abundance of grace.  
That's Romans 5 and 17.  
There which receive abundance of grace, not the abundance of grace.  
The Th is not there.  
 But abundance of grace.  
In other words, as much grace as you can take, that's what you will manifest in your life.  
How much grace?  
What is grace?  
Grace is the favor of God.  
Grace is the beauty of God.  
Grace is the love of God, the lack of God.  
Are you hearing this?  
That works, we think you.  
And then you see that glory on the outside, in everything that you do.  
And you can always increase that grace.  
 by walking in love, by walking in the Word of God, by walking with the Holy Ghost, you increase that grace.  
Like the Bible says, but He gives us more grace.  
So it's His desire to increase the grace on your life every time.  
Maybe you're going through some difficulty.  
What's your need is more grace.  
And don't you say, oh God, give me more grace.  
No, no.  
Hebrews chapter four.  
Hebrews chapter four.  
 I said, are you getting this thing?  
That's what I said in other talks.  
Glory to God.  


  
 Oh, I like this.  
This is verse number 16, chapter four of the book of Hebrews.  
Let us therefore, are you there?  
I'm hearing your papers flipping.  
Are you there now?  
Okay, verse 16, let us therefore come boldly onto the throne of grace.  
 Where is the throne of grace?  
I told you.  
I told you already.  
I told you already.  
Go ahead, girl.  
I told you already.  
Hallelujah.  
Amen.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Guess what?  
The Holy Ghost brought the throne of God into my hearts.  
Oh.  
 No one now he says he has set eternity in their hearts.  
Your heart can contain eternity.  
You've got to understand this.  
I said Jesus brought heaven down here.  
How?  
In his hearts.  
He brought it in his hearts because the Holy Spirit came to live inside him.  
 And the Holy Spirit came with all the blessings of God, all glory to God, with all the presence of God.  
The Holy Spirit came with the throne of God in the heart of Jesus.  
And that's what is done in my life.  
He says, let us comboly onto the throne of grace.  
No, we don't have to ascend somewhere.  
The throne is now in our hearts, comboly.  
 Shut out this world and you be in the throne.  
Why?  
Because the throne is right in your heart now.  
When you were born again, you were born into the presence of God.  
 And that's why you know what Jesus said, I am in my father and my father is in me.  
This is the same beautiful relationship that we have with him now.  
When we were born again, we were born into God.  
We were born into His presence.  
We were born into His throne room.  
When we received the Holy Ghost, God came into us.  
Hallelujah, His throne room came into us.  
Oh, I like this.  
Now I am in Him and He is in me.  
 Just like Jesus.  
Just like Jesus.  
I like it.  
I like it.  
He says, let's read that verse 16.  
Let's read it.  
It's powerful.  
He says, let us come boldly onto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.  
Come boldly.  
 What does that mean?  
He says to obtain mercy and find grace.  
In other words, you see, that's grace for the job.  
That's grace for money.  
That's grace for your marriage.  
That's grace for your children.  
Thank you.  
If you need that mercy, he says, come boldly and obtain mercy.  
He didn't say ask for it.  
He says, obtain it.  
 How much grace do you want?  
What kind of grace do you want?  
You don't pray for it.  
You look for the kind that you want.  
He said, find grace to hell in time of me.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 Do you understand this?  
Jesus came from heaven, and he died on the cross for us.  
Do you know what it was for the Son of God to die?  
He didn't die just to make us poppers.  
He didn't die just to make us beg us.  
He didn't die for the make us spiritual beg us, crying in prayer for something.  
No, he brought us out of the Mary Clay, said our feet upon the rock to stay, but a song didn't amount to say, no way to come.  


  
 I believe Jesus died for me.  
He died for me.  
And God raised him up for me.  
How could I be defeated anymore?  
Glory to God.  


  
 Go back to Ephesians chapter four, one or three years.  
Ephesians chapter four.  
I tell you, when you know this kind of thing, nothing will be too good for you.  
Nothing.  
Nothing.  
You stop practicing the language in the thought heaven in the earth here, privately.  
Because you talk like that outside, they think you're nuts.  
 When we say we're born again, the world doesn't even understand that.  
They say, what?  
You're born what?  
You know, look at the question that Nicodemus asked Jesus.  
When Jesus said, except the man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.  
Nicodemus said, uh-uh, didn't hear your song.  
 He said, I said, except the man be born again.  
He said, how can a man be born after his age?  
Can he eat a second time into his mother's womb and be born?  
Jesus, Jesus looked at Nicodemus narrowly and he said, are you a leader and a teacher of Israel and you don't know these things?  
Because Jesus knew the man didn't know squat.  
 He just said it to him so he could get his attention.  
The man said, well, I don't know that.  
Well, Jesus, that which is born of the flesh is flesh.  
And that which is born of the spirit is spirit.  
The guy got more confused.  
Hallelujah.  
Then Jesus said, we speak of things from above and no man receives our testimony.  
We are not understood.  
This is wonderful.  
 Ephesians chapter 4.  
Now I'm reading to you from verse 11 again, and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some live angeles and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry, the work of the ministry.  
This is your job.  
I just told you, you have heaven in you.  
 We used to sing a song, let the world see heaven in your eyes.  
How true that song is.  
They really can't see heaven in your eyes because you've got heaven inside you.  
Hallelujah.  
The work of the ministry.  
 is the reconciliation of the world to God.  
We are His ambassadors, turning the world back to Him, calling, seeing us to repentance, and changing lives everywhere.  
It is our sovereign responsibility, divine responsibility, to change lives because we have a message that works.  
We have a gospel that works.  
 And because it's now in us and working in us, we can help others receive it in having producing results in them too.  
So when I share the Word of God with you, what are you supposed to do?  
You get strengthened and you go out to where you work, where you live, all the joy and contact with, and you pour out the heaven that's in you.  
 You're led with them in love.  
You speak the love language.  
You communicate with them to them the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
And then they receive your message and they are changed also.  
Hallelujah.  
And in this work of the ministry, there are various aspects.  
For example,  
 There were those who had to set this place up for us to use.  
Those who had to make sure the chairs were arranged today.  
That's a part of the job.  
Making the place comfortable for others to come in and use it.  
But that's not where he ends, because the meeting is for a purpose.  
We don't live here.  
We function out there.  
We're going to take the message out there, where it is needed.  
 You see, here, we are all with the light of God.  
But out there, they're in the dark, and we are the light of the world.  
And we go there with our lights to light them up.  
Hallelujah.  
It's our job.  
 It's our job.  
And then after we have warned them to Christ, we bring them back in here and teach them the word in our cell meetings, in our PCF meetings, in our church services, or teaching them the Word of God, building them up strong.  
Then they become strong like us, they do the same thing.  
They bring others to Christ.  
Listen, if you really believe in Jesus, you will talk about him everywhere.  
Hallelujah.  
That's why you see, I can't keep this thing to myself.  
 You've got to tell somebody here.  
Hallelujah.  
So it's our ministry.  
It's our responsibility.  
It's our work of service for the Master because we truly believe.  
Praise the Lord.  
It's not over yet.  
Verse 12, for the perfecting of the saints.  
What did we say perfecting was?  
What is it?  
 catatismos, dressing, furnishing, equipping, right?  
Yeah.  
For the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, he says these offices, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers and evangelists, are given for the edifying of the body of Christ, edifying of the body of Christ.  
I like it.  
 I like it.  
We are perfected for the work of the ministry.  
So, you see, we are dressed for the work of the ministry.  
We are punished for the work of the ministry.  
We are equipped for the work of the ministry.  
And then also, these ministry gifts are given to us for the edifying of the body of Christ, edifying.  
Now, what it means to beards?  
It means to charge, to build, to charge.  
See?  
 I'm ministering to you right now.  
In my office, I'm ministering to you right now.  
And you are being charged by the Holy Ghost right now.  
You are being built by the Holy Ghost right now.  
Something's happening in your spirit.  
Why?  
Because these are not the words of an orator.  
These are not the words of a good speaker.  
These are the words of the Spirit of God.  
 So they're going right into your spirits.  
You see, they're not meant for your head.  
They're meant for your spirits.  
So they're going into your spirits.  
They're working the work of God in your spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
That's why we see it all great your life.  
And that's what's going on.  
Something is happening.  
Questions are being answered, doubts are being dissolved.  
See, by the anointing of the Holy Ghost.  
That's what's happening to you right now.  
 You feel something inside you.  
You feel the balloons.  
You get what I mean.  
Hallelujah.  
Butterflies.  
Glory to God.  
Something is happening inside.  
You feel like going out in the world right now and telling somebody about Jesus.  
Yeah.  
 clarifying your vision, strengthening you.  
That's what's going on.  
It says for the edifying of the body of Christ.  
That's what the apostles ministry is for, the prophet, the pastor, the evangelist, the teacher.  
That's what all that'll do for you.  
Glory to his name.  
Then it says, till we all come, verse 13.  
Have you seen it?  
 Do we all come in the unity of the face?  
In the unity of the face?  
What does it mean that unity of the face?  
Some of us think one thing or others think another thing, you know?  
This one believes in tithing.  
Or this one believes in tithing the next.  
 This one is in between, sometimes gross.  
Then there's another one who's he arguing whether Titan is right or not.  
Then you have the guy who's not sure whether or not he's supposed to give his offerings.  
Then the other guy who doesn't know whether or not he's supposed to preach the gospel to anybody else.  
He has another doctrine.  
So with all of this, one believes in talking in tongues, the other one doesn't.  
One says it happens when you go to a spiritual hide.  
 So it happens, you know, accidentally when God deems it.  
Another one says, well, you just sit down and you talk in tongues.  
Who am I secular?  
So we all have all these various aspects of our believing.  
Now he says, with these anointed offices, with these apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers, we will very soon come to the unity of the faith.  
 We will soon begin to believe the same thing.  
And say the same thing.  
And think the same thing.  
And do the same thing.  
Can you shut him and somebody?  
 But here's the good thing.  
I want you to see this.  
There's a powerful scripture.  
In that verse 13, two, we all come in the unity of the faith and of the hypagnosis of the Son of God.  
That means full and accurate knowledge of the Son of God.  
Oh my goodness, I like this.  
He's talking about that knowledge that relates with the known.  
In other words, you so know the thing that thing has become a part of your life.  
 Are you hearing me?  
You know, sometimes we know something.  
For example, you know this, but you don't know it enough for it to become a part of your life.  
Hypnosis is a special, accurate knowledge that has relationship with that which is known.  
You so know until it becomes a part of you.  
It becomes an intercourse with that which is known.  
 Are you hearing this?  
It brings in a fellowship.  
This is wonderful.  
See, we all come in the knowledge of the Son of God, the prognosis, not the gnosis, which is scientific knowledge.  
Are you hearing this?  
But the prognosis of the Son of God, a knowledge that brings me into an intimate relationship with him.  
 that I can so know Him till I know His mind.  
I know His thinking.  
I know His mannerisms.  
His mannerisms have robbed off on me.  
I think like Him.  
I talk like Him.  
I'm just like Him.  
That's the knowledge.  
That's the word that's used for knowledge there.  
You see, when we study the Scriptures, it's important for us to know exactly what God is talking about.  
This is mind-blowing.  
This is powerful.  
 We have a message that's uttered in series on three kinds of knowledge.  
If you haven't gotten that, make sure you are right and get it.  
You've got to listen to it.  
The three kinds of knowledge.  
And this one is the highest of them.  
The epic noices of Christ.  
The knowledge.  
 that brings me into such relationship.  
I get to know and know and know and know him and learn so much about him and know so much about him until I am swallowed up in that knowledge that I don't know myself anymore, I just know him.  
That's what Paul was talking about when he said, as we look.  
 Hallelujah.  
As we look at the mirror of God.  
As we look, we keep looking.  
He says, as we gaze, we are metamorphosed.  
We are changed.  
Change.  
He says, it's a metamorphosis.  
In other words, a change of states, a change of fun, a transfiguration, the more we look.  
 at the mirror of God, which is the Word of God.  
That knowledge transforms you.  
Hallelujah.  
Look here, in that verse, that verse 13, till we all come in the unity of the face and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, man or man.  
This time, he doesn't use the word catatismus.  
He uses another word, teleosis.  
What does it mean by teleosis?  
Into a perfect man, a teleosis.  
 He means a completeness, in which case you lack nothing.  
You have come to a full stature.  
You have grown.  
Now you lack nothing in knowledge.  
You lack nothing.  
Hallelujah.  
You are full of Him.  
You have come to that measurement of Christ.  
He says, the full stature.  
 Is this possible?  
Look at this.  
You mean this is possible?  
Look at it there.  
He says that apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers and evangelists can help us get to that level.  
Where do they function in heaven or in earth?  
In the earth's.  
Those offices are given in the earth's, which means in this earth it is possible.  
This is wonderful.  
 There's so much for us to do.  
We can grow some more.  
Are you hearing me?  
We ought to grow some more and come to that full stature of Christ.  
Did somebody say it's not possible?  
Then Jesus is a greater works than this.  
Are you doing my name?  
In Jesus say that?  
The works are not only in miracles.  
It also means a miraculous life.  
Maybe you need to understand this.  
Maybe you need to understand this.  
 The Bible says that Jesus did so much that I'm not written in the Bible.  
He says, for if they were written, the world would not contain the books that would have been published.  
The world would not contain the books, and this is not an exaggeration.  
This is the Spirit of God talking to us.  
In other words, every day Jesus had this supernatural life.  
There was so much to write about you.  
 the way Jesus left.  
So why were we given the account that we were given in the Bible that's so little?  
The Bible says, but these are written, that he might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.  
And I believe in him and have life through his name.  
In other words, God didn't want to distract us with the extraordinary life, the miraculous life of Jesus, would have been carried away by the miracles and left out what he said.  
So he just gave us a little of what he did.  
 just to get our attention and focus a lot on what he taught so we could know who he was.  
So if Jesus did like this, something happened.  
Look, if Jesus said something, you know, we tell people, God bless you and they act like they didn't hear us.  
 Because they don't know what it is.  
They think it's just a greeting, like it's a good money.  
So the Christian says, God bless you.  
So when they say, God bless you, that man must be a pastor.  
They don't understand what it is.  
We are this amama, amama.  
Look here, we are distributing blessings.  
But many don't understand it.  
So blessings are going out every day.  
And not enough people are taking a hold of them.  
 When I said, God bless you, you are blessed.  
You are blessed.  
Understand this, we are anointed to bless.  
We are anointed to change lives.  
We are anointed.  
We came with heaven.  
Hallelujah.  
I got heaven inside me.  
I said, I got heaven inside me.  
I'm not an ordinary man.  
 Think about this, when you're going to work tomorrow, you're going with harmony in you.  
I understand, tell me.  
I don't know who we are.  
Glory to God.  
Harmony in you.  
Glory to God.  
Man, oh my.  
See why you can't stay with cancer.  
Can you see why you can't live with diabetes?  
 You can't allow that in your life.  
Doesn't matter how it's been hurting.  
You said, Delo, in the name of Jesus, I command you to get out of my body.  
We are taught to meditate.  
Meditate what?  
On heavenly realities.  
How much time do you think about heaven?  
Oh, when you think about heaven,  
 Relax, good things happen everywhere.  
Now, when you think about heaven, what do you think of?  
Maybe you think about angels, you know, you think like this.  
Oh, you think about holy Lord God Almighty, Elindomani.  
 Is that all you're thinking about when you think about heaven?  
You just think about there's some beauty over there?  
No, when you're thinking about heaven, the most important thing to think about is the language of communication, fellowship.  
Let me tell you something.  
When you are somewhere, what you miss the most  
 when you're somewhere where you can have all the infrastructure.  
You can have all the nice things, the best housing, the best gas, the best electronics.  
Think of whatever you want to think of.  
All right?  
If you don't have communication, the ability to talk to other people at the level,  
 that you can understand.  
You get what I'm talking about.  
I'm calling on near a fellowship.  
It means a partnership.  
There's such a communication where I share with you at high levels and you talk to me at that level.  
 For example, when I talk with young about Christians or maybe someone that's, you know, I have some difficulty communicating.  
You see, I have some difficulty communicating because there are different levels.  
You come to a point in your life, you don't talk like an ordinary man.  
I don't know how to put this to you.  
 I can't talk failure.  
I can't talk luck.  
I can't say, you see, the challenge is I am having.  
I am having?  
I don't know how to say that.  
See, why can't I say that?  
Not because I don't want to.  
The reason here is I live somewhere, you see, in our country, we don't talk like that.  
Are you hearing me?  
In our country, we don't talk like that.  
 Maybe you didn't get that.  
In some countries, during funerals, they were black.  
In some other countries, during funerals, they were white.  
In some places, this means, bye-bye.  
See you again.  
In some places, this means come.  
See what I mean?  
 So there are different languages.  
You've got to understand the communication in that man's country to know what it is.  
So I couldn't say those things.  
I can't say, you know, I'm afraid he's going to rain.  
I can't say, I'm afraid.  
I can't say, I'm afraid, you know.  
Some people talk about that.  
I mean, I'm afraid the man may not come.  
 I'm afraid I can't make that appointment.  
Hello, I'm afraid the traffic might, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid, I'm afraid.  
I can't say that.  
You see, it can't come out of my mouth.  
Why it's ugly, it can't come out of my mouth.  
I was born somewhere else.  
Glorious things are spoken of the York City of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 Man, I'm really sick now, man, I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick.  
You know, some people like it, they can put some style into it, man, I'm sick.  
I'm really, I'm sick.  
You know, they can't talk like that.  
They say, ah, look, this thing is killing me.  
It's killing me.  
And you know, they put some style into it.  
In our country, we can't talk like that.  
 Are you hearing me?  
We have been called out of this word.  
We don't belong here.  
Let's not learn their language.  
The Bible says for us to be transformed by the renewing of our minds.  
How can we renew our minds with the Word of God?  
We need a new kind of, a new language.  
The language that God speaks.  
 It's a language of righteousness.  
We talk righteousness.  
We walk in righteousness.  
We fellowship righteousness.  
That's the way we live.  
Righteousness is a conqueror, more than a conqueror.  
It's a victor that is.  
Righteousness is a victor.  
You see, the Bible says the evil shall bow before the good and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.  
 Where are the gates of the righteous?  
Your mouth.  
See that?  
Those are the gates of the righteous.  
So when you order words, they stay.  
What you say is what you get.  
Now rule in your body.  
Rule in your home.  
Rule in your city.  
Rule in your country.  
Hallelujah.  
 That's what we're getting at, and that's the reason for this message.  
To begin to help you get yourself, you know, you're taking strides right now.  
You know, you're taking strides.  
Today or long, you have made progress.  
Hallelujah.  
You have made progress.  
You've moved.  
You're like, where is the devil now?  
 Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
May God's spirit rest upon you.  
Proters and reserves in your life.  
May the acknowledging of the Holy Ghost help you in such a way the word will know your difference.  
The word of God will shine through you as a light  
 in a dark place.  
Hallelujah.  
Worship Him, worship Him everywhere.  
Worship Him.  
Honor Him.  


  
 See, ever in your eyes Show them love  


  
 Let the world succeed.  
Everybody go right.  
Show them lies.  
Show them lies.  
Oh, they can't deny.  


  
 in your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes.  


  
 Just one more time.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hear about holes upon the hostel.  
Thank you Holy Spirit.  
Thank you Holy Spirit.  
Lord.  
You got heaven inside you.  
Was the Holy Spirit has brought heaven into you?  


  
 The ark of God's presence is in your heart today.  
But there's where the Word of God lives.  
That's where the Holy Ghost lives.  


  
 You know, as he's representatives, we carry his word.  
We'll bear his name.  
We'll take this message everywhere, changing lives.  
This is what the world needs.  
This is the hope for the world.  
It's the hope for the world.  
I'm just thinking, what's going to happen?  
 When you tell that man about Jesus, when you tell that woman about Jesus, I was thinking, what's going on?  
God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God, God.  


  
 Let the world see Heaven in your eyes Stronger life They get the night and the world see  


  
 You, the bearer of that kingdom, are definitely the first beneficiary of its blessings.  
I tell you something.  
The Bible says, as we have borne the image of the Matthew,  
 We shall also be the image of the heavenly.  
And he wasn't speaking prophetically.  
A better rendering says, we ought to be the image of the heavenly.  
This is my day.  
 to manifest the kingdom of God.  
This is my name.  
It is your day.  
This is your time.  
The world is waiting for you.  
Let the world see heaven in your eyes.  
You give them hope.  
Give them hope for life.  
Let him know there's hope.  
 You tell that this heartened, that this courage, chair up, there's hope for you.  
There's hope for you.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Say, thank your Lord Jesus.
