title: The Benefits of Prayer
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Prayer is important for the Christian.  
There are certain things that will not change until you pray.  
Not because of the prayer itself, but because of the effects of prayer.  
 Step aside.  
Pray.  
Pray.  
Waiting for the Holy Ghost to take over.  
As you speak in tongues, speak in tongues.  
Run your mind to the Scriptures.  
Before long, your spirit will pick something.  
And once the Holy Ghost endizes that and that's it.  
And you're gone.  
 These are the secrets from God's kingdom given to His children.  
To live a successful life, you always win.  
The life of victory in Christ is very similar.  
You're supposed to live in victory, even in the midst of the stars.  


  
 Prayer covers not only the communication, the content of the prayer, it also covers our meditation during the times of prayer, even the seclusion.  
It's all important.  
When you have to cut yourself away from everything else and be alone with the Spirit of God, so we can talk to you.  
 So I can open your eyes.  
No, I'm not talking about you getting into your room and crying, oh God, open my eyes, open my eyes, open my eyes.  
In fact, the more you pray like that, the less open your eyes will be because you'll be disrupting yourself with the prayer.  


  
But it won't happen anyway when you pull apart  
 and commune with God.  


  
We've given you three days in a week for only 15 minutes each time, twice in a day.  
And some of you found 15 minutes to be too long.  
Every now and then you're checking your time.  
It's still 13 minutes.  
15 minutes too long?  


  
 Is that too long?  
It's not too long.  
But take it seriously.  
You'd be amazed at the changes in your life.  
Whenever it is possible to stay away from everything else, do it.  
But what if it hits you when you are driving, talking to arms?  
Be driving and be praying.  
There's nothing wrong with that.  
 The time can come when you're doing something else.  
Go ahead, but pray.  
It's a short time.  
When for some reason, you are never to do it at that time.  
Soon afterward, go and do it.  
Because you see, life is spiritual.  
 Life is spiritual.  
And except you operate from the realm of the Spirit, you could be frustrated.  


  
From time to time we see Christians who are not enjoying the Christian life.  
And they are thinking about what might be wrong.  
 This, the enemy, is this, the trouble, is this, the guessing, guessing and guessing.  
If they were not able to have children for years, they're thinking, maybe it's my uncle's wife.  
I have had 12 miscarriages.  
I think it's my uncle's wife that's still in the babies.  
Why do you think so?  
I dreamt of her.  
She took something out of my stomach.  
Now you start praying against your uncle's wife.  
In the mighty name of Jesus.  
 pointing towards her room.  
How you a Christian or a native doctor?  
You know some Christians have become like native doctors.  
They're not living like Christians.  
They're doing strange things.  


  
As a Christian,  
 Didn't you read in the word?  
No weapon formed against you shall prosper.  
If the weapons formed against you are prospering, then whose problem is it?  
You!  
It's not the weapons that are too strong.  
It's not God that was unable.  
 something about you.  
That's making it possible.  
You are in the wrong position.  
He's at staying inside the house.  
The death angels come in the town.  
But if you stay in the house and you got your doorposts and lintels marked with blood, he said, when that angel sees the blood, he'll pass over you.  
That's it.  
 Say what you're supposed to be, but when you're out of what you're supposed to be, then trouble strikes.  
Then you say the forces were against you, the attack was too much, you couldn't take it.  
Oh God, didn't protect you?  
No.  
Christianity is so simple.  
So simple.  
The life of victory in Christ is very simple.  
 Very simple.  
You're supposed to live in victory, even in the midst of the stumps.  
Remember what Jesus said?  
When the wings became boisterous, the wings were rising.  
And they were in the boats.  
Jesus and his disciples were.  
And what else did it get in?  
The disciples were scared.  
 They woke him up.  
He was sleepy.  
They woke him up.  
Master, don't you care that we perish?  


  
Hallelujah.  
So Jesus said, oh, ye of little faith.  
See, they had no faith.  
They were so afraid, thinking they were going to die on Jesus' doom.  
 Oh, I didn't know it was so high.  
Oh, these are terrible waves.  
Was that what he did?  
I'll talk to my father.  
I'll talk to my father.  
We have been between life and death.  
Is that what Jesus did?  


  
 Was that what he did?  
What did he do?  
He said to the sea, Hush!  
He said, big town.  
Sometimes when we talk in tongues because of certain things, I won't tell you why.  
Why you have to?  
Because there's no wrong to talk in tongues.  
Or if you're talking in tongues out of fear, you're in trouble.  
 the fear will increase.  
The reason for speaking in tongues like that is because you're tearing your spirits to pick the right words, to deal with the right thing.  
You see it?  
Because you don't want to be addressing the wrong thing.  
Just because the winds are strong and the waves are high doesn't mean  
 You're going to be talking to this wave or that wave or all the waves or whatever.  
You're speaking tongues because being the Spirit of God, it's like in an instant.  
The Spirit of God opens your eyes.  
You know exactly what to say.  
What words to use.  
So you're pulling something from within you.  
Not because you are afraid.  
Don't talk out of fear.  


  
You refuse to fear.  
Say, I refuse to fear.  
 I refuse to flee.  
And then you look at your life and you set goals.  
A lot of times we're told to set goals.  
It's important to set goals, but don't set goals out of your emotion.  
Set goals through the Spirit.  
 It's not hard to take a short time, even in a day, to pray and fast.  
Fasten means that you separate yourself from everything else.  
Okay?  
Especially food.  
Did you hear that?  
Everything else, especially food.  
So, you talk to the Lord.  
And praying in the Spirit is the most beautiful of all.  
 Why are you pruning the Spirit?  
The Holy Ghost can take the next steps.  
Now you're working on a project and you say, next steps.  
You determine what you have done and what needs to be done.  
And you say, these are the immediate things that we have to do next, right?  
Okay.  
So when you're speaking in tongues, speaking in tongues, speaking in tongues, because that you can do bad faith.  
 See, you're speaking tongues by faith.  
You open your mouth and the ottrons is given to you by the Holy Ghost.  
And you're speaking in tongues.  
But there's another one that you cannot make happen.  
And that's a higher level of prayer.  
That's what's written for us in Romans chapter 8, from verse 26.  
Let's read it.  
Romans chapter 8, from verse 26.  


  
 This is likewise the Spirit also help us our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought.  
We don't know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit  
 or King James translation itself, supposed to read himself, okay?  
Because the Holy Ghost is a person.  
But the Spirit himself make it in a session for us with groanings.  
You see, the victim, the Spirit also help us, help us our infirmities.  
The right rendering is, the Spirit bears us up.  
You see, he props us.  
 Like you're speaking in tongues like you're trying to get up, okay?  
Speaking in tongues, speaking in tongues, when the Holy Ghost props you up.  
He helps you.  
There are limitations.  
There are infirmities, weaknesses.  
You don't know what to pray for about this situation.  
And so the Holy Spirit takes over the prayer  
 That's what he says.  
There's the one your spirit is praying, your spirit is praying in tongues.  
He says, if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prates.  
But my understanding is unfruitful.  
My spirit prates.  
You remember that?  
My spirit prates.  
 So it's your spirit that prays in tongues, even though the language is granted your spirit by the Holy Ghost.  
But in this one, it's not your spirit that's praying anymore.  
Look at it.  
Likewise, the spirit also helped with our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we are, but the spirit himself may get in a session for us!  
 He's doing the prayer now.  
With what?  
Grownings which cannot be honored.  
You see, at that moment, you've been speaking in tongues, your spirit's been praying.  
You come to this level, the Holy Ghost takes over, and now it's no longer tongues.  
It's all deep size and grounds.  
As though you're crying, you don't know why you're crying.  
You can't even stop it.  
No words are being formed.  
 And all you got is deep size and groans.  
You even have to hold your stomach.  
You don't know what tears coming out.  
There's no pain, but this crying wouldn't stop.  
Why?  
The spirit himself may get in the session for us with groanings.  
He's taken over the prayer because you don't know what to pray for as you ought.  


  
 This is the highest kind of prayer.  
And how little many Christians understand this.  
Some can live a whole year without having this experience.  
Because they don't yield themselves to the Holy Ghost.  


  
 Some are afraid of it because they don't know it.  
This every time I try to pray, I find myself shaking and crying.  
So I don't pray, like, I don't pray far anymore once.  
I just say, Father, in Jesus' name, plus God, man was devil, amen.  
And I run away.  


  
But this is the highest kind of prayer.  
 When you pray like this, you know you're settling things for the future.  
Oh God, Kibharanda goes so predella.  
Ah!  
Ah!  
He said, what did you say in tongues?  
He said, it's my joy to make it happen for you.  
That's what the Holy Ghost said.  
Hallelujah.  
That's what the Holy Ghost said.  
 It's my joy to make it happen for you.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Yeah.  
You will pray like that.  
You'll be amazed at your life.  
I tell people, I'll always be successful.  
I'll always be.  
I'll always be.  
 God has the right people to help me at the right time and at the right place.  
How always be?  
Because look at these secrets.  
These are the secrets given to us from the Word.  
These are the secrets from God's kingdom given to His children to live a successful life.  
You always win.  
 Hallelujah.  
Yeah.  
Step aside, you pray.  
Pray.  
Waiting for the Holy Ghost to take over.  
Hallelujah.  
As you speak in tongues, speak in tongues.  
Run your mind through the Scriptures.  
Before long, your spirit will pick something.  
And once the Holy Ghost then does his that and that that's it.  
 And you're gone.  
This is why certain Christians have come to a point in their lives who it's like there's no more progress.  
They've tried and tried and tried, but no progress.  
They've done everything they know to do.  
And then, frustration sets in.  
 They're now being worn out because they prayed and prayed and prayed.  
It didn't work.  
They fasted and fasted and fasted.  
There was no change.  
The prophesied there was no change.  
Professors were given over them.  
There was no change.  
And now they're wandering.  
Can these bones live?  


  
I'm showing you a better way.  
There's a higher law.  
 I hear me.  
Because when the Spirit takes over, many of us know how to pray very well.  
I mean, you'd be amazed at how some of us have words for prayer.  
When you haven't faced serious things, you have words.  


  
 The time comes where all the spiritual vocabulary will be inspired.  
Then you say, hmm.  
There isn't more to say, you might just fall and remain on the floor.  
And then the Holy Ghost takes over for you.  
Hallelujah.  
 Yeah.  
It's called a breaking of the horse.  
Glory to God.  
But you can learn those things by taking action, praying the right way, yielding yourself to God.  
It's not hard.  
It's not hard at all.  
 So hard at all.  
And this can happen to you frequently, sometimes for a period of time, and then may not just conge like every day, but it can happen every day.  
I mean, I've experienced this like almost, how can I explain it?  
Without that kind of prayer, I wouldn't be here.  
 And I'm serious.  
But in my journey in Christ, all these years, this has been my experience.  
Because in the place of prayer, I see.  
My eyes are open when I close them.  
 Do you understand what I mean?  
Closing them, I don't mean physically, I mean in prayer.  
That means when I shut out the world, then I really see.  
Otherwise, you can't carry on ministry seriously.  
There are too many, too many devils.  
Do you understand?  
They outnumber human beings.  
There are more demons than humans.  
 how you're gonna navigate your way through a world that's full of wickedness.  
You think that just because you're nice, the world's gonna be nice to you.  
You're joking.  
It doesn't happen that way.  
When you do good things, it will not put you on other people's good books.  
They don't like you for it.  
And that's why you have to pray like this, because when you pray like this,  
 Then, no matter what they do, you remain untouchable.  
And then you're able to look at them without hating them, without being bitter, because you're winning.  
I mean, if you're winning, why do you care?  
Why do you care?  
You don't care what's been done against you or said about you, because you're winning anyhow.  
 So you raise your hands, square your shoulders, cause you're winning.  


  
Glory to God.  
Then you really see, you see your future.  
 You see your future.  
The gospel is important to you.  
The Holy Ghost doesn't spend time with time with those who don't care about the gospel.  
The gospel is God's number one priority.  
It's important.  
He sent His Son to die.  
Remember that.  
Nothing is more important than that.  
The gospel is so important to God.  
And once you key into that and the gospel becomes important to you,  
 Your house becomes God's headquarters, center of operation.  
Angels are coming in and out of your house doing things.  
They're always around you.  
You want something that's made available.  
You think about it, it arrives.  
Why?  
Because the angels are on the instruction.  
 to make sure everything you need is made available.  
That's the life I live.  


  
The Lord is my shepherd.  
I shall not walk.  


  
Always attending.  
Always available.  
 And they're pushing buttons here and there, making sure things are working for you.  
And they have the enemy subdued.  
Then God says to you, don't worry about them.  
So you just keep matching.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 no weapon formed against you shall prosper.  
And every tongue that rises against you in judgment, now shall what come true?  
This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord.  
And their righteousness is of me, say it to the Lord.  
That's wonderful.  
That's amazing.  
 Another thing, you see, if you're prayerful, you become a stable person.  
There are too many people who are not stable in the house of God.  
You see, give us our targets.  
I want to make that pledge to you.  
Give us our targets.  
If you are a good giver in the house of God, you are a target.  
You've got to understand that.  
Satan has you marked.  
It's not only God who marks you, Satan marks you.  
 God marks you for blessings, Satan marks you for tax.  
What does he seek?  
It's not your job.  
No, because he knows you're not doing it just because of your job.  
It's not your job.  
It's not your money because he knows if he attacks your money, you get another one.  
 What does he go for?  
He goes for the word of God in your life because he knows that's your secret.  
That's what he attacks because he knows that that's what changed your life.  
 You were not a giver until you heard the gospel.  
You were not a giver until you heard the word that changed your life and made your giver into the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
So if you try to take that away from you, take that inspiration away from you, because he knows if he can do that, then you divert your resources to something else, which he needs to.  
He doesn't care that you put your money into anything.  
So long as it's not speeding up the gospel as the Holy Ghost wants.  
 So give us our targets.  
Guess what?  
When there's a rumor in church, who are those defined first?  
The rumor mongers go for the givers in church.  
They're the ones saying, hey, go tell us so and so.  
Have you heard?  
What are they trying to do?  
Caught him off.  
They're the first targets in the church.  
 says, looking for them.  
When there's grumbling in church, who are the first ones to get their information?  
They said, the aushers are too proud now at days.  
Who are they going to report the aushers to?  
Not the pastor, to the giver.  
They look for the sister who gives a lot.  
They look for the brother who gives a lot.  
And they go there and say, you know, there's a lot going on in church now.  
Aushers don't even greet people.  


  
 Why are they telling them?  
Because Satan has them marked.  
And if they're not knowledgeable in the world and they've not been prayerful to be kept in the things of God, their ego will rise.  
Because in their giving they have secured the church.  
And now the Moshers want to spoil things.  
They say, which washes?  
Because, you know, we've got power with the pastel.  
 See, the ego is going up and it's about to destroy them.  
And so when does that push in for a change?  
Because they have their power block and there's no change.  
I'm getting out of this church.  
In other words, I'm withdrawing my supplies from the church.  
What pride?  
How dare you?  
 We draw in my services from the church.  
So what?  
They walk away?  
To punish the church for not listening to their voice.  
But the truth is Satan had their marks.  
 Now when they go out, they don't hear the same thing that changed their lives no more.  
They don't hear anymore.  
They're gone from it.  
They're cut off from it.  
And gradually, the first thing is, their joy goes down.  
They used to be so excited, but that joy is not there anymore.  
Bitterness comes up, replaces the joy.  
The love for the brethren has changed.  
Now their divisive as to, we love these ones, and these ones are the bad ones.  
 Before then, everybody was wonderful.  
Now it's some people that are wonderful, those who support them.  
What's they doing?  
Reducing their glory.  
Until you hear, that guy used to be a great giver in church.  
That lady used to be a great giver in church.  
Used to be.  
 Give us our targets.  
The more you give in the house of God, if you're smart, the more humble you should be.  
And keep your eyes in the right direction.  
You have some stability in your life through the Holy Spirit.  
 and keep your life full of joy.  
Don't let someone else bring some negative thing into your life to spoil this purity that's in you.  
Oh God, the joy of seeing others with the eyes at which God sees them.  
When you don't have all those negativities, you don't have those influences.  
I don't spend time thinking about the negatives.  
 I don't time for that because I don't want them to change me.  
No.  
I stay in the positive.  
I stay in the positive.  
I like to stay with the good thoughts about everyone.  
You know, as a pastor, I would definitely know a lot of stuff about a lot of people, make no mistakes about that.  
The ones that they tell me and the ones that God shows me,  
 Is it so?  
I don't know a whole lot.  


  
But you see, I can't even think about the negatives because that's not for me.  
Philippians chapter 4.  
Turn to verse 8.  


  
 Finally, my brethren, whatsoever things are true.  
Not allegations.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Somebody's true, I saw it.  
It's true.  
No, you're making a mistake.  
What is dealing with there is something that lines up with the Word of God, because Jesus said that word is truth.  
 Finally, my brethren says, finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure.  
How are you following this?  
Whichever things are lovely, oh God, look at your life, look at, whatsoever things are of good reports.  
 If there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.  
I told you until you do the word, you will be programming yourself for failure.  
You've got to do, this is the word.  


  
Are you there?  
 Look at it.  
It's a thing on these things.  
These are the things you set your mind on.  
When you set your mind on things that are less than this, you become the reflection of your thoughts.  
Imagine if your life is the reflection of these.  
Look at that.  
Truth.  
Honest.  
Look at that.  
I just want you to see the beauty.  
 Because the Bible says, as he thinks it, so is he.  
Your character is the reflection of your thoughts.  
And if you think like this, this is what you will be.  
But if you don't think like this, you'll be something different.  
 whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report.  
If there be any virtue and if there be any praise, think on these things and they will be reflected in your life.  


  
 I'm always full of joy.  
You can't take that from me.  
Always full of joy.  
See, this is not a preaching.  
Look at that.  
This is the flow of my spirit.  
It's not in my outline.  
It's my life.  
It's my spirit sharing with you.  
These are my cogitations.  
Do you understand?  
Hallelujah.  
 Set yourself up for progress, for winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning and learn to speak prophetically about your finances.  
Don't wait for someone to do it for you.  
 Let me tell you something.  
In the Word, there are those who are pledged to the eradication of the gospel of Jesus Christ, but they are losers.  
They think to do anything necessary to cut off the gospel.  
And people like us who love to preach it, because they say,  
 We don't mind you being a Christian, but don't tell everybody.  
And we think we've got to tell everybody.  
And so they say, no, we don't like Christians like you.  
We like those Christians who just, who are, Christianity is in the heart.  
They say, so keep it to yourself.  
They say, no, the joy is too much.  
I can't keep it to myself.  
You've got to tell somebody else.  
Then they say, then we punish you for it.  
 And I said, you don't have the power to do it.  
They said, we see.  
And they want to use state power.  
But we understand we're greater than that.  
How do we do ours?  
On our knees.  
I bow my knees before the Father, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.  


  
 When there's any issue, do you remember that also?  
Take it to the Lord in prayer.  
That's what you do.  
In prayer.  
In prayer.  
Don't let the matter take your attention.  
 and you keep thinking what to do.  
Think, think, think, think, think, think, think.  
One minute to the Holy Ghost.  
We'll make a difference.  
Five hours trying to think, and all you get is worry-looking face.  
Only you, you are the only one there.  


  
 Then you have lines here.  
Worried, and then fear would join.  
You know when worry is there and fear has joined?  
So there's fear, insecurity.  
There's worry, economy.  
Now, then there's hatred, your neighbors, coworkers.  
So it's like you're surrounded  
 with trouble.  
If you're thinking about that, your life changes.  
Every day you are either walking fast, looking round.  
What life will you live like this?  
I'm full of joy.  


  
 Are you full of joy?  
Say, I'm full of joy.  


  
You're going to do it again.  
And when you do it this time, you raise your hand and say, I'm full of joy.  


  
 Did you know there's a special blessing when you raise your hand?  


  
 He said, it is not by might, it is not by power, but by my spirit.  
See, I'm showing you how to find yourself located in God's place, in God's time, for God's purpose, in God's way.  
And I showed you the highest kind of prayer.  
 who in the Holy Spirit himself next in the session for the saints.  
Oh God, let's go back to that scripture.  
I want to show you something more.  
Let's go back there.  
Romans chapter eight.  
 This is likewise the Spirit also help at our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we act, but the Spirit himself may get in a session for us when growing sweets cannot be uttered, verse 27, to get it now.  
And he that's such at the hearts.  
That's the Father.  
 the Father.  
He is the one who searches the hearts, says, and he that's such as the hearts, knows what is the mind of the Spirit.  
You see, you don't know because the coming has grownings that cannot be uttered.  
 But it says, God the Father, who searches the hearts, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He makes an intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  
He makes an intercession for the saints according to the will of God.  
Perfect prayer.  
Perfect prayer.  
And when this happens, look at the next verse.  
And we know.  
 that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the cards according to his purpose.  
See how it works?  
When the Holy Ghost takes over like that and in a seed for you, you know that all things work together for good.  
 For good, no matter what the experience is, all things work together for good.  
Then you start saying it's for my good.  
Whoa, go read a guide, it's for my good.  
You find you cannot be disadvantaged.  
It's for my good, you know, you can talk like this in the church, you come out Monday morning, and if you had a job, you could have a sack letter.  
 And how do you deal with that?  
You just got a prophecy in church and then you come out Monday morning and they tell you, you lost your job.  
What you do, all things work together for good.  
To them the love God.  
To them who I have called according to his purpose.  
Then you say, I am not moved.  


  
 You come out and high-fiving others and say, it's for my good.  
It's for my good.  
I know it's for my good.  
Let's say, how do you know?  
You say, look at it.  
Romans chapter 8, verse 28.  
Hallelujah.  
It's for my good.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Go ahead.  
High five.  
Come on, high five.  
It's for my good brother.  
It's for my good sister.  
It's for my good.  
It's for my good.  
It's for my good.  


  
 I'm the seed of Abraham.  


  
 What if, what if things don't work?  
Come on!  
The seat of Abraham don't fail!  
And the seat of Abraham!  
The wall is mine!  


  
 Who's the seat of Abraham?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  
Where are you?  


  
 I've got the mindset of the righteous.  
So I've got the mindset of the righteous.  
Yeah.  
We have a mindset.  
Hallelujah.  
We have a mindset.  


  
I'm full of joy.  
 And I'm full of love.  
And I walk in righteousness and in prosperity.  
Goodness and mercy shall follow me every day of my life.  
Shall I man some life?  


  
 You know, sometimes there are those who face certain situations and looks as though they're alive as ever in a way and they feel like the strength is leaving them.  
They're like, oh God, I'm getting weaker and helpless.  
 Oh God, what can I do?  
What you have to do is stop looking at the wrong thing.  
Stop looking at the wrong thing.  
Jesus said, as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so also must the Son of Man to lift it up.  
 Do you remember that?  
In the wilderness, there have been big enough supents.  
And they were dying, crying, dying.  
And God said, Moses, make a serpent a prize, raise it on a pole.  
And everyone who looks at it will live.  
He didn't say anyone who prays.  
 All they had to do was look and live.  
If you have been bitten, he said, turn and look.  
And when they looked, they lived.  


  
No ceremonies, no rituals.  
He said, look!  
That's all they needed to do.  
Just look.  


  
 That old songwriter wrote the song, look and leave.  
My brother looked, looked to Jesus, and it's recorded in his world.  
Hallelujah.  
 And it's only that you look at Him.  
Look at me, my brother.  
Look to Jesus now, and it's recorded in His word.  
 Hallelujah.  
And it's only that you look at me.  
That's all.  
Look at him on the cross.  
Taking your place of sorrow, pain, disappointment, sickness, failure,  
 that you should never have them.  
And you look and you see that?  
Then you say, if Jesus did it for me, then I choose to live.  
I choose to live.  
My failure is God.  
I choose to live.  


  
 My sickness is gone.  
I choose to live because he died, but I may live.  
So I have life now.  
And what life?  


  
The life of victory in Christ Jesus.  
That's what I have.  
 So I am a vector 24 hours a day.  
I can't think otherwise.  
I have a mentality of success, victory, prosperity.  
I have a kingdom mentality.  
I've been raised that way.  
I can't change now.  
I'm a king.  
I can't change now.  
 Don't you get it?  


  
I live in Christ.  
See, I'm crucified with Christ.  
Nevertheless, I live yet not all, but Christ liveth in me.  
And the light that I live now, in the flesh, I live by the face of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.  


  
 So I know who I am.  


  
I know who I am.  
Failure.  


  
We don't struggle to be successful.  
It's our inheritance.  
 We don't struggle to prosper.  
It's our inheritance.  


  
I'm not working hard so that I will be successful.  
No.  
I'm a success.  
Everything I do is for success.  
Excellence.  
Excellence is at work in me.  
 See, because I'm set to display the virtues and perfections of the one who called me.  


  
That's my life, that's my calling.  
To display his virtues and perfections.  
First Peter, chapter two, somebody, put it up there.  


  
Verse nine, let's read.  
 I want you to give us from the amplified version.  
Good.  
But she had a chosen race, a royal priesthood.  
Listen, look at it.  
He didn't say, you are going to be.  
He says, you are a chosen race.  
You are not about to become.  
You are not going towards it.  
You are not growing towards it.  
You are  
 In the manner of your life, you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood.  
That means King Priest, a dedicated nation, God's own purchased special people.  
Say, I'm special.  


  
 God's own purchase special people that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous life.  
Shut up, Olivia!  
I told you.  
 Set foots the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of the one who called you out of darkness.  
That's my life.  
I'm excellent.  


  
I'm excellent.  
Anything that's a... I know I'm excellent.  
 And I'm excellent.  
Yeah.  
I'm excellent.  
And I'm displaying the perfections, the virtues and perfections.  
How can I do this enough time for?  
It's a never.  


  
 Satan may come to you.  
He's like, oh, think about so you go like this.  
No, no, not me.  
I don't have time for that.  
I'm royalty.  
You see that?  
Royal priesthood.  
That construction is not good enough.  
It's king priests.  
That's what he's talking about.  
King priests in the order of Melchizedek.  
 who are king priests.  
So when he says a kingdom of priests, he doesn't mean a kingdom where there are priests.  
No, he means king priests.  
You see that?  
They have two offices.  
They are kings and they are priests.  
And they are in the order of Melchizedek, the king priests.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
So that's who we are.  
Say, I'm a king.  
I'm a king.  
Yes, the kings have a way to walk.  
Have you ever seen the king walking like this?  
He's not a king.  
Russian?  
He's not a king.  
Hold on for a second.  


  
 You may, some of you may even need to practice how to walk.  
You know what I mean?  
Practice it?  
See, you've just been going like this.  
No, this is not for a king.  
Then stand in front of a mirror and try it.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Amake!  
 And where the word of the King is, there is power!  
There is what?  
Power!  
Glory to God!
