title: Christian Consecration Part 1
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 Glory to God.  
Sometimes we try to put God's work to work to the best of our understanding and things don't seem to work out.  
And we wonder why.  
Why didn't it work out for me?  
Well, you also have to understand  
 that the life of a Christian is also a growing process.  
In other words, you try to learn.  
Find out what more you should have done.  
Don't take it that you've done everything.  
No, you did everything you knew.  
 There's a big difference between doing everything that should be done and doing everything you know.  
You know, what you know may just not be enough.  
And God said, my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge.  
He said, because they don't know.  
So the lack of knowledge is the pain of many of God's people.  
 There's where they got problems.  
It's not because their problems are too difficult for them.  
It is because of a lack of knowledge.  
They just don't have adequate knowledge of how the kingdom of God functions.  
And when you study in the Bible, especially in the synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke,  
 You'd find that Jesus tried to explain to us in several ways how the kingdom functions.  
He would say something like this.  
The kingdom of God is like, the kingdom of God is us.  
You see, in other words, he was teaching them how the kingdom functions.  
 So it's important to study all of those parables that Jesus gave concerning the kingdom of God, because there he was teaching them how the kingdom functions, how the kingdom of God works.  
And that's what a lot of people don't understand, how it works.  
How it works.  
For example, a child is born deaf and dumb.  
 and the parents are Christians.  
They don't know what to do because they don't know how the kingdom works.  
It's not a problem.  
It's a problem for the one who's not born again, but it's not a problem to you.  
But because you don't know, you'd fret about it, you cry about it, you go from place to place, looking for solution, crying out for hell,  
 What is not a problem at all?  
It's not a problem at all.  
The question is, how does it function?  
What more should I know?  
And then, who had to draw the line of faith and unbelief?  
Who is faith?  
Who is unbelief?  
 How do I know when I'm no longer functioning in faith, but humbly?  
For example, you know, you're praying about something, you're expectant, you're calling out to God, and then you believe that everything now is all right because, you know, you felt that way when you prayed.  
You even felt like you heard the voice of God when you prayed, telling you everything was all right.  
 Then you wait and wait and wait for the process to show up and then things don't change month after month, month after month, and things seem to be getting worse.  
Then you say, hold on here.  
Did I hear God right?  
Did I pray right?  
There's something wrong up here.  
You get somebody else to pray with you.  
And then it doesn't seem to work.  
You get as many as you can to pray about it.  
It doesn't seem to work.  
Now, oh God,  
 of what's the matter?  
You see, time sometimes tests our faith.  
You see, because of time, we're pressured.  
We're thinking, look, time's running out.  
Am I losing this thing?  
The question is, how do I know  
 that what I was praying about, I got it.  
How do I know that I got it?  
That's what faith is.  
Faith is not trying to get it.  
I find that everywhere as we try to teach God's children, the word of faith, I find a lot of them have a misconception of faith.  
 Faith is not what you use to get something from God.  
I've tried to explain it to many.  
It's something that just don't get.  
Faith is not something you use to get something from God.  
Did you hear me?  
Because faith doesn't try to get it.  
 The very definition of faith lets us understand it.  
I believe that's why God defined faith for us in the Word, because he knew we're not going to get a better definition in the Word.  
When all the books used to study about faith, all the dictionaries you can read about faith can give you a good definition of faith.  
I've studied several of them.  
I found out the definition in the Bible is the best definition of faith.  
 As Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1, it is now, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  
In other words, two key things there.  
First it says, faith is substance.  
Faith is the substance of things hoped for.  
 That means faith is the title deed.  
Faith, it means, is a real thing.  
He says, the evidence of unseen realities.  
It is the title deed, the substance.  
In other words, it is that tangible expression of your hope.  
 He says, the evidence, evidence of unseen things.  
Evidence, it is the proof of unseen things.  
It is the evidence, which means God wants you to have a substance to your hope.  
 Now, if there's no substance to your hope, in other words, no tangible expression to your hope, there's no faith.  
So faith is an inner or what you call a spiritual tangibility.  
It is inside.  
You know it.  
It is evidence, proof.  
 You can't have faith without knowing that you have it.  
Are you hearing me?  
You can't have faith without knowing that you have it.  
And when your faith is demonstrated about something, you know you have that thing.  
Because faith is the substance.  
 And since it's substance, it means you can touch it.  
You can relate with it from within you.  
You know it.  
Others can't see it, but you have the evidence.  
You may not be able to prove it to someone else, but you know that you know that you know that you have it.  
Because they may not be able to see it, but you have the evidence to you.  
 Just because a woman looks big doesn't mean she's pregnant with a baby.  
It might be a tumor.  
But she can't tell.  
She got a baby.  
So the size is not the evidence.  
But she knows.  
Are you still there?  
When you understand faith, your fears disappear.  
 Because faith is the opposite of fear.  
Fear is trusting in the ability of that thing that you don't want, in the presence of it or in the power of it.  
Faith is trusting in the ability of God, but fear is trusting in the ability of your adversary.  
 If you are afraid of what the devil might do to you, it means you trust the ability of a devil.  
In other words, you got faith in the devil.  
So fear is negative faith.  
So there's nobody who cannot have faith.  
Hallelujah.  
Why am I saying this today?  
Somebody needs it.  
That's not what I want to talk to you about.  
 Somebody needs that today.  
That's not what I want to begin to share.  
What I want to begin to share with you today is on what I call Christian consecration.  
Christian consecration.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Glory to God.  
Christian consecration.  
 I would have just said consecration.  
But because I understand that there's a lot of Christians who misunderstand the subject and there's so much that's been said about it.  
I want us to look at the word.  
What does the word say?  
What does God say?  
What does the Bible say?  
 And that's the most important.  
It doesn't matter what you have believed for so many years.  
Somebody said, I believe this thing for so many years.  
Well, it doesn't matter.  
If a lie has been 20 years in office, it doesn't make it true.  
It's still alive.  
Hallelujah.  
So we'll take a scripture.  
Romans chapter number six.  


  
 You there in Romans 6?  


  
I'm going to read from verse 12.  
Maybe I should make you read it first.  
Can you read it for me?  
1, 2, go. 13.  


  
 raise God.  
I'll read it to you from verse 12.  
Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that he should obey it in the lost thereof.  
Neither  
 Yield, the word yield, neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead.  
Yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead.  
 and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.  
Verse 14, ready together, want to go.  


  
Raise God.  
Now verse 15.  


  
 Okay.  
Now, if you notice in the 12th verse, he says, let not sing therefore rain in your mortal body.  
He says, don't let sin rain over you.  
Don't let sin rain in your body.  
 Don't let sin have the dominion over you.  
That says something.  
If God says, for example, if I tell you, don't let that fellow enter, if you knew that he was more powerful than yourself, you'd wonder, what kind of instruction am I giving you?  
How many of that guy is bigger than I am?  
I can't stop him.  
You're not there.  
I can't stop him.  
You know?  
 But if the instruction is a correct instruction given to the right fellow, here I said, don't let that fellow come in there.  
And you knew you were stronger than he was.  
He said, all right, bring out your chest.  
And you stand out there and say, all right, you're hurting.  
Because you see, the instruction is, don't let him come in.  
 So that's delegated power.  
You've been authorized to stop him from coming in.  
Now God will be remiss to ask us to do something he knew we couldn't do.  
You agree with that?  
Now God says to us,  
 don't let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lost thereof.  
That means I can stop it.  
In other words, God is telling me two big things here.  
The first one is he distinguishes between sin and me.  
You know, many people think they are sinned.  
 They think they are so evil.  
But God distinguishes between sin and me.  
And he sees sin as an outside force.  
And sees me as someone different from sin.  
So he says, don't let sin have dominion over you.  
All right?  
To let it rain, escape.  
 The second thing is that I have the authority to stop it from ringing in my body.  
I have the authority.  
Now that's remarkable.  
But then he gives us how?  


  
 Actually, the beautiful verses before what we just read from the 12th verse, we're going to go to them later on.  
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.  
Verse 13, he says,  


  
 I said, the word yield, I wanted you to market because in the King James uses the word yield.  
But in several other translations, the word present is better because the Greek is Paris to me.  
And Paris to me means to present.  
It's like taking your documents, all right?  
And you're going to that office for an interview and you present your document to be perused.  
 Okay, you present them.  
Or the someone who wants a job and then you ask that they present him to the board.  
So they bring him and present him to the board.  
You get it?  
Now that's what person me means.  
So it's not years like just, okay, here I am.  
No, it means a presentation.  
 All right?  
Are you still there?  
It is a presentation which means that it's something that I do.  
It is operative.  
It's something that I do.  
I choose to.  
For example, Jesus didn't become a lot of my life by just wishing that he would be.  
 I had to confess his logic over my life on a certain day.  
I had to say, I believe in my heart that God raised Jesus from the dead.  
I confess with my Mount Jesus Christ as Lord of my life.  
You get it?  
I had to come to a realization.  
 For me as an individual, though I was growing up that way, but at least I had to come to the knowledge sometime in my life that Jesus Christ was Lord of my life and confess Him that way.  
You see that?  
It wouldn't just happen.  
You're not going to be born again by just wishing you were.  
 You're not going to be born again by just liking God.  
You say, I like God, I like God, I like Christians.  
That's not going to make your Christian.  
You know, sometimes we tell people what Jesus said, you must be born again.  
They say, most I say, most I say this, most I do this, most I. They think they are clean.  
After I don't do any evil, I don't do bad things.  
So they are trusting in their goodness.  
 No, in salvation, there's a definite act.  
And in salvation, you have to receive it.  
Lambanu, it means you take it, you don't wait.  
It's not dikomai, you don't wait for somebody to put it there, you receive salvation.  
You see that?  
And now again, he shows us that  
 In present as heirs to God, there has to be a time in your life where you came to the realization that Jesus Christ is Lord of your life and that you belong to Him.  
Do you know not many Christians understand that yet?  
We'll come to that in a moment.  
That's why I'm sharing with you Christian consecration.  
What does it mean?  
What is Christian consecration?  
What is Christian consecration?  
 In 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and verse 20, the Scriptures declare, very clearly to us.  
Read it for me.  
I want you to see it yourself.  
Have you found it?  
What does it say?  
Again.  
Says he are bought with a price.  
 Come on here.  
No, come on.  
I was sharing the other evening when we were here to have an executive service here.  
I was sharing something with you that God doesn't exist for us.  
He doesn't live for us.  
We live for him.  
We exist for him.  
He's not out there for us.  
 Now, when the Bible says, if God be for us, you know, because a lot of people don't study, they just read.  
But the Bible says, if God be for us, I mean, God, God, God for us, no, that's not what it's saying.  
What it says is God be for us.  
Who can be against us?  
It means if God is back of us.  
Do you understand?  
That's what it's saying.  
Hallelujah.  
If God is my support,  
 If God is my strengthener, nobody can be against me successfully.  
That's what I say.  
But God doesn't live for us.  
We live for Him.  
He doesn't exist for us.  
So quit acting as though God exists for you.  
You there?  
 Now, you know, it's very easy for us to write out a list of things we want God to do for us.  
You know, I've got this prayer request.  
We want God to do this and to do that and to do that in the family and in the job and the finances and in this and in that and that and that.  
We got a long list.  
Have you ever sat down, taken a pin and a paper for yourself to say, what are those things that God wants me to do when you grow up?  
That's what you'd be doing.  
 When you're a baby and a father, buy me a brain, buy me.  
That's a baby.  
Daddy's going out and the little kid comes up.  
Daddy, buy me a football.  
 Buy me shoes.  
Buy me.  
Buy me.  
Bring me.  
Get me.  
I need a phone.  
I want this.  
I want that.  
What does daddy say?  
All right, all right, all right.  
Get it for you.  
When he turns 15, he don't tell you, buy me this.  
You tell him what to do when you're going out.  
Clean that and clean that and you wash that and you wash that when I come back I check it.  
That's it.  
 Things change as to who gives the instructions.  
How are you still there?  
When you've just been born again, five years.  
I asked the Lord to do this from me.  
I asked the Lord.  
You had the Lord.  
You don't know Him yet.  
The Lord.  
When you know Him as Lord, do you stop calling the Lord?  
I told God, I told God, this job belongs to me.  
You told God.  
Are you all right?  
 Do you know who God is?  
I told God.  
I told God this job is mine.  
I told God I'm marrying that man.  
I told God I'm marrying that man.  
You told God.  
You haven't seen anything yet.  
You are not afraid to tell God.  
You're telling me.  
No, when you're not God, you will stop telling him.  
You say, oh Lord, you will be humble.  


  
 Now I see people praying and telling, he never, this ones have not seen anything yet.  
Moses said, I accidentally fee and tremble when he saw the presence of God.  
Now when you meet him, every strand of hair from your head to your feet will stand like this.  
 I tell people, when you see Jesus, your knees will buckle.  
Hallelujah.  
A man in Trinidad hated everything about Jesus.  
Wouldn't let his wife go to church.  
And there's a crusade just close by.  
 And he was looking through his window, angrily, and saying, what are all this people doing here again that disturbing everywhere?  
His wife had gone for the meeting.  
He was so angry.  
Why he was looking through the window?  
He decided he was going to look for his wife and bring that stupid rascal home.  
Well, he got there.  


  
 Every time you heard, Jesus, then suddenly, they heard somebody screaming, ah, ah, ah, ah, the airport tells me, what is it?  
He's real, he's real, he's real, he's real, he's real, he's real, what happened?  
I saw him, I saw him, I saw him, I saw him, what happened?  
Jesus stood right in front of him.  
He saw Jesus.  
 and the Master let him know he was forgiven of his sins.  
But he couldn't, he couldn't keep quiet.  
He shouted and shouted and shouted for joy, for excitement.  
Now he wanted to tell the whole world, Jesus is real.  
I saw him.  
He became the witness for the night.  
He hated God and hated Jesus so much.  
But now he was the one that brought him off the platform.  
He was telling everybody, he's real, he's real, he's real.  
 You don't have to wait till dead.  
He is real, brother.  
Hallelujah.  
He is real, sure real.  
Praise God.  
So he says to present yourself.  
Now in that 13th verse, neither you do your members.  
He's talking about the members of your body, all right?  
 the members of your body.  
Neither you do your members as instruments of righteousness on the same, but present yourselves unto God, present yourselves unto God.  
And we read in that first verse, verse 20, where he says, He abot with the price.  
He abot with the price.  
I want to know from you, how many of you  
 have found out that you were bought by Jesus.  
You know, we think He saved us like, you know, I was drowning in sin and Jesus came with a rope and pulled me out.  
No, sir.  
No, no, no.  
That's a terrible illustration of salvation.  
They're not the same.  
 I was deep in sin, like a man that was down in there, and Jesus came and brought me out.  
No, a thousand times, no!  
That's the illustration of salvation from Christ.  
I want to tell you what a better illustration of that is if you want to use a drowning man.  
 It's a man who was condemned to death for his wrongs and was putting there to die.  
Legally, he was supposed to die.  
He was not just a drowning man, he was a man to be drowned.  
And Jesus came and said, I'll take his place.  
 He didn't throw down a rope.  
He didn't try to send in divers.  
He didn't swim in there to bring you out.  
No, He took your place of condemnation.  
Do you understand?  
Jesus took our place, our place of condemnation.  
That's what He did for us.  
 So when you talk about salvation, you're not talking about a man who saved you from something, you know, by just doing something.  
No, he saved you by giving himself in your place so that you could go free and he would be condemned in your place.  
That's salvation from Christ.  
You've got to understand it.  
That's why it's serious business.  
 because the man died for you, and then there you are, live in your own life, the way you want to live.  
How can God accept it?  
Because you see, to accept salvation from Christ means that you accept that He took your place, and now you must live for Him.  
That's the choice.  
Otherwise, that salvation is not yours.  
 To accept it means that you accept only to live the life that He has given you to live.  
Second Corinthians chapter 5.  
 No, we think that when we come here to dedicate a child to God, and we all stand here in the Pastor Caesar, you know, to take the baby and pray over the baby, and then you want to take to bring up this child and not share the Lord, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
You say, yes, I do, okay, then we'll pray.  
You think that's all.  
It's more than that.  
Second Corinthians chapter five.  
Read verse 14 for me.  


  
 Sorry, I don't know what you're saying.  
Go on, 15.  
Good.  


  
 Now, you say it's for the love of Christ, constrain it us.  
Because with us, George, that if one died for all, then we're all dead.  
In other words, if he died for us, it means we all died.  
Because he did it in our place.  
 In other words, if one paid for our, then we all paid.  
If we were all owing something, and somebody came and paid the debt for us, it would be wrong for anybody to hold us as debt us anymore.  
Because somebody paid for us, that means we are free.  
Because the man paid my house rent.  
Are you getting it now?  
Are you getting it now?  
Good.  
The 15th verse says,  
 Read that 15 verse.  
I want you to catch something.  


  
That's it.  
He says, and that he died for all.  
He died for everybody, that there which live should not hencefot from now on.  
 There which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him, which died for them and rose again.  
In other words, your life now must be lived for him.  
You can live for yourself anymore.  
See, it's not Christianity to make your own choices.  
I love a Chinese brother many years ago.  
 The beautiful story about him and many Christians around the world got to hear about it and it's on a beautiful testament, a beautiful expression of our consecration to God.  
He was traveling on a train and three gentlemen wanted to play a game.  
 And they required a fourth person because it took four people to play the game.  
So they got to him and said, excuse me, do you mind playing this game with us?  
You know, they wanted him to join them.  
Then he said, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't come with my hands.  
They never heard anything like that before.  
You what?  
 He said, I didn't come with my hands.  
They looked at him.  
He seemed complete to them.  
Is something wrong or?  
He said, no, no, nothing is wrong.  
I don't have my hands with me.  
I said, what about these ones?  
I said, they're not mine.  
They thought, this is the biggest fool in the trade.  
 You know, they thought he was the biggest fool, but he didn't look like a fool, so they thought, he said, everything all right?  
He said, I can explain.  
Then they sat down and he explained to them the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
He said, I'm brought with the price.  
Now I belong to Jesus.  
I only use my hands for the things that he wants.  
He said, these hands now belong to him.  
 They only do the things that he wants done.  
Come on somebody.  
I like that.  
I like that.  
I didn't come with my hands.  
Oh God.  
What a thought.  
What a thought.  
What a thought.  
What a thought.  
What a thought.  
 You're brought with the price.  
You belong to God, not to yourself.  
Now he says, you are not your own.  
You are not your own.  
Have you ever thought about that?  
That's what salvation is all about.  
There is a lot of folks.  
 who are the lives are confused.  
You can't, I mean, you'd be amazed if God were to show us the content of the prayer of a lot of people.  
You understand what they're going through.  
But it's not supposed to be that way.  
I just found out a matter of time.  
Well, glory to God.  
 Oh, lift your hands toward Him.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory.  
Blessed be God.  
Blessed be the most high God who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.  
 He's changed our lives, filled us with the Holy Ghost.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
We worship you.  
We praise your glorious name.  
Hallelujah.  
We praise your glorious name.
