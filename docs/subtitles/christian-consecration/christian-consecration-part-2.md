title: Christian Consecration Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Mabel is yours.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Are you ready for this?  
The Book of Romans.  


  
I've started sharing a new set of teachings and series of teachings called this Christian consecration.  
Christian consecration.  


  
 In Romans chapter number six, reading from verse six, knowing this, I think that when I see a word like that,  
 I don't think anybody starts an important statement with the word knowing.  
There must be a connection somewhere.  
Looks like he's been talking about something that I would like to know about.  
So let's go to verse 1.  
So we'll read from verse 1, chapter 6, Book of Romans.  
What shall we say then?  
 Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?  
God forbid, how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?  
I want you to notice what he's saying.  
How is this?  
Shall we, this grace?  
The grace of God has been bestowed on us, lavished on us.  
 He says, but now that we know that shall we continue in sin that grace may continue to work, this is God forbid.  
How shall we that are dead to sin?  
What a description.  
We that are dead to sin.  
In other words, if you're born again, he says, you're dead to sin.  
It's either real or unreal or it is real.  
 How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer bearing?  
No, he not.  
That so many of us, as we baptized into Jesus Christ, we baptized into his death.  
Strong statements.  
 These are strong statements, I'm telling you.  
Strong, strong statements.  
He says, don't you know?  
There are many of us, as we baptize into Jesus Christ, we baptize into His death.  


  
I want to know from you, how many of you have been baptized in water?  
 You've been baptized in water?  
Do you know the meaning of that?  
You can't go back to the world.  
It's death sentence to go back to the world after you're baptized.  
You dance.  
You know, some people say, well, they ask the question, what about this in compulsory?  
 Some say, well, if you can be baptized, if you can't, no problem.  
You better be.  
You better be because the final separation from the world is water baptism.  


  
If God be baptized in water,  
 But the Bible clearly tells us that baptism, what aboutism, doesn't save you?  
Why?  
Because it is the man that has received salvation that is baptized.  
So if you are baptized without receiving salvation, you are not saved.  
It's as simple as that.  
So when you receive salvation,  
 That means to be born again.  
Then you get baptized.  
It's like saying, doing Christian things will not save you.  
But if you are a Christian, you have to live a Christian life.  
You do Christian things.  
 Like you go to church, for example, you pray in the name of Jesus, you study the Bible, these are all good works.  
But they will not save you.  
But if you are a Christian, you must do them.  
You get it?  
That's the point.  
So what aboutism doesn't save you?  
But like every other major thing in the Word of God that Christians ought to do,  
 And those things will help them answer a good conscience.  
Same thing word about Jesus instructed it, you better do it.  
So he says, no, you know that so many of us, as we baptize into Jesus Christ, we're baptized into his death.  
 Therefore, we are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.  
He says, we were buried with him by baptism into death.  
We were buried with Christ.  
 Like he was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father.  
He was raised from the dead.  
We also should walk in newness of life.  
That's powerful.  
Oh, that's powerful.  
 So this is, therefore we are buried with him by baptism in the death that like us, Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in units of life.  
For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection.  
No win.  
No win.  
That our old man,  
 He's crucified with him.  
Reminds me of the little story I heard years ago about a certain gentleman, a certain preacher who read this and said, now I see.  
He said, now I found out who Paul's daddy was.  
He said, Paul's daddy, he said, yes, I found out about him.  
 Because Paul wrote this, you see, he wrote it to the Romans.  
So he said, I found out, Paul's daddy.  
So who was Paul's daddy?  
He said, it was the thief that was crucified with Christ.  
They said, how did you find that out?  
He said, Paul said, my old man was crucified with Christ.  


  
So you see, language, language can change anything.  
 Because a lot of people, you know, they call their father, my old man is at home.  
So how's your old man?  
So he's fine.  
So now he reads Paul saying, no one is that our old man is crucified.  
No, Paul's old man is crucified Jesus.  
All right, well, your old man here refers not to your daddy.  
Are you hearing me?  
As it refers to your old nature, the man you used to be before you were born again.  
 Hallelujah.  
The man you were before you were born again.  
That's the old man, the old nature.  
Say, God, He shows us that we are not what we used to be.  
Now, He's not talking about our attitude, our behavior, the things we do.  
That's not what He's talking about.  
All of that depends on who you are.  
 He says, the man you used to be is dead.  
You know, if you, many of you are young Christians, that means new Christians, okay?  
In other words, you were born again maybe within the last 15 years, that's new.  


  
 You understand?  
Yeah, you were born again within the last 15 years, that's new.  
So you may not be acquainted with some things that used to happen among Christians and some of the old doctrines they used to preach.  
They still have some of them today.  
 like the dual nature teaching, where they say that the Christian has two natures.  
He has the old nature and he has the new nature.  
He got the two natures.  
So if he yields to the old nature, he'll do the bad things.  
And if he yields to the new nature, he'll do the good things.  
So he got these two natures in him.  
Well, that's nonsense.  
He doesn't have two natures.  
We just read one.  
 that our old nature was crucified with him.  
Old nature's dead.  
He's not hiding somewhere.  
Somebody said, well, you know that there can be a resurrection.  
Every time you are tinted, the old nature is rising again, rising from the dead.  
He doesn't have the power of resurrection.  
 How could your old nature be rising again?  
Where did they get that doctrine from?  
They got those doctrines from their personal experiences.  
You see, they believed at one time that everything was all right, the new creatures in Christ Jesus, and then suddenly they found themselves tempted to do the same things they used to do.  
And they said, oh, oh, I thought it was gone.  
Looks like what I used to do is back.  
It looks like, you know, so they're going to these struggles in life.  
 that tell them, you're not really different from what you were before.  
So they think, okay, now I understand.  
There's the old one and there's the new one.  
I got the old one, so sin is still really in me.  
When I eat it, then it comes out.  
So the doctrine is based on their experience, not on the Word of God.  
Something's wrong with that.  
Something's wrong with that.  
 You still there?  
Some wrong with that.  
The accurate teaching of the Word of God is what we need.  
There's where light comes from.  
There's where strength comes from.  
Hallelujah.  
But let's read on.  
He says, knowing this.  
 Not assuming this, knowing this.  
Now, when God says to know something, He's telling you that that thing is real.  
Hallelujah.  
It's real.  
It's provable.  
It's real.  
You don't know something that's not real.  
If it's not real, you don't know that it exists because it's not real.  
You can assume it's there.  
 You can't know it if it's not there.  
Alleluia.  
So says, knowing this, there are old manners crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed.  
 that his thought we should not serve sin in this wonderful.  
This is knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin is talking about the physical body, this physical body that dictated for us, that led us in sin.  
 Because, you see, when man fell, he became subject to his senses.  
His senses ruled him.  
That's why he's called Kannal, ruled by his natural senses, ruled by his body.  
Another term to describe the Kannal man is body root, his body root.  
 How's the body ruled?  
Ruled by his natural senses.  
What his senses tell him?  
If he feels that way, he says it's that way.  
Life is based on whatever his senses tell him.  
And you know most people in the world today are that way.  
They live according to their senses.  
And the Bible says if you live according to your senses, you're not a child of God.  
That's what the Bible says.  
 This is day that are in the flesh.  
These are not the children of God.  
You read that in Romans 9 verse 8.  
That's what it says.  
So these are not the children of God.  
See?  
The children of God walk by the Spirit, not by the senses.  
 So he says that our old man has been crucified, the old nature has been crucified so that the body that dominated us would have its authority over our spirits broken.  
Because now there's a new man in Christ and this new man is superior to sin and superior to Satan and is not subject to the body.  
 Oh, this is wonderful.  
You would see it now.  
Come on, you with me?  
For he, oh boy, verse seven, he that is dead is freed from sin.  
What do you mean he that is dead is freed from sin?  
What happened when we died with Christ?  
 We were free from sin.  
I've told you several times, this stuff about redemption.  
And I don't mean this critically because I know that all around the world, there are ministries that are called redemption ministries, redeem us ministries, redeemed ministries, all of that.  
But the truth is this.  
The truth is this.  
The Christian is not the redeemed man.  
 I don't know why.  
It's so easy to study the Bible.  
It's like what I said about Pentecostalism the other day.  
And I said, there's only one reason I'm not a Pentecostal.  
I said, because when you study the Bible, those who were celebrating Pentecost did not receive the Holy Spirit.  
But it's a contradiction.  
 And irony, we find that the Pentecosters, when you ask them, what is the meaning of Pentecosters?  
Who are Pentecosters?  
They would say the Pentecosters are those who believe in the Holy Spirit and speaking tongues.  
But when you open the Bible, those who received the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost were not celebrating Pentecost.  
They were in the upper room.  
All the people outside who were celebrating Pentecost did not receive the Holy Spirit.  
It's a contradiction.  
 Somebody started it and everybody accepted it.  
So he said, where are you?  
What Christian denominations?  
I'm a Pentecostal.  
Why?  
Because I believe in Holy Ghost and talking in tongues.  
What does Baba say about Pentecost?  


  
They don't know.  
Christians never celebrated Pentecost.  
 They never did.  
It was a Jewish fist and has nothing to do with Christianity.  
So throughout the New Testament, you don't find Christians celebrating Pentecost.  
So on the day of Pentecost, the only Christians there were on that day were in the upper room, locked up for fear, while others celebrated Pentecost.  
 and the Holy Spirit came upon them.  
It didn't come upon the Pentecostals.  
It came upon those who were separated from Pentecost.  
You see it?  
But you know, when something has been in office for a long time, I told you it doesn't make it true.  
But there are people who will stay with it.  
They'll rather die with it.  
 Hold on to it, because it threatens their security, you see.  
There are lots of stuff, lots of things.  
I've told you, that's why you need to know the Bible for yourself.  
Yeshua.  
See.  


  
Wonderful.  
 When He died, we died with Him, Jesus Christ.  
We were there in His death.  
So He says, He that is dead is freed from sin.  
So I said, notice Paul has just made it clean, pure, simple.  
What's he telling us?  
 Death could have been all that was necessary to free us from our sins.  
If salvation were all about salvation from sin, Jesus didn't need to rise from the dead.  
His death was enough.  
That freed us.  
That paid for all of our sins.  
That's redemption.  
But that's not Christianity.  
See the difference?  
That's a policy.  
 Redemption is to save a man by paying a price.  
So Jesus paid the price with his own life.  
He died for us that we might be saved.  
But that is not Christianity.  
Christianity, listen, Christianity or a Christian is not the man that was redeemed.  
Redemption does not produce Christianity.  
 The Christian is not the man that Christ died for.  
Christianity.  
Hello?  
Christianity.  
Hey, look at it this way.  
When Jesus hung on that cross, when he hung there and they looked at him,  
 In the mind of justice, in the mind of Papa God, we were all hanging on that trust there.  
We were there.  
As Jesus was there, we were in Him.  
He was our representative.  
Then He tried out.  
It is finished.  
 and gave up the ghost, he died.  
When he died, in the mind of God, because he was our representative, we died.  
Then he was brought down from the cross and buried.  
When he was buried, we were buried.  
Now, when Jesus said, it is finished, all was paid.  
 He had taken our sins upon Himself.  
We were free.  
Then He died.  
That man, the day Jesus died, everybody could have been singing the song.  
I am redeemed.  
I am redeemed.  
I am redeemed.  
I am redeemed.  
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He had redeemed from the hand of the enemy.  
We could have been singing.  
Everybody could have been singing.  
When He died, there were free from their sins.  
 because Jesus bore their sins and went to hell.  
You see that?  
That's all that was necessary.  
That's redemption.  
But you know what?  
Here is the big thing.  
Here is what the angels didn't see.  


  
As for the purposes, the angels still marvel at it.  
 and seek to look into it.  
He was what Satan didn't see.  


  
When, look, look, look, when God raised Jesus from the dead, there was Christianity.  
 began from.  
I'll tell you what happened.  
When God raised Jesus from the dead, he was no more redemption.  
A new life had begun.  
When Jesus was raised from the dead, the Bible says we were raised together with him.  
 He says, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation.  
Now here is the big thing.  
To be born again, what does it require?  
He says nothing about the death.  
Romans chapter 10, verse 9.  
If thou shall confess with thy mouth, the Lord Jesus, believing in your heart that God raised him from the dead.  
 Thou shalt be saved.  
Salvation comes by believing in the resurrection and confessing the logic of Jesus.  
Can you see it?  
That's how salvation comes.  
So who is a Christian?  
A Christian is that man that identifies with a resurrected Christ.  
 And who is he?  
He has no pasts.  
The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5 or 17, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation.  
That means he's a new species.  
That means he's a new kind of man.  
 That's why he says in James chapter 1 verse 18, of his own will begot he us by the word of truth that we should be a kind.  
As a boy, a kind of fast fruits of his creatures.  
So we are a new type of men.  
We are new creations.  
So that's what came out of the redemption.  
So the redemption was settled with the debt of Jesus.  
 Christianity comes from the resurrection, a new life.  
Are you hearing me?  
So, we died with him.  
That's part of says, if we believe that we died with him, it says, we ought to know that we should live with him.  
So, what is the big thing about Christianity?  
That's who will come in the evening.  
Let's go into this.  
 Let's finish reading this.  
Look at verse nine, you like this one.  
No, verse eight.  
Now, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him.  
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, diet no more.  
Dead have no more dominion over Him.  
Hey, hey, look, look where we're going.  
This is marvelous.  
This is marvelous.  
Verse nine.  
 knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, died no more.  
Listen, Christ, being raised from the dead, died no more.  
He says, death had no more dominion over him.  
I told you something.  
I said, every time you read about Christ,  
 you get to know yourself.  
Because we are in Him.  
You see that?  
He never talks to us about Christ without showing us who we are.  
What is the Bible for?  
He gave us the Scriptures to inform us of His own mind so we can understand the mind of God.  
Without the Scriptures you cannot know the mind of God.  
You need the Scriptures to know His mind.  
 Now this is God's mind.  
He says, Christ, haven't died, will not die again.  
Did you hear that?  
Now look at it.  
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, died no more.  
Death had no more dominion over him, for in that he died,  
 He died unto sin once.  
Haiah.  
Oh, thank you, Holy Spirit.  
But in that he leaveth, he leaveth unto God.  
He died unto sin once, and God raised him up.  
He died unto sin once because he was made sin for us.  
 He was made seen on our behalf.  
So he died unto sin.  
He paid that price once.  
And haven't been raised from the dead.  
The Bible says he will die no more.  
Death had no more dominion over him.  
What does he tell us to do about that?  
He says to know it.  
 All right?  
We should know it.  
It should be what?  
Revelation knowledge.  
Because you were not there.  
So it's not sense knowledge.  
It's not that we saw it.  
We didn't see him when he died.  
We were not there.  
We didn't touch him when he walked this earth.  
So he's not talking about sense knowledge.  
He's talking about revelation knowledge.  
Revelation knowledge.  
 I know that I know that I know that Christ Jesus died for me.  
I know that he was buried for me.  
I know that God raised him from the dead.  
I know it.  
I know it more than I know my name.  
I know it.  
I know it.  
Knowing this, that Christ being raised from the dead, diets no more.  
Death hath no more dominion over him.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 For in that He died, verse 10, He died unto sin once.  
But in that He liveeth, He liveeth unto God.  
He liveeth unto God.  
He died unto sin once.  
He liveeth unto God.  
He died unto sin once.  
He liveeth unto God.  
What does that mean?  
He liveeth unto God.  
 That means his whole life belongs to God.  
He lives for God.  
He lives unto God.  
He lives unto the purposes of God.  
He has no more life of his own.  
He lives unto the purposes of God.  
Are you hearing what I'm reading to you?  
He lives unto God.  
He has no life of his own anymore.  
He died unto sin once.  
Now that he lives, because God raised him from the dead, he lives unto God, who raised him from the dead.  


  
 Watch this now.  
Verse 11, read that word, one word.  
Again.  
Again.  
That means in the same way.  


  
In the same way.  
 as Christ has been taken to have died unto sin once and have been raised from the dead to live unto God.  
He says, likewise, recon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Is this a recon?  
Count it to be so.  
 He says, count it to be sold.  
Now, if I have $200 here, and I count one, two, three, four, $200, all right, and I have it here in cash, then I say, hey, write it down, I have $200.  
 If I write $300, would that be good reckoning?  
If I write $100, would that be good reckoning?  
Correct reckoning is right, $200.  
So he says, write it down, count it, I count it to be so.  
And God is very concerned about correct accounting.  
That's why you wrote books.  
Read your Bible.  
 So he says, recon ye also yourselves, counted to be so.  
Ah, ah, that means, what is God going to look at?  
The records.  
What do the records say?  
I mean, it doesn't matter what somebody's telling you, when it comes to finances, we're dealing with records here.  
We say, what do the records say, man?  
So, what do the records say?  
Well, from the records, this man died.  
 Yeah, but I didn't feel it.  
Nothing to do with your feeling.  
The record says you're tired.  
God says, accounted to be so.  
That you died unto sin.  
 He didn't say that you should die to sin, you know, years ago.  
That's one of those things that's, you know, all Christians you tell us.  
They say, die to self.  
Okay, let us die to self.  
Everybody die to self.  
Brown doesn't talk about dying to self.  
Brown says, you died to sin.  
And then say, you should die to sin.  
He says, when people have not yet died to sin, you have to die to sin today.  
No, no, no, no.  
He says, counting that you died to sin.  
He didn't say counting that you are going to.  
No, it's not a debt you're going to pay.  
He says, it has, oh my goodness.  
 This happened already!  
Reconyts!  
Counties!  
Write it down!  
A county to be so!  
Are you still there, somebody?  
 Likewise, reckon he also yourselves to be dead indeed on the scene, but alive unto God, alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord, alive unto God.  
Oh my goodness, that means the life that I live now has to be unto God.  
I live now unto God.  
I'm alive unto God.  
 Oh boy, is that what God sees about me?  
Yes.  
He says, your life belongs to God.  
Now you live unto God.  
You were dead, but now you're alive.  
You die.  
Now you're alive.  
You're not dead.  
No, you're alive.  
You're alive to God.  
Dead to sin.  
Alive to God.  
Dead to sin.  
Alive to God.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
I'm alive to God.  
I'm alive to God.  
 I'm alive to God."  
You see, because I'm alive to God, I can hear God.  
Because I'm alive to God, He's real to me.  
Because I'm alive to God, I know what God is doing.  
I know what God is saying.  
I know the will of God for my life.  
Come on, shout amen to God.  
I'm alive to God.  
Oh, glory to God.  
There's a lot of people who are not alive to God.  
 They are live to sin and dead to God.  
Should they don't hear the voice of God?  
When we talk about hearing God, they say, are you saying you hear God or money?  
Yes, I said so because I'm alive to God.  
I'm alive to God.  
Hallelujah.  
That's my place.  
That's my realm of life.  
I'm alive to God.  
Glory to God.  
How are you alive to God?  
 My new mind.  
I'm alive to God.  
Thank your Lord Jesus.  
I'm alive to God.  
See, when you're not alive to God, something happens in your life, you're thinking, well, where can we get help?  
You see, you're not alive to God.  
So then, where can we get help?  
That's the first thing that comes to you.  
You think, where can we get help?  
So you pick up your telephone and you call somebody,  
 Do we have any connection?  
Do you know somebody?  
Can we come alive to God?  
Come alive to God.  


  
 You know, some are looking, checking his head over somebody who's got some terrible situation.  
Maybe it's cancer, maybe it's a terminal disease and looks, well, we'll get the best doctors in the world.  
I'll call some doctors in America.  
There's a, yeah, I'm gonna call, you call all the doctors you can.  
Things may not change.  
There's one doctor you can call and you can be sure of everything.  
Hallelujah.  
 Somebody say, Hallelujah.  
I'm alive to God.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm alive to God.  
That's what Abraham knew.  
He knew the reality of the kingdom that ruled over the censoring.  
He knew about it.  
When Lot was chosen Sodom, the Valley of Sodom,  
 Abraham didn't care about it.  
He didn't care about it.  
Why?  
He had the spirit of faith.  
He had the spirit of faith.  
He could see what others couldn't see.  
All that Lot saw was the greenness of the valley, but couldn't see the future.  
But Abraham saw the future.  
Hallelujah.  
How did he end up?  
 Abraham ended up big.  
Lot ended up in the cave.  
Praise the Lord.  
All right, now here's another one.  
Verse 12, let not seem therefore reigning your mortal body that he should obey it in the lost thereof.  
See that?  
He says, now, hey, you're alive to God.  
You can stop sin from reigning in your body.  
 See that?  
You can.  
The Christian.  
There are only two things that make a Christian sing.  
And now you want to hear.  
Really want to hear?  
The only two things that make a Christian sing.  


  
 Hi.  
Two things that make a Christian scene.  
I've originally done that.  
Now, because it's so important that I've got to inject it, right?  
But I know when I say it, you're going to, oh, I thought I knew that before.  
The two things that make a Christian scene, nothing else.  
 Number one, selfishness.  
And what is the cure for?  
Oh boy, that's why I love John.  
John said, he said the Christian cannot sing.  
Now most Christians have a problem with that.  
They say, oh, how can you say that the Christian will not sing here?  
Because they are Christians and they are singing.  
 And they have tried to stop, so you see, they can understand that.  
But because they don't understand what sin is.  
If they understood what sin was, things that have been different.  
But here, number one is selfishness.  
And what's the cure for that?  
It has come already.  
The law of God, Romans 5, the law of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.  
If you walk in love, you will not sin.  
 You cannot walk in love and selfishness at the same time.  
Love is the solution.  
Can you see that?  
Nothing done in love could be sinned.  


  
There's a difference between human love and God's love.  
Agape, the love of God, and filio.  
 brotherly love.  
They're not the same.  


  
The love of God is a self-given love.  
The love of God is an outworking of God in you.  
Full of compassion.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Glory to God.  
Glory to God.  
 It is the full of compassion.  
It is the expression of Christ Himself.  
The Bible says, God is love.  
He that love it not, know it not God, for God is love.  
You know, I tell you something, when you are full of God, this past two weeks or so, we're sharing on the fullness of God, all right?  
And you know, when you are so full of God, it comes out of your eyes, the love of liquid love flowing out of you.  
 Yeah, that's what God wants.  
That's what God wants.  
You can't walk in love and sing at the same time.  
Nothing done in love could be seen.  
Second thing, that causes men to sing.  
I said, there are only two things.  
You studied the whole Bible, only two things.  
Selfishness?  
 So anything down in selfishness is seen.  
See that?  
The second thing is fear.  
Fear causes us to sing.  
Even when you're doing right, fear can cause you to sing.  
Let me give an example.  
Hey, listen.  
Here's a guy.  
 He lives maybe with his parents or guardians or among his strengths and he knows they don't like him to go to church.  
So he sneaks the church, attends the service, he loves everything, comes back home and is away coming from.  
I went to, did you go to church?  
No.  
 You see, he lied.  
Why did he lie?  
Because he wanted to lie?  
No.  
He lied.  
Because he did something wrong?  
No.  
He lied not because he did something wrong.  
But you see, in the mind of those other people, it is wrong.  
And if he tells them that he went to church, which in their minds is wrong, he'll get in trouble.  
So for fear of them, he says, I didn't go there.  
See that?  
 What cost is sin?  
Fear.  
And when you study the Bible all the time, from the Old Testament into the New, all the time when God showed up or sent an angel to show up and bring a message to somebody, first thing, fear not.  
God never wants us to fear.  
Because fear makes us to live a life that is less than God wants us to live.  
 Because, you know, we're afraid of people.  
We're afraid of what they think about us.  
We're afraid of what they might say about us.  
We're afraid that they might ostracize us.  
We're afraid.  
Because we want to be identified with them.  
And they don't even want us.  
And we don't know it.  
It was struggling and pain heavily just to be identified with them.  
 So we say all kinds of things and do all kinds of things just to be accepted, because we're afraid.  
He don't need to be afraid.  
And you know, I love what Paul says.  
 that God will soon bruise and under your feet.  
Now, he was looking at it from the standpoint of the struggle that those folks will have it.  
He says, don't worry.  
Everything will be all right soon.  
Like you're free.  
Then I kick you out of the house.  
If they kick you out of the house, where you gonna go?  
 See, why, you're afraid.  
You don't know where you might be saying to them, I kick you out.  
But soon, because you're growing and your fate is increasing.  
So God knows what you're going through.  
Your fate is increasing.  
One day you make you so strong and you have the boldness to stand to anybody.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
So that's what God is merciful.  
 I hear me.  
Now when you swindle somebody, when you steal money from somebody, it's not because of fear, because of selfishness, greed, greed, selfishness.  
And why the selfishness is the faithlessness.  
You don't trust God.  
You are free.  
 Can you see that?  
That's what the Bible says.  
So you put those two together, love and faith.  
If you walk in love and live by faith, you cannot sing.  
Nothing you could do would ever be seen.  
Working in love and living by faith.  
It is impossible to sing in that condition.  
 Now, I'm not saying that some people will not say that what you did was wrong, because that's as far as they're concerned, because they like to accuse you with their own mind.  
But what does God say anyway?  
That's what matters.  
Are you still there?  
So God sees it matters.  
Oh, glory to God, glory, glory, glory, glory.  
Just one more point, just one more point.  
Are you still here?  
 Now, verse, we took verse 12, right?  
All right, read verse 13 for me.  


  
What in the world are you saying?  


  
 He says, neither yield, yield your members as instruments of righteousness on the sin, but yield yourselves in the God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness on to God.  
The 14th verse, everybody read that.  


  
For sin shall not have dominion over you.  
 Glory to God.  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Oh, this is wonderful.  
It says to yield yourself unto God.  
The right word is to present yourself unto God, to present yourself unto God, to present yourself unto God as those that are alive.  
Do you see that there?  
 as those that are alive from the dead.  
See, we cannot give to God what He hasn't chosen.  
Now, remember that.  
We cannot give to God what He hasn't chosen.  
He says for us to present as heirs to Him, present as heirs.  


  
 to present as errors, to God.  
Why?  
Two things.  
We read about Jesus that haven't been raised from the dead.  
He's not gonna die anymore, right?  
And that in that he died to sin, he died unto sin once.  
But in that he lives, he lives unto God.  
 Now, we also have been asked to live unto God, present as theirs, and live unto God.  
What does this mean?  
What does it mean?  
What is it saying?  
1 Corinthians chapter 6.  
1 Corinthians chapter 6, read verse 20.  


  
 Begin.  


  
Thank you.  
Read Acts 20.  
Verse 28.  


  
 That is serious.  
In the first one, in the 20th verse of the 6th chapter of 1 Corinthians, you read that you abot with the price.  
Listen, listen, listen.  
He didn't save you by doing something to save you, reaching out of hand to pick you out of the fire,  
 or are making an effort to pull you out of the water.  
He didn't save you by such an effort.  
He took your place of condemnation.  
He died in your place.  
 I want you to understand the salvation from Christ is not that He did something to bring you out of sin.  
He didn't listen.  
He didn't do something to bring you out of sin.  
Tell somebody God didn't do something to bring you out of sin.  
Say it was not to bring you out of sin.  
He died in your place of sin.  
 your place of condemnation.  
We need to understand it.  
We need to comprehend it.  
The man actually died for me in my place.  
And so I found out about it and I accepted the new life that he gives.  
And when I did,  
 I was translated from the domain of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear son.  
Oh, glory to God.  
And I became a new creation.  
Praise the Lord.  
Are you still there?  
Now, this is very, very important.  
We're talking Christian consecration.  
 He says to us, you are bought with the price, bought.  
I want you to get that bought.  
Then you read in Acts 24, 28, about the church.  
All right, the flock of God, which he purchased.  
Are these anonymous?  
He bought you, he purchased you.  
 Listen, brothers and sisters, you are not your own.  
If somebody hadn't told you before, I'm telling you now, you got to hear it, you don't belong to yourself.  
When you join the army, they let you know you don't belong to your family anymore.  
The Americans are against the wall in Iraq by large numbers.  
 and many of them families, they got their sons and daughters at the front lines.  
Why can't they just simply say, honey, come back home, resign from the army?  
They don't resign from the army, brother.  
When you join the army, you don't resign.  
You haven't been told?  
Nobody resigns from the army.  
You never resign from the army.  
 It's not like you join any other company somewhere and say, I don't like what the boss did to me.  
I don't resign.  
I don't believe in this war.  
I'm going home.  
It doesn't work that way.  
You don't resign from the army.  
If they don't dismiss you, you can't go.  
There are only two ways to leave the army.  
Get dismissed, or die.  
 You can't, listen, you can't retire from the army.  
You don't send in your papers to retire.  
They either retire you or you have to die to be out of the army.  
There's no other way.  


  
 It is just nothing to do with, I don't like this place they're sending us to.  
Are they sending us to Iraq, hate going there?  
No, Afghanistan, no, I'm not going.  
You're going, why?  
Because when you sign those dotted lines, when you put your name there, you seize to be owned by your family, you became the property.  
 of the United States Navy or the Army or whichever one, you now belong to them.  
You became their property, the property of the government, the property.  


  
Did you hear me?  
You can't go home.  
This is home.  
Now you join the Army.  
This is home.  
 So you kiss mom and dad, listen, it was a dead sentence.  
I'm dying for my country if need be.  
You've signed it.  
You can't go back.  
I won't change that thing.  
Say, there's something I signed the other three years ago.  
I just want to amend it.  
No, no reconsiderations.  
He bought you with the price.  
 He Jesus bought you with the price.  
Listen, to me, this is not like they think scary.  
This is the most marvelous.  
I belong to the greatest, to the greatest God.  
Oh, come on to somebody.  
You know what it is to belong to one and only?  


  
It's one and only.  
Nobody can do me like Jesus.  
 Paul would write the letter and he would say, Paul, a bond slave of Jesus Christ.  
The Greek connotation was a love slave.  
In other words, I am enslaved to him, but in love with him.  
 I love slave.  
I'm enslaved to him.  
And I'm in love with him.  
I belong to him in love.  
I do what he wants me to do.  
Go away.  
He wants me to go.  
I belong to him.  
And it's with a whole heart.  
Glory to God.  
Are you still there?  
You know, it tells me something.  
Is it worth it?  
When I think about it, is it worth it?  
You know, for some people, it's time to like lean back in them.  
 Ah, how can somebody join something?  
They say, the person can't go home anymore.  
Is that not courtism?  
It looks like this is a court.  
Carl, it's what you hear.  
You ain't going anymore.  


  
Because you weren't told, you didn't know that Jesus became Lord of your spirit, your soul and your body.  
 Because you are not told.  
He owns you.  
He owns you own own.  
He owns you.  
He bought you.  
He purchased you.  
You belong to Him.  
He is your owner.  
No, every day you just wake up and go to wherever you like.  
Without knowing whether or not that's what He wants you to do.  
 I have told God that I have already told him, and that's what I'm going to do.  
I've told God, you, you've told God, you should understand.  
No, you've told God.  
I've told God, I've told him, I'm marrying on the 16th.  
Go on.  
Because you are a baby.  
He said, you are yet kinder.  
 When you're kind of ruled by your body, ruled by your senses, you told God.  
So you can tell him what you like.  
Wake up in the morning, Father, in the name of Jesus.  
I just want to remind you.  
Oh God, go and touch my uncle.  
Oh God, go and, go and.  


  
 That means you don't know him.  
It means you don't know him.  
What did Isaac call him?  
The fear of Isaac.  
Jacob called him the fear of Isaac.  
Do you know who he is?  


  
 He said, I am the first and the last.  
Get his description.  
Get his resume so you can understand.  
No, job, job, when job was suffering.  
He said, I have done nothing wrong.  
I can't understand why I'm going through all this.  
I can't understand what have I done.  
He was complaining.  
 What have I done?  
What have I done?  
Can somebody just be suffering like this?  
He was talking, he said, the day I meet God, I have questions for him.  
I have questions for God.  
Suddenly God spoke and said, who is this?  
He said, who is this that speaks words without knowledge?  
God said, do you know where darkness resides?  
 You know, God began to ask job questions.  
Question after question.  
When his intellect finally got completely paralyzed.  
He said, Oh God, I'd heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eyes see thee.  
I'll bore myself, I'll repent in dust and ashes.  
Yes.  
 He didn't know who he was talking about.  
Somebody says, it doesn't matter, all these things are saying, when I see God, I'm going to ask him questions.  
When you see him, you're mounted.  


  
Then you will know.  
Then you will know.  
Hallelujah.  
He's the first and the last.  
 the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.  
Hallelujah.  
He's that big.  
He's the only one who could describe himself like that.  
Jesus said, I am the way, the truth and the life, the life, the essence.  


  
He said, no man comes to the Father but by me.  
That's big.  
That's big.  
 Now he wants us to live onto him.  
The question is, is he worth it?  
Is he worth it?  


  
I find the story.  
I'll close with this.  
I find a story that's very touching to me.  
 in the world.  
It's recorded by Matthew Mac Luke.  
Did you have a read of the alabaster box?  
You sure?  
Okay.  
Let's take a look at it.  


  
You know, sometimes it's one of the most amazing thoughts.  


  
 I would like you to connect two parts.  
First, in St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 12.  


  
St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 12.  
Read from verse 1.  


  
 Read from verse 1, St.  
John chapter 12 from verse 1.  
Okay.  


  
 I just want you to get the setting.  
Have you gotten the setting?  
All right.  
He says from verse three, then took Mary a pound of ointment of Spagnard very costly.  
Say that with me, very costly.  
And anointed the feet of Jesus and what?  
His feet with her hair and the house was filled with the order of the ointment.  
 Then said one of his disciples, Judas is carried, Simon's son, which should betray him.  
Why was not this ointment sold for 300 pains and given to the poor?  
Did you see that?  
A woman came to where Jesus was.  
 and poured a very costly perfume.  
The Bible says the room was feared.  


  
Judas, I recognize that that's designer's perfume, I know it.  
The Judas was very sociable.  
 He said, why wasn't this thing sold?  
He knew the what?  
It's in Matthew 26.  


  
Are you there?  
From verse 6.  
Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,  
 There came unto him a woman, having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his hair as he sat at meat.  
But when his disciples saw it, now Matthew, Mark, and Luke were written before the Book of John.  
John mentioned that it was Judas,  
 that spoke up and convinced the others.  
He mentioned it.  
It was Judas.  
Judas spoke up.  
He said, who was he talking to?  
To the others.  
And they all agreed with him.  
Now watch.  
 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation.  
They were angry.  
They were upset.  
They were scared.  
Saying to what purpose is this waste.  


  
You know, as I studied the scripture, I realized that people are the same as the word in Jesus' name.  
 They're no different.  
This woman comes in and breaks the alabaster box of very costly perfume and pours it on Jesus.  
And the disciples get mad at her and he said, so what purpose is this West?  
So what purpose is this West?  


  
 Let's read verse 9.  
For this ointment might have been sold for so much and given to the poor.  
Stop there.  


  
So what purpose is this West?  


  
On Jesus?  
Then who is Jesus?  
That is the question.  
What is he worth?  


  
 That's a question.  
Who is Jesus?  
Evidently, they didn't know him.  
Who is Jesus?  
So, pouring this thing on Jesus was a West.  
They said, is to what purpose is this West?  
West?  
They said we could have, they didn't own it.  
It belonged to that woman.  
To what purpose is this West?  
 We could have sold it for so much.  
Another writer says, for 300 ordinary, very expensive.  
And we have given the money to the poor.  
John explains father to us.  
He said this, he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a treasurer and had the bag and often stole money out of it.  
Let's leave that for another this talk.  
It's true.  
I hung that one first.  
 So this perfume was wasted, poured on Jesus.  
It was a waste.  
It was wasted.  
It was a waste.  
We should have given the money to the poor.  
It was a waste.  
What is Jesus' worth?  
I think that's the fundamental question.  
What is he worth?  
Who is he?  
What is a waste?  
A waste is an investment that is much more.  
 that is required.  
When you give more than the value of a thing, then you see it's been wasted.  
So the issue here, the fundamental issue here is value.  
What was Jesus' worth?  
When you want to give somebody a present, you measure in your mind what you think he or she might appreciate, all right?  
So you have a sense of value.  
You have a sense of value.  
 Let's assume you wanted to send a car to the president of the Federal Republic.  
All right?  
Which car would you assume was a waste?  
Because he's the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  
So which car would you buy for him that you would call a waste?  
No, I'm coming.  
 Let's keep that in mind.  
Then you want to give a present to the man who watches your gate.  
You want to give him a car?  
Okay, which car would you think would be a waste?  
If you decided to give him a car, first of all, use a car to you already.  
Even that concentration is a waste.  
 You see, there are human beings, but you see, their sense of values are different.  
They all have their own sense of values.  
All right?  
So when you want to give, you think of the sense of value.  
So here, it's a matter of value.  
Jesus has this ointment poured on him and the disciples is toward purpose is this West.  
What did Jesus say?  
 Let's read.  


  
Verse 10, when Jesus understood it, He said unto them, why trouble ye the woman, for she had wrought a good work upon me.  
Jesus answered, Jesus said, what is done is good.  
Why did trouble her?  
 What she's done is good.  
You see, the disciples had a different way of measuring what was right or wrong.  
What was good or bad?  
That sense of value was different.  
He was Jesus.  
Jesus said what she's done is good.  
And who matters?  
Jesus.  
Jesus.  


  
 For ye have the poor always with you, but me, ye have not always."  
Do you see that?  
And that's very instructive.  
He said, the poor, you will always have with you.  
That's just that one.  
I'll refer to it another day.  
 The poor, you always have with you, but me, you have not always.  
For in that she had poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.  
Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached, in the whole world, there shall also this that this woman had done be told for a memorial of her.  


  
 Look what she got.  
I mean, look what she got.  
This is something the disciples would have wanted.  
Look what this woman got.  
There's no way they don't know Mary.  
Even where the countryside, all the names of the disciples of Jesus, everybody knows Mary.  
Hallelujah.  
 This is the lady.  
She poured this ointment on Jesus.  
This said it was a waste.  
Thank God she did it.  
Jesus said she came to do it early.  
She came to do it right on time.  
You can read about it in the other books in Mark and in Luke.  
And I already started sharing with you from John.  
So Jesus said she came to do it at the right time.  
 before my burial.  
She came to do it at the right time.  
Do you know there's a right time to do something?  
And there's a wrong time to do it.  
Let me give you an example.  
Some women at the resurrection day, resurrection morning.  
Hell in the morning.  
 because they couldn't announce Him before the time.  
But Mary listened to the Spirit, and suddenly she said she was going.  
If she had asked the permission from those disciples, they definitely would have stopped her.  
But she poured it, and then they found out about it.  
They said, who's doing this?  
Ah, that's me.  
How could you have done such a stupid thing?  
But Jesus said, hey, you don't know what's happening here.  
She did the right thing.  
Right time.  
 The other women who had the same knowing that they should have known this Jesus, Paul, what they have, their ointment on Jesus.  
But they didn't do it at the right time.  
And guess what?  
Did they ever get to do it?  
No.  
They never got to do it.  
He was only Mary who got to do it.  
They never got to do it.  
When they got to the grave, he was gone.  
 They never got to do it.  
It pays to do the right thing at the right time.  
They never got to do it.  
You know, there are some people who were even called into the ministry.  
Let me give you this part of it.  
Who were called into the ministry?  
And for some reason they didn't.  
Why?  
They wanted to pursue something first.  
They wanted to go for something else first.  
Then later on, they would come back and do it for God.  
And then,  
 Did they ever get the chance for most?  
No.  
No.  
It pays to know the voice of God when he speaks.  
It pays to know.  
Somebody said, I understand that you are a graduate of engineering and you are working in the ministry as a full-time something.  
Yes.  
What is this wist?  
 The same they haven't changed.  
It's a waste in their minds.  
It's a waste.  
For some people, they're there serving God.  
And you could have been better.  
I mean, I don't know how many times some of our singers I've heard from the devil telling them, hey, you could have been better out there.  
If you were singing these songs out there, you'd make a lot of money.  
 Because when you sing here, we don't pay you for it.  
We raise our hands and say, thank you, Jesus.  
So what is this waste?  
Say, I'm just wasting my talent in this place.  
Really?  
Really?  
Maybe.  
Maybe.  
 It depends on who you are like.  
Jesus, all those disciples in their own renewed minds, tempted by Judas' chariot.  
Judas' chariot led them into it.  
To what purpose is this waste?  
Your degree is too high for God.  
How can you be a Christian?  
 You know, somebody was made, was given a big position.  
He said, you know, I used to go to that church.  
But now with my new position, I don't think I should go to church like this.  
Is there any way of bringing service to the house?  
It's not a waste.  
It's too much.  
How can you go to church?  
No, you are too big.  
Because now you are, so and so, so.  
 You are so big now.  
How can you go to church?  
Because you have been given a high position.  
So the church will come to your house.  
It has become a waste to go.  
To what purpose is this waste?  
Because if I go there, you know, it's a paraphernalia of government.  
Everything will have to follow me.  
That there are about 16 of us.  
How can 16 of us?  
And they come from different churches.  
So how are we going to do it?  
Okay, can I bring the church to my house?  
I'm talking to you now.  
Change your ways.  
 Change your ways.  
To what purpose is this waste?  
Have you given to God and you heard that same voice?  
That it was a waste.  
It was a waste.  
A man said to me one time, somebody said to him, he asked that fellow, you don't give your tithes.  
He said, pastor, do you know how much that is?  
He said, but you're supposed to give your tithes.  
He said, if I gave you the money, you wouldn't know what to do with it.  
 Has it become so big that it is a waste to give it to God?  
Have you come to that point in your life?  
To what purpose is this waste?  
I don't know what you think might be a waste to give to God today in your life.  
But it's a matter of values.  
What you think Jesus is once?  
What you think is once?  
 Depends on you.  
The appearance who said to their children, if it is ministry, you want to go and preach, I should have said to the Bible's go, you wasted my money in the university, ah!  
To what purpose is this waste?  
To what purpose?  
Tell somebody it's not a waste.  
He's worth it.  
I said he's worth it.  
Is he worth it?  
Yes.  
Live your life for him.  
 See, to live your life for God doesn't mean you become a missionary.  
Doesn't mean you become a pastor.  
No.  
But you serve him with all your hearts.  
He becomes number one.  
He becomes number one in everything in your life.  
That's what it means.  
He becomes number one.  
And let no man deceive you with vain words and tell you it is a waste.  
 Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Can you talk to the Lord now?  
Worship Him and honor Him.
