title: 7 Gifts of God in Christ Part 2
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the untobes.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
What discussing seven gifts are they the only gifts now, but what dealing with these seven  


  
 These seven beautiful marvellous gifts of God given to us in Christ Jesus.  
The Christian life is amazing, wonderful, awesome.  
And you know, we're so blessed not because of what we've achieved by ourselves, what we've done, no, not because of our goodness, no.  
 Not at all.  
All because of what Jesus did.  
And all we had to do was to believe.  
That's all we had to do.  
To believe.  
See, I'm blessed.  
And I'm so blessed.  
Not because I got the blessing somehow.  
No.  
I was just born that way.  
 When you're born again, you're born great.  
I was born great.  
When you're born into Christ, you're born an heir of God, a joint heir with Christ.  
And you better find out what belongs to you.  
Otherwise, you would live a life that is so sad and so sorry.  
And it would look like you didn't know Jesus.  
Yeah.  
You make a choice.  
 You look at choice, a choice to suffer, a choice to cry every day.  
Never forget a lady who came to one of our meetings that were having this special healing service.  
There was a sound in the morning.  
And her sons and her husband carried her to the service.  
She had to be put on a wooden bed because her body just couldn't take  
 something softer, because every movement gave her pain.  
She had been in the hospital.  
They couldn't help her.  
And she was a Christian, born again.  
And I had to put down this wooden bed, just so her body would remain in her fixed position without shaking in the pains.  
And they brought her to the meeting.  
And she said, I cried every day.  
 I pray to God every day, crying, hoping that God will hear my cries and do something about my situation.  
And then one day somebody got out some DVDs from Pastor Chris and she was listening and watching those programs.  
And she heard me teaching, you don't have to cry to God.  
 She thought she'd never heard that before.  
She didn't know Christian many years.  
Nobody told that she didn't have to cry.  
And in that message, I said, you don't have to cry.  
See?  
And she learned from there God's Word she had faith.  
She said, just take me to that meeting.  
If Pastor Chris breaks for me today, I'm going to be well.  
 Well, they came and it was at the close of the service.  
I actually had pronounced the close in benediction, though about leaving.  
And somebody motioned to me that this woman was here, wanted to be here.  
I said, bring up here.  
They brought up to the platform.  
Just lying on the ground.  
I said to the husband, do you want your wife to be healed?  
He said, yes.  
I said, OK.  
 I said, you tell her in the name of Jesus to be healed.  
I said, that's all you need.  
See, that being crying and praying, hoping that God will hear them.  
Then he put his hand on her and said, what I said to say, be healed in the name of Jesus.  
And that was it.  
 and the woman sprung up healed by the power of God.  
Completely novel.  
Hallelujah.  
And several years later, she went around preaching the gospel telling others what Jesus did for her.  
She said, I cried every day.  
I didn't know there was no need to cry.  
 Hear me.  
There's no need to cry.  
Jesus has come.  
Jesus has died.  
Jesus has been buried.  
Jesus has resurrected.  
Jesus has ascended.  
All is completed.  
Why cry now?  
If you choose, you can have a wonderful life.  
If you choose.  
If you choose.  
 There are too many Christians who are not chosen.  
They just say, well, you know, easy trying to say that Christians don't suffer.  
Choose yourself.  
Jesus suffered for me.  
Jesus suffered for me.  
Will you face persecution?  
Of course.  
I've had some.  
Will you face criticism evidently?  
But that's not a problem compared to the glory.  
 Oh, yeah.  
Hallelujah.  
So we're talking seven gifts of God in Christ.  
Wonderful, wonderful.  
Seven gifts of God.  
Imagine if you lived your life in the consciousness of these gifts.  
The first one was,  
 eternal life and the second one righteousness and the third one and the fourth one and the fifth one then give you the fifth one so today we're taking the fifth the sixth and the seventh you ready  
 The fifth one is grace, grace, grace is God's gift.  
Wonderful.  
Now, let's read from Romans chapter five and verse number 17.  
Romans chapter five, verse 17.  
For ye by one man's offense, death reigned by one.  
Much more, there which receive abundance of grace.  
Wow.  
 They which receive that He said, they which pray for, oh God, please give me grace.  
You see, you've got to study God's word.  
If you study God's words, you would know what to pray for and what not to pray for.  
You would know what belongs to you and what doesn't belong to you.  
Very important.  
One of the beautiful reasons for the Holy Spirit coming into your life is to help you discover what God's given to you freely.  
 I'll show that to you in a moment.  
Look at this.  
It says, for if by one man's offense that reign by one, much more, there which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life.  
Not shall beg in life.  
Not shall be poor in life.  
There shall reign as kings in life by one Jesus Christ.  
You reign.  
You reign.  
 not sickness raining in your body, you rain in life.  
You ever hear people say, that's the thing that's raining now.  
I never, I never agree with them, even as a young star.  
I'd say, no, that's not what's raining.  
They say, but that's what's raining.  
I say, no, this is a what's raining as to me, from Jesus.  
Because there which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall rain.  
And I have received abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness.  
 So I reign.  
So he can't hang around me and tell me something else is raining when I'm raining.  
I'm raining.  
He doesn't say Jesus shall rain.  
No, they will receive abundance of grace.  
So Jesus reigns through us.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
 Abundance of grace.  
Well, now, go to the next one I'll give to you.  
And this time, Ephesians 4 and verse number 7.  
Ephesians 4 verse 7.  
But unto every one of us is given grace.  
On to the past us is given grace.  
On to the very spiritual brethren.  
 Onto those that pray hard enough.  
Onto those that qualify by living purely in one week.  
But onto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.  
Oh, dear Lord, this is amazing, which I had time to just build a tent around here and really give you some stuff here.  
This is powerful.  
 On to every one of us is given grace, not will be given grace.  
It's not a promise.  
A statement of fact.  
On to every one of us is given grace.  
Say, I've been given grace.  
How much grace?  
How much grace?  
According to the measure of the gift of Christ.  
Hallelujah.  
 First Peter, chapter 4, verse 10, you would like this one.  
Okay, as every man had received the gift.  
Did you see that?  
Even so many said the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.  
I like it.  
Now, let's read to them in a simpler version.  
We can pick the NIV.  
 Look at it.  
Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.  
You, administering God's grace, did you hear that?  
You have become a minister of God's grace.  


  
 Not praying for grace.  
Oh God, please be gracious unto me.  
You are now administering God's grace to other people.  
What an honor.  
You know, a lot of people don't know what it is to be a Christian.  
They think a Christian is just someone that is accepted by God, you know, and God is actually not so happy with you.  
And he's just, if not because of Jesus, what God would have done to us.  
 us, you don't know who we are.  
When you are born again, you are a new creature in Christ Jesus.  
You are a new person.  
You are not the one.  
Hear this.  
Oh dear Lord, you know, when people don't understand the scriptures, they find contradictions, contradictions, because they don't understand.  
 They don't get it.  


  
Listen, Jesus died for everybody.  
The only people that Jesus didn't die for are Christians.  
Now, I have to say that.  
Now, it's accurate, but I have to say that to get your attention very well.  
 so you can understand it even better.  
As if Jesus died for everybody, the only people that Jesus didn't die for are Christians.  
Now, hey, if you're coming for the first time, you're wondering, dear Lord, what is he saying?  
With all the songs about he died for us, you've been singing.  
Yeah, there are songs for babies.  
 Christian babies.  
And there are songs for seniors.  
 When you grow up to understand, all right, let me just give you.  
It's a simple explanation.  
Think about it.  
It's so simple.  
All right.  
Jesus died for sin as He died for the whole world.  
Who are Christians?  
Christians are those who accepted the message of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and thus were recreated.  
They became new creatures.  
 So they're not the ones that he died for, they are the fruits of the death.  
Do you get it now?  
And here's where those who keep talking about, I'm in covenant with God.  
I'm in covenant with my God, you are not.  
 You're not.  
You're not.  
You're not.  
You're not.  
You're not.  
They've been lying to you for so long.  
I know there are books written about God's governance and so on and how we are in covenant with God.  
I have thought so myself for so long, you know.  
But starting the scriptures I found out that was hogwash, rubbish.  
Listen.  
 No Christian is in covenant with God.  
How could you be?  
How could you be?  
How could you be?  
How could you be?  
How could you be?  
Do I have any couple here?  
Any couple here?  
Sitting with your wife?  
Anybody here?  
Good.  
Have a nice one here too.  
Thank you.  
Good of you.  
Imagine... Oh, you look wonderful.  
Yeah.  
 Um, imagine that.  
Can I get someone that looks a little younger?  
Even if you're older, but you just look... Can I pick someone?  
The young guy, come, come.  
You look like you might fit.  
So let's take it that this couple had a son and they named him Jim.  
Jim is their son.  
 in this case, right?  
Good.  
Now, by marriage, you have a covenant, a marriage covenant.  
Is that correct?  
Is that correct?  
Good.  
And now they got a son named Jim.  
Is Jim a part of this covenant?  
No, he definitely isn't.  
 He is the fruit of the covenant.  
You hear it?  
Thank you.  
God bless you.  


  
God, God made that covenant with Jesus.  
Jesus became the heir of the Abrahamic covenant.  
 And now listen, he was the one that God made the new covenant with.  
He was the heir of the Abrahamic covenant, but then he made a covenant with Jehovah, the new covenant that Jesus cut with his own blood.  
On that last night, before his crucifixion, he asked them,  
 to take the cup, the bread and the cup.  
And he said to them, this is the cup of the New Testament in my blood that is shed for you for the remission of sins.  
There's a new covenant.  
All right?  
Now, some people think, oh, so that means he made a covenant with us.  
No, you're wrong.  
That's not what he was pointing at.  
 That's not what he was pointing at.  
And remember that that covenant was before Jesus died.  
I hear this.  
Then he gave his life to seal that covenant.  
The Bible says, until the death of the testicle, a will is of no power.  
What will was this?  
He made the will.  
 which was between him and God.  
He said, in the volume of the book, it is written of me, low I come to do thy will, O God.  
And that is the will.  
That is the will that contains all of the blessings which God set with Jesus in the covenant.  
I hear this.  
 And Jesus sealed it with his blood.  
When he died, it became possible.  
The first thing was new life to be available by reason of Jesus' death, only if you believe.  
And everyone who believes comes into that new life.  
 were born, if you believe in that covenant, that covenant between Jehovah and Jesus, then you become a fruit of that covenant.  
You are an heir, an heir of God.  
That's amazing.  
So you don't, because Jim was their son, he didn't have to beg for anything.  
He had the rights to the family.  
 We have a right to the family.  
We have a right to everything that belongs to Jesus.  
And Jesus said, my Father gave me everything.  
That's what Jesus said.  
He said, everything that the Father has belongs to me.  
The Father gave him everything in the continent.  
He gave him everything.  
So now we are  
 born of the Spirit.  
We are the fruits of the redemption.  
We are not the redeemed.  
We are the fruits of the redemption.  
James chapter 4 verse 6.  
Let's go.  
James chapter 4 verse 6.  
Yeah, but it gives us more grace.  
See, you can get even more grace.  
 See it?  
What does God do in your life?  
When it gives you grace to accomplish anything, when it gives you grace to do anything in your life, then you accomplish it.  
He takes you to the next level.  
He gives you more grace.  
You know, a lot of people are asking God, give me more anointing.  
There's no place in the Bible that says he'll give you another anointing or more anointing.  
Many don't know that.  
 Yeah, they don't know that.  
It's asking God for double anointing and so on, triple anointing.  
That's all.  
It's just a religious talk.  
It's not true.  
There's no way in the Bible.  
Not even one place.  
Surprise?  
Surprise.  
Surprise, surprise.  
But it's true.  
All you need is more grace.  
Oh, you didn't know that.  
 More grace.  
He gives more grace.  
Hallelujah.  
He gives you more grace.  
More grace.  
Yeah, maybe you have a shop and you've been selling certain amounts per week.  
Do you realize if you had 10 times as much, you probably will fill in business because you don't have the capacity to manage  
 That much business.  
Somebody says, God, give me money.  
If God gave you $10 billion right now, you probably pass out just by hearing that you got it.  
 You understand what I'm talking about?  
So, a lot of times, what you need is more grace.  
More grace gives you more capacity to do more, to accomplish more.  
As you achieve, he gives you more grace.  
He expands your course.  
That's what you need.  
He gives more grace.  
Hallelujah.  
Wherefore he's saying, God resisteth the proud, but give that grace to the humble.  
Amen.  
 That's how you need more grace now, isn't it, this guy?  
More grace, more grace.  
What have you done with the present one?  
See, here that is faithful and little is faithful in much.  
Accomplish the current one, and he will give you more grace.  
Hallelujah.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Number six, the name of Jesus.  
 What a gift!  
What a gift!  
Did you know the name of Jesus is a gift?  
What a gift!  
Wow!  
He gave us the power of a Tony to use his name.  
That means the legal authority to use his name.  
Can you imagine that?  
We have a right to use the name of Jesus.  
What does that mean?  
I can do anything!  
 in the name of Jesus.  
See, in my name, it may not work.  
In my daddy's name, it may not work, in my family name, it may not work.  
In the name of Uncle Sue and so it may not work, but in the name of Jesus Christ, it's got to work.  
Because the Bible sees all authority, all power, has been given to Jesus Christ in the heaven and in earth.  
And on that year, Jesus has the power everywhere.  
 Jesus has the power over nations, over governments.  
Jesus has the power over every name.  
Jesus has the power.  
And his name has been given to you to use.  
How are you using it?  
Not many Christians know how to use the name of Jesus.  
They think it's just a name to put at the end of the prayer.  
 So when they finish through, they even say through Jesus Christ alone.  
You don't pray through Jesus Christ.  
It's wrong to pray through Jesus Christ.  
So it's hard.  
Yeah.  
He never told you to pray through Jesus Christ.  
Praying through Jesus Christ means you are making him a medium.  
He is not a medium for the Christian.  
The Christian has arrived in God's presence.  
He doesn't need a medium.  
 Only the sinner needs a medium.  
So he calls on Jesus that he might be saved through Jesus Christ.  
So when he's saved through Jesus Christ, he is brought by the power of God into God's presence.  
He no longer needs a medium.  
So you don't pray through Jesus Christ, our Lord, Amen.  
No, it's wrong.  
You pray in the name of Jesus.  
There's a difference between praying through Jesus and praying in the name of Jesus.  
 a strong legal difference.  
To pray in the name of Jesus means that you are praying in his place, meaning that whatever you are asking for is his name that's asking for it.  
And he can't be turned down.  
 But you see, if you don't really trust that name, then you pray casually as though it means nothing and you're not really expecting anything anyway.  
Did you know that when you use the name of Jesus, you don't have to squeeze up any faith?  
You don't have to.  
It's the simplest thing in the world to get results using the name of Jesus.  
All you have to believe is in the name of Jesus.  
 If you don't know what's behind that name, how can you believe in something you don't know?  
You have to know what's behind that name.  
That was back of that name.  
What's vested in that name, the name of Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
He gave us the power of Adani to use his name.  
Oh, let's see if you verse is here.  
You like this one.  
Glory to God.  
John chapter 14.  
 Read from verse 13 to 14.  
Saint John, chapter 14.  
From verse 13.  
And whatsoever, ha ha ha, whatsoever, whatsoever, whatsoever.  
Anything whatsoever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  
Next verse, if he shall ask anything in my name, I will do it.  
This is not prayer.  
 because you cannot pray to Jesus in the name of Jesus.  
So this is not prayer.  
You don't pray to Jesus, you know, people pray without even listening to what they're saying.  
They say, oh, Jesus.  
Everything they want to say, they're saying Jesus' name.  
They're praying to Jesus in the name of Jesus to be prayer.  
It's not going anywhere.  
They're not listening to themselves.  
Listen, God is very legal-minded.  
Study the Scriptures.  
Very legal-minded.  
 All right?  
So if you've been praying like that and it's been working for you from today, just stop working.  
You know why?  
Because God says, the time of ignorance, God went at, but now commands all men everywhere to repent.  
Because he'll be answering you as a child.  
But there are things that you need, that things have to work for you beyond the level of childish prayer, that just will not work if you're praying like a child.  
 See, you gotta have the knowledge you've got.  
If you should ask anything, my name, I'll do it.  
This is not prayer.  
This is the same kind of thing that, what he's saying is this.  
Remember, he said to us, my father that dwellered in me, he do it the works, meaning the Holy Ghost, because that's the father that dwellered in him.  
The Holy Ghost performed the works, okay?  
Now, Jesus says, you ask anything in my name, I'll make it happen.  
So you're not asking Jesus.  
 I'll give you an example.  
In Acts 3 Peter and John are going into the temple and they get to the gate called beautiful and there's a man who's been laying crippled from birth.  
Never works.  
He's about 40 years old and this man never works.  
 And Peter and John stood before him.  
And Peter spoke up and said to him, look on us.  
In other words, give us your attention.  
There is a silver and gold have I none.  
Now notice he didn't say silver and gold have we none because he didn't know if John had something.  
So he said, silver and gold have I none.  
Because some people use that to preach that we're not supposed to have anything.  
 That's why he didn't have anything.  
That's why Jesus didn't give Peter his mother to take care of.  
He gave his mother to John to take care of.  
Because Peter was broke.  


  
You wouldn't give your mother to a broke man to take care of.  
 Peter was broke.  
So Jesus gave his mother to John to take care of.  
So Peter said, save and go, have I none?  
But such as I have, give ID.  
Then he says, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.  
He didn't say, I pray.  
Oh Father, in the name of Jesus, make him walk.  
 Oh, hear him, O Lord.  
No, he said, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.  
And he got the man by the right hand, poured him up and his uncle once receives strength.  
The Bible says, and he's leaping up stews.  
Glory to God.  
I like it.  
And he walked with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.  
 Hallelujah.  
Wow, I like it.  
Amazing, amazing.  
So you can demand for something to happen in the name of Jesus.  
You commanded to happen in the name of Jesus.  
That means Jesus is ordering that thing to happen.  
 And Jesus says, oh, make sure he does.  
Because he's got a power.  
Now, what about praying in the name of Jesus?  
Can we pray in the name of Jesus?  
Absolutely.  
We can.  
But we pray to the Father in the name of Jesus.  
We don't pray to Jesus in the name of Jesus.  
We pray to the Father in the name of Jesus.  
St.  
John's Gospel chapter 16.  
You go to verse 23.  
 So this next one now is talking about prayer.  
Jesus is talking now.  
He says, and in that day, what day?  
The day of salvation.  
He's looking forward to when he dies for them, when he's resurrected, he's teaching the disciples and something that's about to happen, okay?  
So a new day is coming and that day came, glory to God, and we're in that day now.  
So he says, and in that day, he shall ask me nothing.  
He shall not pray to me.  
Look at it.  
You're not asking Jesus.  
 You're not praying to Jesus.  
And in that day he shall ask me nothing.  
Verily I say unto you, verily, verily I say unto you whatsoever he shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.  
So you're not praying to Jesus.  
 Now somebody said, you know, yeah, that's very true, because when we pray to the Father, then Jesus starts begging the Father, and Jesus starts begging the Father on our behalf.  
No, no, no, he doesn't.  
He doesn't.  
He sure doesn't.  
Let's keep reading.  
Number 24, verse 24.  
He led to, up to now, have he asked nothing in my name.  
Ask, can he shall receive that you join me before?  
Next verse.  
These things have I spoken unto you in problems.  
But the time comes when I shall no more speak unto you in problems, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.  
 At that day, he's just asking my name.  
And I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you.  
He says, I'm not telling you that I'm going to pray the Father for you.  
So don't think that when you pray to the Father in the name of Jesus, then Jesus starts begging the Father on your behalf.  
He says, no, he doesn't happen like that.  
Look at it.  
Next verse.  
 for the Father Himself loveth You.  
He doesn't need anybody to pray to Him for You.  
Look at it, for the Father Himself loveth You because You have loved Me and I believe that I came out from God.  
 You know, somebody said, well, you know, we tell Mary to talk to the father, because we can't talk to the father by ourselves.  
So, Mary tells him, and then, and then, you know, because Mary is very close to Jesus.  
So, Mary convinces Jesus.  
Then Jesus convinces the father, then we get it.  
Where do they get such things from?  
Because they just don't study the Bible.  
God said, my people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge.  
Hear it from the lips of the master himself.  
Jesus himself said it.  
Back to verse 26.  
 Look at it again.  
At that day, he shall ask in my name.  
And I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father himself loves you.  
The Father himself loves you, doesn't need Jesus to convince him to do something for you.  
Okay, Colossians chapter three, verse 17.  
 You'd like this one.  
And whatsoever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
Yeah.  
Anything.  
Whatever you do in word or in action, do all in the name of Jesus.  
That's powerful.  
 So that just takes away the limits.  
Instead of saying, I don't know what I might do in the name of Jesus and what I might not do.  
Well, you can do anything in the name of Jesus, so long as it brings the Father glory.  
Amen.  
Amen.  
The power of eternity to use his name.  
You can do anything in the name of Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
 Imagine if you have been living your life in the name of Jesus, there will be no fear.  
You can't go to bed at night wondering what might just happen to you.  
How could you?  
When you live in the name of Jesus.  
I mean, when he says, when he says, whatever you do in the world or deed, do all in the name of Jesus, that's ticket to living every day in the name of Jesus.  
That's what it means.  
You're living in the name of Jesus.  
Man, oh, man.  
 What a life of success and glory.  
I'll never fail in my life.  
I'm a success.  
Absolute success.  
I'm a victor forever.  
I know who I am.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
 All right.  
Number seven.  
Finally I got there.  
Finally I got there.  
Oh, number seven.  
Gift number seven.  
Gift number seven.  
Can you guess?  
Can you guess?  
Can you guess?  
Citizen ship.  
This is lovely.  
Citizenship.  
Citizenship.  
Look at it.  
In Christ, I have citizenship.  


  
 See, we've got to understand these are things that are given to us in Christ Jesus that belong to us.  
You don't have to ask for any of these.  
You don't ask for them.  
But the gift of righteousness has granted you because you're born that way.  
It's part of your life now.  
Grace is yours.  
 Eternal life is yours.  
The Bible says the gift of God is eternal life.  
As much as eternal life is yours, citizenship is yours.  
No, we're not just trying to make it up.  
No.  
Philippians chapter three, we're reading from verse 20.  
Let's read from the NIV.  
Because there's a word there if you don't understand.  
 that how it's used in the King James, you might just miss it.  
But our citizenship is in heaven.  
And we get away to save you from the head of our Jesus Christ.  
Let's read again.  
Our citizenship is in heaven.  
Can you see your citizen of heaven?  
Your heavenly citizen is not about to happen.  
 No, it's not going to happen later on.  
No, you are a citizen.  
Think about it.  
Say, I'm a heavenly citizen.  
I know who I am.  
Now, how can you be a heavenly citizen and just be completely frustrated on earth?  
No, we can be frustrated.  
We have divine powers.  
We have powers.  
We're not ordinary beings.  
 Listen, trust what Jesus did for you.  
Trust it.  
Trust it.  
Our citizenship isn't even.  
And we eagerly await our Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Look at the next verse.  
Who by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, he can bring everything under his control.  
Can you imagine that?  
We'll transform our lowly bodies, these bodies, so that they will be like his glorious body.  
 So when He shows up from heaven, when He comes, our bodies will be transformed.  
Like the Bible says, in the twinkling of an eye, we shall be changed.  
When Jesus shows up, at the last drop, His as the dead in Christ shall rise first.  
We that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the end.  
So shall we ever be with the Lord.  
 But it'll happen in the twinkling of an eye.  
It's not going to be changed like that.  
That's something that's happening to me.  
No, no, no, in the twinkling of an eye.  
Bam!  
And we put on our glorified bodies.  
Right now, our bodies don't look like he's glorious, buddy.  
Our bodies are different.  
These are not glorified bodies.  
But these are bodies housing glory.  
I hope you understand this.  
Can you shout amen so much?  
 This is wonderful.  
All right.  
First, the people of St.  
John, chapter three, let's read from verse one, into verse two.  
Behold, what manner of love the father had bestowed, lavished upon us that we should be called the sons of God.  
Therefore, the world doesn't recognize us because it didn't recognize him.  
You get it?  
Uh-huh.  
King James says, the world is not because of Newton.  
 Look at this one.  
This is powerful.  
Beloved?  
When?  
When?  
When we get to heaven?  
Now are we the sons of God?  
We are not going to be.  
We are.  
Look at the tenses.  
Look at the tenses.  
 Now are we the sons of God?  
And he does not yet appear what we shall be.  
In other words, on the outside, we don't look at what we are going to be.  
We don't look like that glorified body that we're going to have, but already we are the sons of God.  
They get it.  
Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and he does not yet appear what we shall be.  
But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.  
But now we are the sons of God.  
 Our bodies don't look like that.  
That's why the world doesn't recognize us.  
When we say we're sons of God, they say, you, because that's the way they treated him.  
When he said, I am the son of God, they said, don't say it, we'll kill you.  
They said he was blaspheming, but he was the son of God.  
Hallelujah.  
Okay.  
Same book, chapter four, verse 17.  
 Herean is a love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, read the rest of it, want to go.  


  
Because as he is, not as he was, as he is.  
So are we in this world.  
 It didn't say when we get to heaven.  
In this words, we are like him now, as he is.  
So are we.  
Hearing is a love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment.  
See, because in the day of judgment, people are going to be scared, I tell you.  
Because when they see him sitting on the great white throne, like the Bible tells us, the people began to cry to the mountains.  
They said, follow us and hide us from him.  
I see it on the throne for the great day of his judgment is coming.  
Who is able to stand?  
 so afraid, so scared of him, with the lightens and the thunderings, because their day of judgment has come, but we will be sitting together with him.  
We shall have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is so early in this world, hallelujah, won't shut him in somebody.  
Glory to God.
