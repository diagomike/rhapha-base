title: 7 Gifts of God in Christ Part 1
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and he left us with a message to tell the untold, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and his unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
Today, we're talking seven gifts of God in Christ.  
Number one,  


  
 Everybody should know what should be number one.  
Everybody should know.  
Number one, eternal life.  
It's called everlasting life or eternal life, one and the same thing.  
It's a gift of God.  
Romans chapter 6 and verse number 23.  
The scripture is up on the screen.  
Can you read it for me?  
Want to go.  


  
 terrible.  
The wages of sin is death.  
The payment for sin is death.  
That's the payback.  
That's salary for sin.  
The wages of sin is death.  
Spiritual death.  
But I like this.  
But the gift of God is eternal life.  
 And then it tells us how we get it through Jesus Christ.  
Not through Buddha.  
You can't get it through Buddha.  
It's never going to happen.  
No.  
You can't get it through any other name.  
Only through Jesus Christ.  
Look at it.  
Look at it now.  
Somebody said, there are many Christs.  
Well, the one that's called Jesus is the one that gives eternal life.  
 Can you see it?  
The wages of sin is death.  
But the gift of God is eternal life.  
It's a gift.  
You don't pay for it.  
You don't qualify for it.  
It's a gift.  
And it comes through Jesus Christ.  
And everybody said amen.  
 So, oh, what do I have it?  
It's a gift from God who gets it, who gets to get it, who gets it, who has it?  
It's a gift just because it's a gift, doesn't mean everybody's got it.  
I've got to know where or not I got it.  
Okay, St.  
John's Gospel chapter six and verse 47.  
Look at it, very, very assailed to you.  
He that believeth on me, caught.  
 That's King James for has, has.  
Okay, has.  
If you put a newer version there, you'd see it.  
He that believes, believes, he that believes on me has everlasting life.  
Wonderful.  
Oh, look at it.  
Anybody who believes on Jesus Christ has everlasting life.  
That's all you've got to do to get eternal life.  
 That's all, you believe in Jesus Christ.  
What do you mean believe in Jesus Christ?  
That he, a figure of history?  
No, it's much more than that.  
That he was a wonderful rabbi.  
No, no, no, no, no, a thousand times, no.  
No.  
Okay, okay, okay, okay.  
First episode of St.  
John,  
 In chapter 5, we read from verse 11.  
Some call it 1 John 5, 11.  


  
And this is the record.  
Oh dear God.  
Oh boy.  
 one of the most exciting scriptures.  
And this is the record.  
That means the testimony.  
God's record.  
God's testimony.  
This is the testimony.  
This is God's affirmation.  
This is God's declaration.  
This is God's record.  
That God he has declared.  
God has given to us.  
Pause for a second.  
Is that a promise?  
Is that a statement of the future?  
 past, present, future, which one?  
God has given to us!  


  
He's done it!  
He didn't say, if you pray hard enough,  
 This is God's record.  
This is God's testimony.  
This is God's declaration.  
The God has given to us eternal life.  
Read that next part.  
And this life is in his Son.  
Talking about Jesus.  
This life eternal life is in his Son.  
Is in Jesus.  
 Read the next verse, you'll like it.  
And he says, he that hath the Son hath life.  
What life?  
Eternal life.  
And he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.  
If you don't have the Son of God, you don't have it.  
What is eternal life?  
Eternal life is the nature of God.  
Eternal life refers to the life of God.  
 There is the human life.  
See, the reason is called eternal.  
It's actually almost what we might call a misnomer.  
See, it's not correctly defined.  
See, it's not correctly named.  
But this is the closest thing the English language can give to you for what trying to tell you.  
It's zoe in the Greek.  
 All right?  
And what they're telling you is that it's not the normal biological life which they refer to as okay.  
It's not the biological life.  
It's not the animal life is referring to.  
So this is not the human life.  
The different kinds of life, you've got plant life.  
 All right?  
It's different from animal life.  
And even among animals, they got different kinds of life.  
All right?  
So this one is the life that God has.  
And so the best that English rendering could give you is eternal or everlasting.  
It's the God type of life, the God kind of life.  
It's called the life of the God kind.  
Oh, dear.  
 If you were to read from Second Peter chapter one and you read in verse four, it tells you how that through his words, he's brought us into what he calls a such age of the God kind.  
See, the Greek rendering is very, very interesting.  
In the English, it's called divine nature.  
 partakers of the divine nature, coin on us, which is actually associates or comrades, those that are in fellowship, in oneness, all right?  
Then he says, they ask for shows, which means, think about this, this is powerful.  
It means God kind.  
Like you say, mankind.  
God kind.  
 He's dealing with a heavenly pantheon.  
That being born again, he brings us into comradeship of the God-kind.  
It's too powerful.  
It's too powerful.  
When you meditate on these things, you cannot think like a human being.  
It leaves your vision.  
It leaves your, your understanding is opened.  
 Then you understand why did Jesus come?  
He didn't come to establish a religion.  
Somebody said, oh, he came to forgive us our sins.  
Much more than that.  
Oh, blessed be God.  
Hallelujah.  
 So the gift of God is eternal life.  
And because I believe in Jesus and I have Jesus the Son of God, I have eternal life.  
I have it in the now.  
God has given us.  
He is not going to give us.  
He didn't say, I'll give to you.  
This is His given us, which means I got it now.  
I got it now.  
 And why is it important that I know it?  
I've got to know it.  
If I don't know it, I can't live it.  
I believe in a normal human life.  
And thinking, like many Christians, many, many Christians don't know they have eternal life.  
They don't know it.  
They think it's something they're going to get when they get to heaven.  
They don't know it.  
They're not living like they have it.  
 They're acting like they got a religion from God.  
They don't understand, eternal life is real.  
They don't know it.  
They're not living it.  
Their experiences don't show the God eternal life, so they're living according to their experiences.  
Otherwise, why being subject to malaria?  
Why?  
You're not supposed to be subject to it, but you don't know it.  
 And because you don't know it, you're gonna face it, you're gonna live like your subject to it.  
Why is subject to discouragement and depression?  
Why?  
Because you don't know you're not supposed to be.  
Let me show you something.  
Psalm 82, let's read from verse five.  


  
Look at it, they're not.  
Neither will they understand.  
 So what happens?  
They walk on in darkness.  
And so the result is all the foundations of the earth are out of course.  
Things are upside down.  
Things aren't working correctly.  
Why?  
Because they know not.  
Neither will they understand.  
They walk on in darkness.  
Oh, oh, they know not.  
My life is never dependent on anything on this earth.  
 Understand it.  
I'm born again.  
Do you know what that means?  
That means I'm born with the life and nature of God.  
I'm not an ordinary person Don't you know what Jesus came to do?  
He came to give us life Look at Jesus declaration.  
Oh boy, I gotta show you these things Saint John chapter 5 verse 26  
 Look at that.  
For us, the Father blessed be God.  
As the Father, this is Jesus talking, as the Father hath life in himself, so has he given to the Son to have life in himself, inherent life.  
He's not drawing life from the Father.  
No, the Father gave him life that he should have life for himself.  
Did you know that's what he did for us when we received eternal life?  
 We're not continuously receiving life.  
No, he says that God has given to them eternal life.  
He's not giving you eternal life.  
He has given you eternal life.  
I said, it's one of you.  
You've got to know it.  
Jesus knew it.  
And Jesus declared it.  
Look at it.  
He says, as the father had life in himself.  
So I think given to the son I have life in himself.  
What about you?  
First John chapter five.  
 We go back to verse 11, we're gonna read from there.  
This is exciting, you love it.  
And this is the record that God had given to us eternal life.  
And this life is in his son, verse 12.  
He that had the son had life.  
And he that had not the son of God had not life.  
If you have not been born again, get ready.  
Because except you're born again, you don't know what we're talking about.  
That's what it is to be born again to have eternal life.  
 All right, look at the next verse.  
Look at it.  
13, these things have I written on to you.  
Oh, let's give it to us from the NIV.  
I want them to read it in a newer version.  
He says, I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.  
Boy,  
 He wants you to know.  
Somebody said, we can tell whether or not we have it.  
He says, how can anybody tell?  
He says, I've written to you that you may know.  
He says, I want you to know that you have it.  
He wants you to know.  
Because if you don't know, you cannot live the life.  
You will live the life of a human.  
You say, huh?  
 That means here what I tell you for my word is life.  
That's what I said to you in other times.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Amazing, amazing, amazing.  
I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God.  
 so that you may know that you have eternal life.  
I want you to know you have eternal life.  
Hallelujah.  
Number two.  
And number two is even so big.  
It's called righteousness.  
Righteousness.  
Oh, it's a gift from God.  
 Righteousness?  
Yes, sir.  
I'm righteous.  
Somebody say, are you righteous?  
You think you're righteous?  
Yes, I am.  
I don't just think I am.  
I know I am.  
How did you become righteous?  
I will show it to you.  
I will show it to you.  
How does God see me?  
I'm going to show it to you.  
Oh boy, boy.  
 Romans 5, verse 1.  
Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
The word justified, being declared righteous.  
Being declared righteous by faith.  
 declared righteous.  
How come?  
How come?  
How come?  
Because you're born again, because you're a new creation.  
The Bible says the man, your former life, the life he used to have, the sin that you were before, died in Christ.  
And because you are now a new person, you have no record of sin.  
That's the reason you are justified.  
 Can you see it?  
Somebody said, we're seen as saved by grace.  
That's a lie.  
We're not seen as saved by grace.  
We're no longer seen as.  
We're the righteousness of God.  
Look at it.  
Therefore being justified declared righteous by faith.  
We have peace with God.  
You see, we are peace with God now.  
He loves us and we love Him.  
He's not angry with us.  
Glory to God.  
We're His kids and we can play around Him.  
 And do you realize that you're leaven in God's presence?  
Go to verse 17, verse 17.  
 For if by one man's offense, Adam is talking about Adam's offense, you know, you got to read it in context.  
You can just start from verse 17, you know.  
For if by one man's offense, death, spiritual death, gain the mastery of a man, much more, there which receive, abonance of grace, we're going to come back to this.  
And of the gift of righteousness, receive,  
 gift of righteousness, righteousness is a gift.  
Look at it.  
There which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness.  
There which receive of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life.  
What is righteousness?  
Righteousness is not doing right.  
Hear me.  
The Bible definition of righteousness does not mean doing right.  
Doing right is a result of righteousness.  
 Are you hearing me?  
Doing right is a result of righteousness.  
You cannot do right until you are righteous.  
Righteousness is a nature.  
Righteousness is the nature of God that gives man the rightness, it produces in man the rightness of God.  
For example, God is right.  
Did you ever hear the term might is right?  
Some people debate that it's not good, but it's true.  
 Because God has declared what is right.  
Who dares to say his wrong?  
He's God.  
Whatever standards he's provided, we've got to follow.  
He's God.  
Might.  
He's right.  
True.  
Some people don't like him, but it's true.  
 What he says is is.  
What he says was was, if God said to you, you are a cat.  
Let me tell you, you can't argue with it.  
You will turn into a cat.  
That's what it means by God cannot lie.  
Because when he says something, it becomes.  
He cannot lie.  
It becomes.  
He calls things by names.  
When he calls them by names, they become.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
So that's who he is.  
Somebody go.  
So he's right.  
We say, God is always right.  
It's his characteristic to be right.  
It's his nature to be right.  
And so when God gives you of that, his nature of rightness, you receive of him the ability to be right.  
 That means you now live in consonants with his spirits.  
It's an ability.  
It's a nature.  
You can't live like him.  
You can please him until he gives it to you.  
It is the nature of God that gives man the ability to do right.  
 And that nature of God causes you to be able to stand in this presence without a sense of guilt, of inferiority, or even condemnation.  
You don't feel inferior to God.  
Because His major righteousness means that He has given you what is called right standing.  
You have right standing before God.  
Right standing.  
 It means that there's nothing against you.  
There's no record.  
There's nothing that disqualifies you.  
You have right standing in his presence.  
All this is spiritual because he gives it, he qualifies you in your spirits.  
That's why we can talk like this in his presence.  
That's the reason we can be bold in his presence.  
 That's why we can pray and expect an answer.  
You know, some people say those Christians, they look at us like another group of Christians, you know, because they always, everything they want to say, oh God, we are nothing before thy holy presence.  
That was great and we are small.  
 Who can stand before thy holy throne?  
They want to pray Old Testament.  
But that's why Jesus came.  
So that we will no longer be afraid of God.  
 Oh, boy.  
How can I give it to you?  
Romans 8.  
Let's look at verse 1.  
Romans 8.  
Jesus has come.  
Blessed be God.  
Jesus has come.  
Blessed be God.  
You see, He has come.  
He has died.  
He has resurrected.  
He has ascended.  
Life is available now.  
 Look at this, there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.  
Oh, glory to God.  
What this means, what this means, so powerful, so powerful, so powerful.  
Go back to Romans, I told you, righteousness, righteousness, God's nature, the rightness of God in my spirit.  
 I write standing with God.  
Now I can pray without being afraid.  
I don't have to be thinking, did I please God?  
Did I do anything wrong?  
Will God answer me?  
You know sometimes people want to pray.  
They think, God may not hear me because I've done a lot of wrong things.  
You see, that means you don't understand righteousness.  
Righteousness has nothing to do with what you did or didn't do.  
Righteousness is your standing in the presence of God.  
And Jesus, the Bible says, Jesus is your righteousness.  
He is your standing.  
 Can you shout a name somebody?  
Hallelujah.  
 Do you know how to go on and on?  
Second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 21, you'd like this one.  
This is the other side of it.  
He says, for He had made Him to be sinned for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God.  
Can you imagine this?  
He gives us His righteousness and then turns us into His righteousness.  
This is amazing.  
It's one of the biggest truths of the Word of God.  
 That means that I am the fruit producing parts of the vine.  
Jesus said, I am the vine.  
He had the branches, okay?  
So I am the righteousness fruit bearer.  
Oh, I wish you understood it.  
I'm carrying the fruits of righteousness.  
God is righteous.  
And I am the branch of Christ.  
Jesus Christ.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
I carry the beauty of the Son of God.  
 Can you see why when you live your life as a Christian?  
With your understanding that I share with you, your life will always be beautiful.  
Your life will always be exciting.  
Even in the dungeon, your life will be exciting.  
Think about it.  
Paul and Silas were in jail.  
Their feet, their hands were in stock.  
The Bible says, at midnight, they sang praises to God.  
At midnight, they sang praises to God.  
 You understand that your life is no longer dependent on circumstances.  
When you have or you don't have something, it makes no difference.  
It makes no difference.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, number three, fellowship.  
Fellowship.  
Oh, we're talking seven gifts of God in Christ.  
Number three, fellowship.  
What a gift.  
What a gift.  
What do you mean fellowship?  
Oh, yeah.  
 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse number 9.  
You like it.  
God is faithful, by whom ye we're called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ our Lord.  
 Jesus Christ, our Lord, we are in fellowship with Jesus Christ.  
Isn't that amazing?  
Don't you understand what that means?  
We're in fellowship with Jesus Christ.  
Now, the word is coined onia, okay, meaning fellowship.  
It's the strongest word to use, and that's why they're choosing it there.  
It means partnership.  
It means communion, okay?  
It means to be sharing.  
 Together, how?  
It means oneness.  
Oneness with Jesus, partnership with Jesus, communion with Jesus, fellowship with Jesus.  
He's brought us into fellowship with himself, like we are one together.  
This is amazing.  
No wonder he says that we are joint heirs with Christ.  
God is faithful, by whom you were called.  
 You were called.  
You didn't qualify for it.  
You didn't walk your way there.  
It happened through his calling in Christ Jesus.  
What a gift.  
What a gift.  
What a gift.  
Go to 1 John chapter 1.  
Amazing.  
1 John chapter 1.  
We read from verse 1.  
 that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life.  
Verse two, for the life, wow.  
For the life was manifested, what a construction, what a construction, the life is calling Jesus the life.  
That means Jesus Christ is the embodiment of the divine life.  
 Jesus Christ is the embodiment of deity.  
For the life was manifested and we have seen it.  
Oh, dear Lord.  
And show unto you that into the life which was with the Father and was manifested under us.  
Oh,  
 that which we have seen and heard the claim we honor you, that He also may have fellowship with us and truly God Almighty.  
This is powerful.  
Truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.  
Oh God, oh God, associates of the God kind.  
 What a truth.  
We're in fellowship with God.  
In fellowship with the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.  
Lord, thank you.  
Thank you.  
Thank you.  
What a life has given us.  
Oh, what a life.  
How can you know this and say you are having some discouragement about something?  
How can you know this and face frustrations?  
How can you know this and say you are broke?  
How can you know this?  
How can you know this?  
 I'll be wondering about your future.  
How can you know this?  
How?  
Fellowship with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.  
Amazing.  
Amazing.  
What a gift.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
How?  
Powerful.  
Powerful.  
Let me show you.  
There's something you say all the time, all the time, all the time.  
Second current is chapter 13 and verse number 14.  
You say it all the time.  
 He prayed everywhere.  
I want you to understand it's real.  
Look at it.  
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God.  
And that's the words.  
It's translated communion this time.  
Coimony, fellowship.  
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost.  
Be with you.  
Somebody said, what's the difference between Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit, King James?  
They're the same.  
They're the same.  
 See, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship, the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.  
The communion of the Holy Ghost, what a gift.  
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  
Hi.  
So we've got, we're in fellowship with the Father, with the Son, with the Holy Spirit.  
Amazing.  
Number four.  
 The Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is number four.  
He's a gift to us.  
Oh boy, the Holy Spirit, emphatically yes.  
The Holy Spirit, gift from God.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Acts chapter two, let's read verse 38.  
Acts chapter two, verse 38.  
Then Peter said unto them,  
 Repain and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and he shall receive what?  
The gifts of the Holy Ghost.  
The gifts of the Holy Ghost.  
The Holy Ghost is a gift.  
Come on.  
All right.  
Good.  
Chapter five verse 32.  
And we are witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God had given to them that obey him.  
 given to them, granted them, is a gift.  
Acts 10 verse 45.  
Why is this such a marvelous gift?  
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with Peter because that on the Gentiles also was brought out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  
Why is this so important?  
The gift of the Holy Ghost?  
Do you know what that means?  
This is the third person of the Godhead.  
 Even though we call him the third person of the Godhead, why do we call him the third person of the Godhead?  
Because he's the third of the Godhead to carry out his ministry.  
First, the Father carried out his ministry.  
Second, Jesus, the Son carried out his ministry and thought the Holy Spirit carries out his full ministry.  
But he's the first to be revealed in the Godhead.  
 For the Bible terraces in Genesis chapter 1, you read it.  
It terraces.  
He reveals it and says, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.  
The Spirit of God.  
That's the Holy Spirit.  
His God's gift to you.  
 so that you can live the life of God, so that you always be a success, so that the kingdom of God can be real to you, so that the fellowship of the Father and the Son can become real to you.  
It helps you in prayer.  
It carries out a ministry in your life.  
The Holy Spirit makes the kingdom of God real to you.  
So now, while you're in this earth, you live as though in heaven.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
 Oh, what a life.  
You live beyond the senses because of the power and the ability of the Holy Spirit.  
Then you can do supernatural things.  
No wonder he said to his disciples, tiring in Jerusalem until you've been due the power from one eye.  
 And when the Holy Ghost came, they became powerful.  
That's why when I'm talking to you now, see, your heart is receiving.  
Why?  
Because of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  
That's why you can understand, because of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.  
That's why I can be bold to talk to a sinner about Jesus, because the Holy Spirit will let him know that Jesus Christ is real.  
Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  
 Can you imagine?  
We weren't there when Jesus Christ was born.  
We weren't there when He walked this earth.  
We weren't there when He was crucified.  
We weren't there when He was buried, or when He resurrected or ascended.  
We weren't there, but we believe it and so believe it until we got to know it.  
It has become something you can take away from us.  
Why?  
Because the Holy Spirit has imprinted it in our hearts.  
Hallelujah.  
 He sent the Holy Spirit to lead us, to guide us.  
He says, as many as are led by the Spirit.  
They are the souls of God.  
The Holy Spirit leads us so that if there's trouble, he can direct us.  
If our faith is not yet strong enough, he'll direct us away from it.  
If our faith is built up, he will lead us right into the trouble so that we can conquer the adversary.  
Glory to God.  
 The Holy Spirit is our leader.  
The Holy Spirit is not an influence.  
He's a person.  
And that's why now that he's in your life, you've got to learn to fellowship with him.  
Talk to him.  
Don't talk to him as though he's somebody sitting beside you.  
Don't talk to him like he's someone, you know, out there in your room.  
No, he's not assigned you.  
He lives in you.  
Where shall I allure?
