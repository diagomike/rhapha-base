title: Conditioning Your Spirit for Excellence
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 In life, nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude for achieving his goal.  
Just because your spirit is born again and you have the Holy Ghost in you who is an excellent spirit doesn't mean that you have an excellent character because you have to develop condition your spirit to become an excellent character.  
 Discover how to dream more.  
Learn more.  
Do more and improve your value as an individual, as Pastor Chris teaches in this timely message how to condition your spirit for excellence in becoming a man of immense value.  
So begin today to condition your spirit into an excellent character.  
 Listen and be blessed.  
God bless you.  
The mental structures of societies are far more important than the physical structures.  
And that is the idea behind education.  
It will interest you to know  
 that former education was never a product of government.  
It was a product of religious leaders, not of government.  
Former education came because of  
 religious leaders and philosophers who sought to transmit the ideas they had, which they believed were of some higher inspiration than the norm in their societies and sought to  
 reproduced themselves in those they chose as disciples who eventually became described as scholars.  
And this went on for many, many years before governments began to acquire  
 the philosophies, the ideas, because those who had been trained by these folks had come into government.  
And they said education should not only be for the selected few, but should be made available  
 because they saw the need for it in transforming societies.  
They understood that until you had built mental structures, you could not build excellent physical structures.  
So what you see in society is a reflection.  
It is also a manifestation of the structures of the minds  
 of those behind whatever it is that you've seen.  
The Bible tells us something that would like us to begin our Scripture reading from Proverbs chapter 17.  
I want you to read for me in verse 27.  


  
 He that had knowledge, spared his words, and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.  
He that had knowledge, spared his words.  
He that had knowledge, spared his words.  
This is a real man of knowledge, is not a noise maker.  
 And that a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.  
So someone who has an excellent spirit demonstrates understanding.  
He says, if you see a man who demonstrates understanding, he has an excellent spirit.  
He has an excellent spirit.  
 From today, what I want you to begin to do is channel your thinking, focus your mind towards reproducing in yourself nothing short of excellence.  
 excellence.  
You're going to have to make up your mind for high ideas as a person.  
Are you listening?  
Then to work this thing through over a period of time.  
And you can actually measure your progress over that period of time.  
 He's a man of understanding, he's of an excellent spirit.  
All right, now let's look at two other verses.  
One is the book of Daniel chapter number five, Daniel chapter number five, verse 12.  
For as much as an excellent spirit and knowledge,  
 and understanding the interpreting of dreams and showing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same Daniel.  
An excellent spirit and an excellent spirit goes with these beautiful qualities, knowledge,  
 understanding, then it says here, interpreting of dreams, showing of hard sentences, meaning that he could explain hard sentences, difficult words, difficult constructions, and dissolving of doubts.  
In other words, by the time you heard from Daniel, your doubts were dissolved.  
 wonderful.  
It says, these qualities were found in that Daniel.  
These qualities were found in Daniel.  
Now, let's read just another verse 14.  
 They're saying this to Daniel.  
He says to him, I have even heard of the, that the Spirit of the Gods is in thee, now because they will add all worshippers.  
So they said the Spirit of the Gods, but this was the Spirit of God.  
See, that the Spirit of the Gods is in thee and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.  
Wonderful.  
 Now, let's go to chapter 6, the same book.  
Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents in princes because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.  
Remarkable.  
Remarkable.  
 the man had an excellent spirit.  
And we learned of those qualities of his character.  
Let's begin the process.  
What we're sharing here is practical wisdom.  
And remember, fronnesis is practical wisdom.  
And the Bible says that God gave Solomon fronnesis practical wisdom.  
 There are people who have mental wisdom.  
They just think and they seem to have great ideas and they even think like they've got more wisdom than everybody else.  
But it doesn't translate into its practicality in their lives.  
 That's why you find certain people, you know, they come on television, they tell us what the president should do, what the governors should do.  
They tell us what should be happening, and nothing is happening in their own lives.  
But they seem to know everything.  
And when they speak, people agree with them.  
But they're not changing anything.  
There are social critics.  
You have them everywhere, including in churches.  
 They just seem to know everything that should be done, but they never effect changes.  
Because what they have is not furnaces.  
Furnaces is practical wisdom.  
It's wisdom that translates into your character.  
You see, it's wisdom that is revealed in the things you do.  
That's why Solomon was greater than others.  
 Because the wisdom that he had was furnaces, practical wisdom.  
And the Bible says that he was wiser than all men.  
Where is God?  
Solomon was wiser than all men.  
Can you imagine those one man in this world who was wiser than everybody?  
 And we wouldn't have known that that was possible if the Bible hadn't told us.  
God said so.  
All right.  
When Jesus came, what Jesus said about himself, he said, a greater than Solomon is here.  
He called himself a greater than Solomon in wisdom.  
He talked about Solomon's wisdom and yet declared that he was wiser than Solomon.  
And it's true.  
 And the Bible tells us that He's made that wisdom available to us.  
That wisdom that was better than Solomon's wisdom has been made available to us.  
But how many have taken advantage of that wisdom?  
How many have appropriated that wisdom to their own lives?  
Not many.  
 and how easy it is to have it.  
You don't even have to pray to get it.  
Can you imagine?  
You don't even have to pray to get it.  
Those possibilities of wisdom were made available to your spirit.  
 when you were born again.  
The Bible says, Jesus Christ was made wisdom to us, meaning that when a man receives Christ, he receives the wisdom of God into his spirit.  
And you can channel that wisdom through the understanding of the Word of God, through walking in the light of God's Word, from Sophia to Sinesis.  
Sinesis is the understanding  
 of God's world, the way you view God's world, your ability to comprehend it, is finesse.  
And when you translate that into action and it controls your mind, controls the way you live, then you have the practicality of wisdom.  
That is finesse.  
Did you hear what I said?  
 Okay, now let's read one more scripture.  
Let's see how we can begin immediately to do those things that have the power to shape our lives.  
I want us to go to the Book of James,  
 and chapter number 4.  
Look at James chapter number 4.  
I want us to read verse 17.  
It says, therefore, to him that nowhere to do good  
 And do it, eat not.  
To him it is sin.  
This is practical wisdom.  
The practical wisdom of God doesn't come to you by meditation.  
No, it's the wisdom that God puts there in your spirit.  
 But it is not furnaces until it is put to work because it is a way of life.  
It is a mentality.  
In a New Testament, it's called the wisdom of the just, the wisdom of the righteous, the furnaces of the righteous.  
 And it's remarkable that it's described as the furnaces of the righteous.  
It's remarkable because we just read something in James chapter 4 and verse 17 where it says, therefore to him that nowhere to do good and do it not to him it is sin, which means that man is not walking in furnaces, which is the wisdom of the righteous.  
 So, finesse means that you know what is right and you do what is right.  
Now, others are unlikely to know that thing that is right and therefore to do it.  
Now, some of us will move further and know what is right, but be unable to do it and therefore walk in on righteousness, which is sin.  
By the way, everyone righteousness is sin.  
 Now what it says, therefore to him that no to do good and do it, not to him it is saying it means that that thing is on righteousness.  
So you're not working in righteousness when you know what to do, which is right and then not to do it.  
For example, when we were younger in school, they began to teach us things like picking up leaders.  
 All right?  
We were taught in school that as we went along in the compound, in the school compound, and we saw lasers, it didn't mean that you were the one that put them there.  
They said, pick them up.  
So as you passed by, and you noted some little paper down there, you picked it up, and there was some way for you to drop it.  
They were teaching us practical wisdom.  
 The trouble was that folks who were in charge of the highest schools were not structured to take us on.  
So many of us, when we got into the university, lost that sense.  
Because it didn't go on.  
Most people become more selfish when they get into the university than anywhere else.  
Because in the university,  
 Most, I think they're concerned now about handouts.  
I understand.  
Just the handouts.  
Want to make money.  
Everybody wants to make money.  
But money is a tool.  
And if you don't make your mind, it doesn't matter how much money you make, it's going to fail.  
It's just a matter of time.  
So the people who think that if they just had enough money, everything will be fine.  
No.  
 So begin today to condition your spirit into an excellent character.  
Condition your spirit into an excellent character.  
You know you can have an excellent spirit that is not an excellent character.  
What they were describing for us there, those men had an excellent character.  
 But just because your spirit is born again and you have the Holy Ghost in you who is an excellent spirit doesn't mean that you have an excellent character because you have to develop, condition your spirit to become an excellent character.  
That's why they said the spirit of the gods.  
They thought the spirit of the gods was in Daniel.  
They didn't see it as Daniel's peculiar character.  
 but that it was the Spirit of the Gods that was in him.  
But when you study the Word of God, you find that it was Daniel's peculiar character, as granted him by God.  
And so you also, you have the Holy Spirit, okay?  
Who lives in you?  
Not only that, the Bible says that Christ has been made unto you, wisdom.  
 So, what are you going to do?  
You're going to program your spirit to become an excellent character.  
You're going to program your spirit.  
Are you hearing me?  
You train your spirit to become an excellent character.  
It's a personal training.  
Nobody's going to do it for you.  
 And for that to even begin to happen in your life, you must covet it, you must crave it.  
God didn't say, Solomon, I want to make you wise.  
He didn't say that.  
He said, Solomon, what do you want?  
Solomon said, give me wisdom.  
He asked for wisdom.  
So he wasn't God who was looking for someone to make wise.  
 He was Solomon who wanted God to make him wise.  
And why did Solomon want God to make him wise?  
Because his father had taught him that wisdom was the principal thing.  
So Solomon said, my father taught me.  
My father taught me.  
He said, wisdom is the principal thing.  
Therefore, get wisdom.  
So his father, David, let him know that money was not the principal thing.  
 The kingdom was not the principal thing.  
Friendship with your neighbors was not the principal thing.  
Long life was not the principal thing.  
He said, wisdom is the principal thing.  
Therefore, get wisdom.  
That's what David told Solomon.  
And so when it came to time for God to give him the opportunity to ask for something, he said, wisdom.  
 the principal thing.  
Then God said, Solomon, you didn't ask for the life of your enemies.  
You didn't ask for wealth, money.  
You didn't ask for long life.  
You asked for wisdom.  
Therefore wisdom has granted you so much wisdom that's beyond what this world has ever known.  
And God gave it to you.  
 You see that?  
So begin now, begin now to condition your spirit for the wisdom that God has put within you.  
Then it will dominate your character.  
Then you become a man or woman of wisdom.  
That means a man or woman of excellence.  
What is excellence therefore?  
Can we take that?  
 Interestingly, one of the synonyms of excellence is greatness.  
Did you know?  
Gritness.  
And it does help us to understand what kind of man Abraham was or David who was described as great.  
Now, he was the one who taught his son about wisdom.  
So David was a great man.  
 And if truly greatness is a synonym of excellence, then he was an excellent man.  
Excellence can be related to certain qualities.  
Like they say, that man is an excellent banker.  
It doesn't mean that he is an excellent politician.  
 and he may not be an excellent father.  
You see that?  
But an excellent banker.  
So it could be qualified.  
So excellence is surpassing others.  
It is greatness.  
It is surpassing others.  
 It is extreme beauty.  
And one more word is the word glory.  
So excellence is being glorious.  
All right?  
Excellence also means extraordinary discretion.  
 extraordinary discretion, excellence.  
It means discretion beyond the ordinary.  
That means having excellent perception.  
And that's the difference between the greats and the s'mores.  
 Great people have great visions.  
And great visions don't mean that you have great things you want to do.  
No, it means a wide array or a vast arena of perception, extraordinary amplitude of perception, of vision, the ability to see so much at the same time.  
 So what makes people greater than others has a lot to do with their ability to see?  
So those little things you do outside are things that are actually happening within your spirit.  
So when you pick up those leaders and remove them, what are you doing?  
You're picking up leaders in your own spirit.  
So that's why we are to teach people, help them learn  
 the value and dignity of true label.  
It is not about a salary.  
It is not about a paycheck or maybe meeting financial needs.  
No, it's about character.  
It's about doing something that's actually greater than yourself.  
 That's the value of labor.  
It's not about money.  
And if you can program your spirits, money can never be stopped from coming to you.  
And the more the finer your spirits is attuned, organized that is, in perfected within your system,  
 the greater the resource that come to you.  
The greater the resource that come to you.  
Never forget that.  
All right, let's pray.  
May God help you to see the streets.  
May God help you to live by them.  
May God help you to have for the God  
 condition your spirit.
