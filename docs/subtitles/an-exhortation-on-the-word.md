title: An Exhortation on the Word
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 God's Word.  
The doorway through which light shines and brings illumination on any issue in life.  
You know, when you read of a man as great as David, you should want to know what made him great.  
And if you study his story, you discover he lived beyond his generation, far beyond his generation.  
An extraordinary life.  
He was a success.  
And you know, God only raises a success.  
 In this informative teaching, Pastor Chris reveals how you can live every day through God's Word.  
Listen and be blessed.  
Psalm 119.  
Inverse 105.  


  
 Read it for me, want to go.  


  
Again.  


  
All right.  
Same book and same chapter.  
Turn to verse 130.  


  
 Now what you just read says the word, the word of God is a lamp.  
And it is what?  
A light.  


  
Okay.  
Verse 130.  
Read.  


  
 Again.  


  
The entrance of thy words give it light.  
Now David wrote this and he's talking about God.  
He says the entrance of the Word of God, the entrance.  
He didn't say the buying of the Bible.  
He didn't say the owning of a Bible.  
Somebody said, I have a Bible, I have 10 of them.  
 Well, the Bible says the entrance of God's Word gives light.  
The entrance, when the Word of God enters into your spirit, when the Word gets into your system, it brings you light.  
Which means the man who doesn't have the Word of God in his spirit doesn't have any light.  
 And so he walks in darkness.  
He says, in verse 105 that you read, go back there and read it for me.  
105.  
Again.  


  
 Thy word is a lamp onto my feet and a light onto my parts.  
David, how many of you ever heard of King David, King David of Israel?  
Many, many years ago, the Bible talks about him.  
You heard of David and Goliath.  
Did you ever hear of David?  
Let me see your hand up.  
Okay, now he was a great, great king.  
One of the greatest kings who ever lived.  
 And God testified about him.  
God said of him, a man after my own heart.  
And he wrote most of the Psalms.  
He says, the word is a lamp onto my feet and a light onto my part.  
You know, when you read of a man as great as David, you should want to know what made him great.  
Why was he the way he was?  
 And if you study his story, you discover he lived beyond his generation.  
Far beyond his generation.  
An extraordinary life.  
He was a success.  


  
And you know, God only raises a success.  
He will sponsor no flops.  
 He's a success.  
When God raises you, you'd be a success.  
Hallelujah.  
But he can only do that with his word.  
God reveals himself through his word.  
Now, let me use a simple sound to give you the character of this man, the way he thought about God.  
 in the life that he lived, and why he was so successful.  
A very popular Psalm, Psalm 23.  
You know it, don't you?  
Okay, now let's go right into it.  
Psalm 23, and we'll get it from verse  
 Verse 1, now, look at this man, David.  
And how he writes this, he says, the Lord is my shepherd.  
I shall not want.  
And I'm thinking about the economic situation in many nations of the world.  
Imagine if the people thought like this and said, the Lord is my shepherd.  
Now, most don't know about it.  
Most don't know about it.  
He says, the Lord is my shepherd.  
I shall not want.  
 I shall not lock.  
The Lord is my shepherd.  
I shall not walk.  
He made me lie down in green pastures.  
He leadeth me beside the still waters.  
He restored my soul.  
He leadeth me in the parts of righteousness for his namesake, glory to God.  
 But this is wonderful.  
Look at verse two.  
He make it me to lie down in green pastures.  
He leadeth me beside the still waters.  
He restored my soul.  
He leadeth me in the parts of righteousness for his name's sake.  
Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me.  
Notice he didn't say, for thou shalt be with me.  
 Oh God, I pray that you would be with me.  
You didn't say that.  
For thou art with me.  
He was comforted of the presence of God with you.  
What would your life be like if you knew that God was with you?  
If you knew.  
Now let's look at it.  
If you weren't guessing, you knew that God was with you.  
What decisions would you make?  
 What steps would you take?  
How bold would you be?  
What would you do in your life if you knew that God was with you?  
And look at this.  
He says he's here.  
 Verse four, yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.  
Doesn't matter where I go through, he says, I will fear no evil.  
For thou, with me, thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.  
Thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies.  
He's not afraid of his enemies.  
I don't care about his enemies.  
He says, thou preparest the table before me in the presence of my enemies.  
 He's not asking for the death of his enemies.  
He's not asking for that destruction.  
He says, God prepares a table before me in the presence of my enemies.  
He says, I'm having a glorious stand right in their presence.  
Hallelujah.  
Now prepare as a table before me in the presence of my enemies.  
Thou unknown as my head with oil, my cup, run it over.  
 Surely, I like this, surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  
I just wanted you to see the kind of man David was from this simple sound.  
Let me read you another one.  
 from the book of Psalms 119 and verse 130 and he said the entrance of thy words give it light the entrance of thy words the entrance of thy words give it light light comes from God's word  
 And you know, the Word of God made the Word, the Word of God created the Word.  


  
Man needs the light of God to live in this world, to function here.  


  
 Every man needs the word of God to function at their best potentials.  
You think man has done great things.  
Of course, man has, but think what he would do if he functioned at his best.  
If you think what we've seen is wonderful,  
 Think what will happen if we function by revelation.  
Now we have a lot of trial, error, you know, we try a lot, work a lot, to try to make things happen, and we've tried a great deal.  
Through the sciences and the arts, we've achieved a lot.  
But think what will happen when we deal with reality.  
 When we function at our best potentials, think what will happen.  
When we minimize our errors, you know, one of the definitions of success is the ability to minimize your errors, learning to do the right thing the first time, to get it right the first time.  
 Did you know that's one of the things that Jesus Christ came to make possible for us?  
Did you know that that's one of the definitions of righteousness?  
It's called perfection.  
Getting it right.  
Thinking right.  
Talking right.  
Walking right.  
So when you do what you do, it's just right.  
 You know, sometimes Christians are told, nobody's perfect.  
We'll never be perfect.  
And so, you won't know where to get that from.  
And everybody picks it up.  
We'll never be perfect on the side of heaven.  
Who said?  
Who said?  


  
Now imagine you got into an airplane.  
 and you're traveling from his thing to Los Angeles.  
As soon as you sat down and fastened your seat belts, you heard the pilot say, as you all know, ladies and gentlemen, nothing in the world is perfect.  
I mean, you'd be thinking about the door.  
You'd want to come out.  


  
 Imagine you're getting to the operation room.  


  
And these doctors with their masks on stand around you.  
And they said, before we begin this surgery, we just want you to know that nothing in the world is perfect.  
We're just going to open you up and try to find out what's wrong with you.  
 You say, who's the fool who brought me here?  
See, we expect perfection in certain things because we've been given the idea that such things should be perfect.  
That's why we expect that perfection.  
But if we're told we're not to expect it, then our abilities, our expectations, our potentials just go down.  
 And that's what's happening in the church.  
God says, be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.  
Then we bring back Him and say, no, sir, it's not possible.  
God knew it was possible.  
That's why He said it.  
Perfection is at different stages.  
When you understand perfection, you realize we're not talking about being a perfectionist.  
 Perfection is at different stages.  
It's like success.  
Success in life is at different stages.  
At a certain level of your life, you're a success.  
At least you try to be.  
And you can become good.  
Some of you might have seen the Olympics.  
All right?  
Great.  
There's some who are coming there the third time.  
 Some of them started wondering quite young in their lives at different levels.  
They've been very successful.  
Some of them tried at their state level, before the state, maybe the local government level, city level, state level, then the whole country, then in the region, and finally at the Olympics.  
They were successful at different stages.  


  
 That's the way it defines success at different stages of life.  
The things you've got to face, the things you've got to work on, and when the time comes for your final examinations as it were, you prove yourself.  
And then you live at that level and celebrate your life at that level until the next challenges, the next stage.  
That's the same thing with perfection.  
 You become perfect at this level.  
And you've got to understand this.  
Until you become perfect at a certain level, God's not going to promote you to the next level.  
And so if we keep teaching people that they'll never be perfect, forget about perfection.  
We just keep striving towards it.  
Why is striving towards something you will never attain?  
All the teaching of the Word of God  
 is about perfection.  
But because men have misunderstood the concept of perfection, they teach against it.  
So my Heavenly Father is perfect.  
Jesus is perfect.  
The Holy Spirit is perfect.  
And the Holy Spirit lives in me.  
I will walk in perfection and become perfect.  
 in this life and in different stages of my life.  
Thank you.  
Imagine if you had this mentality years before now.  
Think what you have done with your life.  
Glory to God.  
 Not too late.  
You're on your way, amen.  
So he said, the entrance of thy words, give it light.  
It give it understanding to the simple.  
And the very young ones will be wondering, what's give it?  
Give it his gifts from King James Bible.  
The entrance of your words gives light.  
 the entrance of God's words.  
If God's words enter into you, they will give you lights.  
And unique that lights in this world, the light of God in this world.  
The function in this world.  
You need it.  
Let's read another portion.  
Proverbs chapter 9.  
 and I'm reading from verse nine.  
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser.  
Did you hear that?  
Give instruction.  
He's dealing here with spiritual instruction.  
He says, give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser.  
Teach a just man, a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.  
 Can you imagine that's what's going to happen to you tonight?  
I share with you the Word of God and give spiritual instruction and because you're wise, you'll become wiser.  
It says teach a just man and he will increase in learning.  
The next verse, verse 10.  
 He says, the fee of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  
And the knowledge of the holy is understanding.  
You know what he's talking about here?  
The knowledge of the holy.  
The recognition of the holy.  
 The knowledge of the holy is understanding.  
Do you know that which is holy?  
What does it mean by holy here?  
Holy here means sanctified, separated.  
That which is cut out for God, sanctified by God.  
What God has separated onto himself.  
For example, going to the house of God is the knowledge of the holy.  
Knowing that God has chosen that we should go to his house at certain times for worship.  
 Now if you're a Christian and you don't go to the house of God for worship, you are ignorant of the Holy.  
Christians are told to give their offerings and then you don't give your offerings.  
You don't recognize the Holy because for everything that God blesses you with, he demands that you give him an offering.  
He also demands that you give him a tithe.  
 So you recognize your tithes and say, this is holy unto the Lord.  
The teapat is holy unto the Lord.  
It says the knowledge of the holy is understanding.  
But not many know.  
And this will help you understand why there are many Christians who are living a life of a failure.  
And they're struggling.  
 And I wonder, I'm a Christian, why isn't this working out?  
Get this.  
For those who say, I've been a Christian several years, Christianity hasn't done something for me.  
Christianity doesn't do something for you.  
Make no mistakes about it.  
You do something with your Christianity.  
The question will not be, what has Christianity done for me?  
The question will be, what have you done with your Christianity?  
 You don't say the word has done nothing for me.  
No, what have you done with the word?  
You've been thinking the wrong way to expect that the word is going to do something for you.  
The word doesn't do something for you.  
The word was given to you to live by.  
Do something with the word.  
Do something with your Christianity.  
So the difference between us will be what we have done with that which God gave us.  
 He says, the knowledge of the Holy is understanding, understanding.  
Let me give you an answer.  
You know, Jesus told a parable of a man, the man who went for it to sow, to sow seeds.  
He said, when this sow went for it to sow, some seeds fell by the wayside.  
And the birds of the year came and picked them up.  
And so nothing happened because the seeds never got sown.  
 Then he says, and some fail in the hard ground, and some among thorns, and some on good ground.  
But I want to pick the first one, the seeds that fell by the wayside and were picked up.  
You know what Jesus said in explaining that.  
He said, those  
 seeds that fell by the wayside represent those who hear the word of God and don't understand it.  
He says, and because they don't understand it, Satan comes immediately.  
I don't understand the word immediately.  
He doesn't wait.  
 He says, because they don't understand that Satan comes immediately and takes the word that was sown in their hearts, meaning that the word actually got into them, but because they didn't understand, they didn't receive the word into their spirits.  
And so Satan came and stole the word from them.  
And there was no result.  
 Or does that tell us, understanding is important, understanding.  
If you listen, you will understand.  
If you choose to understand, you will understand.  
If you keep saying, I don't understand, you close the door of understanding.  
So open the door of understanding.  
Because Jesus said, you are of the kingdom.  
And he says, you understand the mysteries of the kingdom of God because they belong to you.  
Say, I understand the word.  
 Say again, I understand the word.  
Of course I belong to Jesus Christ.  
That's it.  
So when you talk like this and think like this, say it and it cannot stop you.  
It cannot confuse you.  
So your life is directed with your tongue.  
That tongue you got inside your mouth was not given to you for ice cream and, you know, it wasn't given to you.  
 A cousin making noise, he was given to you to charge your cause in life.  
That thing in your mouth, that little tongue is the determinant factor of your whole life from this earth to heaven or hell.  
Did you know that?  
 Jesus said, by thy words, thou shalt be justified and by thy words, thou shalt be condemned.  
So if you're going to be justified, it will be by your words.  
If you're going to be condemned, it will be by your words.  
If you will walk in hell and be successful in this life, let me tell you something about success.  
I believe in all around success.  
Success.  
 Not, path success.  
Path success is not success.  
Full success.  
You believe that?  
Yeah, be successful because you belong to Christ.  
And that's why I like to help Christians understand what they received when Jesus Christ came into their hearts.  
You need to know what you got.  
You didn't get religion.  
This is not religion.  
 You're ready now?  
Okay.  
Ah, no, no, no.  
Good to sound one.  
You'd like this one.  
It's short, but it's powerful.  


  
Listen to what he's saying here, from verse one.  
 someone, very for some, is blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the on Godly, the counsel, the advice of sin.  
This is the man who doesn't follow the counsel of the on Godly is blessed.  
Most people follow the counsel of the on Godly.  
No wonder they're not walking in the blessing of God.  
Doesn't matter that they are religious,  
 Doesn't matter that they've been in church a long, long time.  
They cannot walk in the blessing of God because the following the counsel of the ungodly.  
Look at this.  
He says, blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.  
Not standing in the way of sin as not sitting in the seat of the scumful.  
But he's the light.  
He's in the Lord, the Lord.  
He's talking about the word of God.  
 And in his lord he meditate day and night.  
Now he always says about this man, verse three.  
And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bring it for this fruit in his season.  
His leaf also shall not wither.  
He is God.  
How are you following this?  
Look at the lot of part of that verse.  
Read that for me.  


  
 And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.  
Anything he does works.  


  
That's talking about me.  
Whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.  
Look at it, the game says, and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water.  
 He's fully supplied, never owns dry.  
That bringing forth his food in his season, his leaf horse who shall not wither, his leaf horse who shall not wither, in whatsoever he doeth, whatsoever, whatsoever, anything, whatsoever he doeth, shall prosper.  
 Then he says, the ungodly are not so.  
The ungodly are not so.  
But I like the shaft which the wind drive it away.  
Therefore, the ungodly shall not stand in the charge of the noceres in the congregation of the righteous.  
For the Lord knew at the way of the righteous, for the way of the ungodly shall perish.  
Very touching.  
 You know, Jesus came to this world for a reason.  
He came to this world for a reason.  
Now many times, those who wonder why did Jesus come?  
Or did he come to do?  
He didn't come to his dad and not a religion.  
No, he didn't come to start the Christian religion.  
Because real Christianity is no religion.  
Jesus didn't come to start a religion.  
He's not a religious leader.  
 Of course, you know, most of the world thinks he's the head of the Christian religion.  
And he's not the head of the Christian religion.  
The Christian religion must have some religious head.  
I don't know who that is.  
You sure not, Jesus?  
Jesus is the Son of God.  
 He's the creator of the world.  
He made the world.  
This is the reason.  
A lot of people who study the environment and they know how bad the word is.  
They know how bad the universe is.  


  
 They can't comprehend the idea that someone, some personality would have created this whole universe.  
It's too big to think like anyone could have done that.  
Yeah?  
That just should tell you how big he is.  
Because he made it anyway.  
He did.  
 The Bible says he did.  
Oh, somebody said, oh, no, the Bible.  
That ancient book, ancient book, how dare you?  
It's more than an ancient book.  
It's truth, truth revealed.  
The Bible has been proved, tested, tested again and again through many generations.  
It's no book for religion.  
 It is the word of God.  
You know, there are those who say that the different religions, and since there are different religions, every religion comes with its own book.  
And their book is their guiding principle.  
Well, this book, the Bible, is more than a guiding principle.  
It is.  
 the authentic word of God, spoken by prophets from different generations, thousands of years apart, and they're all in agreement.  
And they all have the same theme, Jesus Christ's, the Son of God, whom God proved to be his son by the resurrection from the dead.  


  
 Resurrected and never died again Outside of Jesus Jesus Christ son of the living God and you know the most beautiful part about Jesus I said beautiful not the most important But the most beautiful first  
 His birth was a miracle.  
All right?  
He was born of a virgin.  
His life was an unending stream of the miraculous and supernatural.  
It started three years.  
Miracle after miracle.  
What an account.  
Dear God, what an account.  
 as life was such a supernatural life during his story.  
Then, his death was a miracle.  
 He said his death, of course, his death was a miracle.  
The Bible tells us he was crucified.  
Now those who got crucified, for he wasn't the only one who was crucified in his day, they crucified those that they found guilty of some crime.  
And Jesus wasn't a criminal, but he died of criminal's death.  
He was condemned.  
 unjustly.  
But that's not the point.  
Here's the point.  
It often took at least 13 hours for someone who was crucified to finally die.  
In six hours, this man, Jesus, would command his own death.  
Or is hanging there.  
It cries out, Father, why have you forsaken me?  
 And he thought, what did he say that?  
Well, the Bible tears us because he was made sin.  
You've got to study the Bible more to find that out.  
Well, the Bible tears us that the sin, our sins were laid on Jesus.  
And at the moment, there are sins were laid on him.  
The Bible tears us, the Father is so righteous.  
He doesn't look at sin.  
And it turned his back on his son, Jesus, for he had become sin.  
 who knew no sin, but it was in the plan that he should die for us.  
Anyway, then he said, it is finished.  
He was done.  
He was completed.  
And you know, the Bhagavatiras, there's one more thing.  
They're listening to him.  
 the coming closer to hear what he's saying.  
Some said, is he calling Elijah?  
Or who's he talking to?  
The king closer to listen to him.  
And then, right in the presence, he says, father, into your hands, I command my spirit.  
And he gave up his spirit.  
And his head dropped.  
 And he died.  
They said, that's not possible.  
The Romans and Jiren said, that's not possible.  
No, it could be dead, but he was.  
And it took a spare and thrushed through his side blood and water came out.  
He said, he's dead.  
In six hours, he commanded his undead.  
His death was a miracle.  
Then, of course, he was buried.  
 The thought day, the Bible terraces, God raised him from the dead.  
And he was seen by many others.  
But the most beautiful part for me is what I want to tell you.  
For 40 days and 40 nights after his resurrection, Jesus was teaching his disciples things concerning the kingdom of God.  
Until finally, they were gathered together with him.  
 He had made an appointment with them in Galilee.  
And while he was talking with them, suddenly Jesus has lifted by the Spirit.  
He's a foot off the ground.  
Strange, strange, strange.  
 They think, what are we seeing?  
And then his three feet off the ground and five and 10 and 20 and Jesus is in the air.  
And they're looking at him.  
What would you think?  
And then remember, remember, remember, Mary was there.  
 I think Mira wasn't surprised because, you know, she had had the visitation from the angel.  
So before the little baby was born, this miracle baby, okay?  
So she knew exactly who Jesus was.  
This is the son of God, but I don't think she was prepared for this.  
And then his brothers from the same mother were there.  
 His sisters were there.  
They grew up in the same home.  
Think about this.  
They're watching him and he's in the air.  
They're at with him.  
They knew him.  
They knew he said he was the sort of God, but they didn't quite believe that.  
 They thought he had been telling some stories.  
I mean, Mom and Dad really said something about his dead, maybe because they're old, they forgot some things.  
Because the Bible says his brothers didn't believe in him.  
Now something happens, and Jesus isn't there.  
And they're looking at him, and he's not stopping, he's still going upward.  
Is this real?  
 and they clean out their eyes, he's still there.  
And it's going upward.  
And they keep looking, miracle of all miracles.  
Jesus ascends before their very eyes, goes beyond the clouds.  
Dear God, I think it was time for his brothers to pass out.  
 Because now they find that one they grew up with in their home was truly the Son of God.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, I've thought about it again and again and again.  
What a life.  
 Oh, how did they go home that day?  
What went through their minds as they went back into the city?  
Who would you tell that Jesus of Nazareth, that the crowd saw crucified?  
Who would you tell that this man not only was raised from the dead, but that he went beyond the clouds and went into the heavens?  
You saw him with your eyes.  
They'll think you're crazy.  
Who are you gonna tell?  
 How do you tell this kind of story?  
It's 2000 years and was still telling it.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Christianity is no religion.  
It is the power set in life of Christ and the human being.  
It is divinity at work in humanity.  
It's no religion at all.  
 If you've come to Christ, you haven't embraced the religion.
