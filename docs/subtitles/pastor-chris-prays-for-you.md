 Leprechaun de la Gossapataya, Prada Babaskia, Lando, Lando, Lando!  
We're going to touch him against them!  
Shav Prasma!

No evil shav before them!

 Is there anyone that's discouraged?  
Is there anyone who is straying away, straying from the Gospel, walking in darkness, when there is the light of life?  
Oh, with the Spatch Ministry in spirit, so go forward and cast and come back in the name of Jesus.  
We pray that the Word of God will be stared up again in the hearts.  
 for the love of Christ to be real to them again.  
The Masatara-Kawal-Dunna-Go-Settiki.  
Oh, that the paraboholigos will come upon every one of them.  
In the name of Jesus, the Para-Kaw-Tara-Badavas.  
And some of you are worried about your kids.  
Lord Rabakas-Settiri-Bakon-Taw-Raba-Sattaka-Raba-De-Gede-Ocea.  
 Because of you, that child would turn out well.  
In a mighty name of Jesus, I repute the hand of Satan from that child.  
I repute foolishness from that child.  
I turn away the hand of evil from that child.  
 and release wisdom, guidance, and the presence of God is over your children.  


  
They have helped by the Holy Ghost, by the Holy Ghost, by the Holy Ghost.  
 And even I see like a sickness and infirmity.  


  
That doesn't seem to be going away.  
In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  
I rebuke that evil.  
I command it to depart from your home.  
To depart from your family.  
In the name of Jesus.  


  
 The Word of God is producing resource for you.  


  
The faith that has come into your spirit through the Word is working.  
It's producing resource.  
There's divine favor for you in the name of Jesus.  
You have health.  
You have strength.  
 No discouragement for you.  
No despondency for you.  
In the name of Jesus Christ.  
Oh, glory to God.  
This is thou shall be saved and thy house.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
Restoration.  
Yes.  
Healing.  
Yes.  
 Yes, prosperity, yes.  
Yes, Macha Caraba City.  
The light is shining in every home in the mighty name of Jesus.  
Oh, thank you Holy Spirit.  
Thank you.  
Thank you.

Is there someone with a missing eyeball?  
Is there someone who needs a new heart, a new lung, new kidneys that will receive now in the mighty name of Jesus Christ?  


  
 Maybe there's someone who's missing and the family members have not found him or have for a long time.  
The Holy Ghost goes out to bring him back to the open for their family in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.  


  
 The Holy Ghost knows where he is, the Holy Ghost knows where she is, and they are coming out of obscurity in the mighty name of Jesus.  
 In thy way!

 We are praying for all pregnant women in the church, all of our sisters that are expected, all expected mothers.  
In us, we intercede, no complications.  
We decree in the name of Jesus every pregnancy will carry its full cost and the child will be born healthy, strong as a blessing to the family in the name of Jesus.  
 We come against accidents.  
We come against mishandling of doctors.  
We come against wrong prescriptions in the name of Jesus.  
We release angels to guide them and to lead them in the name of Jesus.  
We decree hair for the mother.  
We decree hair for the baby in the name of Jesus.  
 No doctor will mislead them.  
No nurses will mislead them.  
Father, because your angels are with them, in the name of Jesus, and they're going to give birth, and we're going to dedicate those babies in the name of Jesus.  
Somebody shout hallelujah.  
Oh, thank you.
