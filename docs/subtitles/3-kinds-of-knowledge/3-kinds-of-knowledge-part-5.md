title: 3 Kinds of Knowledge Part 5
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 There is that everyday knowledge founded on intellectual ability with which you can solve natural problems.  
No matter what your life is like, if you will give attention to God's word, it will build you up mentally, it will build you up spiritually, it will build you up physically, it will build you up financially, the word of God will build you life and make you a success.  
 What there is that superior knowledge God gives with which you gain mastery over circumstances and become a supernatural success in any and everything you do.  
What you need for success is not a job from somewhere.  
What you need for success is not a money from somewhere.  
What you need for success is not somebody somewhere to talk for you.  
What you need for your success is what John said.  
He said, I write on to you that you may become a way.  
 that you may know that he has the way.  
In Richard's spirit with the knowledge of God's word, as you listen to part five of this six part live transforming message by Pastor Chris titled three kinds of knowledge.  
It doesn't matter what field you're into.  
It doesn't matter where you work.  
It doesn't matter what kind of business you're into or profession.  
 When you're filled with the knowledge of His will, as you meditate on God's Word and you're brought into this kind of knowledge, what happens is you begin, you begin to function with all wisdom, insight into reality.  
You know beyond what you see.  
God bless you as you listen.  
The Father, we worship you.  
We honor you.  
 We thank you for your love.  
We thank you for your grace.  
We thank you for your kindness.  
Our hearts and our minds are open to hear and receive the word of God in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Amen.  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
You may be seated.  
 All right, so we're talking about three kinds of knowledge.  
We had an expos√© on Colossians chapter 3 and verse 10, where his terraces about the new man being renewed in knowledge.  
And I want us to take off from there very quickly.  


  
 So we will read Colossians thought chapter, but we will begin from the night verse.  
 And it says, line not one to another, saying that he had put off the old man with his deeds.  
He had put off the old nature with his deeds.  
Did you notice he didn't say you should put off or that you're trying to put off?  
He says, you have put off the old man with his deeds.  
In verse 10, he had put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.  
And we explained that on Wednesday night.  
 I told you that the word renewed has to do with something that's progressive, something that's continuous, not just a one-time action, but something that's progressive.  
Secondly, that is not in terms of how recent it is, in other words, not in recency, but in qualitative difference.  
We explain that.  
 went on to the fact that it happens through epignosis.  
That's the kind of knowledge we're talking about.  
In that knowledge, he says, you are brought in to that image of him that created you.  
That's your human spirit, the new man that has been created in God.  
So you become more and more like the one who created you.  
Praise the Lord.  
 So that's in verse 10, Colossians, the third chapter.  
And we explained a lot of things.  
And we went further to talk about several beautiful things, which we do not have the time to go into today.  
But we are moving forward.  
 This time we're looking at what should we have knowledge of?  
Because in that verse 10, I thought chapter Colossians, he says that the new man is renewed in knowledge, after the image of him that created him, renewed in knowledge.  
What kind of knowledge?  
What should we have knowledge of?  
Is he just talking about knowledge of science and technology?  
No.  
 We explained already that that kind of knowledge is called Gnosis in the Greek and refers to scientific knowledge, knowledge with scholastic erudition.  
You understand?  
You're dealing with mental activity.  
So that's not the kind of knowledge he's talking about this time.  
He's looking at revelation knowledge.  
 He's looking at exploring with your spirit, the revelations of God, to the point that you have exact knowledge, full knowledge, because in that arena, there are no assumptions.  
Praise God.  
In human knowledge, they have plus or minus.  
Okay?  
I say, well, I am looking at maybe and maybe not.  
 Well, in God's knowledge, he says it is or it is not.  
He is specific.  
Plus that, he gives you full knowledge.  


  
No bots.  
Hallelujah.  
 Okay, so what should we have knowledge of?  
What should we have this kind of knowledge of?  
That prognosis knowledge.  
Okay, this kind of knowledge.  
What should we know?  
Number one is the knowledge of God.  
Are you there?  
The knowledge of God.  
He wants us to have this knowledge of God.  
This knowledge that you explore with your spirit and get to know God.  
 Hallelujah.  
No wonder he tells us to grow in grace.  
Amen.  
How can you grow in grace without this kind of knowledge?  
Grace is the beauty of God in your life.  
Grace is the favorite God in your life.  
And to grow in all of that, you must have a certain type of knowledge.  
 And this is that type of knowledge.  
Second Peter.  
The second the piezo of Peter.  
 Chapter number one, and I'm reading from verse one, Simon, Peter, or servant in an apostle Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God in our Savior Jesus Christ.  
Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, amen.  
Grace and peace can be multiplied in your life through the hypnosis of God  
 in of Jesus our Lord.  
So the first knowledge he wants us to have is the knowledge of God, the knowledge of God.  
Right there in verse 2, he says, through the knowledge of God in of Jesus our Lord.  
We can know God.  
We can have full and exact knowledge of God.  
Hallelujah.  
If we couldn't, he wouldn't have said this.  
 He wouldn't have told us how grace and peace could be multiplied in our lives.  
Look at verse three.  
According, oh boy, do I love this.  
Oh, I'm inspired just to think of it.  
Look at it, verse three.  
According as he's divine power, hath given unto us, hath granted us, graciously given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.  
 through the big noses of him that have called us to glory and excellence.  
The word glory there is Greek Doxah, meaning, meaning, honor, power, glory, you understand?  
Oh, you're called to honor.  
 Think about it.  
Distinction.  
And he uses what says, in virtue, you call the virtue excellence.  
There's something about you.  
This is your calling.  
 Look at it again, according to us, He's divine power.  
It's the power God that did it.  
He says He's divine power, hath given unto us, hath already done it.  
He's not trying to do it, He's already done it, hath given unto us all things, not some things, but all things.  
Everything that's necessary for life and godliness, He's already given us.  
How?  
Through the hypnosis of Him.  
 this kind of knowledge.  
You see, that's why when you're still a baby in Christ, you do not experience that glorious life because it has granted you as you know, as you brought more into that knowledge.  
You're brought into an arena of understanding of deep spiritual things.  
 You know, you buy toys for children.  
And they play with toys.  
You know, as a kid, you had a toy car or a toy that's in a toy that you didn't have the real thing.  
But when you grew up, you got the real one.  
You understand?  
This happens.  
He's divine power.  
Have granted us.  
 bestowed on us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the exact knowledge of him that are called us to glory and virtue.  
What a life.  
I said, what a life.  
Look at Ephesians chapter 1.  
 You see, no wonder he's just being born again, not of corruption, but of incorruptive power.  
The Word of God, I'll leave it and abandon it forever.  
He's letting us know the kind of life that we've been given.  
The kind of life that we've been given.  
Have you seen it?  
All right, read verse 17.  
Oh, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may what?  
 the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the prognosis of him.  
He wanted to have this type of knowledge.  
If you couldn't have it, he wouldn't pray to God that he should have it.  
 And remember, this is a prayer of the spirits.  
Paul was praying for the church at Ephesus.  
And it's been written for us so we can understand how to pray for the church.  
So this is the prayer of the spirit for the church.  
At the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,  
 may give unto you the spirit of wisdom.  
Wisdom is insight into reality.  
I know there's a lot of definition of wisdom you find in several different dictionaries, but you see the spirit of God, the Holy Ghost granted me that definition of wisdom.  
Because a lot of people don't know what wisdom is.  
 They define wisdom as practical knowledge or they define it as the ability to use knowledge.  
But you see, that's not wisdom.  
They're looking at the lower level of wisdom.  
Wisdom is a force.  
 Wisdom is something that works in you.  
It causes you to think the way you ought to think about certain things.  
It causes you to act in a certain way that brings you success and prosperity and victory, that puts you in the will of God.  
It causes you to function.  
It causes you to do.  
That's what wisdom is.  
It makes you say what you ought to say that is exactly right.  
It takes you to the exact place where you ought to be.  
That's wisdom.  
 You make the right decisions without a reasoning.  
You just know what to do.  
Wisdom is insight into reality.  
You just get... Hello?  
You seem to be functioning in God.  
That's what wisdom is.  
No one in the poor says, we speak wisdom.  
Among them, that I'm at home.  
 This is among them that are perfect.  
We speak wisdom, the wisdom of God.  
Why?  
Because we have insight into reality.  
So we speak wisdom.  
He says we speak the wisdom of God.  
He didn't say we speak with wisdom.  
He says we speak wisdom.  
We talk wisdom.  
Why?  
This is insight into reality.  
Now the lady is pregnant.  
They said, well, it's a tumor.  
 I don't have another tumor inside.  
I've got a baby inside.  
How do you know?  
How can you find that?  
How do you know that?  
Insight into reality.  
Mr. Doctor, this is a baby.  
But you see, if you have a prognosis, it'll work.  
You see, there are different kinds of knowledge.  
 He says that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation, revelation in the knowledge of Him, in the knowledge of Him.  
Hallelujah.  
I like the next verse, but that's not for today.  
That one is too powerful.  
Hallelujah.  
 the eyes of your understanding.  
Thank you, Hallelujah.  
Okay, now let's go to the next one.  
So the first thing you want us to know, have this kind of knowledge of is God, the knowledge of God, have the knowledge of God, Hallelujah.  
Then we'll look at  
 The next thing, what else should you have a diagnosis of?  
So you write down, number two, the knowledge, now the first one is the number one, the knowledge of God.  
And then we have these verses.  
I can just give you two more verses to look at, Colossians 1, verse 10, and then 2 Peter  
 Chapter one verse eight, so you can use that for your personal study.  
Now, number two, the knowledge of every good thing which is in you.  
The knowledge of every good thing which is in you.  
You see, we're talking about having a prognosis, and we are saying what should we have a prognosis of?  
We said first, we should have a prognosis of God.  
 And that includes our Lord Jesus Christ.  
Amen.  
Knowing God, knowing Jesus.  
Secondly, we should have a big nusses of every good thing which is in us.  
Fill him in verse number six.  
Look at it.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
 What does it say?  
Would you read it together?  
Want to go.  
That the communication?  
Yes.  
That the communication of thy faith may become effectual.  
By the acknowledging  
 of every, that word, acknowledge in there, that word, that's where he's talking about hypnosis.  
That word is gotten from the Greek hypnosis.  
Acknowledging of every good thing, which is in you, in Christ Jesus.  
Say this with me, no bad thing in me.  
 I know sometimes some of you who study in Romans chapter 7, you find Paul saying, in my flesh, there is no good thing.  
All right?  
That's in my flesh, he says.  
In my flesh, flesh, flesh.  
Now, he doesn't mean in my body.  
He means in my senses, my brain work.  
Nothing excellent.  
 We don't get the right picture.  
That's why we've been given wisdom.  
So we can have insight into reality.  
You understand that?  
But in us, there's every good saying.  
Now it says, I want you to know every good thing that is in you.  
Because if you do, look at it again.  
It says that the communication of thy faith.  
Now, if I've been thinking to myself, how am I going to be an effective Christian?  
 How am I going to be an effective witness for Jesus Christ?  
Some people say, I have received the Holy Spirit, but still, I don't really know how to preach the gospel.  
Even though I've received the Holy Spirit, I've never won a soul to Jesus.  
Even though I've received the Holy Spirit, I've not been able to communicate my faith properly.  
Look at it now.  
 Sometimes some people say, well, I've been a Christian for a long time.  
One of the reasons I find it difficult to preach is because in my own life, I don't really see the results.  
So I have difficulty sharing my faith with somebody else because I don't really see the result.  
I want to see the result in my life first.  
Ha ha ha, this is what you need.  
It says that the communication of thy faith may become effectual.  
How?  
By the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you, in Christ Jesus.  
 I want you to get to know by revelation every good thing that is in you.  
Not only does it come by that revelation, Ginorsco, but that there is a further understanding of it as you plug into it with your faith open, your eyes open.  
You look in the realm of the Spirit and you see it.  
You see it.  
 You see it by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you, which is in you.  
Do you know those good things that are in you?  
What are they?  
What are they?  
Talk to me quick.  
What are they?  
Number one, you said something earlier.  
Is it the anointing?  
And that's powerful.  
The anointing is in you.  
He says, but the anointing which you have received, abided in you.  
 The anointing is in you.  
Have you acknowledged that anointing?  
Do you know that anointing is in you?  
Now, this is not just an awareness.  
We're not talking about just the awareness of it.  
We're not talking about knowing that there is an anointing in you.  
It's more than that.  
He says, by the epicnosis.  
Meaning, study more about it through the spirits.  
 learn more about the anointing, because it's seen you.  
If you can know what the anointing is, it will put you over.  
Can you say amen?  
Amen.  
By the hypnosis of every good thing.  
Now, if you step least in these good things, you can pick the first one and say, that the communication of my faith, see, the communication of my faith may become  
 effectual by the acknowledging of the anointing which is in me.  
I recognize the anointing which is in me.  
I discern the anointing which is in me.  
Exact knowledge.  
I know.  
 I know that the anointing is in me.  
You see, when you have that kind of knowledge, they can't take it from you.  
Nothing, no situation, no circumstance of life.  
Nothing in the world can take it from you.  
No happenings can take it from you.  
See, that's why he says, I want you to have the exact knowledge, the full knowledge.  
When it becomes full knowledge, it becomes your property.  
You know it, you know it.  
 You know it.  
And when you know it, it doesn't matter what's going on.  
You say, I'm anointed.  
I'm anointed.  
I refuse to be afraid.  
I'm anointed.  
I refuse to fear.  
I'm anointed, hallelujah.  
I'm anointed.  
I fear no evil.  
 Then you understand how David got such an understanding?  
I fear no evil.  
Is it though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death?  
I fear no evil.  
I fear no evil.  
I fear no evil.  


  
 No, think about it.  
Think about coming to that place where you know you fear no evil.  
No, think about it.  
How do you come there by the hypnosis of the anointing?  
I fear no evil.  
He said, the Lord is my light and my salvation.  
He said, whom shall I fear?  
 whom shall I fear?  
He said, Lord, He's the strength of my life.  
Hey!  
Hey!  
The Lord is the strength of my life.  
Of whom shall I be afraid?  


  
 Let me tell you, I hear there are lots of prayer books around.  
Don't buy them.  
They're nonsense.  
When you're reading a prayer against your enemy, you don't need it.  


  
 Look what David said.  
He said, when my enemies and my foes came up against me to heat up my flesh, there's thunder and fear.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 He said, though I know it should come up against me.  
My heart shall not fear.  
The war should rise up against me.  
He said, in this, will I be confident?  
He said, there's only one thing I've asked for.  
Only one thing I desire.  
He says, it's the presence of God.  
To dwell in his presence.  
 That one, my Messiah, can't let her be so.  
That, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah.  
Hey, did you know that one thing that David prayed for?  
That one thing he said, one thing that I desire of the Lord, and that will I seek after.  
That has been granted us.  


  
 what he was praying for.  
The only thing he said I prayed for has been given us.  
He said that I am a dwell in the house of the Lord, to behold his beauty, to inquire in his temple.  
He said that's one thing I desire, but we were burning him.  
We dwell in him.  
We are.  


  
 We carry, listen, we are His living tabernacle.  
We carry His divine presence.  
We are in Him.  
He is in us, one divine creation.  
Everywhere we go, we carry that presence with us.  
David had the unknown and come on here.  
We have it inside.  


  
 When you're reading in second Corinthians chapter three, in verse five, I want to read it to me.  
Second Corinthians chapter three.  
Have you seen it?  
Tell us somebody, I love the word.  
Hallelujah.  
Can't you, right now as we're starting, can't you feel your spirit being lifted?  
That's what it is.  
And when this is sustained,  
 When it is sustained, it stays.  
It stays because you've had enough time.  
That's what meditation is.  
You spend time on it.  
That's why we say, come here again on Wednesday so that, you know, we eat some more and press down, chicken together, running over.  
Hallelujah.  
 That's what it is.  
Did you ever listen to our series on the new Superman?  
Oh, that's the way to get there.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
All right, have you found it?  
Second Corinthians chapter three and verse five, read it to me.  


  
 Now that's so powerful.  
It says not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves.  
This is but our sufficiency.  
The Greek word there is ability.  
It says our ability is of God.  
Now that is mind-blowing.  
It is mind-blowing.  
Why?  
Do you know what you're being told?  
 No wonder.  
Thank God that He sent the Holy Spirit.  
Because He knew our human minds would have never been able to accept these facts.  
These are facts.  
These are present tense facts.  
This is our ability is of God.  
I'm not sure that you have yet comprehended what I've said.  
 when it's our abilities of God.  
It's not in the religious thinking.  
In the Old Testament where he would say, the battle is not your battle.  
The battle is the Lord's battle.  
 So you say, well, I don't depend on my strength.  
I depend on God's strength.  
In other words, I'm looking up to God.  
God's going to do something about it.  
That's not what he's saying.  
What he's saying is that the ability that's functioning in you is the ability of God working in you.  
You haven't gotten it.  
 He's saying that divine ability has been made available to us.  
It is at our disposal.  
You haven't gotten it yet.  
Go to Colossians chapter one.  
Maybe this will help you.  
Go to Colossians chapter one.  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  


  
 If you're coming here for the first time and I'm shouting like this, you don't know where I'm shouting.  
See, because you see, I'm blowing up inside and I have to shout to release some of it.  


  
 Oh Okay  


  
 Let me read to you from verse 26, okay?  
I'm gonna take it down, down, down so you can get it.  
I wanna make sure you catch the whole picture.  
This is from verse 26, Colossians chapter one.  
Even the mystery which had been hid from ages, which had been hid from ages,  
 and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.  
Hold on, I want you to, Christ, not with you, but in you Christ,  
 in you, not around you, not with you, but in you, I want you to observe, observe what is saying.  
Now, whom we preach, Christ in you, this Christ, whom we preach,  
 One in every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.  
One in every man teaching every man like I'm doing right now.  
All right?  
That we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.  
Now, here is the big thing.  
 It's in verse 29, where until I also labor, I want you to understand this, striving according to his work in which work gets in me mightily.  
Striving, he says I am functioning according to his energy.  
That's akin to what we just wear, our sufficiency, our ability,  
 He says, he's of God.  
And I told you, he wasn't just talking about, well, God is able and God is going to help me.  
No, he's talking about an inherent ability.  
Striving.  
He says, I label striving according to his energy.  
Which functions in me?  
He didn't say, which functions for me?  
He says, which functions in me?  
 mightily.  
Why is it that too many Christians have been weak and beggarly because of their ignorance?  
Because they don't know this.  
Why is it that so many of them are living a defeated life?  
Because they don't know this.  
No knowledge of spiritual things.  
 no accurate knowledge of the Scriptures.  
Let me give you some.  
Did you know that when you're born again and the Holy Spirit comes to make His home in you, did you know that having any type of infection  
 is supposed to be impossible?  
I know there are many of you here.  
You went to the doctor and he said, I don't have any infection here.  
I mean, you don't mind telling us.  
They said it was an infection.  
So the doctor gave me some...  


  
 You've been using some antibiotics, so I've been on some antibiotics for some two weeks now.  
You think it's, you know?  
You love it to talk like, I've been using some antibiotics.  
You are in the realm of the spirit of a junior boy.  
And that's why, that's why, infectious.  
 The Bible says, the Bible says, listen, this is, this is too important.  
The life in you, listen to what Paul said, it's so, it's so simple, in Galatians 2, 20.  
He says, I'm crucified with Christ.  
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ.  
 Leave it in me."  
Then he said, the life that I live now in the physical body, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me.  
Ah, the man had come to a point where he recognized his faith had become one with the faith of the Master.  
He was now seen through the eyes of the Master.  
 No wonder he didn't generalize that.  
He didn't say, we are crucified with Christ.  
Didn't he know we were all crucified with Christ?  
Of course he knew.  
But he had to personalize this because it was based on a prognosis.  
He said, I am crucified with Christ.  
Do you know who he was telling this?  
He was telling Peter the Pope.  
Peter showed up somewhere.  
 All right?  
And he was among these Gentiles.  
And they were eating.  
Paul was there.  
Imagine what kind of a meeting that would have been.  
Peter himself, Kala Satakaya.  
I look forward to seeing Peter.  
But you know what?  
He was there in these Gentiles.  
He was eating with them.  
And Paul was there too.  
 What type of fellowship that would have been?  
Peter had, I do.  
Not bad at all.  
I said, not bad at all.  
Paul had a pygnosis.  
And so James, the pastor of the church in Jerusalem, saying some people down there.  
And when they arrive,  
 They met the Pope, Peter.  
He was eating with gentiles.  
And quickly, Peter washed his hands.  
Like a... I was eating nothing.  
And Paul was looking at... He looked at... looked at Peter, looked at the guys from James.  
 Peter, Peter, oh, Paul said I was taken aback by his hypocrisy.  
Then he preached to Paul, to Peter, Paul said to Peter, I am crucified with Christ.  
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveeth in me.  
He said the life that I live now, in the physical body, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.  
 That's why he preached it.  
He left it up to Peter to decide.  
So he didn't say, we are crucified.  
Like he says, we died in him.  
 We were buried with him.  
You understand?  
He knows that.  
He said all of us.  
But this time around, this is a pignosis.  
I'm crucified with you.  
Nevertheless, I leave yet not high, but Christ leave us in me.  
Christ leave us in me.  
He says the life that I live now in the physical body.  
 I leave by the faith of the Son of God who loved me, who saw what I could be.  
That's what he's saying.  
The faith of the Son of God, who saw me before I came and called me righteous, who saw me before I came and made me one with him.  
The faith of the Son of God, who saw that if I would hear about him, I would believe and become a new creation.  
 The fate of the Son of God that makes wicklings strong.  
Oh, the fate of the Son of God that don't seem as the saints.  
Who loved me and gave himself for me.  
He says, our sufficiency is of God.  
Our ability is of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 So every day that you leave, can you come to that knowledge of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus?  
Do you realize that you have the authority in you?  
Do you realize you have the ability of God inside you?  
That the energy of God is working in you?  
Do you realize you are laboring, working, striving?  
By His energy that functions in you mightily.  
You can't tire me out.  
 You can't wear me out.  
Are you hearing me?  
Oh, glory to God.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
I, I, I, what a life we've got.  
I said, what a life we've got.  
What's another good thing inside you?  
Do you know?  
Tell me what's inside you.  
 I like that.  
The life of God.  
You got the life of God in you.  
You have the life of God in you.  
So the human life, let me tell you this.  
This is a fact.  
By the face of God, your human life has been swallowed up by his life.  
But here, here's the difference.  
This is in the mind of justice.  
 This is in the mind of God.  
I told you when God looks at you, he doesn't see you.  
He says, Jesus.  
Because you're now in Him.  
Your righteousness is the righteousness of the Son of God.  
 He doesn't judge you by your righteousness.  
He judges you by the righteousness of Christ Jesus.  
That is the righteousness that has been set to your account.  
Let me tell you some more.  


  
That is what we call the legal aspect of our salvation.  
 The vital aspect of our salvation is that not only have we, that righteousness of God set to our account, we have been made the very expression of that righteousness.  
So the Bible says, we are the righteousness of God in Christ.  
Do you know what that means?  
 No, think about it.  
Just think of having this kind of consciousness.  
Think of having this type of consciousness every day.  
Think of the type of life you would believe in.  
With this kind of consciousness every day.  
I'm a victor any day.  
I'm telling you, I'll live an awesome life.  
Any day.  
Any day.  
Any day.  
 And that's why I keep learning God's Word.  
I keep meditating on it.  
I keep delving into the higher realms of the Word, because as I move in the more glory there is.  
Hallelujah.  
The more glory you open this door, oh, mine, oh mine.  
And I like to feast there.  
And by the time I camp there, I'm like John.  
You didn't get it.  
 That's another day's subject.  
Hallelujah.  
I said, Hallelujah.  
Think about living every day without worries, without cares.  
And the Bible says, casting all your cares upon Him.  
Can you try that?  
You know some people.  
I'm just worried about my son.  
I'm just worried about my husband.  
I'm just worried.  
I'm worried.  
The Bible says, be worried for nothing.  
 be worried for nothing, have no anxiety about anything.  
Then it says, but in everything, by prayer and supplication, we thanksgiving, let your request be made known under God, and a peace of God which surpasses, oh ha ha ha, it surpasses understanding.  
 He says, that piece of God which surpasses all understanding shall garrison your hearts and minds.  
Then Christ Jesus, casting all your cares upon Him, for He carries for you.  
He's saying, go to sleep, boy.  
Go to sleep, I'm in charge.  
That's what he's telling you.  
He says, boy, go to sleep.  
 I'm in charge.  
God has slept.  
And you know another thing, hey, I'm hoping that we'll have the opportunity, maybe in the next series or something, I don't know.  
But by God's grace, as well guided, led by His Spirit, I'll be able to share some of this with you.  
Did you know you ought to speak words into the realm of the Spirit and go to sleep?  


  
 He says, hello?  
What kind of life do you want?  
That's why you have to have this type of knowledge.  
So that when you have this type of knowledge, you start operating at high realms, high levels.  
Where you... When you have given it out, you go to sleep.  
By the time you come back, it's all done.  
It's all done.  
 Somebody say thank you Lord Jesus.  
All right, the knowledge of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus has up for going in the next one, but we're out of time.  
Anyway, somebody say hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
I said hallelujah.  
I've got the life of God in need.  
 No jimma can stay inside.  
No camsa can stay inside.  
No infection can stay inside.  
No sickness can stay inside.  
I've got the life of God in me.  
I said, I've got the life.  
 I get the life of God in me.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  


  
Lift your voice and worship God.  


  
Give him praise.  


  
 I've got the life of God in me.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
Every fiber of my being, in every bone of my body, I've got the life of God in me.  
Hallelujah.
