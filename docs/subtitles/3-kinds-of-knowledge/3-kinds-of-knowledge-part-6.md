title: 3 Kinds of Knowledge Part 6
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, we thank you for another beautiful opportunity to worship you, have fellowship with you, and with one another in your presence.  
Our hearts and our minds are open to hear the word of God, and we receive it gladly in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Amen.  
You may be seated.  
Praise the Lord.  
 I'm sure you have your notebooks with you, do you?  
You have your Bible?  
Indian notebook?  
All right, because that's the only way we can actually learn and put into us those things that we are receiving.  
Because, you know, a lot of times we think that when we listen,  
 We retain everything.  
But I'm sure when you went to school, you discovered you didn't retain everything.  
Did you ever do any exams?  
Did you ever do any exams in your life?  
How many of you  
 had only all your life for every subject, every cost you ever did, you always had 100% from your primary school, to the secondary school, to the university, you always only had 100% in every subject, in every cost.  
Can I see your hand up?  


  
 Are you sure?  
You didn't?  
Why didn't you have 100% all the time?  
Because you didn't know everything.  
Praise God.  
I know some of you are thinking, but maybe I knew and the teacher didn't know.  
Well,  
 It's unlikely.  
Hallelujah.  
We've been studying three kinds of wisdom.  
Because the Bible shows us these three kinds of wisdom.  


  
 And we endeavored to look at the original translations so we can get a good picture.  
Now somebody said, well, but that is not available to everybody.  
So, well, that's the reason why God announced men to teach others.  
 So he can give them revelation that everybody may not have.  
When you study the scriptures, you find that the apostles brought several revelations that everybody didn't have.  
So there's an anointing to help us understand.  
 So we come to the house of God and receive of that ministry so that we are not only enlightened, we are blessed.  
Our lives are improved.  
To be blessed means that your life is improved.  
If your life is not improved, you are not blessed.  
The blessing causes improvement in your life.  
Where is God?  
What do you mean by improvement?  
 It doesn't start by making you have more money.  
So he says, well, if my life is improved, why am I not paying my rent?  
Well, first you are blessed with information.  
Where is God?  
And then we talked about three kinds of knowledge.  
And that's a great blessing.  
We're talking about three kinds of wisdom.  
 And when you have wisdom, you are blessed.  
We looked at what wisdom does for you.  
Do you remember?  
We looked at Proverbs chapter four and we looked at Proverbs chapter eight and looked at several scriptures there.  
And we found out what wisdom could do for you.  
Now we're taking another step.  
I don't know how many of you were here Wednesday night, but on Wednesday night we moved several steps forward and  
 We're going to be going on from there.  
See why you must learn to attend Wednesday services.  
They'll help you.  
They'll help you.  
How can you, you know?  
You take one step, you miss the next one.  
You take another one, you miss the next one.  
So you become Sunday, Sunday.  
I know you will tell me it's because of your job.  
 You need the Word of God.  
You need the ministry of the Word into your life.  
You need it.  


  
You may never know what you could have or what you could have been or what you could have gone if God doesn't tell you.  
 For example, Samuel, the prophet, went to the house of Jesse to anoint one of his sons to become king of Israel.  
When Samuel got there, because he was sent by God, when Samuel got there, he asked Mr. Jesse, where are your sons?  
 I'm here to anoint one of them.  
And he brought out the first son, who was a soldier, well-beards, strong, like this big, strong and reliable.  
 He brought him out and when Samuel saw him, he was intimidated by the guy's statue.  
He says surely the Lord's anointed is before him.  
And it took the horn of oil and water to anoint him.  
And God said, Samuel, don't anoint him because I've rejected him.  
 God didn't say, I have chosen him.  
He didn't say, I have not chosen him.  
He didn't say, well, I don't want this one.  
He used a term that's very disturbing.  
He said, I have rejected him.  
Meaning that God actually considered him and said no.  
That gets me thinking.  
 And the thoughts that go through my mind, because of that scripture, they're like, did Eliot ever know that God thought about him to be king?  
Where then did he miss it?  
So all of Eliot's life, he never knew that God had considered him to make him king.  
And for some reason, God said no.  
 He didn't know.  
Never cross this man.  
Another occasion, he lies at the man of God, spoke to the king of Israel, and said, now, open the window.  
Shoot.  
He was speaking to the man by revelation.  
He said, shoot.  
And he pulled the arrow.  
 This is bull and shut and shut and stopped.  
Oh, the Prophet said, why did you stop?  
He said you should have continued like five times and you would have completely destroyed all your enemies.  
Then he said, now the Syrians I escaped from your hands.  
 The man didn't know that God had planned to put his enemies right under him.  
Syria would have been right under him.  
He lost it.  
Why didn't he know?  
He lacked revelation.  
Praise God.  
 You may not know what God has planned for your life, except he opened your eyes to see.  
And then there are those who even, even if God opened their eyes to see, they would never achieve their dreams.  
Oh, look around you.  


  
 You'd see those who aren't a skid role.  


  
And you see the hobbles, spiritual and physical.  
Lives wander us.  
 The many who haven't found themselves yet.  
They've had 10 jobs in a year.  
These are professional hobos.  
They haven't found themselves.  
They haven't found themselves.  
You just wonder, why?  
Why is it that so many people fail in life?  
Why?  
 I've thought about it before, many times.  
Why are there so many people who do not attain success, who live on fulfilled lives?  
Childhood dreams gone out the window.  
Many have drifted in the stream of life.  
 Carried on like the jellyfish.  
You know the jellyfish can swim against the currents.  
He wanted to be a soldier, but he failed.  
He never became a soldier.  
He thought he would become a great policeman.  
He stopped in the sidewalk of life and never made it.  
 The guy driving the taxi around town.  
He had thought he was going to be a great politician.  
He talked powerfully.  
He talked great.  
He was known for words.  
He sounded convincing on any topic.  
He had even thought himself to be a nationalist.  
Somehow.  
 He's found himself among those group of men who have lost it.  
They lost it.  
The opportunity is gone.  


  
They've ended up on live sidewalk and they keep hearing  
 That voice that says to them, never again.  
That means your potential is gone forever.  


  
Childhood dreams never realized.  
What about those who thought that they will be great merchants?  
You thought you'd travel with lots of business.  
 Blind and selling across continents, that's what you thought you'd do.  
Many years have passed by.  
It didn't materialize.  
Deep inside you, you blame the society, you blame the government, you blame your husband, you blame your wife, you blame the kids that came along.  
Why?  


  
 Does the world have such rendezvous of broken lives?  
Failures.  
Why?  


  
Somebody thought, I'll go to school.  
I'll get this education.  
He got it.  
He said, I'll further my education.  
I'm going to have an MBA.  
He got it.  
 It still didn't work.  
He still wasn't happy.  
He still wasn't fulfilled.  
He said to himself, our study father, he got a PhD.  
It still didn't work.  
He said, I'll get another PhD.  
It still didn't work.  
He taught in the university more than 10 years, became a professor, getting old and beheaded.  
It still hasn't worked.  
And he's wondering, when he sees other professors like himself, poor, he wonders, what does life really mean?  
 What does life really mean?  
A young lady wanted to get married and got married to an educated man.  
And a man became so learned and she was happy as the guru and expanded and he thought, well, my husband is professor so-and-so.  
Only to find out he didn't have to be a professor to have any money.  
And he's broke and she's broke and children are broke and everybody's broke.  
And she's wondering, what does life really mean?  
 What does life really mean?  
Why are there so many failures?  
Success is not about money.  
But in life, you've got to have money.  
If you financially broke, you are sunk.  
That's a fact.  
 Now I will talk about riches with righteousness.  
I read it to you the other, and it was last Sunday.  
He said, I am wisdom.  
I have riches and righteousness.  
What?  
Do you remember that?  
Riches and righteousness, that's what wisdom gives to you.  
And we're talking about three kinds of wisdom.  
Hallelujah.  
One of the definitions I gave you upon furnaces, I said it is,  
 Living in the will of God.  
You remember that?  
Yes.  
Living in the will of God.  
The will of God is the Word of God.  
The Word of God is the wisdom of God.  
When we talk about, see, I asked you a question, why are there so many failures in life?  


  
 There's one thing lacking wisdom.  
They lack the wisdom of God.  
They lack it.  
There's so many people who were influenced by the wisdom of God.  
 Most of those who have blessed the world were different discoveries, were those who were influenced by the wisdom of God.  
Read their history.  


  
You'd find someone down the line of grandfather, grandmother, somewhere, or close friend who had it done alive, who had the word of God in him, that influenced that fellow.  
 and give him light.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Are you still there?  
Praise God forevermore.  
Three kinds of wisdom.  
And we said, number one is what?  
Come on.  
Sophia.  
Number two.  
Senesis.  
And number three.  
 Great.  
And we said, Saphia is what?  
Theoretical wisdom.  
Sinesis is what?  
Critical wisdom.  
And Sinesis is what?  
Practical wisdom.  
 And on Wednesday night, we were studying several things.  
You know, this is so important.  
Bible tears is that God gave Solomon wisdom.  
And I told you that in the Greeks at Tarjan, it says, God gave Solomon from Nessus.  
 what he had more than all others was furnaces.  
That's what he had more than everybody else.  
That's what changed things.  
And he was an extraordinary businessman.  
Did you ever read this story?  
Solomon was a businessman.  
Boy, he was a big businessman.  
A lot of people think about, well, he was keen, and that's why he was great.  
Hey, he was keen.  
 But he was a businessman.  


  
Read his story.  
Bible tells us how he imported horses and chariots from Egypt and sold to other nations and made money from them.  
Didn't you read it?  
Read your Bible.  
Bible tells us Solomon had merchants.  
 He had merchants that brought gold and gold every year.  
Some of them brought gold every three years.  
They went out on business and brought money back every three years.  
That's a lot of bucks.  
Then plus that he received gifts from all over the world.  
The Bible says in one year, he received gold.  
 of 666 talents weight.  
That's an enormous amount of gold.  
We talked about the Queen of Sheba coming to play.  
Solomon of Visa, the Bible says, when the Queen of Sheba, she was rich.  
She was one of the richest games, if not the richest, at the time.  
Outside Solomon.  
 So she couldn't believe it.  
When she heard of the wealth of Solomon, she did not believe it.  
The Bible says she didn't believe it.  
 She heard of the wisdom of Solomon.  
She said, I'm going there.  
I won't find out the wisdom of this man.  
They said, he's that rich.  
The barber says she got an extraordinary entourage with so much wealth and travel to Israel.  
She wanted to intimidate that guy.  
Queen of Shiba traveled with so much wealth.  
 and took 120 talents of gold.  
Now listen, Solomon made in a whole year 666 talents of gold.  
Now this woman didn't know this.  
She took 120 talents of gold on one side to give to Solomon.  
 Are you still there?  
This is what she's going to give.  
Now you think of what she's going to spend on her own with all her in charge.  
So she was rich.  
And so she went to Jerusalem.  


  
 Come on, let's look at it.  
Let the scriptures speak.  
We are reading first Kings chapter number 10.  
And I am reading from verse one.  
Are you there?  


  
And when the queen, are you there?  
 I'm still hearing your pages.  
Okay, verse one, chapter 10, first Kings.  
And when the queen of Shiva heard of the fame of Solomon, concerning the name of the Lord, she came to prove him with hard questions.  
She was intelligent.  
She was educated.  
Do you understand?  
She was erudite.  
She was, look, this woman was knowledgeable.  
So she came to prove Solomon with hard questions.  
 To test him, do you want to... Are you there?  
To test him with hard questions.  
She said, what kind of school did he attend?  
I attended the best school in the world.  
I had the best professors.  
 I'm going to Jerusalem.  
And when the Queen of Shiva heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord, she came to prove him with hard questions.  
And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train with hammers that bore spices and very much good and precious stones.  
And when she was scum to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.  
 And Solomon told her all her questions, answered all her questions.  
There was not anything heed from the king which he told her not.  
Hallelujah.  
And when the queen of Shiva had seen all Solomon's wisdom and the house that he had built and the food of his stable and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers, are you still there?  
 Huh?  
And their apparel, their dressing.  
And then his cop barris and his accent, the way he went up to his throne and to the house of God.  
Are you there?  
Under the house of the Lord.  
There was no more spirit.  
I mean, she was out of breaks.  
She went like this.  


  
 Those of you that you have a house boy and house girl and your housemates look dirty and on camp, I feel sorry for you.  
You have people who work for you and they look like sophomores.  
I'm sorry for you.  
You call your house get, Tina!  
By the time she's coming, she's wearing only dress.  


  
 And you are happy.  
Come on, clean this place.  
You are happy.  
See, look at this.  
Solomon servants were, were arrayed.  
When the queen of Shiva saw the man's servants.  
Huh?  
Huh?  
 You say, ah, who is that?  
You know my name is my boy.  
When they see him the way he is, he can't even work right.  
You are happy.  
Say the one that carries your child.  
You're now bitter.  
You have no idea about today.  
Say the way I'm looking at you.  


  
 When you get back this week, go and buy them new clothes.  
Are you hearing me?  
Your prosperity is seen in the lives of those who work with you.  
Not on yourself.  
Be smart.  
Look at my pastas.  
Take a look at all my pastas.  


  
Hey, it's important.  
No, come here.  
Take a look at my stuff.  
You understand.  
 Yeah, that's the way not to be.  
All the people working for you are suffering.  
You understand?  
Don't give them food.  
Don't give them meat.  
If you give them meat, you start stealing.  
Don't give them meat.  
How much meat do you have?  
You kill a chicken a year and see you will not give somebody any meat.  
Don't give them meat.  


  
 Every day you kill chicken, you come into the port and you start checking, checking, checking.  
Where's the gizad?  
Where's the gizad?  
They've stolen the gizad.  


  
Hello, somebody!  


  
 I'll never say change.  


  
Hallelujah.  
There was no more spirit in this woman.  
Verse 6, and she said to the king,  
 It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom.  
How bad I believed not the words until I came and my eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me.  
Thy wisdom and prosperity exceeded the fame which I heard.  
 Happy are thy men.  
Happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and not hear thy wisdom.  
Hallelujah!  
Blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of Israel, because the Lord loved Israel forever, therefore made thee king to do judgment and justice.  
 And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices, very great stone and precious stones.  
And there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the Queen of Sheba gave to the king Solomon.  
Think about that.  
What she gave to king Solomon, nobody ever brought such a sign.  
I said she was wealthy.  
But when she met Solomon,  
 She said, the half of it was not told.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
I want you to go to verse 23.  
You know, in that verse 22, before we go to 23, in verse 22, the latter part of it, the Bible says, in the days of Solomon, silver was not counted.  
 If you read Father, it tells you that he made silver to be stones, stones outside in the days of Solomon, not because it lost value, but because there was so much gold that they didn't count silver.  
You are going to be so rich.  
Hallelujah.  
 Praise God forevermore.  
Let's look at verse.  
That was verse 20, 21 actually.  
It was in 21, okay?  
Okay.  
Now we'll read in from verse 23.  
I want you all to read it to me, verse 23.  


  
Did you hear that?  
 King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.  
And that wisdom is furnaces.  
As a thought kind of wisdom.  
Look at verse 24, read it to me, want to go.  


  
 He says, and all the earth, such to Solomon, to hear his furnaces, which God had put in his heart.  
Remarkable.  
Remarkable.  
You read in the fourth chapter, in the 29th verse, it tells you that God gave Solomon  
 from this is his intelligence.  
You understand?  
He says, God gave that wisdom to Solomon.  
That was why, that was the edge that he had above others.  
I said, there's Sophia, Sophia.  
Sophia is insight into reality.  
We're talking about the wisdom of God.  
 It's insight into the true state of things.  
You can see He didn't think.  
Sophia is like revelation.  
Revelation.  
 And we talked about that.  
And then we talked about Sunesis.  
That's the second stage of wisdom.  
Sunesis is comprehension.  
The ability to analyze and interpret situations differently.  
It's critical wisdom, analytical wisdom.  
Sunesis is perception.  
 Are you still there?  
Every one of you, every one of you has been granted Sophia.  
Christ has been made unto you, Sophia from God.  
You have all of that wisdom of God by which the world was created, all of the wisdom of God in your spirit.  
 The revelation of God is in your spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
All the treasures of Sophia.  
All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
Nusses, do you understand?  
All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are Heed in Christ.  
 and we are members of Christ.  
So every one of us has all the treasures of wisdom in our spirits.  
That's what the Word of God says.  
 Listen, Jesus Christ was the unveiling of the personality of the Father.  
Do you understand?  
The Bible says He was the express image of the Father's person.  
The Greek word is icon.  
The Bible says He was the icon.  
That's where we get the English word icon.  
The representation of the Father's person.  
If you wanted to know who the Father was, you ought to look at Jesus.  
 In St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 12, verse 45, Jesus said, He that see at me, see at Him that sent me.  
Hallelujah.  
Are you still there?  
Jesus was the unfailing of the Father.  
 They hadn't seen the Father.  
He was fair to them.  
He was fair by the law.  
There was this great veil in the old covenant.  
You know, when they came to the temple of God, there was a great veil that he, the presence of God from everybody, they didn't know what God looked like.  
They didn't know what the presence was like.  
And once every year, the High Priest went beyond that great curtain into the presence of God.  
 and he stood before the mercy seats.  
The priests were over on the other side, and the people were in the temple carts.  
Nobody saw that presence.  
Nobody knew what Jehovah was like.  
They didn't know what he was like.  
He told them, don't you ever represent me with any figure?  
Not an animal, not a bat, no image.  
They hadn't seen him.  
 But when Jesus was crucified on the cross, hanging there and crying out, a loyal oiler must about deny.  
When he cried so, the Bible says there wasn't that quick.  
The rocks began to crack.  
 Are you hearing this?  
Then it says the veil in the temple that separated the holy place from the most holy place was turning to from the top to the bottom.  
That veil that hid away the presence of God was caught into.  
Why?  
Because Jesus said, destroyed this temple.  
 He was talking about His body.  
His body was the temple.  
In other words, God Almighty was hiding in that temple and they hadn't seen Him.  
When they killed Him, He was their Lord, their Savior, Jehovah, their Shepherd.  
That was slain.  
This is the one that said, I and my Father are one.  
 He that sees me, sees the one that sent me.  
When you see me, you see the father.  
Philip had said to him, Master, show us the father and we'll be satisfied.  
Show us the father, we'll be satisfied.  
He said, Philip, have I been such a long time with you and you haven't known me?  
He says anybody who sees me has seen the father.  
 In other words, I am the image, the representation.  
I want you to understand there's a great difference between the representative and the representation.  
He was not the representative, he was the representation of the father.  
He was the icon, the Greek word is icon, E-I-K-O-A, icon.  
The very image, the likeness, the expression,  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Oh, the express image.  
Hebrews chapter 1 verse 3 tells us he's the express image of the Father's person, the effulgence of his glory.  
What does this mean?  
 What does this mean?  
When you read in 1st Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 24, it tells us Christ, the wisdom of God and the power of God.  
Christ is the wisdom of God.  
Ushakababadeleki sombra.  
I don't know if you're getting this.  
That's telling us that the wisdom of God became tabernacle in a human body.  
Every step that Jesus took, this was the Sophia of Almighty God.  
 The wisdom of God.  
No wonder he says he was in the world.  
The world was made by him.  
The world knew him not.  
He was the wisdom.  
The wisdom.  
Cosa.  
The wisdom of God.  
When he spoke, it was wisdom talking.  
Lakebrandonski, do you understand what I'm talking about?  
 He said, Peter, the tax collectors are here.  
He said, you take your hook and go to the water down there.  
He said, put the hook into the river.  
He said, the first fish you catch, bring a coin out of his mouth.  
How did he know?  
It was the wisdom of God.  
Haha.  
Hallelujah.  
 They gave him bread and fish.  
He bested them.  
He said, divide.  
The men are 5,000.  
The women and children are not counted.  
Divide for more than 12,000 people.  
A little boy is launched.  
How did he know it worked?  
The wisdom of God.  
Insights into reality.  
Do you understand?  
Insights.  
 He knew something that the ordinary man didn't know.  
He knew the bread could be multiplied.  
He knew the fish could be multiplied.  
They didn't know it, but he knew what was inside.  
Somebody shout hallelujah.  
 Boy, I'm inspired by Jesus.  
I said, I'm inspired by Jesus.  
So, grader Haster, he saw a man who had no eyes.  
The barber says he spat on the ground.  
He made clay of the spittle, and then he stabbed something in the guy's eyes.  
He said, go and wash in the pool of sand, and the man came back seeing how the Jesus know it will work.  
It was Sophia from God.  
 Hallelujah.  
This is the wisdom of God.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
Oh, Hallelujah.  
 wisdom.  
How did he know?  
He was the embodiment of wisdom.  
How did he know?  
Son-da-ga-ba-shata.  
How did he know?  
This is the wisdom of God.  
The Bible says in Christ I heed and  
 He says he hid.  
No wonder they couldn't see it.  
No wonder others couldn't know.  
The Bible says if the princes of this world had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.  
They didn't know because it was hidden inside him.  
The wisdom of God was hidden in Christ.  
He says this wisdom, which the princes of this world did not know.  
 Have they found out?  
No.  
They're still don't know.  
They're still don't know.  
Christ, the wisdom of God.  
When you receive Christ, you receive the wisdom of God into your spirits.  
He said, I am a greater than Solomon.  
I don't know if you understand that terminology or not, but that seems to tell me that he made Solomon wise.  
All of the wisdom of Solomon was only a fraction.  
 Hallelujah.  
He said, have you heard of the riches of Solomon?  
Have you heard so much wealth about Solomon that even the queen of Shiva was embarrassed?  
He said, look at the lily of the valley.  
He said, look at those plains, how are red in glory they are?  
He said, not even Solomon was a red as one of us.  


  
 He said, look, the very hairs, every strung mataka basata, lingro roshandara.  
He said, every strand of hair on your head is coated.  
I don't know if you've ever read it.  
He said, the very hairs of your head are numbered.  
That doesn't mean counted.  
I don't know if you understand that.  
He said they are numbered.  
There is a difference between being counted and being numbered.  
You can be counted and unknown, but you cannot be numbered and unknown.  
 There'll be none that means you have a code number.  
He said, every strand of hair on your head is coded.  
When you made your hair today,  
 is charmed of hair may have fallen.  
You don't know about it, but in heaven, the court is written that that one has fallen.  
The Bible says you don't even care for things as little as that.  
You don't even care.  
Why does God care?  
Last, Skivro, Anto Karusha.  
I'll tell you what.  
He's telling you that he isn't at every strand of hair.  
There is a hidden treasure.  
The natural man doesn't know about it, but God knows what it means.  
Hey, COVID, a God.  
 Look at what men have found out today.  
What they didn't know many years ago.  
How did they discover where they can find the DNA?  
How did they know?  
Because God had something hidden inside all the time.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
Hallelujah.  
Somebody shout hallelujah.  
Oh, the wisdom of God.  


  
 God gave Solomon from Nises.  
From Nises.  
I'll come to that.  
But let's look at Sophia for a moment.  
I said it's a revelation.  
When you start thinking, when you start thinking, I'm going to be a tailor.  
I'm going to study how to sew clothes.  
I'm going to study how to cut patterns.  
I'm going to be a big time teller.  
Hey!  
 So fear is working.  
So fear is working.  
But you need what?  
You need senesis.  
To begin to understand how you're going to do this business right.  
To begin to understand the market principles.  
To begin to understand how you're going to sell.  
To begin to understand how to organize all the facilities that you need.  
But you know what?  
 Beyond that, why is it that though you had that dream, you never did it?  
Why is it that even though you understood how you had the comprehension, you understood what to do, you analyzed everything, you still didn't do it?  
Why do men have dreams unfulfilled?  
Why are intelligent men poor?  
 because they don't have what's called true intelligence.  
What they have is Sophia.  
Many of them have senesis.  
They can explain everything.  
They know what the nation ought to do for the whole country to prosper, but they have broke themselves.  
You say, why?  
Why?  
There's one reason.  
The Bible says God gave Solomon for senesis.  
That's what the men had, more than everybody else.  
 furnaces.  
That's the reason your business is not turning out right, because you don't have furnaces.  
You know what to do.  
And why are you not doing it?  
It's not another person that's your problem.  
It's not the place where you leave that's your problem.  
No.  
See, one of the things that happens, you know,  
 When you're born again, decency comes into your spirit.  
You become a decent man.  
You become a decent woman.  
Your level of reasoning changes.  
You no longer use vulgar words.  
You know, I see men of high repute, high respect in the society.  
And sometimes I hear them talk,  
 sometimes even on television, and they use vulgar words.  
And you know, you shiva, you feel it like, hey man, how could such a man of respect use such words?  
He likes for nieces.  
There is an excellency about your life when you know Jesus.  
 Your vocabulary changes.  
Your communication changes.  
Are you still there?  
And if you build it on, if you build it on, if you build it on, you grow in it.
