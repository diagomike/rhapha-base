title: 3 Kinds of Knowledge Part 1
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 There is that everyday knowledge founded on intellectual ability with which you can solve natural problems.  
No matter what your life is like, if you will give attention to God's word, it will build you up mentally, it will build you up spiritually, it will build you up physically, it will build you up financially, the word of God will build you life and make you a success.  
 There is that superior knowledge God gives with which you gain mastery over circumstances and become a supernatural success in any and everything you do.  
What you need for success is not a job from somewhere.  
What you need for success is not a money from somewhere.  
What you need for success is not somebody somewhere to talk for you.  
What you need for your success is what John said.  
He said, I write unto you that you may become a way.  
 that you may know that he has the way.  
In Richard's spirit with the knowledge of God's word, as you listen to part six of this six-part live transforming message by Pastor Chris titled, Three kinds of knowledge.  
It doesn't matter what field you're into.  
It doesn't matter where you work.  
It doesn't matter what kind of business you're into or profession.  
 When you're filled with the knowledge of His will, as you meditate on God's Word and you're brought into this kind of knowledge, what happens is you begin to function with all wisdom inside into reality.  
You know beyond what you see.  
God bless you as you listen.  
Three kinds of knowledge.  
 You can have a long list of so many kinds of knowledge as you may please.  
But I want to talk about three of them because of their significance in the Word of God.  
First Timothy chapter six.  
First Timothy chapter six.  
Find it quickly.  
I want to read to you  
 from verse 20.  
First he went to chapter 6, verse 20.  
He says, Oh Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust.  
Avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science.  
Forestly so called.  
 Do you see that?  
Oppositions of science.  
Foursly, he says, so-called.  
That word is from the Greek Gnosis.  
It means knowledge.  
And it's referring to general knowledge, scientific knowledge, abstract knowledge,  
 So the Greek word is Gnosys, G-N-O-S-I-S.  
But that's not the kind of knowledge I want to talk about.  
This is the knowledge of everyday event.  
This is knowledge that's based on intellectual ability, intellectual activity.  
 So it's called Gnosis.  
He tells us to be careful.  
You notice, he says, oh Timotee, Paul is writing the Timotee, he says, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and then babblings.  
He calls them then babblings, empty ramblings, and oppositions of science, falsely so called.  
He's telling us that they're deceiving themselves.  
 Because life cannot be based on that kind of knowledge.  
I hear in this.  
Now, you turn to Ephesians chapter number three.  
I read from verse 14.  
 for these cause about my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love,  
 may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breath and depth and height and to know.  
I want you to look at verse 19.  
We're talking about three kinds of knowledge.  
Three kinds of knowledge.  
We'll observe these three kinds of knowledge and how they affect us and what we can do with them.  
 In verse 19 it says, and to know, that's one of the kinds of knowledge I want to talk to you about.  
The Greek word is gynosco.  
And to know, to gynosco, the love of Christ, which surpasses knowledge.  
Now that word knowledge again is the one we just observed in 1st Timothy chapter 6 and verse number 20, and it's nusses.  
Nusses are told you scientific knowledge, knowledge that's based on intellectual activity.  
 Now he says, to know the love of Christ, the love of Christ which surpasses science, the love of Christ surpasses intellectual knowledge.  
It's a general kind of knowledge.  
It's a knowledge that's based on intellectual activity and God can give it to you.  
 Some of us have not understood these things.  
You see, we have worked with the Lord in the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit in certain operations.  
But it can be more.  
It can be more.  
For example, when the Bible says the gifts, He gives to another, the word of knowledge.  
Did you know He was talking about gnosis?  
 It's a word, a part, a piece of all the knowledge that's available, which means that God can give you a word of knowledge in the field of metallurgy.  
God can give you a word of knowledge in the field of chemistry.  
He can give you a word of knowledge in medicine, in law.  
Are you still there?  
He can impart it to you.  
 But because we haven't recognized these different kinds of knowledge and what the Spirit of God is doing in our lives, we haven't made as there is available to the Spirit to work with.  
There's so much that God can do in your life.  
He made the plans and the animals.  
He made the matters.  
He made everything there is in the world.  
He can teach you about them.  
 I said, he can teach you about them.  
The world is looking for solutions.  
And God is looking out for people to give the solutions to.  
He can give you the medical solution to AIDS.  
He can give you.  
What you need is a word of knowledge.  
God has all the knowledge.  
Word of knowledge is a piece of that knowledge that God has.  
Hallelujah.  
 glory to God, just a piece of it.  


  
The very thought of it excites me that I can be praying and I can receive a word of knowledge, scientific knowledge.  
Interestingly, I've had several things like that happen with me where I've been able to explain natural things  
 through revelation imparted to my spirit.  
But they had to do with natural things.  
It was a word of knowledge given to me.  
You can receive a word of knowledge.  
You see, when we, you see, why is it that many people haven't had this?  
Because many people haven't heard it.  
That's why they haven't had it happen to them.  
 When we preach salvation, sinners get saved.  
In other words, they come to Christ, they give their hearts to Christ because they receive faith for salvation.  
When we teach on the Holy Spirit, many receive the Holy Spirit, and they are blessed with the glorious manifestations of the Holy Spirit.  
When we teach on healing, people get healed.  
Do you understand?  
Oh yeah!  
When we teach on the second coming of Christ, or the rapture of the church, or the end time message, people start getting themselves ready.  
 because they receive faith in that arena.  
When we teach on this subject also of knowledge, your mind will open up.  
Hallelujah.  
Because the teaching prepares you for the manifestation, for the work in that life.  
That's why I'm sharing this with you, because I know what it's going to do to you.  
Hallelujah.  
 So that's a creature that we were reading, said to know the gynosco, the love of Christ, which surpass it scientific knowledge.  
He's telling us that the love of Christ is beyond the comprehension of science.  
They cannot understand what Jesus meant when he cried out on the cross, the loyal, the mass about to die.  
Science cannot explain that.  
 Your mental activity cannot bring that to you.  
All the books of this world cannot explain what happened on the cross to you.  
The love of Christ surpasses science.  
So what do you get?  
Genosco.  
The first kind of knowledge I want to talk to you about.  
Genosco is revelation knowledge.  
 It cannot come by intellectual activity.  
It's revelation knowledge.  
It's a complete package.  
It's a complete knowledge delivered to you through the agency of the Spirit of God.  
You just know.  
You know that Jesus was born of a virgin.  
Hallelujah.  
You were not there.  
But it came to you as a revelation.  
That's Gino's school.  
 Alleluia.  
I like to bring some thoughts to your spirit.  
See, Genosco is an introduction into a kind of knowledge.  
We call it a kind, because there are different types of knowledge.  
It's a kind of knowledge.  
You are brought into that type of knowledge.  
 The Spirit of God, the Word of God, brings you into that kind of knowledge.  
And it's esoteric knowledge.  
It's knowledge that's given to a few.  
The whole world doesn't get it.  
That's why in 1st Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 14, the Bible says, the natural man, the man that's not being born again, he says, that man cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God.  
He says, they are foolishness unto him.  
Neither can he gynosco them.  
 You see, he says, because they are spiritually understood, the natural man cannot have gynosco.  
He cannot know God.  
To know God is gynosco.  
It's a revelation, a complete revelation.  
It's far removed from intellectual abilities.  
You can be a professor and never know God.  
 a professor that studies revelation.  
You can be a professor of theology.  
And still not know God.  
Because you cannot get gynosco in the laboratory.  
You cannot get gynosco from studying books and books and books.  
Gynosco has to be given to you by the Holy Spirit.  
It's a revelation knowledge.  
 And it's a complete, it's a complete knowledge.  
There are no assumptions.  
So he says, and to know the love of Christ, which is beyond science, which is beyond the intellect, you know it by your spirits.  
That's why you find yourself praying.  
You just, you're in love with Jesus.  
 You just feel the love of God.  
And you're there.  
A man, 65 years old, but you're crying in the presence of God.  
Your children can understand it.  
Your wife cannot understand it.  
Your friends can understand it.  
You match your man like this, just whipping before God.  
They can understand it.  
Why?  
Because of Genosco.  
Hahaha.  
Hallelujah.  
 You have gotten a hold of a type of knowledge.  
You have been transported into the knowledge of the spirits.  
You found yourself in another realm of life, where you begin to relate with things in the realm of the spirits.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
So that's the first kind of knowledge.  
 When you were born again, it was that knowledge that was imparted to your spirit.  
That's what you got about God.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord.  
You are brought into this knowledge.  
Aye.  
 The Bible says which none of the princes of this world knew?  
He says none of the princes of this world, Ginozko did.  
They didn't have Ginozko.  
He said, for have they known it?  
Have they had Ginozko?  
He said they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.  
They didn't have Ginozko.  
It's a special kind of knowledge.  
They were not brought into it, into this special kind of information from God.  
 So they said Jesus was an ordinary man.  
They could not recognize him.  
They didn't know who he was, but he was the son of God in reality.  
He said, I am the way.  
Hey, I am the way, the truth, the life.  
He says, I am the essence.  
I am, I am.  


  
Yet they crucified him.  
They didn't know who he was.  
 They didn't have this kind of knowledge.  
Barbara says, have they had ginosco?  
Have they had it?  
That knowledge that's beyond your brain, that knowledge that's beyond your mind.  
He said, have they had it?  
They would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  
So that brings you into a special kind of knowledge.  
 Somebody say thank you Lord Jesus.  
Oh hallelujah, hallelujah.  
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Thank you Lord.  
Mm, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, shah.  
Mm.  
Ah, yeah.  
 See, let me read it to you from 1 Corinthians.  
So you see, Paul puts it.  
1 Corinthians.  
From chapter number 2, verse 7.  
Are you there?  
But we speak!  
Ah!  
Ah!  
Hey!  
 He says, but we speak the wisdom of God in esoteric language.  
He says, in a mystery, we speak it.  
Are you catching it?  
We speak the wisdom.  
We speak it.  
Wisdom.  
We talk wisdom.  
He says, we speak the wisdom of God.  
 in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the words unto our glory, which none of the princes of this word knew.  
That's Ginozco.  
For had they Ginozco did, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  
 But now let's go on, we're going to see another one.  
But as it is written, I had not seen nor he heard, need I have ate it into the heart of man, the things which God had prepared for them that love him.  
But God had revealed them unto us by his spirit, for the spirit, search it all things.  
Yeah, the deep things of God.  
 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him?  
Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.  
Now this is remarkable.  
I said this is remarkable.  
Look, he says, what man knows the things of a man?  
Accept the spirit of man which is in him.  
 Here he uses the second word that I want you to understand, and it's called idol in the Greek.  
It's pronounced idol, E-I-D-O.  
Sometimes E-I-D-O, and then sometimes it is pronounced Oida O-I-D-A.  
Whichever one you want, you can take it.  
Hallelujah.  
 But that knowledge that he's talking about, he says, what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of the man which is in him.  
He says, even so, the things of God, knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.  
It reminds me of the things that Jesus said when he talked about his father.  
He said to his disciples, you don't know him, but I know him.  
Hallelujah.  
He said, you don't know him.  
 He said, you haven't gynoscoed God.  
He says, but I do God.  
He didn't use gynosco for himself because he didn't need a revelation.  
So he talked about another kind of knowledge.  
He said, you need to gynosco God, but I do God.  
In other words, he had a different type of knowledge about God.  
It was an awareness.  
 I know is a kind, it's absolute knowledge.  
It is the divine knowledge of God, where he requires no revelation or outside information.  
It is a knowledge within the scope of his knowing, but God's knowing is a scopeless.  
So I know is the knowledge that a man has that has become his possession,  
 He needs no further revelation.  
It is something he has become a wealth.  
For example, the barber says, we know.  
Romans 828 says, we know that all things work together.  
He says, we know.  
All things work together for good to them that love God.  
That is idle.  
We are aware.  
In other words, no need to struggle.  
 No need to cry.  
We have come home with this information.  
We already know we are aware that all things work together for good to them that love God.  
Have you come to that awareness?  
It's a place of rest.  
Hallelujah.  
It's part of the mountain top experience.  
It's a place of rest.  
It's as we know.  
 that all things work together.  
So no matter what happens in your life, no matter what happens around you, you just have this knowledge.  
It's called an absolute knowledge.  
You've come home, you have become aware.  
Hallelujah.  
So you just laugh no matter what happens.  
That's why he said be anxious for nothing.  
He said be anxious for nothing.  
 But in everything, by prayer and supplication, He says, let your request be made known unto God, and the peace which is akin to the Old Testament Shalom.  
 He says the peace of God that surpasses all understanding.  
He says that kind of peace, people wonder at it.  
He says it surpasses understanding.  
People can understand why you can be so peaceful.  
In spite of the opposition, in spite of the problems, he says that peace of God, that surpasses understanding shall garrison your heart and mind through Christ Jesus.  
So we know  
 There are all things worked together.  
John used the same term.  
He said, we know that we have passed from debt unto life.  
First John 3, 14.  
He said, we know we have passed.  
We have crossed over.  
We live in the realm of life.  
We have crossed over from debt unto life.  
Where will sickness come from?  
 Where will failure come from?  
John was aware.  
There was an awareness.  
I don't know where are you catching me or not.  
There was an awareness.  
He said, we know the word is idle.  
We are aware that we have passed from death to life.  
We are not trying to cross over.  
We're not hoping for it.  
We're not praying about it.  
He says, we are aware.  
 that we have crossed over from death onto life.  
We're not dwell in the realm of life.  
We function in the arena of life.  
No wonder John said, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
He said, this life, this Zoei is in his son.  
He said, he that had the son, had Zoei.  
We passed from death onto life.  
And we are away.  
 It's called absolute knowledge, absolute knowledge, absolute knowledge.  
We know.  
You see, this knowledge gives you that information on the inside that you are not a failure and that you will never be a failure.  
People can look at you and think you have failed, but you have idle.  
 We know, Hallelujah.  
We know that all things work together.  


  
What you need for success  
 It's not a job from somewhere.  
What you need for success is not a money from somewhere.  
What you need for success is not somebody somewhere to talk for you.  
What you need for your success is what John said.  
He said, I write on to you that you may become a way, that you may know that he has the way.  
I want you to know that you have it.  
And that's what you need.  
 That's what you need.  
Zoe.  
Zoe is unconquerable.  
Do you understand?  
You cannot defeat Zoe.  
This is the life that if a man would have,  
 It will make a success out of him.  
This is that life that if a man would have, he would be beyond sickness, disease and infirmity.  
This is that life which was promised before the world began.  
And the barber says, in these last days, have been manifested onto us.  
 Hallelujah.  
He said, the life, the zoe, he personalizes it.  
He says, the zoe, definite article.  
The zoe was manifested.  
And we have seen it.  
He says, and we testify unto you.  
 the zoe, the life, the thing in God that made him God, why he is God, why he is not a created being, why he is the super being, why God is God, it's called zoe, he says that zoe was manifested.  
 He came onto his own.  
His own received him now.  
But as many as received him, to them he gave the power, the ability to become the sons of God.  
And now we are like him, as he is so are we in this world.  
Can you shout amen, somebody?  
Hallelujah.  
 What a life.  
What a life.  
Does life look dark to you?  
Does life look challenging?  
Maybe you're in a certain situation in your life, and it's looking like a story, it's hopeless.  
I'm telling you something.  
There's something that's been quickened in your spirits.  
It's called a zoe life of God.  
Are you hearing me?  
It's inside you.  
 Hallelujah.  
That's why he said he know all these things.  
We are more than conquerors through him that loved us.  
Oh, Hallelujah.  
Go rid of God.  
Wow.  
We know.  
 Whoo!  
Glory to God!  
Yay!  
Yay, yay, yay, yay.  
Absolute knowledge.  
It's absolute knowledge.  
It's within my scope of knowing.  
It's my possession now.  
No one the person that he might be able to comprehend.  
He says, no, take possession of it.  
Are you hearing me?  
Oh, come here.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
 That's that second kind of knowledge.  
I told you the first one is Ginozko.  
The second one, I don't.  
Or like some call it Oida.  
The third one.  
Maybe before I bring you the third one, I want to bring you one other thing that you see when you, you know, revelation sometimes can be stronger and fuller.  
 Are you there?  
Revelation sometimes can be stronger and fuller.  
And sometimes it's important for us to look at them and understand what the Bible says.  
Can I take you to St.  
John's Gospel?  
Remember what Jesus said, and He shall know the truth.  
And the truth shall make you free, right?  
St.  
John chapter 8.  
 Hallelujah!  
Hey!  
You know, with an understanding of this, we are able to locate ourselves.  
We can understand where we are in the realm of the Spirit and how much more we need to grow.  
All right?  
In that John chapter 8 and verse number 32, I want you to read it to me.  
 want to go.  
And ye shall what?  
Ye shall know the truth.  
And ye shall know the truth.  
And the truth shall make you free.  
Now, what Jesus said there was, He used the word gynosco.  
 He said, he shall gynosco the truth.  
And the truth shall make you free.  
Revelation of the truth, okay?  
Revelation knowledge of the truth.  
But there is another word I want to bring in so that you can understand some of these things.  
Revelation without involvement can bring you frustration.  
Are you getting it?  
 Revelation without involvement can bring you frustration.  
That's why you find some people, they seem to know everything.  
And yet their lives don't show that they know anything.  
They've been Christians a long time, according to Scripture.  
They know everything of all the various movements and moves of the Spirit.  
They seem to just know everything.  
They got all the books from everywhere.  
 And so you say, what's the matter with the guy?  
He needs something more than Ginozco.  
Let me show it to you.  
First Timothy, chapter four.  
Are you there?  
Who will read from verse one?  
 so you can get it in the right context.  
Now the Spirit speak it expressly that in a lot of times, some shall depart from the faith, giving heat to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.  
Speaking lives in hypocrisy, having their conscience served with a hot iron, forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meat,  
 which God had created to be received, the thanksgiving of them which believe.  
Here's what I want you to see.  
Them which believe and know the truth.  
He's talking about people who believe and know the truth.  
Now, he said, you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.  
But now he talks about those who believe and know the truth.  
 Let me show you some.  
Notice what he says, and notice what he didn't say.  
He says, doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy.  
He says, in the last days, some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.  
Now, seducing spirits are demons that lure people into forest doctrines.  
 All right?  
Okay.  
So he says, seduce and spirits and doctrines of devils.  
Speaking lies and hypocrisy, having their conscience served with a hot iron, forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from myths which God had created to be received with thanksgiving.  
He says, as a doctrine.  
All right?  
Now, there are doctrines like that.  
 The doctrines that say that it is a sin to get married, they say that, let me explain this, because they had them in Bible days and they still have them today.  
Now when you saw that the Bible talks about the 144,000 men, he says, who have not been defiled by women?  
Okay, now this 144,000, the Bible says, will be weaknesses in the last days.  
 Now we have second groups who say that they have been called out and they've been there from Bible days.  
They've been called out and it is wrong to marry because if you get married then you will be defiled and not be qualified to be a witness of those last days.  
And they also are  
 vegetarians, they say that they do not eat meat.  
Now, that's not to say that anybody who's a vegetarian, somebody's wrong with him.  
He says commanding to abstain.  
That means it is in their doctrine to abstain from meat.  
Okay?  
He's not saying that anybody who does not marry or anybody who does not eat such meat  
 has listened to doctrines of demons.  
That's personal.  
He's dealing with sex.  
Hello?  
Is that okay?  
Okay, because there are some of you here, you don't even eat meat at all.  
And now, when you read this, you don't go and say, no.  
This is commanding to abstain from myths which God had created to be received with thanksgiving of them.  
Which believe?  
 and know the truth.  
Now, he says, and know the truth.  
He's telling us that there are people who know the truth.  
Now, I want to remind you again, he says, and he shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.  
Okay?  
Now, these two groups are different.  
There's one he says, he shall know the truth, the truth shall make you free.  
 But here are others who are not talking about being made free.  
They are living in the realm of Thanksgiving.  
Did you notice?  
They received with Thanksgiving.  
They're not just talking about we are free not to eat meat.  
They've gone beyond that level.  
What's the difference between the two?  
Where he says he shall know the truth.  
He used a word.  
 Ginozco.  
Now, what is this of them that believe and know the truth?  
Who have gone beyond that doctrine of devils?  
He used another word, Epi.  
What?  
I knew you were going to say that.  
Epi Ginozco.  
 This one is Epigenosco.  
Epigenosco is that knowledge that unites the one who knows with what he knows.  
He unites.  
He becomes known.  
I'll give you a clear Scripture.  
Turn to Colossians chapter 1.  
Are you there?  
 Colossians chapter one, I'm reading from verse five.  
For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, where have you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you, as it is in all the world?  
Aha, watch now.  
He says, the word of the gospel, the truth of the gospel that's come to you, as it is in all the world, and bring yet fought fruit as a dot also in you, since the day you heard of it and knew the grace of God in truth.  
 He says, since the deader heard it, it produced fruit in them.  
It produced result in them.  
Since the deader heard it and knew the grace of God in truth.  
That's word and knew.  
Knew the grace of God is epigenosco.  
Epigenosco is a knowledge that unites the Noah and what he knows.  
 It unites them.  
He says, they knew the grace of God in truth.  
And so what happened?  
They grew.  
It says, from the day they heard it.  
From the day they heard it.  
This is a revelation knowledge.  
You see, let's explain for them.  
I told you, revelation has different levels.  
 You can have a revelation of God's word that's impaled to your spirit.  
You just know.  
And it can be big.  
And the greater the revelation that you have in your spirit, the more liberty you have.  
But you see, revelation takes you into the realms of relationships.  
A man has gynosco, revelation knowledge.  
Another man has epic gynosco.  
It's a full-on knowledge.  
 It's a greater revelation.  
That's why some of us have different levels of revelation of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
And the amount of revelation that you have will determine the kind of life that you will live.  
And Paul talked about the abundance of revelations that were given to him.  
All the apostles were not given the same level of revelation.  
 So he might as well say that he was granted an abundance of Epi Ginozco.  
Praise God.  
While many are moving the realm of Ginozco, some have gone epi.  
That will help you remember it.  
Okay, thank you Lord Jesus.  
Look at 2nd Corinthians chapter eight and verse nine.  
 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
That though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor.  
Did you notice that?  
He says, now the first one I showed you, he says, since the day they heard it and knew the grace of God in truth.  
Now this one says, for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
Now the two examples, remember them, the first one says he shall know the truth.  
The other one, he says what?  
Those who believe and know the truth.  
 One group knew the truth.  
The other one had a relationship with the truth, okay?  
And it was a revelation.  
A revelation granted them with relationship, okay?  
They were brought in union with the truth, the new, and it produced resource, greater resource.  
Now this one, the first one we said in Colossians chapter 1 verse 6, we said,  
 They knew the grace of God in truth.  
Okay?  
And that was what?  
Epi Ginozco.  
They related with it and it produced results in their lives.  
But the other ones also knew the grace of God.  
It says, you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.  
But that was Ginozco.  
There's a level of it.  
So it blesses you, but you can have more.  
Praise God.  
So that will lead us to something that we can relate with, which we can deal with.  
 See, there are some things that we can say they're up to God.  
But there are things that we can participate in.  
And they're the ones that I get some good kicks out of.  
You know why?  
Because then I can hold myself responsible for what happens in my life.  
Amen?  
Then I can't blame anybody.  
 So I can't think that anybody can put a limit on me.  
So you can't blame your uncle, or your uncle's wife, or your neighbor, or your boss, or your employee, or anybody.  
You hold yourself responsible.  
He says, ye shall know the truth.  
He didn't say when they know the truth, it will help you.  
 You're in it.  
Now, this next one, which is the third one that I'm bringing to you, the other's noses, epic denosco, are all those ones who are just along the side, okay?  
I told you three kinds of knowledge.  
We've learned one.  
Two.  
The third kind of knowledge.  
And it's such an important  
 kind of knowledge.  
I want us to read something.  
The book of Philemon.  
Thank you, Holy Spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
You ready for this one?  
The book of Philemon  
 It's just got a few verses.  
It's not broken into chapters.  
Turn to verse six, and I want y'all to read it.  


  
Again.  


  
Okay.  
Now, I want to explain  
 why this is so important.  
I don't know whether you all heard what you read or not, but let me read it to you.  
It says that the communication, the sharing, the fellowship of your faith, he's talking about the Christian faith that you have become a part of, may become effectual, operative,  
 says that the communication of thy faith may become effecture, may become operative.  
By the acknowledging, that's the word.  
The Greek is Epic Gnosis.  
By the acknowledging of every good thing, which is in you, in Christ Jesus.  
Epic Gnosis is of full knowledge.  
 It means exact knowledge, full knowledge.  
It's referring to a full comprehension, a full recognition.  
It is a revelation, but revelation with participation.  
This is remarkable.  
It's a revelation, revelation with participation.  
 You see, Abagnosis brings you into the realm of understanding that gets you operating with the fullness of God.  
You remember that was his prayer, says that he may be filled with all the fullness of God.  
He was Paul's prayer for the church.  
There was a knowledge he expected us to have.  
 Colossians chapter 1.  
Have you seen it?  
Verse 9.  
Is this for this course?  
We also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you.  
And the desire that he might be filled with the knowledge, with the hypnosis of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.  
 In our wisdom and spiritual understanding, he says praying for you that you might be filled with that knowledge.  
He wants you to be filled with that kind of knowledge, that full knowledge.  
That exact knowledge.  
I like to put it this way.  
I said, Ginozco, Ginozco is a complete package.  
Like something you've ordered.  
 A complete package.  
You've ordered it and it's been sent to you.  
That's a revelation.  
It's been sent to you.  
It's a full package.  
You know what you ordered for.  
You haven't seen it yet, but you know what's inside.  
You ordered it.  
It's been sent and they tell you it's complete.  
 It's been sent to you.  
So it's coming.  
That's Ginozco.  
When it arrives and you open it, you see everything inside.  
This is no longer Ginozco.  
You now are aware the transaction is completed.  
Now, Ginozco is complete knowledge.  
Ido.  
Ido is the completion of the knowledge.  
 That is the completion of the transaction.  
It has come.  
You are no longer expecting it.  
It's part of your scope of knowledge.  
It's what you possess now.  
It's yours.  
You can see everything.  
 In the package, it's all complete.  
It's all right.  
You know them now.  
You are aware now.  
You had gynusco, a revelation.  
You knew what was inside, even though you hadn't seen it.  
But now it has arrived.  
You are relating with it.  
It is now absolute knowledge.  
Normal assumptions.  
You get it?  
Normal assumptions.  
You are aware.  
You can count them.  
You can see them.  
So that's what Jesus said, I know the Father.  
I know.  
 And with Him, I don't need revelation.  
He was with the Father all the time.  
He said, but you, you need what?  
Ginozco.  
Praise God.  
So now the package has come.  
You have idle knowledge, idle knowledge, absolute knowledge.  
It's there.  
You are aware.  
It's knowledge with awareness.  
 Okay?  
Like Paul says, that's your whole, that your spirit, your heart be flooded with lights, that you may know idle, that you may know the hope of his God.  
He wants you to know all the beauty.  
 of the heavenly realms, all the graces that have been bestowed upon us.  
Like the Bible says, we have not received the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God, those things that came in the package.  
Amen.  
 They came by Genosco.  
They came by Genosco.  
We knew by revelation.  
We received by revelation.  
They came by Genosco, but now the Holy Spirit has shown us all those things, is that we may know the things that are freely given to us of God.  
We are now seeing them.  
Oh, all right.  
That's there.  
All right, and that's there.  
Now, the third level.  
 This dot level is epignosis.  
Epignosis is the completeness of knowledge.  
It is the full knowledge.  
 The full comprehension.  
It is knowledge with a relationship.  
It is knowledge that relates with these objects.  
Now, there's a difference between this one and Epigenosco that I told you about.  
Even though both of them relate, the other one is united.  
Here, there is a relation, a coin onia.  
Do you understand what I'm talking about?  
 So there's growth, there's development.  
It's something I can do for myself.  
That's why he prays that I be filled with this type of knowledge, but that I should have it with all wisdom and spiritual understanding.  
Hallelujah.  
Because as I get this kind of full knowledge of God, my life is changed.  
My life is transformed.  
Epic noses changes your life.  
Epic noses changes your attitude.  
You behave differently.  
Where'd you get it from?  
 You get it from meditation.  
You get it from meditation on the Word of God.  
As you meditate on God's Word, you have a full revelation.  
You meditate.  
It becomes clear to you.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
 Peter tells us how we become partakers of his divine nature.  
He says, it's through this kind of knowledge, through epagnosis.  
We find ourselves participating in the divine realm, the divine nature.  
Your life changes.  
You now understand how you can pray a simple prayer, and it works.  
Look at the Bible.  
They pray simple prayers.  
 But those prayers were powerful.  
Today we are thinking of how to pray powerful prayers for simple matters.  
They prayed simple prayers for powerful matters.  
You are looking for somebody to pray powerful prayer for you, for a simple matter.  
The opposite, because there is no epicnosis.  
This was what made Paul different from the other apostles.  
 I want you to understand this.  
Paul had a relationship with his revelation.  
No one that Peter said concerning Paul, he said, there are some things written by Paul that are hard to be understood, and that many of the unlearners rest at them.  
But at least Peter was studying some of Paul's writings, and he said they were scripture.  
No one that he got a glimpse of it,  
 He used that word four times, a pygnosis.  
But Paul used that word sixteen times, and they were the only two writers who used that word in the whole Bible.  
All the other apostles didn't mention a pygnosis.  
You don't find it in the book of Acts on the gospels.  
 But Paul had related, he said that the communication, see how effective Paul was.  
Now he's talking to them, says the communication of that fact that it may become effectual through the epicnosis of every good thing that is in you in Christ Jesus.  
He's telling you there are good things inside you, and you've got to know what they are.  
He says if you know what they are, through this kind of knowledge, through this full knowledge,  
 He says, your communication, the communication of your faith will become effective.  
Operative.  
You be a winner every day, anywhere.  
Hallelujah.  
What are you going to do with your life?  
What are you going to do with your life?  
Stop meditation without your Bible.  
How can you meditate?  
No wonder in the Old Testament, God, he already revealed this thing.  
He said to Joshua, he said meditate.  
 Daring, day and night, that thou mayest observe to do, according to all that is written therein.  
Just then, thou shalt make thy way prosperous.  
Ah, yeah, yeah.  
This is the end you shall have, good success.  
Not just success, but good success.  
This is meditate.  
 Meditate.  
He says, you will make your way prosperous.  
Some people are praying, oh God, prosper me.  
No.  
He says, you will make your way prosperous.  
How?  
By meditation.  
In a New Testament, we understand it.  
That meditation will bring you what?  
Hypnosis.  
That is short to make the communication of your faith, operative and successful.  
What did he say to Timothy?  
 He said, give yourself wholly to them.  
He says, meditate upon these things.  
He says, meditate upon these things.  
Give yourself completely to them that thy profiting may appear to all.  
He says, people have been looking at you, but they're going to discover your progress.  
He says, your progress will become obvious to everybody.  
It doesn't matter what they think about you, but they cannot deny your success.  


  
 They cannot deny your success.  
They may not like you.  
It doesn't matter.  
They are not a factor.  
Come on, somebody.  
 See, we are on a journey.  
We are on a journey.  
And we have been given the necessary materials to prosper and to be successful.  
It's been bred in our spirit.  
We know who we are.  
 were more than conquerors.  
Through him that loved us, Hallelujah.  
Oh, he says, I am crucified with Christ.  
Nevertheless, I leave, yet not I, but Christ leave it in me, the life that I leave now in the flesh.  
I leave by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me.  
Oh, Hallelujah.  
 When you understand the love of Christ through Ginozco and you meditate on it, it becomes epic Ginozco.  
Hey!  
You begin to relate with it.  
What do you get from there?  
I leave by the fades of the Son of God, who loved me.  
 and give Himself for me.  
In other words, there's a relationship now.  
I'm no longer living by my faith.  
Do you understand what I'm talking about?  
I feel like flying.  
Do you understand?  
Relationship now.  
He says, nevertheless, I live, yet not I, but Christ liveeth in me.  
He says, the life that I live now.  
Oh, I live by the faith of the Son of God.  
 He had mood.  
I live by the faith of the Son of God.  
I have stopped struggling with my faith.  
I have now related with His face.  
I live by the faith of the Son of God.  
If God had faith because of me, if He looked at me and believed I could be successful, then I believe hallelujah, hallelujah.
