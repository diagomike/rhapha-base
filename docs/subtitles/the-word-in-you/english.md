 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 I want to read some things to you, the thoughts in my mind.  
The first book of Samuel, chapter number 22.  
From verse 1, chapter 22, David, therefore,  


  
 departed the ends, and escaped to the cave Adulam.  
And when his brethren and all his father's house heard it, they went down the door.  
Look at verse two.  
And everyone that was in distress, and everyone that was in debt, and everyone that was discontented, gathered themselves onto him.  
 and he became a captain over them, and they were with him about 400 men.  
David had been anointed by the spirit of God to become king of Israel, but he didn't become king of the night.  
Saul was still a little throne, and King Saul wanted David dead.  
 and went out looking for him.  
And who were those who came to David?  
Who were those who came to him?  
Everyone, look at those who gathered with him.  
Everyone that was in distress.  
I wanted to look at the church that David started.  
I listened to me.  
The church David started.  
 was full of people in distress.  
And then everyone that was in debt, they were owing.  
They were all behind in their finances.  
And everyone that was discontented on satisfied.  
They were unhappy with their lives.  
Things are gone so bad.  
All these gathered themselves to David.  
 What did David have?  
What did David have?  
They are not.  
When we began sharing the gospel, it wasn't the very nice folks that came to listen to us, not the good guys.  
The good guys didn't like what we were preaching.  
It seemed too simple.  
 and not for church people.  
It was for dirty people, sinful people, broken people, not the holy people.  
As we preached it, those who don't hear it, we took it.  
Jesus said a man had a banquet.  
 and he invited his friends to come.  
And one by one they gave excuses.  
I organized a seminar in 1984.  
I believe it was 84.  
Organized a seminar.  
I invited many brethren.  
They didn't come.  
 They told me they weren't coming.  
So my friends and I decided to go out and invite the sinners, the dirty, the wicked, the courtists.  
We went out to them.  
The seminar was titled, In Him We Have.  
That was the title.  
In Him We Have.  
 And the Christian brothers and sisters we were inviting didn't want to come.  
So we went out and called, this was 1984.  
We called the bad guys, the bad girls, those that the Christians didn't like to hang around with, we called them.  
These were  
 I said, the bad guys, just think of the bad guys.  
And it came.  
I preached a message in Him we have.  
And I shared with them the various things we have in Christ.  
One by one, the Spirit touched them in a special way.  
 And then they received the Holy Ghost in their dirty jeans, torn jeans, you know, acid wash, all kinds of things.  
These were not the Christians that had time.  
You know, brothers want to say, brah, brah, John, where are you, brah, John?  
And brah, John's style is like this, you know.  
C's, C's.  
These were not brah, no C's.  
 Funny names, they had funny names.  
There was your name.  
There my name would be D. Here's the guys.  


  
Other guys, this is Gabor.  
So, and they gave their hearts to Christ and went out  
 And instead of telling us about Jesus, gets what our old Christian friend said.  
They think they are born again.  
Is this born again?  
It won't last.  
They think they are born again.  
It won't last.  
And who were teaching them the word?  
They had received the Holy Spirit.  
They were preaching everywhere.  
And they were bringing others to Christ.  
 It was explosive.  
More and more people getting born again.  
And guess what they said?  
A fellowship of sinners.  
You know, when they came to the seminar, they came, you know them.  
Well, they came, the guy and the girl,  
 They came with their boyfriends and their girlfriends.  
You get it, and Christians didn't do that.  
All the brothers on one side, all the sisters sat on one side.  
They never, the aisle was between them.  
But now, look at these people all together coming for the seminar, and they got born again in that condition and went back.  
I remember I drew someone's attention.  
 to a girl that had received the Holy Spirit.  
Well, many said to her, she received the Holy Spirit.  
As she walked away, having spoken in tongues, I said, I talked to my friend, I said, Charlie, she's wearing trousers.  
We didn't realize she was wearing trousers when we preached to our late hands, or she received the Holy Ghost.  
I said, she's wearing trousers.  
She received the Holy Ghost in trousers.  
 Holy Ghost didn't look at the trousers.  
Now, some of you here, you don't know what, you don't know what we went through to bring the message to you.  
Now you're wearing trousers, I'm coming to church like this.  


  
I know, you'll be surprised that I'll make any reference to that.  
But just a few years ago, a few years ago,  
 You were not a Christian if you were a girl and you were trousers.  
 It was that bad.  
I remember when we were in an old building, somewhere at Oieleke here, I had invited a certain lady to come share with us in church, a minister of the gospel, and she was well known.  
So she came in, and after preaching for a while, she said, I'm still one of those people that believe that Christian women should not wear trousers.  
Guess what?  
The church, our church, Christ Embassy.  
They were, ah!  
Tell them!  


  
 inside the congregation, our congregation.  
They were very happy that finally someone was going to tell me.  
I didn't say anything, I sat down there.  
I knew she had only a few minutes after preaching, I'll finish.  
Because you see, religious bondage is very difficult to destroy.  
Few years later, her own senior pastor was preaching in trousers, her own senior pastor.  
 who was preaching in trousers.  
Because they finally found out that God did not say anything about trousers in the Bible.  
Aaron, Aaron was wearing gown, Aaron gown, gown.  
And many of the priests had sketch.  
 And then we had to show them from the scriptures what the Bible actually said.  
When he said, the man should not wear that which part in it to a woman.  
And the woman should not wear that which part in it to a man.  
I know some of you are saying, hey, what about that one?  
What about that scripture?  
He didn't say a man should not wear that which belonged get to a woman.  
Say that which part in it.  
I know you are there now.  
 But that is what he said, that which belonging, not that which concerns.  
Come on now, that's what you wanted to say.  
Did I confuse you?  
Okay, let me tell you.  
I told you in reverse, you shouted, but you didn't listen.  
 What he said was, a man should not wear something that belongs to a woman.  
When he said, patent it, that's what he actually meant.  
The Hebrew word meant something that was for a woman, for this particular woman, a man should not wear it.  
Not a style.  
If this thing had been worn by a man, he said, a woman should not wear it.  
 not the style.  
So he meant something which belonged to a particular man, a woman should not go and wear it.  
And he gave reasons.  
He said, because of the discharge.  
This charge from the human body.  
He said, because with that discharge, you will be unclean for seven days.  
Are you listening to this?  
 And that's what he said.  
He didn't mean style of dressing or whether they were trousers or gowns.  
But because they never studied it, so they were confused.  
Well, we left the Holy Breadlet and began to win sinners.  
And Jesus was filling them with the Holy Ghost and bringing them in.  
And they had faith.  
All they knew was Christ in me, the hope of glory.  
 The other ones were hoping that their good works will make them please God.  
Later we found out many of those who had been Christians for such a long time, many of them had not received the Holy Spirit.  
All the news.  
Many of them received the Holy Spirit.  
It was the religious language in the churches.  
They carried on.  
They didn't know the Holy Spirit.  
A lot of them.  
 It hasn't changed because this thing has been in the church for so long.  
You go right into the Old Testament, you would trust the same thing.  
And that's why I read to you, those who came to David, after they realized that the anointing was on David, were they the princes?  
No.  
The noblemen?  
No.  
Those in distress.  
Those that were unhappy with their situation.  
Those in debt.  
 They were the ones that came to David.  
When Jesus came, how many Pharisees gathered with him?  
Read your Bible.  
Why did he go to the deserts to hold meetings?  
They wouldn't allow him in the synagogue.  
After he read the few scriptures and miracles began to happen, they started watching out for him.  
Till next time, Jesus had to move to the deserts where all kinds of people came to him.  
 Who were those who will not come?  
The Sadducees, the Pharisees, the scribes.  
The scribes were reputed for knowing the scriptures.  
They could quote them verse by verse.  
The Pharisees had the thing inside them.  
The Sadducees knew too much.  
How many of them listened to Jesus?  
So to some people, we are not Christian enough.  
 But that is why great things keep happening with us.  
Read many chapters later and see these people that came to David.  
You will see that description again.  
No one was poor.  
No one was in debt.  
No one was discontented.  
They had all become mighty men.  
They were called David's mighty men.  
 The same people.  
And when it was time to give for the building of the temple, they gave... The total amount they gave is written in Scripture.  
I wish I could translate it into Naira for you.  
But you go there and study for yourself.  
You'll be amazed.  
So much gold and silver.  
 They became David's mighty men, mighty men.  
These were men that were broken when they came.  
They were empty when they came.  
They were hopeless when they came.  
Don't let religion destroy your life.  
Are you hearing me?  
Don't let religion destroy your life.  
And don't let human judgment destroy your life.  
You can sit and look at somebody, what will this one do?  
 Anyone that the Holy Spirit is pleased to live in is clean.  
Did you hear me?  
Despise no one.  
Anyone that the Holy Spirit is pleased to live in is clean.  
You know what Jesus said in St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 15?  
Read verse 3.  
St.  
John, chapter 15.  
Read verse 3.  
 Ready for me.  
One, two, go.  
Again.  
One more time.  
When you study the Word of God, you are cleansed.  
He said, you are clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you.  
 You are not cleansed by how long you have been a Christian.  
That is what they didn't know.  
You know, for how long I've been a Christian?  
I've been a Christian for 25 years.  
No!  
You may have been a Christian for donkey years.  
It doesn't matter.  
You are not clean by that.  
Jesus said it.  
You are clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you.  
 You can be clean before men and not be clean before God.  
To be clean before God, it's his word that purifies your soul.  
When that word enters into you, it washes you as white as snow.  
When the word enters you, that's why if you have guilt, like the young man here who has stolen so many phones, you don't even know what to do with the phones.  
Nobody is buying from you.  
 Store so many phones.  
You thought you would make money.  
You didn't make money.  
The phones are there.  
You don't know how to do with them.  
God wants to save your life right now.  
Bow your heads, everybody.  
Bow your heads, please.  
Bow your heads.  
That's young man.  
Raise your hand wherever you are right now.  
Don't let this scene destroy your life.  
Raise your hand wherever you are.  
Because I want to pray for you.  
Where are you?  
Raise your hand quickly.  
 Raise your hand.  
That's young man.  
You were not expecting this.  
Do it quickly.  
Do it quickly.  
Put the second hand on your chest.  
Stand up where you are.  
Put the second hand on your chest.  
Say, Father, forgive me for my sins.  
Wash me from this evil I want to serve you.  
 From today, I will not steal again.  
Help me through the Spirit of God in Jesus' name.  
Amen.  
You are forgiven of your sins.  
Sit down.  
Sit down.  
Praise the Lord.  
Praise the Lord.  
God's word would make you clean.  
 How it happens is this, as you listen, it says, you are clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you.  
As you hear the Word of God, coming into your heart, where there is fear, where there is guilt, where there is worry, the Word of God just merits them away.  
 Faith replaces fear.  
Righteousness replaces guilt.  
Strength replaces weakness.  
Your body may not look different.  
Your clothes may not look different.  
But you feel that pull from God.  
Drawing you close to Him.  
 And you know that you know that you know you are a changed man.  
You are a changed person.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Yes, it's the word you need.  
That's what you need.  
That's what you settle your heart on.  
 Turn the book of Colosians quickly.  
Chapter two.  
Read from verse 13.  
From verse 13.  
Let's go.  


  
Had he what?  
 had he quickened together with him.  
Heaven what?  
Heaven for giving you all trespasses.  
All trespasses.  
All trespasses.  
Read verse 14.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Go to chapter 1.  
Chapter 1, Colossians.  
Read from verse 21.  
Read.  
And who?  
You.  
Come on.  
And you, that's where... Uh-huh.  
Uh-huh.  


  
 I wish you would understand.  
Let me explain something to you about the Word of God so you can know what's going on here.  
The Bible says all his works were finished from the foundation of the world.  
In the Old Testament, he told them, obey my commandments.  
 And then you will be blessed.  
If you don't obey, you will be cursed.  
But the Old Testament didn't work for them.  
They failed God all the time.  
They couldn't obey his voice.  
And God said, I'm going to do a new one.  
I'll make a new covenant.  
 In this new one, Jesus was to die.  
It was based on his blood.  
And then they would receive life.  
But he would receive life for them.  
He would enter into the presence of God for them.  
Are you listening?  
He died for them.  
 He received life.  
He was raised back to life for them.  
He ascended into the presence of God for them and sat on the throne of God for them.  
Then God said, if you will believe that he died for you, then his death would be credited to your account.  
 That means you died.  
If you accept that he was raised to life for you, his resurrection will be credited to your account, meaning you have come back to life.  
If you accept that he ascended into the presence of God for you,  
 Then his ascension and entrance into the presence of God will be credited to your account, meaning you have entered into the presence of God.  
If you accept that he sat on the throne of God for you, then he is sitting on the throne and his very seat will be credited to your account, meaning that you are sitting on the throne.  
 That is the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
He died for me.  
I accept.  
So I will never die for my sin anymore because he died for me.  
But he didn't stop there.  
He was raised for me.  
So I'm back to life.  
 He entered God's presence for me, for me.  
So if I believe, it means it is mine.  
So I have entered in Christ.  
He sat on God's throne.  
I have also sat on that throne.  
And I am seated now, praise the Lord.  
I am there now.  
You see what this means?  
 So my sayings were taken away.  
He gave me righteousness.  
I'm trying to explain to you what the past things of God's word really means.  
What this means.  
Why it is given to us in the past because it's been done.  
It has happened.  
 That's why Peter said, who his own self.  
But our sins on his own body on the tree.  
That we being dead to sin shall live unto righteous.  
That's by whose stripes?  
He were healed.  
He didn't say by whose stripes he are healed.  
No.  
The prophet Isaiah said it before Jesus came.  
When Peter quoted the same thing, he said, by whose stripes?  
He were healed.  
 You wear.  
So if you wear all you have to do, oh, by whose stripes I was here, then I believe.  
Therefore, it is credited to your account.  
You were healed before you found out.  
Now that you have found out, it's yours.  
So you step into it.  
I have received my healing.  
 because I was healed, as I was saved from sin.  
I was redeemed.  
I was.  
I was.  
I was.  
I was.  
I was.  
So who am I now?  
The righteousness of God.  
I am the righteousness of God.  
Glory to God.  
I know who I am.  
Not what I was.  
 I was a sinner.  
I was in weakness.  
I was in distress.  
I was in depth.  
I was discontented.  
But I am a victim.  
I have life now.  
Glory to God.  
 Look, so that's what he's talking about.  
Look at it in Colossians chapter 1, verse 21.  
And you, that way, sometime, alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable.  


  
 Unblamable!  
It doesn't matter who's talking.  
I'm unblamable!  


  
You don't understand this stuff yet.  
You've got to come up to the higher level.  


  
 to present you wholly and unblamable.  
Unblamable?  
But I was the one that made the mistake.  
He says, you are unblamable.  


  
 A lot of times I get to things like this, I remember what Paul said, I could not speak unto you as unto the spiritual.  
There's a language.  
I'm hoping and really looking forward to that time where many of God's children will come on the sin.  
They'll come on that sin and understand who they are in Christ.  
 We haven't even begun to scratch the fringes.  
Unblimmable?  
But I broke it.  
I'm unblimmable?  
Somebody said, I can understand that.  
Yes, you can't with your brain.  


  
 Can I give you an example?  
Jesus was teaching in his house.  
Maybe you didn't realize it was Jesus' house.  
It was his house.  
You know, they said, foxes have holes, the birds of the earth, the son of man, nowhere to lay.  
He said, he didn't say that in generic terms.  
He was going somewhere.  
 And in that place, they failed to make a ready for him, where they were supposed to have prepared for him.  
They failed to make a ready.  
And while he was standing there, some people came to him.  
The Bible says his disciples were angry that the people there didn't prepare for Jesus.  
And now someone said, Master, I want to follow you.  
He said, look, foxes have holes.  
The best of the air I've missed.  
I have no place to stay.  
That was where he said it.  
 He didn't speak it generically that he never had a house.  
Anyway, he had a house.  
It was his house that he was preaching in when the Bible says the place was full and many were outside.  
It was so full that four men brought their friends and they didn't find a way to get in.  
The Bible says they climbed the building and broke up the roof.  
The broke up the roof.  
 and dropped the man in the presence of Jesus.  
Did you read that Jesus asked them to pay?  
Why?  
I know you don't understand this stuff.  
When we come up to that level, we'll begin to understand.  
I told you one time how that I left my pain here.  
 There are other times that's happened before.  
But on this particular occasion, I needed it.  
And declared the place.  
I took my bag like this, I said, in the name of Jesus.  
I command the pen to come in here.  
I opened it and brought it out.  
 Are you listening to what I'm saying?  
I can tell you many things like that.  
But sometimes we're careful not to say some things because the people who would think like, is it magical?  
No, it's not.  
There are strange things we do every day as a normal way of life.  
Yeah, it's a reality.  
Every day.  
 And sometimes if we say this thing, they'll find it difficult to believe.  
That's what the Bible says that Jesus did so many miracles that if they were written, the world will not contain the books that would be published.  
That's what the Bible says and God never exaggerates.  
He said, Jesus did so many miracles that if there were to be written, the world will not contain the books.  
 which means his life was an unending stream of the miraculous.  
Here, God said, to present you unblamable and unapprovalable.  
That's another way of letting you know that he brought you into a life of endless miracles, endless possibilities.  
 You are ironing.  
The clot is burnt.  
He says, you are unbelievable.  
Why are you unbelievable?  
What does that mean?  
If you come up to that level, if you grow to that level of faith, you put your hand on it and clean it.  
If you didn't know, and someone came and said, look at what you did.  
It was when you passed here that that thing broke.  
Oh, I didn't know I broke it.  
Bring it.  
 You put it together.  
Unblamable.  
Unblamable.  
Unblamable.  
Sometimes you say, oh, bring it.  
It will cost you nothing to replace it.  
 Unblinnable and unrepremable in his sights.  
Do you know what that means?  
It means that in God's sights, this works have been perfected.  
As far as God is concerned, that is the way he sees us to be.  
Unblinnable and unrepremable.  
Listen, when God created all things in the Book of Genesis, read chapter 1.  
After he finished everything,  
 The Bible says, God said that he saw that everything was very good.  
He was satisfied.  
He had so worked on you and perfected you that nothing should fail.  
No heart failure, no long condition, no heart condition, nothing.  
You were so fashioned by God.  
 that everything would take care of itself, a complete natural balance.  
They said too much protein, cause this.  
Too little sugar, cause this.  
Too much sugar, cause this.  
The way God made you, according to this book, the way he made you.  
If it was too little sugar, it would balance it.  
If it was too much sugar, it would balance it.  


  
 Why are you listening?  
This was the man that God made.  
This was the man that God made.  


  
He said to the man when he put him in the garden, of every tree in the garden, you are free to eat.  
 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the midst of the garden, you must not eat of it.  
For the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die."  
What does the meaning of the word die?  
It means to fail.  
It means to seize to work.  
To seize to function.  
It means damage.  
 It means to finish.  
It means to fade.  
There's where the problem came from.  
When the air of that tree, it became possible for the heart to feel, for the lungs to feel.  
Death came into the system  
 The blood began to fail.  
But the Bible says that Christ has brought us into life.  
He has finished with a matter of sin.  
And that sin shall not have dominion.  
Sin is not just an act.  
It is a nature.  
It is a system.  
It is a principle.  
When it's that sin shall not have dominion over you.  
 It meant the works of sin, the results of sin, the principle of sin shall not have dominion over you.  
If it shall not have dominion over you, then why should your condition fail?  
Why?  
Why should your heart fail?  
 Why should your lungs fail?  
Why should cancer find its way into your body?  
Why?  
Why?  
You know what God said was the reason?  
He said, my people perish for the lack of knowledge, the lack of knowledge.  
So, because you didn't know, now that you know,  
 Now that you know, I said, now that you know, what are you going to do?  
Tell somebody to use your mouth.  
Talk to your lungs.  
You say lungs, normal failure, heart, normal failure.  


  
 Bones, no more failure.  
Blood, no more failure.  


  
That's why the Bible says, stay up the gift of God that is in you.  
That gift is talking about is the gift of the Holy Ghost.  
 The gift of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God has come to dwell in you.  
He's not talking about one of the several gifts.  
He's talking about the Holy Ghost Himself that has come to live in you.  
The power of God, the life of God that is in you, is a stare of that gift.  
The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
Now the Holy Spirit, because Paul said,  
 Timothy received it when he laid hands on him, and he wasn't talking about the other gifts of the Spirit, which he received when the press betray laid hands on him.  
There's a difference.  
He received the Holy Ghost when Paul laid hands on him.  
Now, if the Holy Spirit is in you, as you stand the power of the Holy Spirit, the more of the Spirit God has at working you, the less the things of this life can affect your body.  
 That's why Paul was beaten by a separate and he felt no harm.  
Because the power of the Holy Ghost has been stared within him before that happened.  
You stare yourself, it doesn't matter what bites you.  
It will mean nothing.  
 because he said one of the signs to follow the believing ones.  
If they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them.  
Whether you are drinking it with your mouth or drinking with your vein makes no difference.  
If it enters into your body, it shall have no power over you.  
Oh, glory to God.

Hallelujah.  
 Hallelujah.  
I said, Hallelujah.  
No one let that girl in South Africa who had no uterus.  
The doctor removed the uterus.  
She couldn't have been pregnant.  
She came in for the night of bliss.  
 She said she knew if she came for the meeting, she would be healed by the power of God.  
Heart was going to happen.  
She didn't know, but she knew if she entered that place.  
A miracle will happen.  
She came in for the meeting.  
The power of God was on us that night when we finished.  
A short while later, she was pregnant.  
She thought, what?  
This is for real.  
She went to the doctor.  
The doctor couldn't believe she was pregnant.  
 Check the test.  
She was pregnant.  
Pregnant?  
Yes, she was.  
Then she had to go for another test.  
This time she went to the very doctor that took away the uterus.  
And the doctor couldn't believe what he saw.  
She was pregnant.  


  
 How do such things happen?  
I said, how do they happen?  
How do they happen?  
How do they happen?  
Say this with me.  
I'm not an ordinary person.  
Say again, I'm not an ordinary person.  
Say, I have the life of God in me.  
 Every fiber of my being.  
Every bone of my body.  
I got the life of God in me.  
It's in my head.  
It's in my hands.  
It's in my legs.  
It's all over me.  
Hallelujah.
