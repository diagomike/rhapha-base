title: Heirs of Bondage
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  
In 2013, we discussed some things.  
I said, the human spirit is influenced by principles, by relationships, and by actions.  
 They control your plans, your purposes, and your pursuits in life.  
They decide or alter destinies.  
Not too many people realize how important this is, how real this is.  
Otherwise, they'll be more careful about these things.  
What you will be in life  
 will depend on these three.  
Okay, I wrote down a few things you can put down so you don't forget.  
Write this down.  
Of course, if you get into a good dictionary, it will give you something close.  
But this is the best.  
Yeah, I will always give you the best.  
Sure, sure.  
A principle is a moral rule  
 A principle is a moral rule of belief or assumption.  
A principle is a moral rule of belief or assumption that controls influences or explains personal conduct  
 or behavior of a society.  
It explains how or why something works or happens the way it does.  


  
It's also a basic theory or truth, an idea,  
 that forms the basis of anything.  


  
Now, sometimes you find people can have their own principles created consciously or unconsciously.  
 for them zeros as individuals, sometimes with their families, sometimes a whole society.  
Then we say, the Koreans do things like this.  
Meanwhile, it's not written down.  
The Africans behave like this.  
The  
 Americans behave like this.  
The Nigerians, the Yorubas, they behave like this.  
They do this or that.  
And these things are not written down.  
But there are certain principles by which they live.  
How they come about them?  
They form them through certain beliefs, certain ideas in their heads, certain assumptions,  
 You know, there are certain people who don't believe in God because they have some ideas in their heads.  
And so they say, I just don't believe in God.  
You say, why don't you believe in God?  
Well, I just don't believe.  
Why don't you?  
I said, that's just me, you see.  
 He's living his life according to a particular principle, a thought, an idea in his mind.  
Now, whether that idea is right or wrong is not what we're dealing with, just the fact that he is going to control order his life in a certain direction because of something somewhere in his head.  
 That'll decide his destiny, whether or not he knows it.  
It'll affect him, whether or not he knows it.  
But how powerful, how influential this will be, depends on certain factors.  
The second thing is relationships.  
 Now, these are different kinds of relationships, but they're all relationships, biological, geographical, emotional, spiritual.  
They have something to do with your life.  


  
The family you come from, those who live around you,  
 proximity, just meeting them every day.  
They have some influence on your life.  


  
Your friends, those that make you happy or sad, they have an influence on your life.  


  
Then your spiritual relationships with God, with the devil, with demons,  
 with fellow Christians, or those who know not God, who exercise certain spiritual influence on your life.  
All this, whether or not you knew before you came here tonight, these things have already affected you.  
For good or ill, your actions,  
 Not many realize that the actions have something to do about the whole life.  
So they just think, well, I just did it.  
You just did it?  
Yeah, that was what was on my mind at that time.  
So I just did it.  
You just did it.  
It's not about now.  
It's about the impact this action is going to have on the rest of your life.  
 but not many things like that.  
They think it's overweight, let's move on, move on.  
The on that you're moving in is already affected by what you just did.  
Whether you're moving on is going to be to the right, to the left, wherever you're moving now, has been already affected.  
 by your action.  
There's a portion of the Bible I read to you.  
And I'll use an expression which I didn't use then, but because I want to encapsulate all of it in just a one-liner for you.  
Ayers of bondage.  
I told you about Ayers of bondage.  
 So I'm saying, if you look at your notes, you won't find the term as of bondage, what is the best way to describe what I told you.  
So when I start reading that to you now, you will remember what I shared with you.  
As of bondage.  
There are people who inherit bondage.  
They inherit darkness.  
They're gonna go the way their grandfather went.  
They're gonna go in the same direction their father went.  
 Their dad was full of anger and they're gonna be full of anger.  
They may not be there yet.  
The guy may even say, well, I don't wanna be like my dad.  
But the question is not whether you wanna be like him.  
The question is, are you following in the steps that would take you in the direction to be like him?  
They said he was an angry man.  
You're not angry yet.  
 You might soon be angry, except you take into consideration all the things I just shared with you in the first three principles, the first three factors that I mentioned.  
Why is it that the guy who never thought he would act like his father, when he got to 55, he became exactly like his dad.  
 Like 30, he said he would never act that way.  
He was sure he would never be that way.  
At 55, he was exactly like him.  
What happened is a bondage.  
There are heirs of bondage.  
They're going to go the way the society goes.  
They're not different from those among whom they live.  
 And yet the Bible says, come out from among them and be separated the Lord.  
They couldn't come out because they didn't know the principles were coming out.  
They thought they'd just relocate and they relocated their cities.  
It didn't change anything.  
You can move from here and live in Australia.  
It will not change your life.  
It's not where you live.  
 In the physical world, it's where you live in the spirit.  
That's what counts.  
How come the fellow who said, he will never get angry, got mad in church.  
The same way his father walked out on the chips in that little town where they lived.  
 He's the way this man now has walked out on the church and the leaders.  
He hasn't changed.  
He's the same.  
He just did his own in church, even though he's born again.  
His life didn't change.  


  
Why?  
He has a bondage.  
Okay.  
 I think I should read that portion that I read to you.  
Some of you are already remembering it.  
Some are thinking what exactly?  
St.  
Matthew's Gospel, the 23rd chapter, will begin reading from verse 31.  
St.  
Matthew's Gospel, 23rd chapter from verse number 31.  
Now, Jesus is talking here, and whenever Jesus talks, you better listen.  
 Wherefore ye be wetness is unto users, that ye are the children of them which kill the prophets?  
This is very interesting.  
Let's put it in the right context.  
Go to verse 29.  
He says, warn to use crimes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because ye bear the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous.  
 and say, if we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.  
Hold on, just look at that scripture.  
They said, we'll never have been like our fathers who did those wicked things.  
If we had been there then, we'll never have joined them to kill the prophets.  
You see that?  
The guy said, I'll never be like that.  
I'll never do that.  
 Well, it's not just by saying that.  
What about the principles?  
What about the relationships?  
What about the actions?  
Remember when Peter said to Jesus, I'll never deny you.  
Jesus said, before the cock crows, twice, you would deny me thrice in the morning.  
 Next day.  
He said, Master, I'll never do that.  
Never.  
The next day he did.  
Why did he happen to him?  
Let's see.  
Back to that scripture.  
And say, if we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.  
 Next verse.  
Hm.  
He says, now you have testified.  
You've said it clearly.  
You are the children of those who killed the prophets.  
32.  
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.  


  
 In other words, go ahead, complete their work.  
He says, you're just like them.  
Next verse.  
He suffers what a description.  
He says, he's suffering.  
He's generation of Vipas.  
Hi.  
He says, how can you escape the damnation of hell?  
 These are some of the strongest words from the lips of the man of Galilee.  
Think about this.  
That man of love, he speaks so strongly, he calls them suppers.  
Generation of Vipas.  
How can you escape the damnation of hell?  
Next verse.  
 Wherefore behold, I say unto you prophets and wise men and scribes, and some of them ye shall kill.  
Like the fathers did.  
He says, you haven't changed.  
You're gonna act just like your daddy.  
He says, some of them you shall kill.  
They said, if we had lived in our fathers days, we would have never been partakers with them in killing the prophets.  
Now, Jesus says, relax.  
 Just like them.  
Just how sinned you.  
Prophets and wise men and scribes.  
And some of them shall kill and crucify.  
And some of them shall use God in your sin others and persecute them from city to city.  
Did they believe him?  
No, but they did.  
Next verse.  
 that upon you may come all the righteous blood of shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous able onto the blood of Zechariah's son of Barakaz whom you slew between the temple and the altar.  
Terrible.  
Verily I say unto you, all these things shall come upon this generation.  
 Next verse.  
Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem.  
Thou that careless the prophets and stonest them which has sent on to thee.  
How often would I have gathered that children together?  
Even as a hen gathered had chickens on their wings and ye would not.  
Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.  
Dear God.  
 For I say unto you, you shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."  
That's the solution.  
That's the solution.  
The recognition and welcoming of Christ is the only way.  
That's the only way for the change.  


  
 That's the only way for the change.  


  
Wow!  
In Hosea, chapter 4, verse 17, very powerful, done there.  
Hosea, chapter 4, verse 17.  
A painful verse.  
It says, if frame is jowling to idols, let him alone.  
 Is this iframe is joined to idols, leave her alone.  
Iframe is the name of that try.  
Join to idols.  


  
Join to his idols.  
 Know what it is when God turns and says it's no use.  
Make sure that your life as a Christian is as the word says.  
If you take your eyes away from the word, you will turn into something else.  
 You must stay focused on the word.  
The Bible says turn not away to the right hand or to the left.  
Stay focused on the word.  
Let the word have dominion over your mind and over your spirit, over your thoughts, over your opinions.  
The Bible says the word God is a lamp.  
 You carry a lamp with you.  
Carry it with you because a lamp only gives light that's dispersed around it.  
It doesn't have strong beams.  
So you don't just turn it and look and say, okay, I'm going.  
That's not a lamp.  
You carry a lamp with you.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Because we're in a day, the Bible says the coming of the Lord will not take place until their first of all is a falling away.  
 And that means that there are people who become Christians and there will have to be a difference between those who love him and those who only love themselves, their own bellies.  
Because there are people who have, the Bible says, the kingdom of God is as a man who cast a net into the sea and all kinds of fishes got in good and bad.  
And he brought them to land and separated the good from the bad.  
 Then he talked about the sheep and the gods.  
Jesus says, when he comes, he will separate the sheep from the gods.  
The sheep, he says, he'll put to his right hand and the gods to the left.  
And he will say to the gods, depart from me, you walk as of iniquity.  
I never knew you.  
I never knew you.  
Never knew.  
Never knew.  
What about all the time they were in church?  
 because they were after their own desires, not after the Lord.  
You need to watch yourself, watch your heart, watch yourself, watch yourself.  
The Christian life is a journey, okay?  
Every day is a fresh day to serve God.  
Every day is a new day to walk in the light.  
 Very important.  
Let me read you some scriptures.  
Revelation chapter two.  


  
Read verse 25, everyone.  
Verse 25.  
Revelation chapter number two.  
Verse 25.  


  
 For that which you have already, hold fast, till I come.  
Because of the possibility of losing it.  
People lose their healings.  
 There have been people who got healed, gloriously healed, they were excited, they gave testimonies, and you could see they were perfectly healed.  
And they walked in their head for some maybe even 18 months.  
And then back to where they were before.  
Brother, what happened?  
I lost my healing.  
You lost your healing?  
What happened?  
 Read, for that which ye have already hold fast, till I come.  
Don't hold fast for six months.  
Hold fast.  


  
Let's read another one.  
Same book, Revelation, chapter three.  
 This time, verse 11.  
Read, want to go.  


  
Oh, so there's a crown.  
Yes, there's a crown waiting.  
There's a crown waiting.  
 The guy was winning souls, winning souls, winning souls in church.  
Until for some reason, he stopped winning souls.  
Something offended him.  
Maybe an usher offended him.  
Maybe the pastor said something that offended him.  
Now he doesn't win souls anymore.  
He's offended.  
You know what he's done?  
There was a crown of righteousness waiting for him.  
Now someone else is gonna get it.  


  
 Read it again, read it.  
Behold, I come quickly.  
Jesus said, He's coming.  
Hold that fast, which thou hast that love and take thy crown.  
You're the best giver in your church.  
The number one giver, until you've started asking yourself, how come I'm giving so much?  
The number two person is even very far away from me.  
 I give so much, and the next person's own is very small compared to mine.  
Maybe I should relax a little bit.  
Hold fast that which you have.  
Let another man take your crown.  


  
If it weren't possible for someone else to get it, he wouldn't say so.  


  
 Why do you want to wait until someone else, you want to see someone else doing what God told you to do?  
It's one of the deepest pains.  
It's a pain.  
And this earth, life in this earth is not enough to feel that pain.  
You feel it here?  
 And then, in eternity, it's a pain.  
The pain that will never go away.  
To see someone else fulfilling what God told you to do.  
And you will know.  


  
You will.  
 There are people who have walked away.  
Did you know that when God called Saul to be king of Israel, he promised him an eternal dynasty?  
He did.  
The guy was promised an eternal dynasty.  
He was going to be there, his children and grandchildren.  
It was just going to be forever.  
In other words, the Christ could have come by Saul.  
He lost it.  
 David got it.  


  
There's a time to pray for someone.  
I tell you, don't go too far.  
Some people play games with the spirits until they go too far.  
That's what happened to Saul.  
He had gone too far.  
And even Samuel the prophet was in a seeding and praying for him until God said to Samuel, he said, stop praying for Saul.  
 I found someone else to replace him.  
Break the story.  
That's what he told him.  
He said, stop praying for Saul.  
Is that how long are you going to weep over Saul?  
I found someone else to replace him.  
Do you remember the man named Esau?  
The Bible tells us that Esau, let's read his story.  
Let's read about him.  
Book of Hebrews.  
 He's a story is another painful one, but this time we're just going to look at what the Bible says of him in the New Testament.  


  
Hebrews chapter 12.  
There are things that, you know,  
 I wish the church could be reminded again and again, but as you know, you can't preach the same thing every day.  
Is that correct?  
You can't just continue saying the same thing every day.  
But once in a while, you need to be reminded of these important things.  
Chapter 12, Book of Hebrews, begin from verse 14.  


  
 Follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.  
Do you see that?  
Follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord.  
There's many mistakes about it.  
You can't just live the way you choose.  
You have to live a holy and a godly life.  
 Looking diligently, watch this now.  
Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness, springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defied, lest any root of bitterness, springing up, don't allow a root of bitterness, no matter what was said against you, no matter what you heard, no matter what happened to you,  


  
 because you were delayed for five minutes.  
You were so upset, so angry.  
I can take it.  
Okay.  
Look at this.  
 Look, intelligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness, springing up, lest any root of bitterness.  
It's not even allowed, it's springed up in your life.  
And thereby many be defired.  
How does it defy many?  
When one person is bitter, he starts talking to other people.  
He starts telling everybody ears, everyone who comes to see him brother, says to him, why, why?  
He opens his mouth and says everything.  
 then he defies another person.  
And then the one who even went to counsel him now joins him is defired.  
That's why when someone is bitter, it's better to let the pastor go and see him, or you tell him to go and see the pastor, because you may endanger yourself by going to him.  
Because by the time he's through with you, you might join him in the bitterness.  
And that's what has happened to a lot of people.  
 See, Christianity, we are not the ones that started it.  
It's not new.  
So go and find out those who walked to walk and those who couldn't, sort of fell by the way side.  
What Christianity continued.  
When somebody said to me, I will never enter the church again.  
I said, I will remain here.  
And I'm still in church.  
 And he's in the word.  
Hallelujah.  
Look at verse 16.  


  
 Oh, oh!  
Read verse 17.  
Read it.  
Read it.  
Want to go.  
Is that in your Bible?  
For you know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing, you see,  
 When he was ready to inherit the blessing, the Bible says he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance, though he started carefully with tears.  
His tears were not enough.  


  
Just to let you hold fast that which you have.  
You were made a cell leader.  
You didn't know that that was so important to you and to God and to the church.  
 It meant nothing to you.  
And when you were upset enough, you walked away from the cell, walked away from the members, people for whom Christ died.  
You were put in charge of souls for whom Christ died.  
You didn't care.  
You walked away.  
You thought you were doing it for the church.  
I feel sorry for you.  
You were not doing it for the church.  
You know, sometimes some people give money and they think they gave it to the church.  
If you gave it to the church, you lost it.  
 We don't give money to the church.  
We give it to God.  
We bring it to the church because that is the place that he described for us to give it to him.  
As long as they're not arms, arms are given to the poor.  
But when you're giving your offering, you bring it to the house of God.  
When you're giving your types, you bring it to the house of God.  
In the church.  
But it was not given to the church.  
 I gave XYZ amount of money to the church.  
I know how much I've given to the church.  
No wonder you are in problems.  
Yes, because when you were given, you thought you were given it to the church.  
And the church made no promise.  
The church couldn't promise you nothing.  
The only promise on your giving is from God.  
It's from His Word.  
The church couldn't promise you anything.  


  
 You see, our Christian life is not a game.  
This is serious.  
It's based on spiritual principles.  
It's a spiritual life that we're actually living.  
And Jesus is coming again.  
Whether or not you know it.  
 What we tell others because it's important, the Lord said so.  
He will come and it is nearer today than ever before.  
It is nearer today.  
You know the Bible tells us, I wish I could read all of these things to you.  
But it tells us that in the last days, when  
 the Son of wickedness, the men of sin, the antichrist, comes into office.  
There will be great persecution, the persecution of the saints.  
Now, I believe that by the time the antichrist is coming in, we would have taken off  
 I believe we would have gone.  
I believe we would have checked out of this world.  
But the world will continue.  
The world will continue.  
And of course they'll give weird reasons for our sudden disappearance.  
It all happened according to the Bible.  
 in everything the stage is getting set.  
It is closer now than ever before.  
In fact, the Bible tells us during that seven-year period of the tribulation that the saints, because there will be saints in those days, there will be those who believe in Jesus in those days, because the rapture would be assigned to them.  
The rapture of the church will be assigned to them and many people become serious with God.  
 But the problem is, there will be so much persecution against those who believe in Jesus Christ at that time.  
The barber says they will not be able to buy or sell.  
They will be separated from the financial system of the world.  
 They can't participate except they receive the sign, the mark of the beast.  
And the Bible says that mark will be put on the forehead or on the right hand.  
But anyone who receives that mark, the Bible says, is doomed forever.  
 But if you don't have the mark, you can't buy, you can't sell, you can't participate in the financial system.  
And you know what?  
What are the banks planning now?  
The planning that your credit cards have too many problems.  
They can be broken, they can be stolen.  
And with so many problems,  
 they have decided that the best thing is to put a microchip.  
We think, can you imagine, they didn't read the Bible, but they have decided the best place to have it is on the forehead or the right hand, and they didn't read the Bible.  
That was written by John the Revelator almost 2,000 years ago, another planet.  
Only three weeks ago,  
 The governor of New Jersey, United States of America, made a suggestion on how to monitor illegal immigrants.  
And what did he say?  
Very simple.  
He says, let's go after them the same way UPS monitors its parcels.  
What does that mean?  
What does that mean?  
They're going to have that barcode.  
They're going to have that microchip.  
 And you can't put it on the immigrants whom you don't know.  
They said there are 11 million in the United States whom they can't find.  
They don't know who is who.  
So everybody's got to get it.  
And that's the only way you can know who is who.  
So these suggestions are accepted as the best way to organize society.  
So they're not just going to force it on people.  
It's just going to come sneaky.  
 in a way that everybody says it's fine.  
And then those who believe in Jesus, who read the Bible, and they say, no, this is not good for us.  
And others will say, what's the matter with you?  
You always separate yourselves.  
You Christians, you are the problems of society.  
And they will be marked for persecution.  
The stage is set, brothers and sisters.  
 It's said, there's just one thing left.  
It is the super provocation.  
What do I mean by that?  
It is the provocation of the world against Israel.  
It's mounting, it's increasing.  
So you think it's an Israel thing, it's not an Israel thing.  
The problem with Israel is what it stands for.  
Israel is the sort of sturdian of the revelation of Jehovah.  
 That is the problem with Israel.  
That is what Israel is headed for.  


  
And that is the problem with the church.  
With the Christians.  
Because they are connected to the history of Israel.  
That's the problem with the church.  
 I mean, that is what they think is the problem.  
You get it?  
And that's why the church will be persecuted.  
The Bible says, these child, talking about Jesus when he was born, is set for his sign that shall be spoken against.  


  
 So when you find us preaching with somewhat enthusiasm and urgency, it's because we read the Bible and we know the time is short.  
The time is short and we've got to hurry.  
We've got to win more souls.  
That's what we're doing it.  
We've got to hurry up.  
 Somebody said, oh, God already knows everybody that's gonna be born again, so there's no point doing anything.  
Really?  
It's because you don't read the Bible.  
In the same way, we could say, so God already knows what I will do right or wrong.  
It might as well do whatever because God already planned whether I'm gonna do right or wrong, which takes away responsibility, accountability,  
 So how will God judge the world since he is therefore responsible for whether I do right or wrong?  
Don't deceive yourself.  
There will be a judgment.  
There will be.  
There will be a judgment.  


  
 So don't think that if you have the excuse that it was so and so that offended you and that's why you behaved the way you did, that God would say, all right, I understand.  
It's not going to be that way.  
It's not going to understand it like that.  
No.  
Are you still here?  
Yeah.  
So those are words of admonition and warnings.  
 You see, because you have to build your life with the Word of God.  
He left us with sufficient information before he went to heaven, Jesus Christ.  
See, he left us with sufficient information.  
He told us anything else that he hadn't said the Holy Spirit would tell us.  
And the Holy Spirit has been with us since he came on the day of Pentecost.  
 teaching us, strengthening us, guiding us, directing us.  
Hallelujah.  
So don't live your life as though there's no future.  
No.  
Live like someone who's waiting for his master.  
Think about this.  
How many of you ever had a dog?  
Some even do have now.  
 Let me see your hair.  
Okay, do you have a dog?  
Okay, let me tell you what we do to dogs.  
Did you create a dog?  
No, you bought it or someone gave it to you as a gift.  
I don't even know if you found it in the street and learned it home.  
But somehow you got this dog.  
 And then you have this nice way of treating your dog.  
Your dog should be happy to be in your house.  
After you give him all the nice food, you even have a dress for him.  
You've given him a name and he should answer that name.  
In fact, there are no dogs in the city that are enjoying like your dog.  
He should be happy to be in your house.  
 That's what you think.  
You've given your dog a life to live.  
You've chosen the type of life he should live.  
You decide when he goes out.  
You're gonna walk him out when you choose, when you wanna do it.  
And then you walk him back, right?  
And in fact, when you're taking him out, sometimes you put a chain on his neck.  
Correct?  
How happy is your dog?  
Do you hear of the happy chickens in Europe?  
Okay, you don't know about that.  
 They say that the chicken would be sweeter when you eat it if it lived a happy life before he was killed.  
So they have monitors who go around to check how happy the chickens are.  
Where is God?  
Okay, so this dog, you've planned his life.  
Is that correct?  
I mean, you've chosen a lifestyle for your dog and he should be happy.  
 And you didn't create the dog.  
But you're smart enough to give him a nice life.  
You've planned his future.  


  
You choose his food.  
You get him the best food.  
He doesn't need to work for his food.  
I mean, you've taken the responsibility to go to the mall and get him.  
In fact, you place a stand in order.  
The food is supplied.  
 Your dog is happy.  
And so you find no reason whatsoever for him to be upset.  
That's you who didn't create a dog.  
And you get surprised that God Almighty who created us, she will have a life that he has chosen for you to live.  
Think about it.  
You didn't hear that very well.  
If you, who didn't create the dog?  
 could be kind enough and nice enough to give your dog a life.  
You have chosen the life that he should live.  
You've planned his future, and you find no reason why he should be upset.  
Because you've given him the best life.  
He's enjoying better than other dogs in the city.  
And you said to him, go and find out what your mates are doing outside.  
They're suffering.  
I house you.  
You can even jump on my bed.  
 If you could think so well and plan the future and the life of your dog, why do you wonder that Almighty God has a plan for your life?  


  
He created you, you didn't create the dog.  
Some dogs have passports, international traveling passports.  
 And some are heirs, heirs of their master.  
The master didn't give his property his inheritance to anybody else, but to the dog.  
There's a parrot, one of the richest parrots in the world.  
The master left him an inheritance, including the house.  
Amazing.  
How we feel for our dogs and our cats.  
 Look at that lady who's cut slips on the sim bed with her.  
Nice little meow.  
Hallelujah.  
But God Almighty has a plan for our lives and we're wondering why we should follow it.  
Listen, He's got a plan for you.  
And the best thing will be to discover that plan and to work in the light of it.  
Amen.  
 And His plan is the best plan.  
Spirit of God is with us.  
Building us, strengthening us, always letting carry out His ministry in your life.  
Let Him carry out His ministry in your life.  
You can't do it on your own.  
You need His help.  
You need the Holy Spirit's help.  
 A situation that you can't face, he will help you face it.  


  
Sometimes you might even have some challenges with your own behavior.  
Things you'd like to stop, and you don't know how.  
The Holy Spirit is the answer.  
 He will help you if you let him.  
Remember, man, Pastor was ministering to him.  
Pastor had been praying for him for a while and went to see him and said, look, the Lord asked me to come and talk to you.  
You've got to change your way of living.  
You can't keep going in this direction.  
 He said, I know, I know, I know you're right, but I don't want to change.  
He said to the pastor, I know God sent you, I have respect, and he started crying while he was talking to the pastor.  
He was weeping, weeping, I know, I know, I know you're right.  
I know I'm going in the wrong direction, but I'm not going to change it.  


  
 He didn't change it.  
A few years later, he died, cressing God.  
Cressing God.  
That's how he died, blaming God.  
Will you suppose such a person would have gone?  


  
 You know, sometimes we think that just because someone is in a certain condition, he wants a change.  
Not everyone wants a change.  
That's why I just told you that.  
Not everyone wants a change.  
Some are okay.  
Listen, leave me alone.  
I'm okay.  
Please leave me alone.  
We can't leave you alone.  
We're gonna try.  
We're gonna try because you don't know what you're doing.  
 You're making the wrong decision.  
Yes, it's my decision.  
Please leave me alone.  
No, it would leave you alone.  
Because we can see that you don't understand.  
I understand.  
Leave me alone.  
No, I'm walking away from you right now, but I'm going to keep praying for you.  
Please don't pray for me.  
No, I will pray for you.  
I'll pray for you.  
 When they tell you don't pray for me, keep praying for them.  
They need prayer.  
They may not realize it.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm strong.  
I'm strong.  
I'm strong.  
I'm sound.  
I'm full of love.  
My life is full of grace.  
And I know it.  
God lives in me.  
He lives in me.  
 It lives in me.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
It should become your consciousness.  
Your consciousness.  
I'm full of God.  
I am full of God.  
My whole spirit soul and body.  
I'm full of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
How many of you are full of God?  


  
I know for some people that is just, you know, it's a Christian talk.  
It's being positive.  


  
 It doesn't really strike any call.  
But my brother, my sister, until that becomes a reality in your consciousness, you will not be living a Christian life.  
The only way you live it is to be God inside minded.  
God is in you.  
 You have to become conscious.  
You have to become conscious.  
Oh, can we read the scriptures?  
Second Corinthians chapter 6, begin from verse 14.  
Let's see.  
Second Corinthians chapter 6, verse 14.  
Be not unequally yoked together.  
Do you understand that construction?  


  
 Someone said, no, that's minus, minus, which is plus.  
No.  
Be not unequally yoked.  
It is not minus, minus, which is plus.  
Don't interpret those words with mathematics.  
I want to explain to you what that is very simply.  
Both of you come.  
Handsome, guys.  
Can you see this two gentlemen?  


  
 Okay, thank you.  
Imagine that we put a yolk on them, and they were to plow the ground.  
Okay?  
Imagine that they had a yolk on them, and they were taking that plow behind them.  
And you see, they're like, right?  
He on their heads.  
 Yes.  
So we call this an equal yuking.  
They are yoked equally.  
You see that?  
We call it an equal yuking.  
This is equal in the yuk.  
You get it now?  
Good.  
Now,  
 Let me find you.  


  
Relax.  
Come.  
I want to find a good match.  
I want to look for a good match.  


  
 I need a guy.  
I always look too tall.  
I don't want one that's very tall.  
But you're quite tall.  
OK.  
Well, imagine this.  
 This is certainly an unequal yoking.  
If you yoke the two of them together, the plow is going to be moving in one direction.  
You get it?  
She's going to be pulling him.  
I know you're powerful.  
 You get it?  
So that is an equal yukin.  
And this is an unequal yukin.  
So when the Bible says, don't be unequally yoked.  
Don't be on that the same yuk with one who is not a Christian.  
That's what is an unequal yukin.  
Thank you.  
God bless you.  
Thank you.  
God bless you.  
 So that's what that verse says.  
Back to verse 14, chapter 6, be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.  
For word fellowship had righteousness with unrighteousness.  
Look at that.  
He calls us righteousness.  
He calls the unbelievers unrighteousness.  
Look at the terms.  
 One day says, you are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  
He calls us righteousness and calls them on righteousness.  
Be not unequally yoked together, we don't believe us.  
For what fellowship had righteousness, we don't righteousness.  
And what communion had light with darkness?  
Jesus said, you are the light of the world.  
So the Christian is a light and the unbeliever is a darkness.  
 What communion hath light with darkness?  
Next verse.  
And what concord hath Christ?  
What beleal?  
Christ.  
The church is called Christ.  
The unbeliever, beleal.  
That's Satan.  
That's the devil.  
 Oh my goodness, Christ represents God.  
Pilah represents a devil.  
Look at that.  
Oh, what part had he that believed us with an infidel?  
Look at the next verse.  
And what agreement had the temple of God with idols?  
He calls the Christian the temple of God.  
 He calls the non-Christian idols.  
For ye are the temple of the living God.  


  
He didn't say you're going to be.  
You are.  
You are the temple of the living God.  
 Oh hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, glory hallelujah.  
This is amazing.  
You remember when God left ethnic temples, it was that day when Jesus was crucified.  
Why he was on that cross for three long hours?  
The Bible says there was darkness in the earth.  
 The rocks began to split, the earth began to quake, and the Bible tells us, God, His presence had been in the holy of holies, separated from the holy place with a thick curtain, 40 feet long, 20 feet high, four inches thick.  
And when Jesus said, it is finished,  
 When he said it, the Bible says that thick cut and four inches thick, 20 feet high, was caught from the top to the bottom.  
It was the hand of God, not the hand of man.  
It was caught from the top to the bottom.  
And the holy of holies was open, and God departed from that temple.  
 Hallelujah.  
And somebody ran to the priest and said, it's open, it's open, it's open.  
What's open?  
They said, the holy place is open.  
Symbolizing the holy place, the most holy place in the evidence, open to every one of us.  
Before now only the high priest go into the presence of God, but now it's open for everybody.  
It was taken from there to heaven.  
 when Jesus Christ came back in the power of the Holy Spirit's, the church was born, the human body became the living Tabernacle of Almighty God.  
Now He lives in us.  
You are the temple of the living God.  
 Every day I walk in this earth, I have the consciousness that I am the temple of the living God.  
No wonder I can never be defeated.  
No wonder I'm unshakeable.  
No wonder I'm a victor forever.  
Breter is he that is in he.  
Then he that is in the world.  
And the temple of the living God.  
 Hallelujah.  
I'm full of life.  
From the kind of my head to the souls of my feet.  
I'm the temper of the living God.  
How could cancer find a way in my body?  
How could diabetes make a home in my body?  
I'm the temper of the living God.  


  
 Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
No, I'm not gonna have heart trouble.  
No, my lungs do not have any problems.  
No, my kidneys are not gonna have any problems.  
I'm the temple of the living God.  
He lives in me.  
You see, we must carry that consciousness.  
Lift your hands and worship you.  
 Worship Him.  
Worship Him.  
Worship Him.  
We trust that you have been blessed by this message.  
If you would like to invite Jesus Christ to be the Lord of your life, kindly say this prayer, O Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ, Son of the living God,  
 I believe He died for me, and God raised Him from the dead.  
I believe He's alive today.  
I confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day.  
Through Him and in His name, I have eternal life.  
I'm born again.  
 Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul.  
I'm now a child of God.  
Hallelujah.  
Congratulations.  
You are now a child of God.
