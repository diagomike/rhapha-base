title: September 2021 - The Month of Visualization
---
 Book of Exodus chapter 7 and verse number 1.  
And the Lord said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.  
Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse number 15.  
See, I have said before thee this day, life and good.  
 and death in evil.  
Next verse.  
In that I commend thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his status and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply.  
And the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land with thou goest to possess it.  
 Guru Joshua chapter six from verse one.  
Now Jericho was strictly shut up because of the children of Israel.  
None went out and none came in.  
Verse two.  
And the Lord said unto Joshua, see, I have given into thine hand Jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor.  
Guru chapter eight, book of Joshua, verse one.  
 And the Lord said unto Joshua, fear not, neither be thou dismayed.  
Take all the people of war with thee and arise.  
Go up to eye.  
See, I have given into thy hand the king of eye and his people and his city and his land.  
Jeremiah chapter 1 verse number 10.  
See, I have these days set before thee.  
 or set thee over the nations.  
See, I have these days set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw down to build and to plant.  
Hallelujah.  
Now the word see  
 is translated from several Hebrew words.  
And they have different connotations.  
And in the days following, we'll be able to give you several details of these things.  
 But they particularly refer to visual images, visual images.  
And this is so important because even in the New Testament, he gives us several words.  
 to help us understand how he wants us to live, how he wants us to think.  
I want you to look at 2 Corinthians 5 and verse 17, and see what it says.  
Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.  
All things have passed away.  
Behold, all things have become new.  
It says, see, all things have become new.  
 The whole, all things are becoming new.  
And if you would look at 2 Corinthians chapter 4 and verse number 18, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.  
That means we look rather at the things which are not seen.  
 For the things which are seen at Temporal, but the things which are not seen are Eternal.  
Several Greek words also translated behold, see, look.  
And they also have similar thoughts.  
Similar thoughts in communicating visual images.  
 Let me read something to you from Isaiah chapter 33 and verse 20.  
Isaiah chapter 33 and verse 20.  
Look upon Zion, the city of our salinities, thy eyes shall see Jerusalem of quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down.  
 not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed.  
Neither shall any of the cards thereof be broken."  
It says, look upon Zion, the city of our salinities.  
Denies shall see Jerusalem.  
And here you have several words for look, see, and they are in the changeably used for look, see, behold, lo, etc.  
 In this case, he tells you to look with the eyes of a prophet, Khazah.  
All right.  
And in the Old Testament, you'd find more and more of the use of a term, rah-ah, to see, to see.  


  
 In Genesis chapter 15, when you read verse number 5, another word is introduced when God speaks to Abraham.  
By verses he brought him forth abroad and said, look now, look now toward heaven.  
The word is Nabat.  
And Nabat means to scan.  
You see, you're not just looking but you're scanning through because it's going to tell him to count.  
 So he's got to scan.  
He brought him for the broad and said, look now toward heaven and tell the stars that I'll be able to number them.  
And he said unto him, so shall thy seed be.  
That's remarkable, remarkable, remarkable.  
And then something quite interesting in the book of Revelation,  
 you'd see the use of a term.  
First, when you say, behold, in second Corinthians chapter 5 or 17, where we read, there's a more common word that is used there.  
You do.  
What you do is middle voice of idol or idol.  
 which is often used in the book of Revelation when John says, and I beheld.  
Like he says, one of the beasts, one of those awe-inspiring creatures said to me, come and see.  
Let's read something like in Revelation chapter 6, look at verse number 5.  
And when he had opened the thought seal, I heard the thought be say, come and see, and I beheld.  
 You see, I beheld, a lower black horse, and it had sat on him, had a pair of balances in his hand.  
I beheld.  
What was he seeing?  
He was seeing visions.  
He was seeing visual images.  
See, so in all of these various shades and applications of terms in the Hebrew or in the Greek,  
 It's about visual images, visual images, and lots and lots of times God wanted his people to look and see.  
Look and see.  
Look and see.  
Why is this important?  
You know, if you listen a lot, if you listen a lot to negative things, fear will come to your heart.  
 And you believe them.  
You believe them.  
You've got to be careful.  
I want to explain just a couple of things to you for this month.  
Now, this month of September is the month of visualization.  
Visualization.  
God wants us to use our visual powers.  
 He wants us to use them.  
He wants us to use them.  
He wants us to use them.  
And you're going to use yours.  
This is important.  
Now, visualization is the design of your life and circumstances.  
 You see, you use visualization for designing your life and circumstances.  
He says, see, I have given you Jericho.  
See, visualize Jericho is yours.  
See, I have given you Jericho is his.  
See, see, I have given you the land.  
See, see, I've met your God to Pharaoh.  
That's what he said.  
 I've given you power of other nations, C. He says, C. Now Satan doesn't want you to see that.  
He would rather have you see something else.  
He would want you to see everything else from his perspective so that you can create what he wants.  
Because he knows you are a creator.  
You were made in the image of God.  
You were made in the likeness of God.  
That means you have the ability to function like God.  
Satan can't create nothing.  
 so he has to use you to create in the world what he wants by giving you the images that he wants you to see and helping you make making you establish them create them for him don't do it don't give him what he wants don't give him what he wants so visualization is  
 for designing your life and circumstances.  
And you construct your life and circumstances with thoughts and words.  
Hear me again, hear me again.  
When he says to visualize, I'm going to give you an example here.  
In Revelation chapter 6 verse 5, just as an example,  
 Let's look at it again.  
And when he had opened the thought seal, I heard the thought be say, come and see.  
Come and see, blepho, blepho means to use your optical eyes to look at something.  
So he turns your attention, he says, turn and look at this.  
So he says, come and see.  
And then, you see, he can't help you.  
 He can only call your attention that you should focus your eyes, the point is to focus your eyes to something and look.  
But then he says, and I behered.  
He uses idol or idol.  
You see, he says, and I behered.  
So he didn't just look with his optical eyes.  
He had an understanding.  
 He had an understanding.  
He conceded.  
He perceived there was a perception to his sight.  
So he didn't say blepho or blepho.  
He uses ido.  
I beheld.  
I beheld.  
I beheld.  
I beheld.  
So the  


  
 You're going to intentionally, intentionally use visualization.  
Intentionally, you choose to do it.  
This means you intentionally keep your attention away from those things that work against your construction.  
You see, you're constructing your life and your circumstances.  
 And God says, he uses your visual powers.  
He uses your visual powers.  
He said to Abraham, I'm going to make your seeds so many, but I need your help.  
What's that?  
I've got to get you to look.  
You look, look at the stars.  
Look, he says, scan, scan.  
Look, that means  
 This is an intense way of looking in such a way that you see details.  
That's why you use the word nebat.  
So that you can see like you're going to count.  
I'm seeing the details.  
Why he's going to give him seed and seed cannot be generalized.  
Seed refers to individual persons.  
These are children.  
Abraham has to see this vision.  
 God wants you to use your visual powers.  
See, when we pray, we don't just talk.  
We use the power of visualization.  
We see the peace in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
We see that the demons are fleeing from us, in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
We said they are fleeing and they are fleeing in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
 The Lord has given us authority and power and we are exercising it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
So remember, remember,  
 This means that you intentionally keep your attention away from those things that work against your construction.  
And you enrich your mind and spirit with the materials for building your life by faith.  
Remember, faith is substance.  
Don't forget, faith is substance.  
That means faith is a spiritual material.  
It says, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not sinned.  
 Faith is substance.  
It's a substance of things hoped for.  
So you're going to use your faith and reach your mind and your spirit with materials for building your life and your circumstances, bad faith.  
What circumstances do you want to live in?  
What do you want your life to be every day?  
 Some people live in circumstances of sickness and disease and infirmity.  
They are hardly ever well.  
They're often sickly and sickly.  
The people who live in crisis all their life long, from one crisis to another, from one crisis to another, things are hardly okay with them.  
Why?  
They created those things without ever knowing.  
 But the good news is, you can remake your life.  
You can recreate your circumstances.  
You can, and you better do it.  
You've got no choice.  
It's the right thing to do.  
Say, you can allow Satan to run your life.  
So this month, you're going to use your power of visualization.  
It is the amount of visualization.  
You're going to use your visual powers  
 You're gonna use them and create the circumstances, the life and circumstances that you want.  
Hallelujah.  
And we use it not only for our zeros, we use it for our families, we use it for our communities, we use it for our cities, we use it for our nations.  
We have to.  
We have to.  
 And when we see that picture, everything that is against it, we cast it down.  
The Bible says, casting down imaginations.  
Casting down imaginations.  
We are able to cast down imaginations, all those wrong imaginations that come to us.  
We cast them down in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Every time the wrong thought comes to you, you rebuke it in the name of Jesus, and you set your mind on course.  
 The picture of what you want is what you put in your mind.  
Let no man deceive you.  
Don't let them deceive you with their posts.  
All their negative posts of fear.  
Don't let them deceive you.  
Through the news media.  
Don't let them deceive you.  
 And every time they publish something that is inconsistent with your declaration in the things of God, you nullify what they're saying in the name of Jesus.  
And you prophesy with what you have in the name of Jesus, what you have believed God for what you have prayed for what you have declared by faith.  
You insist that that is what is real.  
That we should bring before you.  
 has no power, has no life.  
Hallelujah.  
Remember, we have not followed Connolly device favors.  
No, we haven't.  
We have followed the truth of God, and we can only win.  
 We can only win.  
We'll live in His love.  
We'll live in His grace.  
We'll live by His power.  
We'll live through the Spirit of God and in the mighty and matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Hallelujah.  
What a September we're going to have.  
What a September we're going to have.  
Glory to God.  
 Go ahead and pray.  
Pray everywhere.  
Open your mouth and pray.  
It's a amount of visualization.  
What we see is what we get.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
So ready, Lord Jesus.  
So ready, Lord Jesus.  


  
 Let's set it up, here I'm about to call back even the happiness.
