title: 3 Kinds of Wisdom Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Mabel is yours.  


  
 Father in the name of the Lord Jesus, we thank you for another blessed opportunity to worship you, to honor you, to learn your word, to have fellowship with the Holy Spirit, and with one another.  
Our hearts and our minds are open now.  
 to hear your word gladly and the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Amen.  
You may be seated.  
Hallelujah.  
Raise the Lord.  
When you study the scriptures, particularly in the  
 In the New Testament, you would observe a clear distinction between different kinds of wisdom.  
Now, this time, what I mean by that is a little different from the subject that I'm teaching on.  
 First, the Bible classifies wisdom for us in three major different ways.  
Let us know that you have what's known as the wisdom of this world.  
Okay?  
There is the wisdom of this world.  
 I'd like you to turn into the book of James.  
Let's look at that kind of wisdom.  
Now before I read to you, James, maybe James would be very conclusive.  
First Corinthians.  
Turn to First Corinthians chapter number one.  
Beginning with verse 20.  


  
Are you there?  
 Where is the wise?  
Can you see that?  
Okay, read it to me.  
I want to go.  


  
Did you see that?  
Where is the wise?  
Where is the scribe?  
Where is the dispute  
 of this world.  


  
And then he says, had not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?  
So there is the wisdom of this world.  
And the Bible says, had not God made it foolish?  
That's a good question.  
He's actually speaking in the affirmative.  
 You see, all right.  
Verse 21, for after that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God.  
It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.  
You know, a lot of people ask, why do you preach?  
Most you preach, why don't you just let people believe on their own?  
Let nobody can believe on his own, except somebody tells him.  
 Somebody's got to preach to you.  
So the Bible says that God designed to use what is known as the foolishness of preaching.  
Sometimes you would think, we're foolish for preaching.  
Look at it.  
Look at verse 21.  
I want you to observe it yourself.  
He says, for after that in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God.  
You see that?  
 the world in its worldly wisdom could not recognize God.  
But God created the world in his own wisdom.  
Now he says, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.  
God is pleased to use the foolishness of preaching to save those that believe.  
Hallelujah.  
 Oh, I could explain much more in that arena, but I want us to go on.  
So, another verse.  
I'd like you to turn to 1st Corinthians chapter number 2.  
And this time we're looking at verse 6.  
How bet?  
 We speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world that come to not.  
This is not the wisdom of this world.  
So the Bible is very clear about the wisdom of this world.  
It says we speak wisdom among them that are perfect.  
Another word is material, spiritually material.  
He says, but not the wisdom of this world.  
 What is the wisdom of this one?  
Let's read again from 1 Corinthians chapter number 3.  
This time verse 19.  
Are you there?  
I want you to read it for me.  
Want to go.  


  
 Did you see that?  
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  
Look at verse 18, very instructive.  
He says, let no man deceive himself.  
If any man among you seem it to be wise in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wise.  
What is meant by the wisdom of this world?  
 The wisdom of this word is the scheming in this word.  
It is the way the word has designed things, the system of the word.  
How things are wrong in the word, the shape of things in the word, the methods, the modus operandi in the word.  
That's what he's talking about.  
 He says, the wisdom of this world is foolishness.  
It is foolishness in the sight of God.  
The system of this world is foolishness in the sight of God.  
Man's design of becoming successful.  
 Man's methods are becoming happy and prosperous and fulfilled.  
He says it's foolishness.  
God sees it as foolishness.  
Now that's very important.  
I want now go to Book of James chapter number three.  
 Hallelujah.  
I said, we're talking about three kinds of wisdom, but we're looking first at these different kinds of wisdom.  
The one that is of this world, what is it like?  
Booker James chapter number three.  
I'll read to you from verse 14.  
Have you found it?  


  
 But if we have bitter end in, and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.  
This wisdom, this wisdom that has envy with it, this wisdom that's bitter, I hear this.  
This wisdom, this is if we have bitter end in, and strife in your hearts, glory not, don't rejoice, don't be glad.  
 And don't lie against the truth, he says.  
This wisdom descended not from above, but is earthly, sensual and devilish.  
So the wisdom of this world is athlete.  
So, athlete wisdom is the wisdom of this world.  
If it's athlete, it's of this world.  
 So it tells us that wisdom is ethnic.  
It's got a lot of strife in it.  
It's got bitter envy in it, embedded in it.  
Now look at the wars all over the world.  
Look at the stripes all over the world.  
Look at the problems.  
The more we want peace, the more trouble we get.  


  
Actually wisdom.  
 We sign agreements and break them.  


  
We make good decisions, seemingly good decisions.  
And I'm following through, ethly wisdom.  
And what does it say about that ethly wisdom?  
 They say, it's what?  
It is sensual.  
That means it is of the senses.  
It is of the senses.  
That's another way of sense of the flesh.  
The word flesh refers to the senses.  
It is sensual and devilish, devilish, meaning the wisdom of this world has got satan at the head of it.  
Have you ever operated in the wisdom of this woman?  
 Hallelujah.  
Let me give you an idea, how simple it is, because sometimes we don't realize how much we are functioning in the wisdom of this world.  
The wisdom of this world says, when you save and save and save and hard and hard and hard, you become rich.  
God says, when you give, you receive.  
 It is bless them that curse you.  
The wisdom of this world will not accept that.  
Bless them that curse you.  
Pray for those who despitefully use you.  


  
Is that acceptable to us?  
Well, for this world it's not acceptable.  
But God says,  
 That's another life.  
Think about it.  
He said, you lay your hands on the sick, they recover.  
Well, the wisdom of this world says, you better be careful.  
You touch that sick person, you may have the sickness.  


  
A lot of times, what the wisdom of this world tells us to do, God saves us wrong.  
 It's the other way.  


  
Who come up to the wisdom of God in a moment?  
Praise God.  
But I'm excited just to think of the fact that God has so clearly for us distinguished between what He's got for us and what the world has.  
Alleluia.  
Okay.  
 Haven't you thought about it?  
Why is it that most professors are not rich?  
Because wisdom is not in the classroom.  
No school can give you wisdom.  
The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  
Hallelujah.  
But how come we are?  
Why don't we ever think differently?  


  
 Hallelujah.  
All right, so he tells us that that wisdom, the earthly wisdom is sensual and devilish.  
It's of the senses and it's devilish.  
 Okay, let's look at another kind of wisdom.  
So we've observed the wisdom of this world.  
It's called worldly wisdom, it's called earthly wisdom.  
There's another one, the wisdom of men.  
Now that's different from the wisdom of this world.  
So what's the difference?  
Well, many times you have to understand that  
 Like the Bible says, the God of this world, Satan, had blinded the minds of those who believe not.  
There is a system, and then there are men.  
It's not everything that you do, which is wrong, that's motivated by Satan, because you're a free moral agent.  
You have your own will.  
 So the Bible talks about the wisdom of men.  
This has to do with their reasoning, the way they reason, the decisions they make, their choices, the wisdom of men.  
And I wonder how many people operate in the wisdom of men.  
 Of course, most people do.  
You see, the wisdom of this world controls us as ordinary human beings.  
So we function within the ambience of the wisdom of this world.  
Then you got the wisdom of men, my own wisdom, with which I function within the context of worldly wisdom.  
 So I operate within worldly wisdom, with my own wisdom.  
So I'm in flames by my environment, with this worldly wisdom.  
So I have created my kind of wisdom, my own type of wisdom, which is the wisdom of men.  
And the other man has his wisdom also, and that one has his wisdom.  
And we are functioning in the wisdom of men.  
So what does the Bible say?  
Come on, look at it now.  
 So you're right now, that's number two, the wisdom of man.  
Okay, we're looking at 1st Corinthians chapter one and verse 17.  
For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words.  
 Have you observed that?  
It says wisdom of words.  
Now, this has to do with the wisdom of men.  
They express themselves in words.  
Men express their wisdom in words and in actions.  
So this is the wisdom of men, but let's go on.  
Look at 1 Corinthians chapter 2.  
I'm going to be reading to you from verse 4.  
 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom.  
Okay, you get it now.  
Words of man's wisdom.  
You see, man's wisdom is expressed in words.  
Okay?  
So he says, my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit of power.  
That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men.  
 but in the power of God, hallelujah.  
So you can see the wisdom of men here, expressing words.  
So he says, but when I preached the gospel to you, I didn't preach it in the wisdom of men, not in words of men's wisdom, words of men's wisdom.  
 A lot of times you listen to some theologians and they are expressing their wisdom about God.  
There's a lot of things in their own wisdom about God.  


  
They have reasoned out what God should be like.  
They have in their imagination what God should say, what God's decision should be.  
 They've created their ideas in their own minds about the personality and character of God.  
It's amazing.  
But that's man's wisdom.  
Man's wisdom.  
But the gospel is not in man's wisdom.  
It's not in your reasoning.  
Oh, no, it's not.  
 You know, somebody's, you can think it out and say, well, if I, I want God to be pleased with me.  
So here's what I'm going to do.  
I'm going to behave well, do all the rights things, and try to be better than God will accept me.  
That is the wisdom of men.  
I'll try my best to be good.  
 I'll try my best, I'll try my best, my best, to be good enough.  
And then God can take over from wherever I fail.  
Somebody said, if my good outweighs my bad, God should accept me after he knows I've tried.  
 That's not the way God is.  
That sounds nice for man's wisdom.  
That's man's wisdom.  
It sounds nice.  
And when you express yourself like that to ordinary man, they say, yeah, that's good.  
You have some people that say, I'm a nice guy.  
I don't smoke.  
I don't drink.  
I don't follow women.  
 I don't cheat.  
I don't do anything.  
I don't have anybody.  
I'm a good man.  
I don't know why God would be hungry with somebody like me.  


  
You see, that's human wisdom, the wisdom of men.  
It sounds nice.  
 The man looks good.  
Look at Samuel the prophet.  
He arrived at Jesse's house.  
God had sent him to anoint one of the sons of Jesse.  
He saw the first son of Jesse, a layer by name.  
And he said, wow, you know, the guy was huge, tall.  
They looked like a soldier.  
And Samuel said, wow, the Lord's anointed is right before him.  
And he wanted to anoint him.  
And God said, don't do it.  
Why?  
 He said, God doesn't see the way men see.  
He said, man, look at the outward appearance.  
But God looked at the heart.  
 God sees the heart.  
Men look at the outward appearance.  
And that's the way we make our decisions.  
Because we don't have anything beyond the senses.  
It looks nice.  
It looks like gold.  
Oh, it's shining.  
Like somebody has said, all that glitters is not gold.  
But that's what we hear, even though we don't act it.  
It looks nice.  
So we wear the two and we throw it up and say, this is heavier than this.  
I'll take this one.  
 It's like lots choosing the valley looking green and moved to the land of Sodom.  
But the Bible says God was angry with the people of Sodom.  
And he didn't know it.  
And you know the story, it lost everything.  
Hallelujah.  
Have you ever thought about wanting God to help you make a decision?  
 Here you are, trying to get into a particular company.  
You must work there.  
Oh God, I must get a job there.  
I must get a job there.  
You don't know God is planning to close it up.  
I'll get a job there.  
You're faster than praying.  
Until you get a job there two weeks later, it's gone.  
The wisdom of men.  
Hallelujah.  
All right, look at...  
 Verse 13, same chapter 2, verse 13.  


  
 Let's read from verse 12, it would be better.  
We'll read it 12 into 13.  
Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit reaches of God, and we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.  
The things that are freely given to us of God, which things also we speak.  
He says we speak the things that are freely given to us of God.  
He says which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the holy goes teaches.  
Comparing spiritual things and spiritual.  
See, when we speak,  
 He says, we speak the things that God has given to us freely, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches.  
Man's wisdom teaches you that when you've got pain in your stomach, you say, I have stomach pain.  
But we do not talk about the stomach and it's pain with the words which man's wisdom teaches.  
Oh, if you could get ahold of this.  
Hallelujah.  
 Do you understand what I'm talking about?  
This is so important.  
We don't say, I was scared, I'm scared.  
As I saw it, I was so scared.  
You see, men, grown men, with children, say scary, scary.  
Scary.  
I don't know why they love the language.  
 I'm afraid I may not be there tomorrow.  
I'm afraid.  
What?  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
Are you coming?  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
I'm afraid.  
 But it tells us not to use the words which man's wisdom teach it, but which the holy does teach it.  
He says comparing spiritual things to spiritual.  
But we communicate wrongly.  
For two weeks now, you know, I cut the flu.  
You cut the flu.  
You should have let it go.  
Now you wonder why you have the flu.  
You cut it.  
 I have headaches.  
Why should it go?  
You're praying to God to take something away from you which you have claimed.  
I have headaches.  
And the Bible says a man can receive nothing except it's given to him from above.  
How did you have your headaches?  
I have headaches.  
I have.  
Most you have it.  
Can't you say I feel headaches?  
 You feel it, yeah?  
And that doesn't change anything.  
But when you say I have headaches, you've let possession.  
You ought to say I have my healing.  
Hallelujah.  
I feel headaches, but I have my healing.  
Glory to God.  
Not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghost teaches.  
Change your talk.  
 You still there?  
Oh, glory to God.  
Man's wisdom.  
Man's wisdom is a failure.  
Romans chapter 16.  
I'm reading to you verse  
 18, for they that have sought, served not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly.  
And by good words and fast speeches, deceive the hearts of the simple.  
Deceive the hearts, he says good words and fast speeches.  
Deceive the spirits, the hearts of the simple.  
I want you to understand what he's talking about here.  
You see, there's a difference between your mind and your heart.  
Your heart is the core of your nature.  
 That's the inward man.  
And when your heart is deceived, it means that you have a different lifestyle.  
Oh, I'll come to that.  
It says good words and fair speeches.  
Deceive the hearts of the simple.  
Talking about certain group of people who use good words and fair speeches.  
Religious folks do.  
Religious folks.  
 You know?  
And they are more outspoken than those who actually know the truth.  
That's the trouble.  
Most of the Christian books, Christian books that have been written were written by men of the senses.  
Who knew nothing about the Holy Ghost?  
It's hard.  
There are not many Christian books available.  
You know, a lot of Christians want to read books, but most of the books they buy are wrong ones.  
Written by men of the senses.  
 great scholastic minds.  
The powerful, but they're empty.  
Empty.  
Empty biblical exegesis.  
Empty.  
All wrong.  
Terrible.  
And it says,  
 Such means serve not our Lord Jesus Christ but their own belly, in that they use good words and fair speeches and deceive the spirits, the hearts of the simple  
 And that's what Paul said when I came to preach.  
He says, my speech and my preaching was not with excellency of speech.  
This is a preach to you, not with words of man's wisdom.  
 But in demonstration of the spirit and of power, the demonstration of the spirit and of power, that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men.  
Hallelujah.  
In the play of words by men.  
He says, I want your faith to stand in the power of God.  
You know, why do you think that many religious people today, a lot of ministers do?  
They say,  
 There are no genuine miracles today.  
Miracles are not important.  
Do you know why?  
Because they don't have them.  
They have to get you to believe that miracles are not real.  
Yes, they quote Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever.  
What's the meaning of that?  
Now, what he did back then he can do today.  
What he was then, he still is.  
I am the Lord.  
I change not.  
Therefore, his sons of Jacob are not consumed.  
What does that mean?  
That God is the same.  
 He said, I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  
Not I was.  
I am.  
He hasn't changed.  
And they tell us, no more genuine miracles.  
Miracles are no longer necessary.  
Some of them are very smart.  
They say, you know what?  
Miracles were needed before the Bible came to be.  
Now that the Bible is complete, we don't need miracles anymore.  
Uh-oh.  
What does the Bible mean?  
 when he says that the wet and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, confirming the word which signs following.  
If he confirmed their word then, he needs to confirm it today, even more today.  
Because we didn't walk where Jesus was in the streets, they did.  
 That went in and out resume.  
The edge resume.  
But we came 2000 years later.  
We've got to have proof.  


  
Oh, they believe God answers prayer.  
That when he answers, they say, mm-mm, that was too fast.  
So that cannot be good.  
Why?  
How can somebody that was born blind just start seeing, just like that?  
Just like that, it can't be real.  
 How can somebody, how someone brought in this stretcher just get up and start running?  
Ah, that's not possible.  
It's not possible, but you believe in prayer, don't you?  
Yes, then you say, Father, we thy precious children, I come before you again, lie.  


  
It's not hard to know the truth.  
 Truth is simple.  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
That's the wisdom of men.  
The wisdom of men.  
Colossians chapter number two.  
Read verse four, one to go.  
Did you see that?  
 These eyes say, lest any man should begal you with entice in words.  
There are entice in words.  
And those entice in words are empty.  
They're empty.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Second Corinthians.  
Just letting you understand what we're dealing with here.  
Second Corinthians.  
 I want you to look at chapter number one, this time we are reading verse 12, want to go.  
Not with what?  
Flashly wisdom, because it's fleshly wisdom, the wisdom of the senses.  
Flashly wisdom.  
We're talking about the wisdom of men, right?  
 He calls it, he gives it another name now, fleshly wisdom.  
Praise God.  
Fleshly wisdom.  
Men who are in the flesh, and the Bible says they that are in the flesh cannot please God.  
But they're in the flesh.  
And isn't that amazing how the men of the flesh always want to tell men of the spirit what to do?  
It's amazing.  
 Men of the flesh are very outspoken.  
They can't keep quiet.  
It's not easy for them to, they can easily learn, fleshly mind that people can't sit down and learn.  
All the time they want to, they want to tell you what to do.  
They've got the answer.  
They have it all figured out.  


  
But be wise and look at their lives and see.  
 When you receive advice from somebody, find out who's talking to you.  
Who is this guy?  
Hallelujah.  
Then, of course, the third one.  
The wisdom of God.  
Amen.  
First Corinthians chapter number two.  
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  
 Hey, glory to God.  
I love this.  
Are you there?  
Read verse 7 for me, you want to go.  
You see, this wisdom we've been talking about is Sophia.  
 Whether it is the Sophia of this world, or the Sophia of men, or the Sophia of God.  
Do you understand?  
But we are talking about the Sophia of God now, the wisdom of God.  
Look at the way he talks about it here in verse seven.  
He says, but we speak the wisdom of God.  
Notice he didn't say we talk about the wisdom.  
He says, we speak the wisdom of God.  
We speak wisdom.  
 We speak wisdom.  
Have you ever spoken wisdom?  
Do you know what it is to speak wisdom?  
He didn't say, I speak by wisdom.  
He said, I speak wisdom.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Wonderful.  
He says, we speak the wisdom of God in esoteric language.  
Look at it there.  
He says, in a mystery.  
That's esoteric communication.  
 Wow, we speak, verse seven, but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery.  
Even the hidden wisdom, you see, it's not for everybody.  
I said, it's not for everybody.  
The wisdom of God is not for everybody.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery.  
Even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world.  
 He ordained it.  
He planned it.  
He said it aside before the foundation of the world and he planned it for our glory.  
Look at it.  
He says for our honor.  
He planned that wisdom for us.  
 Leecu hasto prahasti.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
So that's what I'm talking about, three kinds of wisdom.  
And I said, number one is Sofia, but not just Sofia, but Sofia of God, the wisdom of God.  
Sofia wisdom means insight into reality.  
 It means seeing into the real truths of things, seeing with the mind and the eyes of God, understanding it from God's perspective.  
Hallelujah.  
And that wisdom is the wisdom that made this world.  
That is creative wisdom.  
It's insight into reality.  
You know the real truth.  
Praise God.  
That's the wisdom of God.  
 It's called Sophia, okay?  
Are you there?  
All right, now, here's something very, very important.  
He says, but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the foundation of the world.  
He ordained it for our glory.  
He planned it.  
 for our glory, not for our defeats, but for our glory.  
Hallelujah, not for our dishonor, but for our honor.  
Do you understand what he's talking about?  
For our promotion, glory to God.  
Oh, thank you Lord Jesus.  
He ordained it for our glory.  
Look at verse eight, he says, which none of the princes of this world, oh my goodness.  
Which none of the princes of this world knew.  
 He says, this wisdom of God, this Sophia of God, the princes of this world, the great men of this world.  
Are you understanding this, the professors of this world?  
He said, which none of the, none none of the princes of this world knew.  
 They didn't know it.  
Why?  
He chooses the word Ginozco.  
There.  
He said they had no Ginozco, which means that that kind of wisdom, you receive it by Ginozco.  
Revelation knowledge.  
Revelation knowledge.  
 which none of the princes of this world knew.  
Look at it, I like it.  
This is which none of the princes of this world knew, for had they gynoschodits, they would not have crucified the Lord of Gory.  
If they had known it, if they had known that wisdom, ayah, ayah, if they had known that man of Galilee, when his chapter on planet earth, if they had known.  
 He said the wood not have crucified the Lord of Glory.  
I didn't know him.  
The Bible says he was in the world.  
The world was made by him.  
The world knew him not.  
He came onto his own.  
His own received him not.  


  
He says the world was made by him.  
 The world was made by him.  
The world knew him not.  
Who was he?  
The word.  
He was the Word of God.  
The Prophet spoke him.  
The world knew him not.  
He came onto his own.  
His own received him not.  
Then it is but as many as received him.  
 not as many as heard about Him.  
As many as received Him.  
Have you received Him?  
He says, as many as many, whosoever, as many, rich or poor, great or small, as many as received Him.  
To them, He gave the authority, the ability, the power to become the sounds of God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
 Oh, glory to His name forever.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory.  
Which none of the princes of this world knew.  
They didn't know this kind of wisdom.  
Oh, the wisdom of God.  
Ay, ay, ay.  
The wisdom of God.  
As if Sophia is the first one.  
That's the first one you receive.  
 When you receive Christ into your heart, Christ becomes your Sophia.  
He becomes your wisdom.  
Amen.  
I want us to just talk to the Lord.  
Thank Him for His word.  
Thank Him for His kindness.  


  
Glory.  
 Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Holy Spirit.  
Praise God.  
The wisdom of this world.  
And then there's... I refuse to function in the wisdom of this world.  
I refuse to lead by the wisdom of men.  
I choose.  
 to function in the wisdom of God.  
Amen, praise God.  
Hallelujah.
