title: 3 Kinds of Wisdom Part 1
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, we thank you for your love and your grace and your kindness.  
We thank you for your presence with us tonight.  
We thank you for the Holy Spirit, our teacher, and our guide, our instructor, the one whom you send to enlighten us in the ways of your spirit, the life of the kingdom,  
 Thank you for your presence here tonight.  
And now again our hearts and our minds are open to be taught to receive your word godly with faith and weakness in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Amen.  
Praise God.  
You may be seated.  
Hallelujah.  
Did you have a beautiful day?  
 John Wesley said the best of all is God with us.  
Is that right?  
I'd like you to greet three people and say you are in for God's supernatural intervention in your life.  


  
 Praise the Lord.  
Hallelujah.  
Are you in for it?  


  
Yes.  
Hallelujah.  
I am in for God's supernatural intervention in my life.  
 raise God.  
You believe that?  
We were studying three kinds of knowledge and it was important for us to learn that and understand because  
 It's not every kind of knowledge that gives the result that one may be expecting.  
We talked about the knowledge  
 that makes us masters.  
Because it's a special kind of knowledge for that.  
The knowledge attics us to the high realms of the supernatural.  
I want to begin tonight to share on another subject that is just as important.  
 Why is it that so many people are failures in the world?  
Why is it that only very few?  
It is said that only three percent of all that  
 have attended the universities become successful three percent and out of the three percent only three percent of that three percent become rich  


  
 Very few of that 3% of the 3% become wealthy.  
Are you still there?  
But money is not all there is about it.  
We're looking at prosperity also in all other areas of life.  
Things working out for you  
 turning out beautifully.  
Why is it that too many people all over the world leave unfulfilled lives?  
Things just don't work out for them.  
And there are a lot of people who don't even expect anything to work out, they're not expecting anything.  
They don't know they could be anything.  
They don't know they could have anything.  
 Let's look at the nation here, for example.  
How many people are running for president?  
How many intend running for president?  
Why are you not running?  
You don't even think about it.  
You see, very few people believe they're cool.  
 Let's assume many of them are gambling, but why is it that only so few of them can even dare to gamble?  
The majority of the people don't think it could be them.  
How many of you are running for government ships?  
 You see, the attitude of a lot of people is, as soon as they come out of school, they're looking for a job.  
It just doesn't cross their minds that it could be anything.  
And the parents are the most guilty because they help the children to choose causes that will help them get a job quick.  
You see, they program their children for failure from the beginning.  
 You see, you have to, while they're trying to choose a course for their job, they say, you see, this course, you can easily get a job.  
How can you go and study zoology?  
Look for, they say, they say, look, they want to help them choose a course, but they can quickly get a job.  
They program children from the very beginning for failure.  
Why?  
 Why?  
Hallelujah.  
See, you can have a big dream.  
Even when you are employed in an organization, work and be productive in such a way that the whole organization can depend on you.  
Let them count on you.  
 Count on your excellence.  
Let them count on you.  
Become so good at what you do that they can't do without you.  
You understand?  
That they can't do without you.  
I don't mean by seizing the keys whenever you go out so nobody else can do anything until you come back.  
That's nonsense.  
I'm talking about your abilities.  
That you rely on your mind.  
Are you still there?  
 So I want to begin tonight to share on three kinds.  
There goes again, three kinds.  
Yeah, there are always three kinds.  
Well, I like to pick up the three kinds.  
So I can explain to you, you know, we've got Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.  
And then man is spirit, soul, and body.  
There's a lot of teaching on threes.  
So even though there are so many kinds, I like to pick  
 three of them.  
So this time, three kinds of wisdom.  
Yes.  
And during the course of our study, we will have time to look at what the Bible calls the wisdom of man, the wisdom of this world.  
Okay?  
Those ones.  
But I want to look at three kinds of wisdom  
 That pertains to us because in the teachings of the scripture you would find references for wisdom that is not from God.  
Someone is intelligent but in the wrong direction.  
He's smart but he uses it to be a thief.  
You understand?  
A very smart thief and God doesn't like that.  
 So, we're looking at three kinds of wisdom.  
And then we'll see how we can apply these things in our lives.  
The reason for failure in life is the lack of wisdom.  
You see that?  
 The reason why most men never attain to a great deal of success.  
The reason why.  
They never come up to what God really wants for them.  
Let's look at God's idea.  
He spoke to Abraham and said, I want to make you great.  
 Abraham didn't say, oh God, please, I'd like to be great.  
No, he didn't ask for it.  
But God said, I want to make you great, which means whether or not you intended it, this is God's dream.  
He said, I want to make you great and I want to make you a blessing.  
You see that?  
So God wants you to be a blessing.  
God wants the whole world to benefit  
 from your coming, the fact that you were born.  
Just imagine if Thomas Edison hadn't done anything about incandescent light, who knows what darkness would have been.  
But because he worked on it, it's been developed to what we have today.  
 Think about the right brothers, and what did he?  
I just wonder if flying would have been possible today.  
Somebody had to think.  
When you are born again, you become the seed of Abraham, whom God said, I will make you great.  
And God said,  
 Your seed is through your seed.  
The nations of the world will be blessed.  
And the Bible says that we are the seed of Abraham.  
So it's our inheritance.  
It's our calling to be a blessing to this world.  
 It's our calling to effect changes, positive changes.  
You are in this world as an agent of change, positive change.  
And you see, if you never hear about it, if you never get to know, you may never become.  
You have to hear about it.  
You have to know what your calling is.  
 what the Lord expects of you.  
And once you know it, the next thing is to begin to apply it.  
Hallelujah.  
So at every stage of your life, you can be a success.  
Success is not measured at the end of your life.  
Success is measured at different stages of your life.  
 You can tell whether your success today, now, are your success right now.  
You can tell, you can look at your life and tell whether or not your success.  
I started teaching on success as a student in a school, in the university.  
And before I went into the university, I was teaching, I had leadership training programs.  
I was teaching on leadership.  
 Maybe one of these days I'll get some of those notes and read some of them out to you.  
It just didn't cross my mind that I had to become an old man first to know what success was.  
Solomon was a young man when God made him a success.  
Are you still there?  
 Yeah.  
Success is measured at different stages of your life, different points of your life.  
And you know, God's dream is for you to heap success upon success.  
Success upon success.  
If you're successful now, He can count on you for another level of success.  
Remember what He said.  
He said, I am the vine, ye are the branches.  
 He said, every branch in me that produces fruit is as my father will print it so it can produce more fruit.  
You see, if you're productive, the Lord would work on you so he can become even more productive.  
Then he said, you become my disciples.  
 when you produce much fruit.  
So when you get to the level of much, this is now you're really following me.  
You see, I told you about the lambs and the sheep.  
The lambs don't follow the shepherd.  
They follow the sheep.  
So when you are productive, when you become productive, producing much,  
 And he said, then, you are my disciples.  
So there are different stages of discipleship.  
Hallelujah.  
So you can be very, very successful.  
And you see, you become successful conscious.  
If you're successful today, you become successful conscious.  
It means tomorrow you're going to be successful again.  
 Some people have failures and they keep failing too many times in their lives.  
You're a failure when your boss cannot depend on you.  
You're a failure.  
Your failure when a project is committed into your hands and it fails.  
You're a failure.  
You understand?  
You have failed when those around you can find that you are dispensable and they can do better.  
 in your absence.  
You have failed.  
When a project is committed into your hands and you come up with excuses, there are people who are always making excuses at work.  
There's a reason they couldn't do it.  
There's a reason they couldn't do this.  
Oh, my boss is against me.  
Oh, the head of our unit doesn't like me.  
Oh, the branch manager doesn't like me.  
That's why they give excuses and excuses and excuses.  
 Only failures make excuses.  
If you're a success, you don't make excuses.  
You produce results.  
You win.  
And there is an attitude for success.  
That attitude is an attitude of victory.  
You just can't be beaten down.  
Sadness is not a part of your life.  
 You learn, you train yourself.  
You train yourself to be excited every day.  
Happy.  
Happy.  
Ready to confront life's crisis.  
Ready to solve problems.  
Ready to answer questions because that's what you were born for.  
Answering questions, solving problems, being a blessing, hallelujah.  
What a life.  
 But then the ingredient of it is wisdom.  
Praise God.  
So thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Wisdom.  
So can we now turn into collosions?  
Book of collosions.  
I want you to look first from chapter one.  
 Or maybe before I take you there, go to chapter two, let's speak two things here.  
Hallelujah.  
My own mind.  


  
 I would read from verse 1 chapter 2 for I would that she knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at Lord they see you and for as many as I have not seen my face in the flesh.  
And that word sometimes is pronounced Lordesia by some, okay?  
Verse 2, that their hearts might become folded, mean it together in love.  
 And under all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ.  
Now that verse sounds big, but we'll break it, okay?  
Now look at verse three.  
The last word in verse two is what?  
Give it to me, come on.  
What's the last word in verse two?  
 Okay, verse three, in home, Christ in home, ah, heed, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  
 Christ in whom I hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
I feel like tearing everything.  
Did you notice he didn't say  
 He didn't say, Jesus in whom I heed all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
Did you notice that?  
He says, Christ.  
He says, the Father and then Christ.  
Christ in whom I heed all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
 The word, the Greek word for wisdom here is Sophia.  
S-O-P-H-R-A, all right?  
Sophia.  
Sophia means insight into reality.  
It means all the collective understanding of all things.  
Are you getting this?  
Sophia is the insight.  
 into reality for example you look at this from there all you see is the shape you see the color and then they tell you what it is but the next thing you're gonna know is you're gonna have all the information that you can get all right now the word he says  
 all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
It says Sophia and Gnosis, meaning all information that you could ever mentally assemble.  
You get it?  
Now, insight, it says insight into reality.  
You know exactly what every element there represents.  
 You know beyond what can be seen.  
You know beyond the description of the senses.  
And yet you have all the information of the senses.  
All the information that you could ever get from the earth realm.  
You're looking at scholastic erodition, where you play with your mind.  
And you can communicate it mentally.  
 But then he says, wisdom, where you go beyond what could be explained humanly.  
Look at this, look at this, look at this, look at this, look at this.  
He and the children of Israel are not only weak and amless, defenseless,  
 They have no way to go.  
The Egyptians are coming after them.  
And this is no ordinary story.  
This is reality.  
The Egyptian army of the day was the world power.  
And they were coming after these slaves to take them back to bondage.  
 And they're about to throw stones at Moses to kill him.  
They said, you brought us out here to destroy us.  
We want to go back to Egypt.  
They were scared because Pharaoh's chariots were coming, charging towards them.  
And the Red Sea was in front of them.  
There was nowhere to go.  
They were doomed.  
Now,  
 Moses starts to pray now.  
He says, oh, God, do something.  
God said, Moses, don't pray now.  
He said, this is not the time to pray.  
He said, tell the people to go forward to where?  
The sea was right in front of them.  
And he said, tell the people to go forward.  
 Oh Lord Jesus, into the sea, to where?  
God said Moses, stretch your hand over the water and divide it.  
Now, now look at it, with all the nusses.  
 I'm talking about mental activity, all the knowledge that you could ever get from thinking, from working out in your mind, all the information of science, calculate everything together.  
You cannot divide that sea.  
Not so fast for six million Jews to go through on dry ground.  
How are you going to do it?  
 What you need is the wisdom of the insight into reality to see beyond all the calculations of physics.  
Do you understand?  
He's a stretcher hand over the water and divide it.  
Miracles are not magics.  
There are things that are based on spiritual laws of wisdom.  
 Do you understand?  
They know things that you said, oh, they just happened.  
God just made it happen.  
No, it's based on spiritual laws.  
It's when you operate at a higher realm of life.  
They're physical laws, but they're spiritual laws.  
He's a stretcher hand over the water and divide it.  
 And then, you see, he was straining Moses on the miraculous.  
And Moses stretched his hand over the water, and the Bible says, when he did, a strong wind from the presence of God surged through the water and patted it this way and that.  
And the water stayed like that, stood up all night long, until the china of Israel went through on dry ground.  
 And after the last man had gone out, and the last man of Egypt, because Egypt went after them in the water, on the bright dry ground.  
After the last man of Egypt was inside, the first man of Egypt was inside, but the last man of Egypt was outside.  
God said, Moses, hey.  
 He said, stretch your hair!  
Let the water come back!  
And the water came down and covered them.  
And the army of Egypt perished in one day.  
How do you explain it?  
 I told you about the axe head that Elijah, Elijah made to swim.  
Elijah, the axe head, metal, axe head, heavy axe head.  
He caused it to come up, to float.  
How?  
He didn't pray.  
Sophia.  
How you see you there?  
 the wisdom of God, insight into reality.  
Look at, they came to Jesus.  
There's a master, master, Him, whom thou lovest.  
It's sick.  
Lazarus is sick.  
Please come and heal Him.  
Jesus said, all right, no problem.  
He didn't go.  
He delayed.  
Lazarus died.  
 Then Jesus called his disciples to get it.  
He said, let's go to Bethany.  
Why?  
He says, our friend Lazarus is sleeping.  
And I want to go and wake him up.  
They said, Master, these sleeping ads are all right.  
Why did I have to go there?  
He said, don't you understand?  
He's dead.  
And I'm God for your sakes that I was not there.  
He said, let's go.  
 Now, Jesus went there.  
He said, I'm going to wake him up.  
He had told them when it came to him and said, he's sick and dying.  
He said, this sickness is not on to death.  
But for the glory of God, the man died.  
Somebody said, I even had a prophecy that the job was mine.  
At the end, somebody else got it.  
I can understand all these things.  
Shut up.  
 should operate with Sophia.  
Insights into reality.  
Look beyond the world.  
As a look beyond the world.  
Jesus got there.  
They took him to the place where the man had been laid.  
Dead for four days.  
 Decomposition had set in.  
They said, by this time his stinkets, he said, don't worry, road has turned away.  
The road has turned away.  
How did Jesus pray?  
He said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me because you hear me always.  
What did the father hear?  
What he said before?  
 This sickness is not on to death.  
Now, there was another time a little girl died.  
When Jesus came, he said, little girl, I say unto you, arise.  
So Jesus got that girl to arise.  
But let's look what he did to Lazarus.  
 Is it I thank you father, that you've heard me because you hear me always.  
Now, he stood in front of that cave and he heard out, Jesus!  
Come out!  
Like he was calling somebody behind the wall, you understand?  
He didn't say, rise from the dead.  
 Hensei, arise!  
Mm-mm.  
His Elijah's come out.  
He was in the cave.  
He's a come out.  
They thought he was really, really crazy now.  
The Jewish leaders were all there.  
They thought he was really mad.  
Now, didn't you say he had a demon?  
But to their amazement, Lazarus came hoping out of that cave.  
 What did Jesus know?  
What did He have?  
Insights into reality.  
Reality.  
You know, they said that, uh-huh.  
They said, it's a cancerous growth.  
They said, it's cancer.  
They said, who said?  
Who said?  
Who said?  
Huh?  
The wisdom of the doctor, right?  
 Can you see beyond it?  
Can you see the emptiness of it?  
They said the fibro is going larger.  
They said the fibro is bigger.  
Doctor said it's oppression.  
Why are you afraid of oppression because of the knife?  
They're going to touch you open.  
 Okay, I don't want to be put on the anesthesia.  
I would like to be awake.  
Let me be looking at the... You don't know if you go or whether you come back.  
Didn't you say there's a heaven?  


  
How many times did it tell us fear not?  
Fear not?  
Fear not?  
Fear not?  
 It's growing larger.  
How do you know?  
I can feel it.  
Then you come to church and say, I'm not moved by what I feel.  


  
Why didn't you laugh when you ferret it?  


  
You are a liar!  
 Yeah!  
You see, you see, that's the wisdom of God.  
Now, let me show you something there.  
Hey, hello, hello, hello.  
I told you, when you're born again, all right?  
 You have what?  
Ginozko knowledge.  
Ginozko.  
It's a revelation of the word that comes to you.  
I said, but that revelation, if you're going to grow into things of God, you have to get into what?  
Epic gnosis.  
Do you remember that?  
Okay.  
Okay.  
Okay.  
Okay.  
Now, look at this.  
I want you to turn to the book of St.  
Luke's Gospel, chapter number one.  
Are you there?  


  
 Alright, I'm reading to you.  
 from verse 17, you know, he is talking about John about, this is a prophecy about John about this and so on and so forth, says, and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient, I want you to mark that word, disobedient to the wisdom of the justs.  
Did you get it?  
 to the wisdom of the just.  
Now, here's something very beautiful.  
He says, to turn the hearts of the fathers of the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just or the wisdom of the righteous, the disobedient.  
That word is the word that is referred to again in the book of Hebrews 11 chapter, where is the thought chapter, when you read about the children of Israel not being passuatable.  
Okay.  
Now,  
 Here's the point.  
The word means one who cannot be persuaded, one who is unbelieving.  
That's the one who calls disobedient.  
The English translation says disobedient.  
It means one that will not be persuaded.  
He will not believe.  
He will not be persuaded to act accordingly.  
 Now he says, to turn the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to the wisdom of the righteous.  
So the righteous have a certain kind of wisdom.  
Now what kind of wisdom is he referring to here?  
This time he chooses another word, it's a Greek word that's called furnaces.  
Alright?  
Furnaces.  
 D-H-R-O-N-E-S-R-S.  
All right?  
All right.  
Now, what kind of wisdom is furnaces?  
It means a mindset.  
I think that's the best way to describe that.  
A mindset.  
 Now, I know many of you use the word mindset, but I want to, maybe I should read to you the meaning of that compound word mindset.  
Are you there?  
All right, mindset means a fixed mental attitude or disposition.  
Are you getting it?  
A fixed mental attitude or disposition  
 that predetermines a person's responses to situations and his interpretations of those situations.  
It fixed mental attitude.  
You see, he now has a mental attitude that influences his actions.  
 in any given situation.  
He has a fixed mental attitude.  
There's a way the guy is.  
There's a way he reasons.  
You can almost tell how he's going to behave in a certain situation.  
And the interpretation, his interpretation of situations is a fixed mental attitude.  
 Now, Phrenesis is a mindset.  
So he says, to turn the disobedience to the mindset of the righteous.  
The righteous, God's righteous ones are supposed to have a mindset.  
You see, all the time when I share with you the Word of God, I try to help you get a mindset.  
 I'm taking you on a journey so you can have the mindsets of a victim.  
The mindsets of one who is more than a conqueror.  
A mindset of a success.  
There's a mindset.  
It says a fixed mental attitude.  
This is the kind of wisdom that he wants to take you to.  


  
 Are you there?  
No, no, no, no.  
Look at Jesus.  
Look at Jesus.  
He had a mindset.  
He sent us the cypress.  
You go and wait for me somewhere.  
You know, he appointed them to wait for him somewhere.  
He was praying.  
When he was through, it was nighttime.  
Dark night.  
And Jesus came down from where was praying.  
And oh, all right, it's the sea.  
 All the boats were gone.  
He didn't supreme.  
He just walked on the water.  
He had a mindset.  
He didn't think of thinking.  
Look, do you understand?  
There was a mindset.  
He had a fixed mental attitude that couldn't distinguish between the water and the concrete or the ground.  
There was no difference.  
 A mind sets that recognizes no fear.  
No matter what happens behind you, all you do is look at it with the mind sets of a victim.  
They can't knock you out.  
Are you still there?  
Look at Samson.  
He had a mind set.  
 1,000 soldiers came out against him.  
1,000 men of war.  
You know what he did?  
He just looked for the jawbone of an ass.  
1,000 men.  
Facing one man.  
The anointing came on him.  
See, do you remember something else I touched you about the other Wednesday when we were talking about add to your fate virtue?  
Huh?  
 At, at, he's a sponsor, lavishly supply.  
You see, the guy, the anointed will come, but he had to lavishly supply something.  
Do you get it?  
There was an attitude that he had to have.  
An attitude.  
There's an attitude required for the anointing to produce results in your life.  
You gain functioning fear.  
 And have their non-improduced results.  
Are you there?  
A mindset.  
Now let me show you how to get there.  
See, it's a journey.  
First is Sophia.  
Sophia is the wisdom of God.  
And you know, the Bible says that Christ Jesus has been made onto us wisdom.  
And then we just read something that in Christ, you have all the treasures of wisdom, Sophia.  
 And what?  
Knowledge.  
All the treasures.  
I don't know whether you have caught that.  
Let me tell you what it implies.  
It means that if you took up something here, if you took this thing, and held it in your hand, you could actually get every required information from within your spirit.  
If you develop your spirit enough,  
 Let me tell you something.  
Several years ago, something happened.  
I explained something about a certain fruit.  
But I was given the explanation for my spirit.  
I'd never read about it.  
I'd never heard anybody talk about it.  
But I gave the information.  
And when I did, somebody went to a textbook  
 to find out what I said.  
To find out everything I said I was 100% accurate when it came from my spirit.  
I listened to somebody one day speaking his own language and I began to correct him on his language.  
I've never understood that language.  
I can't communicate in that language.  
You know what he did?  
 He argued a bit and he said, all right, I'm going home and I'm going to talk to some of the elderly men in my village.  
I said, that would be beautiful.  
They went home to their hometown and talked to some elderly men about what I said.  
You know what they told him?  
They said, who is that person?  
 They said, he is exactly right.  
They said, we wonder why many of the present generation don't understand it.  
That's what I told you.  
I was accurate.  
Are you still there?  
There's so much I can go from one to another to tell you experiences of those things where we can, he says, in Christ, what is the meaning of Christ?  
 God carefully put there the word Christ instead of saying Jesus.  
Because Christ means Jesus and the church.  
He's the head.  
We are the body, the head and the body from Christ.  
We are joint heirs with him.  
And he says that the treasures, all the treasures of wisdom, Sophia,  
 and knowledge, nusses, every required information about anything in this world.  
Do you know what Moses said?  
He said the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children.  
He said the things that are not revealed belong to God.  
Hi.  
Meaning that we can play with any information that has come to this world.  
Anything in this world that a man can know is already inside us.  
 Let me show you something.  
Look at even the natural world.  
Where men have been able to delve into their spirits, to pull out some information.  
And that's what has taken us to the level of science and technology that we are today.  
And what they have is still little compared with what the world could actually receive.  
And we are the custodians of all the treasures of wisdom.  
 and knowledge.  
There's nothing you cannot know.  
Nothing you cannot know.  
But you have to do something, and that is train your spirit.  
Train yourself to pick information from your spirit.  
Look, you'd find yourself, all right, all right, a lot of things.  
 Because information comes to me.  
Some of you will find that you'll be writing.  
You will start writing revelations.  
You will write.  
I'm telling you, when you go outside that these sand that all of us are walking on, we are walking on something that is so important, but we don't know.  
Why do I know this?  
This sand, this sand outside.  
I'm telling you, this sand, how do I know?  
First of all, from this knowledge that I have within me, I am telling you,  
 This sand that is so common outside that we are all working on.  
Because men have not looked at that which is common.  
We are following oil.  
But there's something in this sand.  
But men have been given a certain kind of foolishness.  
So they tread on God.  
Look it.  
Go to Liberia.  
And say alone.  
 They got diamonds.  
They are brook.  
The United Kingdom doesn't have diamonds.  
Until they came, until they came from Europe to talk to us about the diamonds.  
Until we found them carrying the thing and going to Europe with it.  
Did we know what it was?  
No!  
Look at the oil.  
We sat on them.  
 We knew nothing until they came and showed us.  
All these common things you are looking at.  
If God would grant you that grace for you to see, how can you project yourself into this kind of wisdom?  
Speaking in tongues.  
 speaking in tongues by speaking in tongues.  
You will launch yourself into the field of chemistry and begin to receive information.  
You have information in biology like you never thought possible.  
You become skillful in politics.  
Did you know about a man in the Bible?  
 The man called a heat to fail.  
You remember him?  
The man was not as anointed as you.  
He was a man who had prayed with his mind.  
The Bible says in those days, his advice was as though somebody had heard from God.  
He was not a prophet.  
He was not a prophet.  
Did you ever read about the man who sat for ideas?  
 Many people come to him and ask for solutions.  
All he did was to go into a dark room, lock himself up.  
He would sit down there for hours with a pen and a paper.  
And he would write for hours.  
Solutions to different things.  
No, when you are playing football and nobody's watching you, only you.  
You dribble around the field.  
You dribble everybody onto you, you scoff, between two students.  
They call it choosing.  


  
 Get yourself ready for a great and tremendous future.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Get yourself ready for it.  
Get yourself ready for it.  
That's in the future is yours.  
Hallelujah.  
Look, let me tell you, the next five years, 10 years, some of you are going to become so big, leave a cup out of my eye.  
Yes.  


  
 Hallelujah!  
Hallelujah!  
Sit down!  
Okay, let me mention the other kind, the one between them.  
Okay?  
So I said, the first one is Sophia.  
The second one is the one I want to tell you now.  
The third one is what?  
Phrenesis.  
Okay?  
Now,  
 Interestingly, the second one sounds like the last one.  
It's called Sonesis.  
There's a scripture that can give us a light into that one.  
Ephesians chapter three.  
Have you seen Ephesians chapter three?  
All right, read it to me.  
Verse four.  
 Yeah.  
Wherefore, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ.  
Now, maybe let's read from verse one.  
For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you jentires, if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has given me to you word, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery.  
 As I wrote a foreign few words, whereby when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ.  
He's telling them something.  
He says, I've got this information.  
I want you when you read what I've written to you, when you read it.  
So you can understand.  
You can understand.  
 King James is my knowledge in the mystery of Christ.  
The Greek word is sonesis.  
And sonesis doesn't mean knowledge there.  
It refers to a special kind of comprehension.  
It means perception.  
You might translate it understanding.  
It is the ability to understand concepts and see relationships between them.  
 All right?  
Thirdly, it suggests a quickness of apprehension.  
The penetrating consideration which precedes action.  
This is that knowledge or understanding of certain facts, the knowledge of certain things within you, the understanding.  
That's the reason why the King James translates it knowledge.  
 It is the comprehension, your ability to comprehend certain facts, certain ideas.  
It is that understanding that you have that causes you to behave in a certain way.  
Sometimes this thing is not even explainable.  
 But then, when we listen to you, for example, I tell people, if you listen, if you want to understand our ministry, go and listen to the tapes.  
After you have listened to a number of them, you have to listen to a lot of them, you will come up with senesis.  
You get it?  
Yeah.  
It's that thing.  
That's actually the one that gives you that thought one, which is  
 the fixed mental attitude, the mindset.  
When you have gotten this type of information, this kind of understanding, you have a mindset.  
So God gives you severe, all right?  
So that you can have an understanding, which is what, senesis, for the purpose  
 of getting you to have Phonesis, a mindset.  
You see, sometimes that word, Phonesis translated, prudence.  
Sometimes it's called practical wisdom.  
It makes you act in the second way.  
It's a mindset.  
 You have some people that just don't believe.  
They've trained themselves not to believe.  
They have that mindset to be unbelieving.  
They've got a problem.  
You can have a mindset.  
 and you can train yourself to have a mindset.  
And God wants you to have the right kind of training.  
So, being a child of God, being a child of God, the wisdom of God is made available to you.  
And if you will delve into that wisdom, in these different areas of life, you begin to have what, senesis.  
He says that he may understand my senesis in the mystery of Christ.  
You can have senesis.  
 in different subjects.  
He was talking about the mystery of Christ.  
He had a special kind of understanding about Christ and his message and his ministry.  
No one at all was ready for anything.  
Hallelujah.
