title: 3 Kinds of Wisdom Part 4
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 Why is the world full of failures?  
The world is full of failures.  
Too many people who ended up on the sidewalk.  
Too many whose dreams never came to pass.  
The dreams never materialized.  
 Too many who, at old age, were unhappy with their lives.  
But too many people all over the world who are looking to the government to make things better, who are hoping that the economy will help them to prosper.  
But life is not that way, haven't you read history?  
Life is not that way.  
 No government will make you prosper.  
All the people that are ever getting there, getting for themselves.  
And they forget about everybody else.  
Always remember that.  
God never put your future in the hands of any government.  
Well, there are too many people all over the world who think that they are conditioned.  
 is caused by the government.  
Or they think it has to do with their nation, where they come from.  
Or the job that they are doing.  
Success is not based on any of those things.  
Success is based on one powerful word.  
It's called wisdom.  
 Oh, hallelujah.  
Maybe I should read something to you.  
Just to think about it makes me excited.  
Turn to the book of Proverbs.  
Are you there?  
I want to read from Proverbs chapter number four and very quickly from verse  
 Now, let me give you the background.  
You know the book of Proverbs was written by Solomon, right?  
And before Jesus came, Solomon was the wisest man that ever lived.  
He was so, so wise.  
God made him wives.  
And you know, he made the wise decision when God spoke to him as a young man who had just ascended the throne.  
God said,  
 What do you want me to do for you?  
Ask what you will.  
And he asked God for wisdom.  
Do you remember?  
Question, how did Solomon know that he should ask for wisdom?  
Why didn't he ask for the wrong saying?  
Why didn't he ask for anything else?  
And God also made that remark.  
 He said, you didn't ask for long life.  
You didn't ask for the life of your enemies.  
You didn't ask for riches.  
You didn't ask for any of these things.  
He said, look, along with wisdom, I'll give you everything.  
Why did Solomon not ask for anything else?  
I want to show you.  
It's here.  
Proverbs chapter four.  
So let me read it to you from verse one.  
Here.  
 ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to no understanding.  
For I give you good doctrine, for such ye not my law.  
For I was my father's son, tender, and only beloved in the side of my mother.  
Listen, what does it mean by I was my father's son?  
I mean, shouldn't that be some kind of tautology?  
 No, it's not.  
He's explaining something that we ought to understand.  
When you start in the New Testament, you observe something we call the adopted son.  
Okay?  
The Greek word is he was.  
A son that has been raised to become his son.  
You get it?  
The one that's born a son  
 born a male son is called Technon.  
But when he's raised, he's called Hughes.  
So  
 This is what he's talking about here.  
When he says, I was my father's son.  
In other words, I was my father's adopted son.  
Adopted not in the way you talk about adoption today.  
You know, you sign some papers, make some payment, get somebody to become your child.  
That's not what he's talking about.  
That's not the meaning of adoption.  
Now, the word adoption when you studied in the New Testament refers to one that was trained.  
 Usually, the king would give one of his sons to the governors, the elders, the instructors, the teachers, and say, train this son for me.  
And they would train him in military service, train him in all kinds and all forms of discipline and learning,  
 Because he's the one that his father wants to make the king.  
He didn't have to be the first son.  
The adopted son became the king.  
And you know Solomon was not his father's first son.  
He was not even the second.  
He was not the third.  
But he was the adopted son.  
He was raised to be a king.  
 Are you there?  
So that's what he's saying here.  
He says, I was my father's son.  
Praise God.  
Okay, now let's observe something.  
Says, tender.  
Verse three, far was my father's son.  
Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.  
He, my father, taught me also.  
Who was his father?  
David.  
He's talking about King David.  
 He's talking about King David.  
He said, he taught me also and said unto me, let thine heart retain my words, keep my commandments and live.  
His father taught him.  
He's still telling us what his father said.  
Look at verse five.  
His father told him, he said, get wisdom.  
 Get understanding, forget it not, neither decline from the words of my mouth.  
For sake are not, and she shall preserve thee.  
Lava, and she shall keep thee.  
Listen, David told Solomon.  
Look at, look at, look at for seven.  
Wisdom is the principal thing.  
Therefore, get wisdom.  
And with all that getting, get understanding.  
King David told us on this,  
 He said, look boy, don't look at the palace even though I leave this for you.  
Don't look at the gold even though I give this to you.  
Don't look at the silver.  
He said, wisdom is the principle thing.  
Therefore get wisdom.  
 He said, with all that I get in, get understanding.  
You know, some people go to church on the Sunday morning, listen to the Word of God, and say, well, I didn't understand what the preacher said.  
I didn't understand.  
And then they go away.  
He says, with all that I get in, get understanding.  
I didn't understand.  
Well, I wasn't understanding, so I put it off.  
Understanding.  
How can you miss that?  
 Didn't you hear what Jesus said about the sower?  
He said, our sower went foot to soul.  
As he sowed, he said, some seeds fell by the wayside.  
And the birds of the air came and picked them up.  
He explained that parable.  
He said, those that fell by the wayside are the people who hear the word of God and do not understand.  
He said, and then Satan comes immediately and steal the word that was sown in their hearts.  
Why?  
Because they did not understand.  
 So what should you do?  
Listen with all your attention.  
Don't miss anything.  
People go to churches and they start counting the pillars and the fans and the looking around and thinking about all kinds of things and miss the whole stuff.  
 He says, with all that getting, get understanding.  
He says, wisdom is the principal thing.  
Hey, stop looking for money for your capital.  
He says, the capital is wisdom.  
Wisdom is the capital.  
That's what you need.  
If you have it, look.  
Let's look at it.  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Look at it.  
 Here's what his father told ya.  
Verse eight, Exalta, Exalt what?  
Wisdom, Exalta and she shall promote thee.  
She shall bring thee to honor when thou doesn't embrace her.  
She shall give to thy head an ornament of grace.  
A crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.  
Are you hearing?  


  
 Look at verse 13, take fast hold of instruction.  
Let her not go.  
Keep her for she is thy life.  
Instruction.  
Do you understand what it's talking about?  
When you're given an instruction, you're guided by inspired instruction.  
This is do it.  
That's your life.  
 The Bible says a child left to himself who come to ruin.  
He'll come to destruction.  
A child has left to himself.  
It's that way physically and it's that way spiritually.  
You are blessed to have somebody tell you what to do.  
You're blessed to have somebody teach you.  
You're blessed.  
 There are lots of Christians, people who have given their hearts to Christ, they don't have anybody to teach them anything.  
Some of them go to churches and sound, they sit down there and listen, listen, and listen, they get nothing.  
There's no teaching of the Word of God.  
They sing and go back home.  
 Only to feel good.  
Some people say, oh, I like dancing on Sunday.  
That's what I just wanted to dance.  
Dance and sweat and sweat.  
Oh, to this service.  
Oh, it was wonderful.  
What happened?  
Did you learn?  
And he said, ah, I dance, I dance.  
Hey, I wash it, but it's all my strength.  
Hey!  
Ignorance gone on Rampage.  
In the New Testament, they don't wash up him with all their strengths.  
 All the fleshly dance doesn't mean anything to God in a new testament.  
He says, God is a spirit.  
They that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in reality.  
Who come to that?  
Hallelujah.  
Don the chapter 8, book of Proverbs.  
 Listen to what wisdom is saying here.  
 from verse 1, dot, dot, wisdom, cry, and understanding, put forth her voice.  
She's standing in the top of high places, by the way, in the places of the parts.  
She cry it at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in, at the doors.  
On to you, oh, man, I call wisdom.  
It's talking.  
Oh, how many people ignore the voice of wisdom?  
When wisdom calls, they don't listen.  
 Wisdom cries.  
They don't listen and they wonder why there's poverty.  
They wonder why there's hunger.  
They wonder why there's failure.  
Because men are not listening to the voice of wisdom.  
No, I'm not talking about the wisdom of this world.  
No, I'm not talking about the wisdom of men.  
I'm talking about the wisdom of God.  
And that wisdom does not come from classes in the university.  
 It doesn't come from the laboratory.  
It doesn't come from all the books of this world.  
The wisdom of God is given by God.  
Hallelujah.  
And that wisdom says, I'm crying.  
I'm calling out to you.  
Oh, man.  
 In my voice to the sounds of man, look at verse 5, all ye simple, understand wisdom, and ye fools, be of an understanding heart, here for I will speak of excellent things.  
And the open of my lips shall be right things.  
From my mouth shall speak truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.  
There is nothing far of perversing them.  
 They are all plain to him that understands and writes to them that find knowledge.  
Hallelujah.  
He says, receive my instruction and not silver.  
Knowledge rather than choice gold.  
He says, listen, receive my instruction.  
Not silver.  
Receive knowledge rather than precious gold.  
Wisdom is the principle thing.  
 All right, look at verse 11.  
For wisdom is better than rubies.  
And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to her or to eat.  
I wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of winning vengeance.  
The fear of the Lord is to hate evil, pride and arrogance and the evil way and the proud mouth do I hate.  
 Council is mine.  
Wisdom is talking.  
It is council is mine and sound wisdom.  
I am understanding.  
I have strengths.  
 By me, kings reign, and princes decree justice.  
By me, princes rule, and neighbors, even all the judges of the earth.  
I love them that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me.  
Those that seek me early, don't wait till you're too old to talk.  
Call now.  
Verse 18, riches and honor.  
 Ah, with me.  
Yay.  
Durable riches and righteousness.  
Ha ha ha.  
Riches, honor.  
He says durable riches.  
That means lasting riches and righteousness.  
Somebody said you cannot be rich and righteous together.  
Look at this now.  
Look at it now.  
Look at it now.  
He says durable riches and righteousness.  


  
 My fruit is better than gold, yeah, than fine gold, and my revenue than choice silver.  
I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the parts of judgment, that I may cause, hey, I, there I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and I will feel their treasures.  
Okay, now you understand what I'm talking about.  
 That's what I'm talking about wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
There's somebody wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
The wisdom of God.  
The Greek word is Sophia.  
Wisdom.  
Sophia.  
Sophia.  
When God talks about Sophia, He's dealing with excellent things.  
I want us to turn for a moment  
 the book of Colosians.  
You ready?  
Oh, look at verse nine, chapter one.  
For this cost we are so since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you and to desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will in our Sophia.  
 and spiritual understanding.  
And not, glory to God.  
That spiritual understanding there, the word is sunesis.  
Oh, we'll come to that, okay?  
He says, the knowledge of his will in all wisdom, Sophia, in all wisdom.  
What does it mean?  
I said, we're talking about three kinds of wisdom.  
 That's our subject, the first kind of wisdom is Sophia.  
What type of wisdom is Sophia?  
First, I want us to read something here.  
In chapter two, book of Colosians, I'm reading from verse one.  
 For I will actually know what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh.  
Their hearts might be comforted, being knicked together in love, and under all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ.  
A very long verse, right?  
And sometimes you lose the meaning of it.  
 But here is what I want to read to you.  
He says, Christ, Christ, verse 3, in whom I heed, I want you to read the rest of it.  
I'm not sure you heard it.  
He says, Christ, in whom I heed, in whom I deposit it, all the treasures  
 Not some, but all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
It is all the treasures of wisdom.  
What is wisdom?  
What is Sophia?  
What is talking about when we refer to the wisdom of God?  
You can write it down.  
 He's talking about insight into reality.  
He's talking about insight in all learning.  
Science.  
Inside in all learning.  
He's talking about insight into hitting things.  
Do you understand?  
Inside into hitting things, including enigmatic and symbolic language.  
 Do you understand?  
Things that are difficult to understand.  
Things that mean have difficulty.  
They have difficulty unraveling.  
Let me show you this.  
Go to Daniel chapter 5, so you begin to understand what we're talking about here.  
Daniel chapter 5.  
Daniel chapter 5, when you have Sophia,  
 Listen, remember what we read.  
He said, in Christ I heed all the treasures.  
Oh my goodness.  
Listen, God, God, heed all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Christ.  
And did you notice he didn't say Jesus?  
Did you notice he didn't say that all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are in Jesus?  
 He said, they are in Christ.  
Who is Christ?  
There is no Christ a day without the church.  
There is no Christ without Jesus.  
Jesus is the head.  
The church is His body.  
That's the meaning of Christ.  
We are joint heirs together with Him.  
 what He is we have become.  
What belongs to Him belongs to us in the same way that it belongs to Him.  
You have to understand what the scriptures mean.  
So when He says Christ, we are the members of the body of Christ.  
He says everyone in particular.  
Oh boy.  
Inside us.  
You have the deposit.  
 of all the treasures.  
Oh, this is too big for the religious mind.  
This is too big for the ordinary person.  
This is too big for somebody without the knowledge of God.  
He says all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
 are heed in Christ.  
That means you.  
That means Christ.  
That means me.  
He's talking about Jesus, you and me together.  
In us is the wisdom of God, in totality.  
Don't you understand when he says, as he is, so are we.  
Don't you understand that?  
 Don't you understand what it means when he says, the fullness of the Godhead, bodily dwells in Jesus, then he says, and he are complete in him.  
That's another way of saying he has the completeness of him, meaning that without him there is no fullness.  
Without us there is no fullness.  
So together we have one with him, says he that is joined to the Lord, his own spirits.  
 Why did God deposit all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in Jesus?  
Why?  
Because of us.  
So that together we can have access to healing wisdom.  
The Bible says, which the world did not know.  
He says the princes of the world could not know it.  
They had no revelation of that wisdom.  
 He says, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Gloom.  
He says, I had not seen him.  
He had not heard.  
No, I did hear that into the heart of man, the things which God had reserved to them that love him.  
He says, but he has revealed them to us by his spirits.  
 And that spirit which such it all thinks, he says, yeah, the deep things of God.  
Oh my goodness.  
He says, the Holy Ghost, such is all the deep things of God.  
The Holy Ghost does.  
He knows all the deep things of God.  
Jesus said, when the Spirit of truth is come, he says, he shall take of mine and shall unveil it unto you.  
Hey, hey.  
 says the Holy Ghost shall take of mine.  
And he shall unveil it unto you.  
He shall guide you into all reality.  
This is wisdom.  
He says he shall guide you into all reality.  
We have not taken advantage of what is available to us.  
Why?  
Because of ignorance.  
For the most part, the church has not been taught.  
 God's people need to be taught.  
You see, until you know who you are, you would never rise up to the calling.  
You need to find out what belongs to you, who you are in Christ.  
Look at your image.  
You look at the word.  
Why does He say Christ in you the hope of glory?  
If that's true,  
 What is the suffering for?  
If that's true, why should you be strungulated by government policies?  
You are too much for that.  


  
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  
Hey, ah!  
Let me read something to you.  
From the book of Daniel,  
 Daniel chapter five, I'm reading to you from verse 12.  
He's talking about something, look, he's telling us about a man named Daniel.  
He says there was an excellent spirit in him.  
Come, look, look, look, look, look.  
Daniel had only a measure.  
 of what you have.  
You have the totality of the spirits.  
You have the personality of the spirits residing in you.  
He has made his home in your body.  
Daniel didn't have it that way.  
And yet, listen to the description.  
 He says, for as much as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding, we're talking about Sophia.  
Are you still there?  
An excellent spirit to have Sophia is to have an excellent spirit, a knowledge and understanding, interpreting of dreams and showing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts.  
 I don't know if you heard that.  
The man had such wisdom.  
He could explain hard sentences.  
He dissolved doubts.  
The Bible, Genesis and Second Chronicles, study chapter 9.  
How did the queen of Shiva heard about Solomon and journeyed from her country to visit Solomon?  
 Haven't heard so much about him.  
She came with questions.  
And the Bible says Solomon had knowledge in sciences.  
He had knowledge in arts.  
Read about it.  
This is the Bible now.  
Solomon knew about nature.  
When the queen of Sheba, who had been schooled in the best schools of the day, when she arrived and listened to Solomon,  
 The Bible says Solomon told her all her hearts.  
Explained everything says there was nothing.  
It says there was nothing that was a heat from Solomon.  
Nothing.  
Every question that the woman asks Solomon had the exact answer.  
Desolving of doubts.  
Explaining heart sentences.  
This is Sophia.  
Do you understand?  
 And now, that wisdom resides in you.  
The Bible says that Christ has been made unto us, wisdom from God.  
He is my Sophia.  
I have an excellent spirit.  
Do you understand that?  
When I speak, I dissolve doubts.  
I explain hard sentences.  
 Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Dissolving of doubts.  
He says, when you are through, nothing needs to be said anymore.  
You have dissolved doubts.  
You have explained hard sentences.  
He didn't think are revealed.  
He says, all that wisdom is in your spirit.  
That's Sophia.  
 It's in your spirit.  
When you were born again, you were born with it.  
It came when you were born again.  
When you became a new creation.  
Hey, this superior creation that God has brought forth in Christ.  
This is what you are.  
I'm showing you what happened when you got born again.  
I'm telling you who you are.  
Look at yourself.  
You are the house.  
 of the wisdom of God.  
Listen, maybe you haven't gotten it yet.  
The wisdom that created this world is in you.  
That is what the Bible says.  
That's what the Bible says.  
The question is, can you believe this?  
You see, when you look at yourself outwardly, when you look at yourself in the flesh,  
 This cannot be real.  
But if God would do this for Solomon, what did Jesus say about himself?  
He said, a greater than Solomon is here.  
Jesus Christ was a greater than Solomon.  
He called himself a greater than Solomon.  
He was greater than Solomon.  


  
 You are not connected in salvation to Solomon.  
You are not connected.  
Are you hearing me?  
To the wise men of the East.  
You are connected to Jesus, the greater than Solomon.  
You know what you ought to be saying in your life?  
I do not lack wisdom.  
You see, babes in Christ lack wisdom.  
 Babes in Christ lack wisdom.  
They lack it.  
What kind of wisdom do they lack?  
The expression of the wisdom.  
The luckets.  
Yes, inside them are heat.  
All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
Inside them.  
 Notices all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
The Greek word for knowledge that's not this, meaning all the sciences, meaning all the understanding of everything on the heaven.  
If you would dig inside, pull out knowledge from within you, nothing that you cannot know.  
I said poverty is unnecessary.  
 There's no reason why you should be poor.  
You are a special creation.  
The Bible says you are a chosen breed, a royal priesthood, a peculiar people, peculiar.  
There's something unique about you.  
Just that you have not taken time.  
So I so let yourself from the wrong information in the world.  
 The Holy Ghost is the spirit of reality.  
Who has come to guide you into all reality about your business.  
All reality about science, chemistry, mathematics, metallurgy.  
Don't you understand?  
He's come to guide you into all knowledge.  
All reality.  
How can you fail?  
How can you fail?  
I said poverty is unnecessary.  
 Take advantage of what you have on the inside.  
Welcome the Holy Ghost in your life.  
This is your inside teacher.  
Say, Holy Spirit, come son in this situation.  
What do we do?  
You say this?  
Look at this.  
Look at this.  
Do you think he would be in you and leave some wisdom in heaven?  
Everything is available.  
 inside you.  
Father, I thank you that I have all the wisdom.  
Now I want you to help me pull what I need out."  
Then you start speaking in tongues.  
He's not speaking in tongues.  
The Bible says, he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifies himself.  
You're activating your spirits.  
He says, what is it then?  
I will pray with the spirit and I'll prove the understanding also.  
 Which one is the also?  
The understanding.  
But most of us pray with our understanding to speak in tongues also.  
We have it the other way.  
We have to pray more in tongues than in our understanding.  
This is our prayer with the spirit which means speaking in tongues.  
And our prayer with the understanding also.  
Oh Father, I don't know how I'm going to.  
 I'm just suffering, I don't know why I'm suffering.  
You haven't started.  


  
You are the step-kila has kobra dala man de la buscha.  
Play for a dala man de la bia.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
 I've got the wisdom of God in me.  
Hallelujah.  
You know, you know the Bible talks about the wisdom of this world.  
And what does the Bible say about it?  
It's foolishness.  
The wisdom of this world is foolishness.  


  
 I said, I've got the wisdom of God in me.  
Hiya.  
Yeah.  
Hallelujah.  
If you find yourself in a confusing situation, the wisdom of God will guide you out.  


  
 Hello.  
You see, you see, when you know that you got wisdom, you stop working like a failure.  
You stop working like a failure.  
Yeah.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 Let's see if we can take something more.  
You ready for more?  
Let's see if we can.  
Hopes.  
I love you.  
Hallelujah.  
Deserving of doubts.  
Ha ha!  
Go with a god.  
He's a showing of hard sentences.  


  
 Thank you, Holy Spirit.  
Thank you, Holy Spirit.  


  
This has to be operated.  


  
You see, not wisdom of God, Sophia,  
 which is deposited in you when you're born again.  
Somebody says, how can all the wisdom of God be put inside this small, wretched person like myself?  
How much information has man put into the little microchip?  
Think about it.  
 As I think about it, that small microchip, think about how much information has been put inside it.  


  
 So God can't put his wisdom in you.  
Man can put human wisdom in the microchip.  
And God can't put wisdom inside you.  
God said, I want to live in you, dwell in you.  
If God Almighty  


  
 the embodiment of that wisdom.  
If he can dwell in you, how come his wisdom that belongs to him?  
Cannot be in you?  
Well, he's not telling us he's trying to do it.  
He's told us he's already done it.  
I got the wisdom of God in me.  
All information in this world  
 is accessible to me.  
My spirit can get it.  
All I need to do is discipline myself to get a hold of what I require.  
That's all I need.  
To learn to meditate and concentrate.  
That means focus.  
You know we talk about three kinds of knowledge.  
You remember?  
 There was the general knowledge.  
But we were dealing with revelation knowledge.  
And about revelation knowledge, there was more for the growing Christian.  
For the one who wanted to operate on that revelation, he needed to do something to make his knowledge.  
Like the Bible says, walk out your salvation.  
 with Godly reference.  
Walk out, now you have been saved.  
He says, put your salvation to work.  
Operate in that salvation.  
Walk it out.  
Many haven't walked out their salvation.  
But they're saying, this wisdom has been in you.  
Before I came to talk to you, it was already there.  
But it's in number one.  
Many of you didn't know much about it.  
 Many of you knew about it, you didn't stay at all.  
That's another level.  
Let's pray.  
Hallelujah.  
Lima, Haskeredigos, Caprananda, glory to God.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.
