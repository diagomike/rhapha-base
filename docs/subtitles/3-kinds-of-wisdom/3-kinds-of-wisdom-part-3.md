title: 3 Kinds of Wisdom Part 3
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 There's a big difference between feeling good and being blessed.  
When you are blessed, your life is improved.  
You can feel good without your life being improved.  
The truth is, a lot of Christians have not been able to distinguish between being blessed and feeling good.  


  
 So many go to church on Sunday and dance and dance and dance and dance until the sweat and sweat.  
I say, I will dance on my God.  
It's on my God.  
I know that David danced.  
Do you remember David?  
He danced and danced and danced for his God.  
And one of his wives  
 was angry that he was dancing that way.  
And you remember the rest of the story.  
She got in trouble for that.  
But you see, that, that was acceptable all not the old covenant.  
They worshiped him with all their might.  
 They danced in the flesh.  
Under the new contract, it is not useful.  
And that's one of the reasons why there are lots of splinter groups today.  
So many churches that are formed on the basis of  
 Some anger, they're angry with one other group, so they start a church.  
For example, there's a group that says that you're not supposed to use musical instruments in church.  
Because in the New Testament, it doesn't talk about musical instruments.  
All musical instruments were in the Old Testament.  
In the New Testament, no clapping,  
 No drums.  
No cymbals.  
Just sing.  
And lift your hands.  
Have you ever heard that?  
How many of you have heard that?  
Good.  
That's not enough to start a church.  
That's a good thought.  
There's nothing wrong.  
 in singing and clapping and rejoicing and even dancing.  
Nothing wrong if your spirit is attuned to God.  
But where that dance is what you are looking forward to and that is what blesses you  
 Something is wrong.  
So it doesn't matter that you dance from the sun up to the sun down.  
I jump.  
My home on it is beautiful and my hair will leave.  
You can, you know, you are going to give your offering.  
My home on it is beautiful and my hair will leave.  


  
 That is not worship.  
It is not praise.  
Nothing is happening.  
My home on earth is beautiful.  
My heavenly home is more beautiful.  
My heavenly home.  
It just gets worse.  


  
That's not a praise song.  
It's not a worship song.  
It doesn't mean anything.  
 You can say, Twinkle Twinkle little star.  
It doesn't matter.  
You are not being blessed.  
Even though you feel that you are being blessed.  
It doesn't improve your life.  
 You see, the problem is, too many people are ignorant of the word of God.  
And because they are ignorant of the Scriptures, they air.  
That's what Jesus said.  
He said, you air because you know not the Scriptures.  
So many don't know how to worship God.  
There's a way to worship God.  
There's a prescribed manner to worship God.  
 And that's why many times when you're worshiping, there are people who are wandering.  
They don't know how to key in.  
When you see you worshiping God and praising God, they don't know what to do.  
Because a lot of you here, you can worship without anybody singing, right?  
Am I right?  
You just take off and you're gone.  
Because your spirit is alive.  
 And when you're like that, you don't need revival.  
Revive us again.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
Revive us.  


  
Why?  
What you listen to matters  
 You listen to the word of God that leaves your spirit, you believed it.  
The word of God that keeps you alive, you be alive.  
You listen to the one that kills you, you would need revival all the time.  
See?  
The human nature loves to be condemned because he recognizes his impurities.  
 He loves to be condemned.  
So when you preach a message of condemnation to him, he's at home.  
He loves it.  
Just tell me.  
So you are a sinner just saved by grace.  
Yes, amen.  
Amen.  
That's not in you.  
Amen, I know.  
He's happy to receive it.  
 No man is anything.  
Only God.  
Amen.  
We are less than us.  
Amen.  
It's happy.  
Amen.  
There is no righteous, no, no to one.  
Amen.  
Such people are afraid of the Bible.  
Start talking about Jesus is coming again.  
They'll be scared.  
 Please, O Lord, please make me rapturable, please.  
Why?  
Because they have been placed in a coffin of fear, they're dead already, needing revival.  
Make up your mind as a child of God to know the Word of God for yourself.  
Amen?  
 You will leave an exciting and prosperous life when you know the word of God for yourself.  
Learn it, know it, master it.  
Leave it 24 hours a day.  
Then you'll live a great life.  
 Every day we are an exciting day of success, prosperity and victory.  
And those three things are strange to many people.  
They do not leave successful lives.  
They do not leave prosperous lives.  
They do not leave victorious lives.  
They're not aware that anybody could leave like that.  
 They think everybody is suffering, like they are suffering.  
Have you ever been some way and somebody says, oh, all of us have been sick?  
Last week, it was my son.  
The other day, it was my wife.  
The other day, it was my uncle.  
And he is also, even me, I'm looking, I'm already tired.  
Have you ever visited people and they like that?  
They complain of everything.  
They look old already.  
 Old, quiet, suffering.  
Every day they are like this.  


  
Every day.  
They are afraid to laugh.  
No, even some of you are in church now.  
I thought I was laughing around you like this.  
 You can't laugh out.  
You can't laugh out.  
You must not be caught laughing.  
They told you that if you laugh too much, sit down and we catch you.  


  
Laughter does good like medicine.  
Even when you don't feel like laughing, you go ha ha ha ha.  


  
 You've seen some people, they're not happy.  
They're very sad, so they start looking for some, uh, comedian to watch.  
They start growing from TV station to TV, looking for some comedian to help them become happy.  
They want to catch one, they don't relax like this.  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  
 You don't need a comedian to make you laugh.  
And that kind of laughter doesn't go down deep in the spirit.  
You stand in front of the mirror and start laughing.  
You say, don't think you're mad, yes.  
That's why you lock the door, lock everybody out.  
And then do it for yourself.  
At least you wouldn't think you're mad.  


  
 You know, some people think that, oh, life is very serious.  
Life is not a joke.  


  
They don't want to be happy.  
Yes, they want to be happy.  
Okay, make yourself happy.  
Mm-mm.  
Make yourself happy.  
Okay, can you make yourself happy?  
Hello?  
Can you?  
 You better do so.  
Because nobody, when I marry, I know, just be happy.  
Once I marry, it's just us, that's what I'm just waiting for.  
Once I just marry.  


  
Go ahead.  
The reason I'm not happy in my life is that I don't have any child.  
I've been married for 10 years.  
Go and buy one then.  


  
 to everywhere I go.  
Everywhere I go they ask me where is your husband.  
Oh God where is my husband?  
What kind of life is this?  
Can't you just be happy?  
Does it matter that anybody's asking you questions?  
Tell them to shut the trap.  
Be happy about yourself.  
Get excited about yourself.  
 Look at you, very pretty you, very handsome you, yet you are not happy.  
Don't let anybody stop you from being happy.  
Make up your mind to be happy.  
I made up my mind a long, long time ago to be happy and nothing can stop it.  
And I've been happy ever since.  


  
 Pick up your mind.  
Nothing is going to stop your job.  
Hello?  
Are you ready?  
Okay.  
We're talking about three kinds of wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
Wisdom is the principal thing.  
And David said to Solomon, he said, get wisdom.  
 Get understanding.  
All right?  
That's what it told you.  
I'm gonna look at a few things real quick.  
Now you know, that's the wisdom of this world, all right?  
The Bible refers to the wisdom of this world.  
And then there is the wisdom of man.  
 The wisdom of this world really has to do with how things are done in the world.  
The structure of things, their way of life and their judgments about what is right and what is wrong.  
What should be done, the answers that they prefer for the different problems that they experience, the wisdom of this world.  
 The wisdom of this world has done a lot of good stuff, all right?  
But you know what?  
At its best, its foolishness before God.  
At its best.  
Then it talks about the wisdom of men.  
The wisdom of men usually expressed in high sounding words, dealing with how they organize their minds.  
 and all that great learning in the different schools all over the world, sometimes the best schools, and men reason.  
Somebody said, he's a great philosopher, men in great thinker.  
That's the wisdom of men.  
Some even describe themselves as thinkers, say, I mean, thinker.  
 So, what are you saying?  
I mean, thinker.  
Are you born again?  
I'm not born again.  
I mean, thinker.  
The Bible describes your wisdom as the wisdom of men.  
And the Bible says it's foolish.  
I mean, thinker.  
Some have studied great thinkers.  
They idolize great thinkers, men that are called great thinkers.  
 They idolize them.  
They're carried away by them.  
They are disciples.  
Listen, many great thinkers of many, many years ago, Greek philosophers particularly, and German philosophers.  
They still have disciples today.  
Even though they're dead long, long, long, they have disciples who believe in them.  
Many people in different arms of government all over the world believe in these philosophers who have thought their way.  
 through various systems.  
If you don't know what you could have had, what you could have been, if you don't know, you accept what you see as the best.  
If you have no other way of knowing  
 You stay with what you get.  
But thank God He's given us His Word to enlighten us to give us information so we can know something beyond what we see with our optical eyes.  
Life is more than what other human beings tell us.  
Thank God for the Bible.  
 Someone has rightly said the Bible is a living thing.  
And I think so.  
Hallelujah.  
We're talking about three kinds of wisdom.  
You cannot be a true success without wisdom.  
Think about a man when he was a young boy.  
He won several awards for excellence.  
 He was a good sportsman.  
He was superb.  
In his academics, he got awards, always had the best.  
Went into the university.  
He was the best, started a beautiful course, came out with more awards, got a beautiful job, and just went up through the ranks.  
 Finally, he retired at 65.  
Life went on.  
Suddenly came, you know, he had got all his retirement planned out.  
Everything was working fine.  
He got in his rocking chair for his old age by the window.  
Well, but looking at the world, retired from working, doesn't need to work now.  
He's done all the best.  
His wall is full of all the awards.  
 All the certificates, everything there, all the trophies, wonderful.  
Then in one sweep, the economy changes.  
All what is had in the bank is reduced to almost nothing.  
He can't believe it.  
 Suddenly what he had that was much has become small.  
His health is beginning to get into trouble.  
He's not as strong as he used to be.  
He's gone to the best doctors.  
Doctors said, well, you know, you're 75 now.  
His old man's sickness.  
All what he expected.  
 seems to be changing.  
Now he's spending money trying to keep himself well.  
His wife is not any better.  
She's been sick for the last five years too.  
He had tried to set up all his children.  
But somehow, they hardly remember him.  
 They call on Christmas day and on new year day.  
What a life.  
What shall it profit a man?  
If you are gain the whole world, after you have run the United Nations, you will retire.  
After you have run Ekoas, I said, you retire.  
 After you have been four, ten presidents, you retire.  
When you retire, go to come and visit you.  
Then we ask one question, what shall it profit a man?  
If he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul,  
 What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  
Most men lack wisdom.  
No, it's not the academics, that's not what they lack.  
There's a place to get it.  
You study, work hard, you get all of that, but that is not wisdom.  
 And yet, wisdom is the principal thing.  
So you have the wisdom of this world that comes to nothing.  
You have the wisdom of men that fails.  
And lastly, you have the wisdom of God.  
 We're dealing with three kinds of wisdom and the first, and all I want to talk about is the wisdom of God, all right?  
I want to spend time talking about the other two because they don't mean anything.  
That's not for us.  
But I'm dealing with three kinds of wisdom that are accessible to us, that belong to us.  
The first one is a Greek word, Sophia.  
 And Sophia is insight, the insight that God gives you into reality.  
All right?  
Sophia includes all of the knowledge, all of the understanding of all learning and science.  
It is insight into heating things.  
When you have it,  
 Nothing eludes you.  
No one that the Bible says that all things are there to him with whom we have to do, talking about the Word of God.  
And the Word of God is the wisdom of God.  
This is all things are unveiled.  
Nothing is heeding from the Word.  
And when you're born again, the Bible tells us that that wisdom is granted us.  
 It's deposited in our spirits.  


  
Jesus in Christ, I heed all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
All of that is inside us.  
 Sometimes that's too big for the ordinary mind to understand, or for the baby Christian to understand.  
How could all the wisdom of God be given to me?  
But that's a fact.  
It's a fact.  
It's a fact that shows you how much God loves us, wanting to share with us all of his wisdom.  
It's a fact.  
 The Bible says, in the presence of the Lord, there's fullness of joy at his right hand.  
Our pleasures evermore.  
Let's, you know, the kind of God he is.  
He's not the master mind behind your suffering.  
He's not the master mind behind your sorrows.  
Maybe you're here today, and things aren't going the way you want them to go.  
 Maybe I'm not living a fulfilled life.  
There can be a change today.  
And I will show you how.  
Hallelujah.  
I'll show you how.  


  
All of the wisdom of God.  
The Bible says in Christ I heed all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
That thing is so big.  
 If we could meditate on that scripture, what masters will become?  
Masters of our circumstances.  
Men who are completely unafraid, on perturbed.  
You would no worry anymore.  
No wonder, this I believe, you see, these were writings of Paul.  
Paul understood this.  
And he was the one that told us, be anxious for nothing.  
 He said, brought in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving.  
He said, make your request known unto God and the peace of God.  
That surpasses all understanding.  
He says, the peace of God, that surpasses understanding.  
In other words, men look at you and they are stones at the peace of God in your life.  
It surpasses understanding.  
 says, that peace shall guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  
That's what he knew.  
He was praying for the church that they will operate in that wisdom.  
That they'll be reaching it.  
Why?  
Because he knew what it was.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 Wisdom, say it with me, say wisdom, wisdom, wisdom.  
I want you to become familiar with that word.  
Familiar in a positive sense.  
Okay?  
Get acquainted with it.  
Get acquainted with wisdom.  
Wisdom, wisdom.  
Think wisdom.  
Wisdom.  
 What is wisdom?  
I said, it's insight into reality.  
For example, you know what he said?  
He says, how bad we speak wisdom among them that I'm at all.  
Yet not the wisdom of this world.  
Do you understand that?  
But we speak wisdom.  
Then he says, we speak the wisdom of God in esoteric language.  
He says, it's a close communication revealed only to a select few.  
 He says, it's not a language for everybody.  
We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery.  
He says, we speak it among them, but a matron.  
Oh, my goodness.  
Hallelujah.  
He said, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the holy ghost teaches.  
He says, we speak the wisdom of God.  
We speak the wisdom.  
 See, that's why people can't think that we are just being bragadocious when we use those words.  
For example, when I say, I got the life of God in me, that's the wisdom of God.  
When I say, I'm full of wisdom, I'm full of wisdom.  
That's the wisdom of God.  
Someone says, how can somebody say he's full of wisdom?  
Are you the one to praise yourself?  
I'm not praising myself.  
I'm speaking wisdom.  
 I walk in the light, I walk in strength, I walk in righteousness.  
I walk in the glory of God, and I am the glory of God.  
And again, you see, that's what the Word of God says.  
That's what the wisdom of God says.  
So I speak that wisdom.  
But the natural man cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God.  
They are foolishness unto him.  
The Bible says, neither can he gynosco them.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 Why?  
Because they are spiritually understood.  
Spiritual understanding.  
Hey, hey, hey.  
That's a great word for sonnesis.  
It says sonnesis.  
Sonnesis, spiritual understanding.  
Do you understand that?  
Sonnesis is wisdom.  
King James uses the term spiritual understanding for us.  
That's the second kind of wisdom.  
We're talking three kinds of wisdom.  
The first one is Sofia.  
The second one is sonnesis.  
 What is Sunesis?  
Firstly, Sofia is what we call theoretical wisdom.  
Sunesis is critical wisdom.  
Are you still there?  
Hm.  
Oh, ho, ho, ho.  
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.  
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  
I've got the life of God in me.  
 I got the life of God in me.  
I got the spirit of the Son of God.  
I got the life of God in me.  
Hallelujah.  
Now, I want you to look at Book of the Visions, Chapter 3.  
Don't read something to you.  
 as the first kind of wisdom is Sophia, the Greek word is Sophia.  
It is all the knowledge of God, all the wisdom of God, all the understanding of God, deposited in Christ, and we are partakers thereof.  
So inside every one of us haven't been born again, there is the treasure of the wisdom of God, all the treasures.  
We have it in us.  
 But that's theoretical wisdom.  
It's a fact!  
But to put it to work is something else.  
That's why even many Christians are not successful.  
Because even though they got all the treasures of wisdom inside them, first of all, they are ignorant of that fact.  
They don't even know that that's a fact.  
 Most of them don't even know that such a thing exists.  
They don't know about it.  
Secondly, they have not been taught how to convert Sophia into Sunescis.  
And that's what I want to show you.  
Sophia is theoretical wisdom.  
You got it.  
It's in there.  
 but it has to become senesis.  
That's the next step.  
Oh, I, uh, Ephesians chapter three, I want to read to you.  
 from verse 1, for this course I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Galatians.  
If ye are Gentiles, all right?  
You're Gentiles.  
If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God,  
 Let me read again, all right?  
For this cause I Paul, the priest now of Jesus Christ for you, Gentiles, if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has given me to you word, how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery.  
As I wrote a foreign few words, he says, I wrote about the mystery before.  
I wrote about it for you.  
Now we're talking about this is Paul.  
Do you remember the Apostle Paul?  
 Now, this is whereby when you read, when you read that thing which I wrote, you see it, when you read, you may understand my sonesis in the mystery of Christ.  
The word knowledge there, wrongly put, is Greek sonesis.  
It's another synonym for wisdom.  
 It refers to comprehension, perception.  
Write it down, write it down, write it down, write it down.  
So it's in this comprehension, perception, understanding.  
It means the ability to understand concepts and see relationships between them.  
Okay?  
It suggests quickness of apprehension.  
 the penetrating concentration which precedes action.  
Are you following this?  
Literally.  
So this is means in the Greek literally.  
It means mentally putting together.  
So it deals with the intelligence.  
 So it means dealing, it comes from another Greek word that's closed to it.  
It's a Greek Sunni mai.  
What does that mean?  
It means dealing wisely.  
It means dealing wisely.  
 It tells you that dealing wisely produces success.  
That's why in the book, if you have, well, it's not so common, the Greek Septuagint.  
That's the Greek version of the Hebrew Old Testament.  
Okay?  
The Greek version of the Hebrew Old Testament.  
Now, in that Greek version, when you read Joshua chapter 1 verse 8,  
 where it says, the latter part of it, it tells you, you'll have good success, okay?  
Have good success there is from the Greek Tsunima, which means to deal wisely.  


  
 So in its full construction, it's telling you that you deal wisely, making you successful.  
You deal wisely in the affairs of life.  
Now, maybe we should read that verse so you can see it.  
Okay?  
Joshua chapter 1, look at verse 8, or tell us in this book of the law.  
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
All right?  
Do you remember it?  
Okay.  
Let's look at it.  
 You see, it's this book of the law shall not depart out by mouth, but thou shall meditate there in day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein, for then thou shall make thy way prosperous, and then thou shall have good success.  
Thou shall, that have good success there was rendered from a Greek word, Tsunima, in the Greek Septuagint.  
Okay, you would not see that in the Hebrew text.  
All right?  
It means to deal wisely.  
 So, here, Paul's referring to something that is so important.  
Well, it tells us that he may understand my knowledge.  
This is my sunesis in the mystery of Christ.  
He's saying that if we read his writings, we'll come to understand his comprehension, his perception.  
Why did Paul do the things he did?  
 Now we can see his perspective of the gospel.  
How did he perceive Jesus?  
Why was his message the way it was?  
Are you following this?  
Why?  
Why was it that way?  
And you know sometimes, sometimes we look at our lives and we can't find, we can't seem to find, we can't seem to place ourselves.  
 You ask some people, what do you believe?  
They're not sure what they believe.  
They just believe, but they're not sure what they believe.  
Paul says, you read my writings, you have an understanding of my comprehension.  
 In other words, the wisdom of God in his spirits had come to the level of his comprehension.  
So any day he could tell you what he believed about Jesus.  
He could explain to you his gospel.  
He called it my gospel.  
What is your gospel?  
At your people, if you listen to our tapes,  
 You can tell what we really believe.  
You just listen to the tapes and listen to the tapes.  
You can tell.  
You can tell our Sunnisis.  
Are you getting it now?  
And that helps us to deal wisely.  
This is how we can analyze life.  
We look at anything on the basis of that Sunnisis.  
That is the second level wisdom.  
Do you understand?  
 If anybody is asking you any question, is this right or is this right?  
Can a Christian do this?  
Can a Christian do this?  
It will be based on your sonessis of the mystery of Christ.  
If you don't have that sonessis, you have no answer.  
Sonessis is not for the babe in Christ.  
 is for the one who is growing in Christ, who has started to comprehend the mystery of Christ, who is beginning to have an understanding of the mystery of Christ, understanding the gospel.  
You see, the gospel is coming home now.  
See, not only do you believe in Jesus, you have now come to understand what you believe.  
It's another level.  
Now you can play from your mind.  
 Are you following this?  
You now make decisions on the basis of your sonessis.  
As a second level wisdom.  
And every child have got out to understand this.  
Every one of us has Sophia.  
We all have it inside us.  
We all have it.  
 But it's got to come up where we can begin to use that Sophia.  
Do you understand?  
We use it to analyze.  
By the time you start analyzing things, checking up things.  
Now you're doing diligent study, you're talking senesis.  
You're talking senesis.  
This is the next level wisdom.  
Now you're wise.  
Now you can make decisions.  
 You can say, this is right.  
No, this one is not okay.  
Well, even though this is right, not for me.  
You get it?  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
If every child of God could rise up to that point where you don't have to be asking questions, but you have the knowledge on the basis of your comprehension of the mystery of Christ,  
 You discover you wouldn't have to study everything in the Bible Genesis to Revelation before you understand the message of Christ.  
You have it in you.  
Why?  
Because you are putting to work, you are bringing up that which is inside.  
Amen.  
That which is inside.  
See why you have to study the Word of God?  
Because if you don't study, you're not going to have sinuses.  
 You have Sophia, but Sophia is theoretical wisdom.  
But it's not working.  
It's not working.  
You can distinguish between whether this is okay or not.  
Anything goes for you.  
You read all the newspapers, you don't know whether or not you should.  
Anything, anything goes.  
Look at all the home videos, all the tips you have bought, home videos.  
 There's no sneezes.  
See that?  
That wisdom is not there.  
From one thing to the other, you watch and watch and watch and watch.  
You know what Bible says?  
It says the listening and poverty is coming close to you.  
Finally, get a hold of you.  
Too late to change.  
Then you start complaining.  
You don't understand no kind of government, no kind of government.  
Government is not your problem.  


  
 Tell us about your sinuses.  
Say it again.  
Say it one more time.  
Okay.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Yeah.  
That's the next level.  
Critical wisdom.  
It's called critical wisdom.  
Critical wisdom.  
When you have sinuses,  
 You'll be able to deal wisely in your business.  
So, necessary.  
Critical wisdom.  
You'll be able to review issues and make the right decision.  
That's critical wisdom.  
I told you what it says in Joshua 1 verse 8.  
So that you may be able to deal wisely.  
This is you'll be able to deal wisely in the affairs of life.  
 In fact, if you look at it from the amplified version, you'd see it.  
You'd see it there.  
You'd be able to deal wisely.  
Because it says, to meditate on the world, they are not.  
They say, this book of the law shall not depend out of thy mouth, but thou shall meditate.  
So talk the word, meditate on the word, and you have sinuses.  
 What if you don't do it?  
Even though God has blessed you with all the wisdom of God, it's not going to work.  
Praise God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
But the last one is where I want to take you to.  
That last one is where I really want to take you to.  


  
You ready for this?  
St.  
Luke's Gospel.  
 Chapter 1.  
In him would live and move and hide.  
I'll be in him would live and move and hide.  
I'll be in.  
Praise God.  
 So it looks Gospel chapter number one.  
I want you to look at verse 17.  
I want you to read it to me.  
You ready?  
Okay, go.  
Mm-hmm.  
The children, uh-huh.  


  
And the disobedient to what?  
 He wants to turn the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous.  


  
This is so powerful.  
Well, you know,  
 Well, that's why we have to study the Scriptures, because if we don't study, we can't know.  
And the Bible says to search the Scriptures.  
And as you grow in the Lord, sometimes people say, so how do you get to know when there are differences, especially when you use the English translation and everything looks the same?  
 First and foremost, the more you grow in the things of God, the more you're able to tell that this thing is not supposed to be this way.  
And then you're motivated to do some more search and you find it right there.  
Praise God.  
And that again is based on senesis.  
 Okay?  
All right, now here's the point I want to make.  
He said his plan is to turn the heart of the disobedience to the wisdom of the righteous.  
Now that word wisdom, now let's look at it first on generic terms.  
He says to turn the disobedience to the wisdom of the righteous.  
 Those of course, disobedient, the Greek word that is translated, disobedient, that means those who are on persuadable, the faithless, the unbelieving.  
So they do not obey the word.  
And God's plan is to turn their hearts  
 to bring them up to the wisdom of the righteous.  
Now the words were carefully chosen of the Holy Spirit.  
He's bringing them to the wisdom of the righteous.  
This time, the word wisdom does not come from Sophia.  
Why?  
Because even if they had the Sophia of the righteous, they might still behave that way.  
 After all, I just showed you from the book that you that are born again, you have that Sophia.  
But why then do you act the way you do?  
Why are many Christians failures?  
Even though they have Sophia, he doesn't say to bring them to the synopsis of the righteous.  
Why?  
Because that's still not enough.  
 You could have senesis and act differently.  
You know, sometimes you believe something, you understand something, yet you do differently.  
And then you say, I can understand why.  
I know that this thing is not a, why am I doing it?  
You know what he said?  
He said he wants to bring the disobedient, that means the worst of the bunch.  
 You may not be as bad as that.  
Yet God is saying that His plan is to bring the worst of the bunch up to the wisdom of the righteous.  
He chooses a word, furnaces.  
Furnaces means, oh boy, it means a mindset.  
That's furnaces, it means a mindset.  
 You don't know how big this thing is.  
It's too big.  
It's too big.  
Ah, someone in this place.  
It says, Anishah, go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, which is Elijah as an okay James version, to turn the hearts of the fathers of the children and the disobedient to the furnaces of the just.  
 to make ready of people prepared for the Lord.  
It shows us God's mind, God's plan.  
He says to bring the disobedient to the mindset of the righteous, God of heaven.  


  
You know, things like this, when I read them on my own, I just sit down  
 And I started singing in tongues.  
I said, this thing is too big.  
You need Gino school to get a hold of it.  
That's the truth.  
Are you ready for that?  
You've got to catch it.  
You've got to catch it.  
 Listen, if God's plan is to bring me up to the furnaces, the mindsets of the righteous.  
What a miracle.  
What a plan.  
What an honor.  
Great wonder.  
This is marvelous.  
 Maybe I should give you a proper definition of mindset.  
What is mindset?  
When you say mindset, what does it mean?  
Because if you don't know what the mindset is, because I know a lot of you use it on a daily basis.  
But I think we should look at the meaning.  
Okay?  
What the mindset is.  
So I'd like to read it to you.  
You ready?  


  
 Mindset means a fixed, I want you to notice the words carefully, a fixed mental attitude or disposition that predetermines a person's responses to situations and his interpretation of situations.  
 Minds it is a fixed mental attitude or disposition.  
It predetermines your responses to situations.  
It predetermines your interpretation.  
Listen, listen, what it is saying is this.  
A fixed mental attitude that controls  
 how you will respond to anything, and how you will interpret anything.  
It is a fixed mental attitude.  
When you have a mindset, you see life from that perspective.  
That is the only way you read things.  
That's the only way you understand.  
If your mindset is wrong, you are finished.  
Listen, don't you understand what?  
It's a compound word.  
Mind sets.  
 Your mind is fixed to thinking in a setting direction.  
Now, God is saying that He is bringing the disobedient to the mindset of the righteous.  
The righteous have a mindset.  
What is the reason for your failure?  
That your mindset is not the mindset of the righteous.  
 What is the reason for your poverty?  
That your mindset is not the mindset of the righteous.  
The righteous have a mindset.  
Listen, I do not think failure.  
I can't think failure.  
I don't think failure.  
I can't comprehend failure.  
I have a mindset.  
 Failure is not an option.  
It doesn't work with my system.  
I can't think of failing.  
The Word of God has projected me out of that long time ago.  
I don't think in that arena.  
I can't think fear.  
I lost my fear as many years ago.  
When I was a little boy, I used to be afraid.  
 I was scared in the night.  
I was afraid of anything.  
I feared dark places.  
I feared to hear a noise in the night.  
I was scared.  
I like to sleep fast.  
Why others are awake around me?  
And to wake up late with everybody else's awake already.  
That's the way I was.  
Forget about the future.  
I couldn't even think about future.  
 I was too scared of the present.  
You know what?  
When I received the Holy Ghost, you know, before then, if I heard the thunderings and saw the lightnings and all those things, I was scared.  
I was scared.  
Where did the fears come from?  
I didn't know then.  
 I knew now.  
From studying the word, I knew the source of fear.  
But I didn't know where the fears came from, just a little boy.  
But I was afraid.  
I lived in fear.  
I don't think my parents ever knew how much fear there was in me.  
It was too much.  
But when I received the Holy Ghost, I said I lost my fears.  
 And as the years went on, starting the Word of God had lost my fright.  
I couldn't be frightened.  
Nothing could happen.  
Today, nothing happens to frighten me.  
I can't be frightened.  
You can't frighten me with anything.  
No matter what happens behind me.  
I will not check like this.  
No.  
All sorts of things have been disabled.  
It's a fact.  
 Why?  
Because through those scriptures, I have developed a mindset.  
I have developed a mindset.  
I can't think sickness.  
And this is what I'm passing across to you.  
He says, there is a mindset for the just.  
He says, the just shall leave by faith.  
He says, my righteous ones shall leave by faith.  
 What is faith?  


  
 The Holy Spirit, Jesus said, the Holy Spirit, when it comes, He shall guide you into our truths, meaning He shall guide you into our reality.  
Oh, meaning that He makes the Word of God real to us.  
As we study the Scriptures, the Scriptures become real to us.  
They come alive to our spirits.  
Our response to that reality that we can now perceive in the Word of God is what faith is.  
 Faith is acting on those realities, defined for us by the Holy Ghost.  
Hallelujah.  
 The Word of God has been made real.  
Oh, glory to God.  
It's been made real to us.  
Wisdom has become real.  
It has become real.  
The Holy Ghost has made me know that the wisdom of God is real in me, and that the ability of the Spirit of God has been made available to me.  
So when it says, great, I receive that is in you, that he that is in the world, it's a fact.  
It's a fact.  
 It has completely, you know, dated my mentality.  
I can only think that way.  
Greater is he that is in me.  
No matter what happens, I only think greater is he that is in me.  
I cannot think fear.  
I cannot think defeats.  
The one in me is greater.  
Greater, greater, greater.  
 He is bringing the disobedient to the mindset, the mindset of the just, the mindset of the righteous.  
Oh, there is a mindset.  
Kila has Karadika.  
There is a mindset, a mindset for victory, a mindset for success.  
It doesn't matter what you're a part of.  
When you get involved, success only, victory only.  
 He says he out of God, little children.  
He have overcome them.  
Hey, ah.  
John had a mind set.  
Do you understand?  
This is from Nessus.  
It's a mind set.  
How do you get it by meditating on the scriptures?  
Meditating on Sophia.  
As you meditate, you receive some Nessus, a comprehension.  
Do you understand?  
 With that comprehension, you start speaking according to your comprehension, then it controls not only your vocabulary, it controls your mind, and therefore you have what?  
From this is a mindset.  
A mindset.  
Imagine when children grow up in that environment.  
Nobody ever calls them stupid.  
Nobody ever calls them foolish.  
Are you still there?  
 They'll develop a mindset for success.  
It doesn't matter what crisis they face.  
If only you could understand what I'm sharing with you now.  
It doesn't matter what kind of business, even if you're just a little traitor.  
 As you carry your things to the markets, you have a mindset.  
You know you are a success.  
You know you are a victim.  
You are going to the market to win.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Think about it.  
From then on, you see, you are no longer controlled by your environment.  
It doesn't matter what people say about you.  
You have a mindset for success.  
 Hallelujah.  
That's the way I am.  
You can't knock me down.  
You can't knock me out.  
Nothing shakes me.  
Nothing moves me.  
I got a mind sex.  
He says, in all these things, we are more than conquerors.  
Through him that loved us.  
 Hallelujah.  
Mindset.  
You know, something is happening.  
Somebody saying something against you or something that's been written against you.  
You know, you have a mindset.  
You say, that's not a factor.  
He doesn't matter to my success.  
That's not a factor.  
Success is boning you.  
 Oh, he says, blessed is the man.  
Haven't you read it?  
Who work at nuts in the council of the ungodly?  
 No sitting in the seat of this council, no standing in the way of sinners.  
He's the likes.  
He's in the law of the Lord.  
And daring.  
He meditated day and night.  
He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water.  
Come and shout amen somebody.  
Hallelujah.  
 You begin to say this, you say, that's the way I am.  
I'm like a tree planted by the rivers of water.  
Bring it for fruits in a season.  
His leaf also shall not wither whatsoever he do it.  
Shall prosper.  
Oh, for the God.  


  
What a life.  


  
 You are not only blessed.  
You are a blessing.  
You are a blessing.  
Don't you understand?  
You are a blessing.  


  
Hallelujah.  
I said hallelujah.  


  
 I don't know if there's anybody here today and you've been sick in your body.  
I don't know what you've been diagnosed with, but I've got news for you.  
If only you will get this mindset.  


  
 Hallelujah!  
Hallelujah!  
Hallelujah!  


  
 Praise the Lord.  
Sit down for a moment.  
Sit down.  


  
Did I ever tell you about the French prince?  
The little boy during the French Revolution.  
 They got a whore of those little boys.  
He was a prince, but he was a kid.  
And they wanted to kill him.  
And somebody said, no, no, no, no, don't kill him.  
He's young.  
If you kill him, he'll go to heaven.  
And that's too good for his bad father.  
They said, before he dies,  
 Let us give him to a witch and let the witch teach him to curse.  
So he'll be polluted in his life.  
Then he'll die and go to hell.  
Oh, they said, that's right.  
That's right.  
Let's not kill him now.  
He was too innocent.  
He'll go to heaven, give him to a witch, and they gave him to a witch.  
It was said that the witch tried and tried to teach this little boy, nine years old, how to curse.  
 But he would not say what the witch said to say.  
The witch tried and tried and finally got frustrated and said, I said, you must say it.  
The little boy looked at the witch and said, I can't say that.  
He said, I was born to be a king.  
Let me tell you another story.  


  
 Prince Charles had something like a bull or so, probably a bull or an elephant or something, charging towards him.  
It was said that all those around were shocked because it didn't move.  
He stood right there looking.  
 The AIDS had to come and help.  
He didn't move.  
Why?  
He had a mind set.  
He'd been trained.  
This is not an ordinary guy.  
This is not a street guy.  
Don't you understand?  
And he got on the news.  
The media carried it.  
 He told him something of the substance of that man.  
He just stood.  
Because the British prince must not run for anything.  
He would rather die there than to turn and run, rid their history.  
That's what you call a mindset.  


  
 You studied to become afraid.  
It was information you heard that made you afraid.  
I said, when I look back, I can tell where those fears came from when I was a little born.  
Because of all the stories that were telling me.  
All the terrible stories.  
They were all negative terrible stories.  
And I heard the stories.  
And the more I heard, and the more I wanted to hear them.  
But I never knew what they were producing in my spirits.  
They produced fear.  
I was intimidated.  
I was scared of life.  
 They told me about witches and witch doctors.  
They told me if you heard... They told me, hold on.  
They told me those birds are possessed by spirits.  
They were not ordinary birds.  
 I was made to understand that demons had more power.  
They showed up, but angels never showed up.  
Nobody told me about angels, but they all knew they were angels.  
None of them ever saw an angel, but they knew about demons.  
Tell me about demons.  
I was scared.  
But when I received the Holy Ghost, oh boy.  
 And I found out greater is he that is in you than he that is in no more.  
I was changed.  
I was transfigured.  
I became another person.  
I was changed.  
Metamorphosed.  
 He said, yeah, of God, he have overcome them.  
He didn't say, he's sharp.  
He said, he have, he have.  
And I've told myself a thousand times, you have overcome them.  
You have overcome them.  
One day I was praying, and I heard a voice.  
The Lord said, Lord, you have overcome the world.  
Oh, glory to God.  
And I took a hold of that, Remer.  
And I proclaimed it, I have overcome the world.  
 So I've overcome every nation.  
It doesn't matter which nation I go to.  
I've overcome the world.  
Every nation on the heaven.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
Thanks be unto God, who gives us the victory and causes the sever of his knowledge.  
By us.  
 in every place.  
Everywhere we go, there's an aroma of his knowledge.  
Who's the none of us?  
Somebody shout hallelujah!  
Whoo!  
Oh, glory to God!  
Go ahead and praise Him and thank Him.
