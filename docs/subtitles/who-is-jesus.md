title: Who is Jesus
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Who is Jesus?  
The fullness, the totality of divinity.  
Nothing divine is outside Jesus.  
Jesus is the full package of divinity.  
 When it comes to me, it comes as words.  
Anything to me as words lives in me as God.  
When the word anything to you, the word completes everything.  
Oh, shout amen hallelujah.  
 Remember, in the beginning, what's the word?  
And the word was which God?  
And the word was God.  
The word that was God became flesh.  
Who is Jesus God in flesh?  


  
 I love to talk about Jesus, the Prince of B.C.  
Yes, the Lord of Lords Supreme, through all eternity, the great I am, the way, the truth, the life, the door.  
 Let's talk about Jesus more and more.  
Hallelujah.  
I love to talk about Jesus.  
Who would you rather talk about?  
Come on, tell me.  
He's a prince of peace.  
 The Lord of Lords Supreme, the great I am, Hallelujah.  
Did you know he was the one who appeared to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob?  
He was Jesus.  
The Jews didn't know it.  
 He said to them one day, Abraham rejoiced to see my day.  
And these people who were so angry with Jesus suddenly started laughing at him.  
Why were they laughing at him?  
They said, we told you before that you are not.  
 You're not just 50 years old, now you claim to have seen Abraham.  
Then he said, before Abraham was, I am.  
They didn't like the construction.  
He should have said before Abraham was, I was, so that they would love more.  
But they didn't like what he said, because  
 The connotation of his communication was before Abraham was, I am God.  


  
So they said, what?  
You are a man.  
How dare you make yourself equal with God?  
We thought to kill him.  
 Jesus said that he is the Son of God and that made them mad.  


  
Because Son of God means God in the flesh.  
So Jesus declared that he was God in the flesh.  


  
 never get confused.  
We've got to tell the whole world.  


  
I was surprised as I ministered around the world and made ministers of the gospel around the world.  
Most have never studied the subject.  
Most have never really known that Jesus Christ was Himself God.  
 They thought, yeah, but he is equal with God.  
Then I say, who is God?  
They say, Jesus is the Son of God.  
They say, who is God?  
There's Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  
So I say, where is Father, where is Son, the way is Holy Spirit?  


  
No answer.  
And yet the Bible has answers.  


  
 Jesus is the body of God.  
Did you hear me?  
Jesus is God in the flesh.  


  
Oh, why did the Father call him from heaven?  
 And speak from heaven and say, this is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased.  
The heard his voice come from heaven.  
Who do you think he is?  
Man, do you use your mind to describe God?  
Didn't you just hear what we said he is?  
God.  
Is that so hard for God?  
 to be there and be there at the same time.  


  
Can't you speak from there and respond from there?  


  
Who is Jesus?  
Colossians chapter 1, from verse 18.  


  
 And He is the head of the body.  
The church, read it for me, come on.  


  
He is the head of the body.  
The church is the body, the body of Christ.  
 Who is the beginning, the first born from the dead?  
That in all things he might have what?  
The preeminence.  
Read verse 17.  
He is before all things and by him, by him all things consists.  
He is the divine essence of all things.  
 Read verse 19 now.  


  
It pleased the Father that in him, in Jesus Christ, should all fullness, all fullness, dwell.  
What does it mean fullness?  
Colossians chapter 2, go to verse 9.  
 You love this.  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Look at that, for in Him dwellers.  
Oh, not something.  
Oh, come on now.  
All the fullness of the Godhead in body.  
I told you Jesus is the body of God.  
What do you mean by Godhead?  
Godhead means Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  
 for and indwelled all the fullness, the totality of divinity.  
All the fullness of the Godhead bodily, where Jesus was, the Father was, the Holy Ghost was.  
He was God in fullness, God in full manifestation,  
 They didn't know it.  
He was in the world.  
The world was made by him, and the world knew him not.  
He came onto his own, and his own received him not.  
Jesus is a body of God.  
I told you, he was the one who appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  
 It was Jesus that was in that burning bush where he called Moses.  
Take your shoes off your feet for where you're standing in this holy ground.  
That was Jesus.  


  
The Jews didn't know it.  
But right there was Jesus, Son of God.  
 They didn't know it.  
He gave Moses the Ten Commandments.  
God, can you imagine the tribe, the lifelong, to obey his commandments?  
And when he came, they didn't know you.  


  
 So he healed their sick, gave sight to the blind, unstopped their deaf ears, gave the lame and even the main new limbs.  
The Bible says, though he had done so many miracles before them.  
He had to believe not only him.  
Coste didn't know who he was.  
 If we don't know who he is, would he ignore him?  
Or treat him the way that treated him?  
What I was saying in his songs would ignore him.  
Because there was Shaptim.  
They went to the synagogues, to the temples.  
There was Shaptim everywhere.  
But they didn't know him.  


  
 His presence in the temple of Solomon, the priest could not stand to minister.  
His power was so great, just for them calling on him and singing songs to him, and it went postured on the floor.  
And yet when he showed up, they ignored him.  


  
And now he comes to the temple himself, in his physical body.  
 asking questions.  
What authority did you do these things?  
Who are you?  
Who sent you?  


  
The question.  
And finally, they crucified you.  
Not because he didn't have the power,  
 but because he gave himself up for us.  
He took responsibility for our errors, for our transgressions, for our trespasses, he took responsibility.  
But he's not supposed to do it twice.  


  
 He did it once for our time.  
You know, people say, well, I'm this way because God made me.  
Why do I do wrong things?  
Well, and I'm not responsible for my life.  
God did it.  
Well, he already bore responsibility for whatever happened to you or through you or by you or anything.  
He already took responsibility anyway.  
Now he commands all men everywhere to repent.  


  
 That's why he came.  
That's why he died for everybody.  
He took responsibility.  
Now he commands all men everywhere and says, you must now turn to God.  
You must now turn from your sins.  
He paid full penalty for every sin and provided the life that we must live with the ability to live it.  
 that none of us anymore should walk in condemnation because we're all under God's judgment.  


  
Now we've got to tell it.  
Why do I love to preach the gospel?  
Apart from the fact that God sent me to preach it, I love to preach it because it works.  
It truly works.  
 It works.  
How can I be quiet?  
It works.  
It's real.  
It's true.  


  
I preach it in the schools.  
I preach it in the streets.  
I preach it in the villages.  
I preach it everywhere.  
It works.  
It works for the poor, for the rich.  
 Works for everybody and works in every nation under heaven.  
You can trust it with your life.  
You can bet your life on it.  
It works.  
The gospel is real.  


  
 And you know, the power of the gospel, it's so amazing because, phew.  
Look at it, the barrisings in the gospel is the righteousness of God revealed.  
We don't have to try to make it happen.  
 Paul is bridging that list trap, as a man important in his feet, never walked from verse.  
He's on the ground is listening, and Paul preaches the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
And the Bible says he perceived that the man had faith to be healed.  
He turned to the man.  
He said, man, get up.  
 Wow, wow, wow.  
You know, I read that as a young man, reading my Bible, I shouted glory, hallelujah.  
I was so stirred.  
Wow, wow, wow.  
The men get up.  
 Paul wasn't thinking about what might have happened to his ligaments, his tendons, his bones.  
You don't think about what might have happened to his muscles.  
Never worked from birds or something about the word of God.  
We were created by the word.  
In the beginning was the word and the word was made by him.  
All right, the word was made by him.  
 The Word of God that was there in the beginning created all things.  


  
He made all things.  
The whole world was made by Him.  
So this Word that created all things is able to fix the ligaments, to fix the tendons.  
You don't tell Him what to do.  
He knows what to do.  
He said, man, stand up.  
 the word that pre-existed man and made all thanks, fixed the man's limbs instantly.  
God's word tells somebody, God's word works in real time.  
Real time.  
 I wish I could explain this to you, but you ought to know it.  
You ought to know it.  
God's work works in real time.  
 Real time, when we start sharing the Word of God, when we start discussing God's Word, we are operating at the same wavelength.  
At that moment, God's Word is synchronized with our spirits.  
That's why he says faith is necessary because with faith, you are synchronized with God's mind and thinking at that moment.  
Faith synchronizes you because you see the unseen.  
 Faith helps you see.  
Imagine this.  
He says to the man, stand up.  
The Bible says he perceived that the man had faith to be healed.  
What does that mean?  
The man's spirit was synchronized with the words.  
The gospel he was hearing.  
And when he says, stand up.  
The Bible says he's fucking the man stood up.  
He was healed.  
He was healed.  
 How does it happen?  
Well, that's the miracle power of God.  
It's not for our explanation.  
He created the whole world.  
All things were made by Him.  
And guess what?  
That word that made all things, the babeses, became flesh.  
 The word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
That's Jesus.  
The word became flesh.  
The word, which is God, became flesh.  
Do you get it?  
That's the word in my heart.  
 When He comes to me, He comes as words.  
And as into me as words, lives in me as God.  


  
Just put the Scriptures together.  
John chapter 1, let's speak them out from verse 1.  
 Look real quick, in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.  
The Word was God.  
Why do you say the Word was God?  
Because the Word is describing is in heaven and then he wants to tell us about the Word coming to the earth.  
So in the beginning was the Word.  
The Word was with God and the Word was God.  
 because he uses the pasteens because he's giving us something, the story of the word.  
Do you get it?  
It's the story of the word.  
John's giving us the story of the word.  
The word was there in the beginning and he was with God.  
He was God.  
What's John thinking about?  
John's thinking about he was God, but he became man.  
 Do you get it?  
That's what John's going.  
He's saying, the word was always there in the beginning.  
He preexisted man.  
He was God.  
He became man.  
Let's see.  
In the beginning, what's the word?  
And the word was with God.  
And the word was God.  
Next.  
The same was in the beginning with God.  
 All things were made by him, not by it, but by him.  
So he's a person.  
And without him was not anything made that was made.  
Without him was not anything made that was made.  
Wow.  
Next.  
In him was life.  
Thanks be unto God.  
 Oh, hallelujah.  
And the life was the light of men, hallelujah, hallelujah.  
Whoo!  
And the light shining in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.  
 There was a man sent from God.  
Whose name was John?  
I always loved this.  
Because it tells us, you know, people, they like to say, well, nobody should claim to be sent from God.  
Nobody should claim that God said, but nobody should claim, they just don't want us to say that anybody heard from God.  
But the Bible does declare, unless somebody here embarrasses, there was a man sent from God.  
 What a declaration.  
There was a man sent from God, man or man, whose name was John.  
There was a man sent from God.  
Wow, that's big.  
And he didn't become the Prime Minister.  
And he was not the fear of Egypt.  
And he was not seized of Rome.  
 Think about it.  


  
Whose name was John?  
Where was he?  
They found him in the wilderness.  
God doesn't prove himself in your life through all the nice things of the earth.  
 He doesn't need to prove that he's with you by giving you the best cars and the best houses and lots of money.  
That's not the proof that he sent you or he's with you.  
God sent John and John was not in the palace.  
Never let earthly things deceive you.  


  
 That was a man sent through God whose name was John.  
Come on.  
The same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe.  
Yes, that's important.  
He was sent as a witness.  
Have you been sent as a witness?  
Do you realize you've been sent as a witness?  
You're the light bearer.  
Not only are you a light bearer, you are light yourself.  
 Hallelujah.  
But John was not that light.  
Next verse.  
He was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light.  
That was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.  
Hallelujah.  
He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not.  
 When the prophets talked about him, when the prophets preached him, he was the word.  
They listened.  
They heard his voice.  
But they didn't listen to him.  
They didn't obey him.  
The word was in the world in the mouths of men and women.  
They didn't listen.  
No, no, no.  
He was in the world and the world was made by him.  
 the world knew him not.  
Next, he came on to his own.  
His own received him, but as many as received him.  
To them gave he power to become.  


  
I wish I had time to explain how John got into verse 12, but not today.  
 How?  
Why did he get into verse 12?  
He gets into verse 12 and into verse 13.  
Too powerful.  
He even gets into verse 16.  
These are verses he shouldn't have gone to.  
He's tempted to say more.  
 Where as many as received him to them gave him power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe in his name, verse 13, which were born, not of blood.  
Okay, just for the records, just for the records.  
Go back to verse 12.  
No, no, no, go to verse 11.  
I take it from verse 11 into verse 12.  
So you just want to say what I'm talking about.  
Verse 11, he came onto his own and his own received him not.  
This is not Jesus in the body.  
This is Jesus, this is the word of God.  
 So he goes to verse 12, let's look at verse 12.  
When verse 12 happens, Jesus is not here in his body.  
He's still talking about the word, look at it.  
As many as received him to them gave him power to become the sons of God.  
When this happens, Jesus is no longer in the earth.  
He's not here in his body.  
So he's not talking about Jesus the man.  
 This is Jesus the Word.  
Verse 13, which were born not of blood, not of the will of the flesh, not of the will of man, but of God.  
So we're talking about being born again.  
When it became possible for men to be born again, Jesus was not here.  
Jesus the man was not here.  
Glory to God.  
So he goes back to his context and the word.  
 See, so we go from 11 to 14.  
Are you following now?  
That's the way children.  
So let's go back to 11.  
He came onto his own, and his own received him not.  
So good of 14.  
And the word was made flesh.  
Well, the Greek rendering is better as the word became flesh.  
 That's how it reads.  
The word became flesh.  
The word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
The word became flesh.  
Remember, in the beginning, what's the word?  
And the word was with God.  
And the word was God.  
The word that was God became flesh.  
 Who is Jesus?  
God in flesh.  


  
The word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
And John is so excited.  
He says, and we, we beheld His glory.  
Glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and reality.  
Hallelujah.  
Full of grace and truth.  
 You know the Bible says the law came by who?  
The law came by.  
But grace and truth came, Jesus Christ.  
All right, why don't we just take it a little?  
So you see the next thing, 15, 16.  
John Burr, what does of him?  
And cried saying this.  
 Was he of whom I speak?  
He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.  
Oh, oh, man, ta-kara-ba-dee-ga-saya, look at this, how beautiful, and of his fullness have all we receive and grace, for grace, shout him in, somebody.  
 of His fullness.  
Of His fullness I have received.  
Of His fullness I have received.  
Of His fullness I have received.  
Hallelujah.  
Who is Jesus?  
Who is Jesus?  
Wow.  
Wow.  
Let's go back to Colossians now.  
Colossians chapter 2.  
We're in verse 9, right?  
 Verse 9, for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.  
So Jesus is the body of God.  
Jesus is God in a body.  
Right?  
And not just part of God, we just saw it.  
The fullness of the Godhead.  
The fullness, the totality of divinity.  
 Nothing divine is outside Jesus.  
Jesus is the full package of divinity.  
Oh, when we see him.  


  
You're not going to be asking, where's the father?  
I guarantee you that.  
Jesus is your satisfaction.  
 That's why when a man receives Jesus, he has arrived.  
He has arrived.  
His search is over.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
What a message we have to tell the words.  
When a man receives Jesus, when a woman receives Jesus, their search is over.  
Their hunger is satisfied.  
Their thirst is quenched.  
 It's a guarantee.  
You never search for Him anymore.  
You never search for anything anymore when you meet with Jesus.  
The search comes to an end.  
You have arrived.  
You are home.  
When I find Christians who are still in search, I say, what did you receive?  
What did you believe?  
Told you understand it?  
 He said, he that believed it had everlasting life.  
It's not a promise.  
He that believes has.  
Then I said, what did you get?  
They were never taught that they would get anything.  
They were told if they believed something will come.  
I said, no.  
When you believed, you received.  
You received eternal life when you believed in Jesus.  
 Anyone who receives Jesus receives life.  
The answer is with you now.  
The glory is in you now.  
Don't you understand?  
That's the gospel.  
Otherwise, this new message, why did he tell us to tell the untold?  
Why did he tell us we have a message for the whole world?  
Think about it.  
All right.  
Verse 10, Colossians 2.  
And he,  
 A complete in him.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, you are not short of anything.  
You are complete in him.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh.  
 I am complete.  
I am complete.  
I am complete.  
I am complete.  
I am perfected in Christ, Hallelujah.  
For ministering to somebody one day, they said, oh, shout only one kidney.  
I said, when was that?  
Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blowing story.  
I said, well, that doesn't matter now.  
Now Jesus Christ is Lord of your life.  
You are complete, complete, complete.  
 When she went for a checkup, they found complete kidneys.  
I tell people, the Word of God is the creed of the Word.  
When the Word enters into you, the Word completes everything.  
Oh, shout amen.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Complete.  
I'm completing him.  
Oh, many times I pray and I walk up and down.  
In my room facing the floor and I'm saying, dear Jesus, I'm perfecting Christ Jesus, my Lord.  
Perfected.  
Complete in him.  
I'm complete.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
Complete.  
 We're talking about Jesus, who is he?  
First Timothy chapter three, you're gonna like this.  
In verse 16, boy, you love it.  
And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness.  
God, somebody, can you see that?  
God was manifest in the flesh.  


  
 Whoa!  
Ha ha!  
Can you see it?  
That's it!  
Hey!  
You know years ago...  
 When I read in my Bible, God was manifesting the flesh.  
I thought, dear Jesus, look at it, justified in the spirit.  
The Bible says when he was raised from the dead, he was justified.  
Seeing of angels preached unto the Gentiles, believed on him the world, received up into glory.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 Think about it.  
If you were one of his brothers or his sisters, you knew you were all born of Mary.  
But Mary, your mother told you he was born in a different way from you.  
And he said, well, that's just because he was born before me.  
No, mommy says, uh-uh.  
 I was pregnant with him as a virgin.  
They said, what?  
An angel spoke words to me.  
I believe those words.  
Those words became a baby.  
What happened?  
Oh.  
Mary became pregnant.  
 Because of words.  
The words of the angel.  
And she got pregnant.  
Jesus was found by words.  
Are you hearing me?  
They lived with him in the same home.  
They watched him go out.  
They watched him come in.  
They saw some of his miracles.  
They have difficulty believing in him.  
 Because he was so much like them.  
They saw his disciples.  
They chose not to attend some of his meetings.  
Then one day, he was arrested and they said, we've been warning him.  
We told him not to go back to Jerusalem.  
He wouldn't listen to anybody.  
Very hard-headed.  
Family members are all offended.  
 His supposed father's brothers and relatives have all come to see Mary.  
Why didn't you warn your son?  
We told you the Romans are dangerous.  
We told you the high priest is very dangerous.  
We told you to warn your son.  
Young man, 33 years old, now they're gonna kill him.  


  
He was taken away.  
 The Bible says he was taken from prison, and from judgment.  
And who shall declare his generation?  
Oh, man, to crally, hunger, degas, sardios, la grouge, to prah, hunger, degas, sardios.  
He says, who shall declare his generation?  
Who shall tell who he really was?  


  
Who shall tell?  
 For he was kind of out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was his trigger.  
He's despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and have quarantined with grief.  
Surely, we hid our faces from him.  
Said he was despised and we esteemed him not.  
But he was wounded for our transgressions.  
 He was bruised for our iniquities.  
The chastisement of our peace was upon Him.  
And this Jesus was nailed to the cross.  
And to put on that cross, there He was hanging.  
Now they listened to His voice.  
 His once powerful voice got weaker and weaker.  
Suddenly they heard him say, I thirst.  
They thought, oh, the world who gave others food to eat and wanted to drink.  
I can imagine that woman who met Jesus at the well hearing him say, I thirst.  
 Wasn't this the man that said, I'll give you water?  
Wasn't this the man that said the water that I give?  
Shall be in you aware of living water?  
Now he says, I thirst.  
They get a sponge, soak it up with vinegar, and lift it to you.  
 Jesus is hanging there.  
His head drops.  
He says, it is finished.  
They're thinking, oh, will he perform a miracle and come out?  
Will he come off of the cross?  
He says, it is finished.  
What does it mean?  
It is finished.  
They don't get it.  
Then suddenly.  
 He cries out.  
The last strength of his body.  
Father, into your hands I command my spirit.  
His head drops.  
Jesus is dead.  
The miracle worker is dead.  
The healer is dead.  
The world who raised others from the dead is himself dead.  
 They said, surely it's finished.  
It's over.  
The Bible says the people smot their breasts and went home.  
The priests were done with Jesus.  
The Romans were done with him.  
And they buried him.  
And then they remembered.  
He said he would rise again.  
They said he's a deceiver.  
They said, you know what?  
 before his disciples steal his body and tell us he rose.  
Let's get authority from the governor and seal the tomb.  
So they sealed the tomb and put soldiers at the entrance to protect it and the role of great stone against the entrance of the tomb.  


  
 They won.  
Everywhere is quiet.  
Disciples are weeping.  
They too.  
Everywhere is quiet.  
Disciples now are hiding.  
They are shamed.  
They are shamed.  
They have left their families and their friends and their jobs and their businesses.  
They left everything and followed Jesus.  
 Now it's dead, and the people come, the scoffers, the scorners come around them, and they say, yeah, now you should be wiser.  
Your Jesus is dead, isn't he?  
He told everybody, he's Son of God.  
If he were the Son of God, he wouldn't die.  
God doesn't die.  
 Well, day three.  


  
The women come from the tomb.  
They say, Simon, come on, Simon.  
Jesus is alive.  


  
 Simon and John spring out of the room.  
They dash to the garden, get to the tomb.  
The stone actually is rolling off.  
Peter steps in.  
His body's surely not there.  
John looks around.  
He's surely not there.  
The Bible says, and John looks.  
He said, I believed.  


  
 Glory!  


  
They gather together.  
The disciples are talking about it.  
They're talking about it.  
And while they're talking about it, the Bible says, then came Jesus.  
In the midst of His disciples,  
 What does he say?  
All hell!  
All hell!  
They're excited.  
Jesus was an exciting person.  
You can tell with that that his meetings were not so quiet.  
Go!  
Go!  
Hallelujah!  
 I mean, here is his first meeting with his disciples.  
You would think he would come in and say, well, everybody, how are you doing?  
He comes all hell.  
I mean, think about it.  
Think about it.  
I mean, he's God.  
Why would he get excited?  
Because that's who he is.  
 He comes in and he doesn't talk like, you know, boss boss, you know, like, hello everybody, I told you, rise again.  
You didn't believe me and now you're in trouble.  
No, he comes in excited.  
Oh, hey!  
Oh, hey!  
Those are his first words.  
 So he stares up, an excited meeting, and they are also excited, shouting, whoa.  


  
Glory, hallelujah.  
40 days and 49ers walks among them, teaching them things concerning the kingdom of God.  
Now his brothers and his sisters,  
 His mother and the other women have been attending the meetings.  
Looking at him, still with some suspicion, but the mother believed.  
Because the Bible says neither did his brethren believe in him.  
They hadn't believed.  
But now they're coming around, enjoying the meetings, listening, and hoping he doesn't get as stupid as before.  
Because they're thinking he might be arrested again.  
 They're hoping he had learned his lessons.  
So they're following, hoping they could protect him this time with their lives.  
They felt terrible that they were so helpless when he was first taken.  
So now let's hope everything goes well.  
And one day, he says, our next meeting is in Galilee.  
So let's meet over there.  
He said he's going again.  
So they all assemble.  
 In Galilee, Jesus is with them.  
He speaks.  
He talks.  
He speaks to them.  
They're listening.  
Now he's not saying some other things.  
What does it mean by that?  
It doesn't look like... It doesn't sound like... What is he saying?  
He talked like he's the first time they killed him.  
 He said, I'll not be with you much longer.  
Then the next thing we knew, he was arrested.  
Now he's saying it again.  
I'm not going to be with you much longer.  
Is he going to make another trouble?  
So they're waiting, listening.  
And then he says to them, words they never thought, don't ever hear from the lips of a man.  
St.  
Matthew's gospel.  
 Chapter 28.  
The disciples came there and 11 were there.  


  
 Then 11 disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.  
And when they saw him, the worshiped him, but some doubted.  
And Jesus came and speak unto them, saying, all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.  
Hold on, hold on.  
When you say all power is given unto me in the earth, we can understand it.  
But how can you  
 being a man hath all power in heaven.  
Can you see that?  
This man is not just discussing earthly things.  
He says all power, all authority is given unto me in heaven.  
That means he is saying he controls things in heaven.  


  
 go ye therefore on account of this authority he says I saved you man oh man ah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah when I was near me cadets we did this  
 You did that to who?  
To the officer.  
Think about it.  
This is the man with all authority.  
He is Jesus.  
All authority in heaven and in earth.  
Everywhere.  
Everywhere then he says.  
 Go ye therefore and teach our nations."  
And I say, yes sir.  


  
That's it.  
That is command.  
Go ye therefore and teach our nations.  
Yes sir!

Do it again.  
Do it again.  
Do it again.  
Do it again.  
Do it again.

Do it again.

Yes, sir!
