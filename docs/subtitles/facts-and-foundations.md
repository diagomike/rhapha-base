title: Facts and Foundations
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and he left us with a message to tell the untold, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and his unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
Glory to God.  
Jesus Christ.  


  
 Son of the living God.  
Who is he to you?  
Now, let me show you these scriptures.  
I think they'll bless you, really bless you.  
First, we will go to Book of Psalms, chapter 19.  
We'll begin reading from verse 1.  


  
 What you notice what he says?  
He says, the heavens declare the glory of God.  
And the firmament showeth His handiwork.  
The heavens declare the glory of God.  
And the firmament showeth His handiwork.  
 Day on to day, I'd read speech.  
A night on the night, show at knowledge.  
There's no speech, no language, where their voice is not heard.  
The heavens, the kind of glory of God.  
And he tells us, he says, the farmer and show at his handy work.  
Day on to day.  
 Words are spoken by these signs.  
It says, there's no speech, no language, whether voice is not heard.  
It doesn't matter what language it is.  
English, French, it's all there.  
 The line is gone out through all the earth and the words, the words to the end of the world.  
In them had he set a tabernacle for the sun.  
I like that.  
There's no speech, no language, where that voice is not heard.  
Turn to Daniel chapter 12.  


  
 Daniel chapter 12 from verse 1.  
And this is a revelation to the prophet Daniel, and it was the angel Gabriel who brought him this revelation.  
And it says to him, at that time shall Michael stand up the great prince, which stand yet for the children of thy people.  
He's telling him what will happen in the last days.  
 And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was, since there was a nation even to that same time.  
And at that time, thy people shall be delivered, everyone that shall be found written in the book.  
And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth, those who have died, shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting content.  
 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, the brightness of the heavens.  
And they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.  
They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the heavens.  
Why?  
 Because they had many stats as the heavens, their voice had been heard in every language.  
You will not shine as the brightness of the heavens if you don't function like the heavens.  
 Can you see it?  
And so as we seed the gospel, we're involved in the gospel, send the gospel around the world.  
It says, they that be wise, those who turn many to righteousness, by it says he that we need souls is wise.  
So he's not talking about every Christian here.  
It's those who will win many for the Lord.  
It says, they shall shine as the brightness of the heavens.  
 Why?  
Because the heavens did declare the glory of God.  
And there was no language where the message was not heard.  
Hallelujah.  
And you have acted like that.  
You've sent out the gospel like that.  
And so one day Jesus Christ would show up in half us honored for preaching the gospel to every man in every nation.  
Praise God forevermore.  
 How can you know the gospel and not tell everybody else?  
How could you know these things and keep them to yourself?  
No, that would be selfish, selfish.  
How could you?  
It's either you don't know it or you're really selfish, or it's difficult to know this and be selfish.  
 If you know it, you cannot be selfish.  
If you're selfish, you don't know it.  
Hallelujah.  
So if you truly know the gospel, you'd like to tell everybody else.  
You can't keep it to yourself.  
It's not possible.  
The prophet said, the word was hot in my mouth.  
I couldn't keep quiet.  
I had to talk.  
You've got to talk.  
 You've got to tell somebody else, you can't keep it to yourself.  
Let me share some thoughts with you.  
Just a few lines and wow, wow, wow.  
What this is.  
Number one, our solid foundation.  
 First is about what Christ came to do.  
That's number one.  
What Christ came to do.  


  
First Timothy chapter 1 verse 15.  
Read it one to go.  
Yes.  


  
 He says, this is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.  


  
A faithful saying, a dependable word, worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.  
 It's a fundamental Christ of Jesus came into the world to save sinners and policies of whom I am chief.  
Oh, he says, has the worst of them.  
Now, that's him.  
What about us?  
But we're in the better.  
 I guess we're just as bad what He saved us.  
Thanks be on to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Yes.  
So that's number one.  
You've got to have that clear in your mind.  
Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners and I'm one of them.  
And tell me about our solid foundation.  
Second thing, who He is and who we are.  
 Who is he?  
Who said Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners?  
But who was Jesus?  
What kind of a man was he?  
Who was this man who came to save me?  
And now that he's saved me, who am I?  
What has that done to me?  
We'll look at scriptures.  
Let's begin.  
Colosians chapter 1.  
 And we are reading from verse 15.  
And see, who's he talking about?  
Who's he talking about?  
He's talking about Jesus.  
He's talking about Jesus.  
If you look at the previous verses, he's talking about Jesus, the Son of God.  
And then it comes to verse 15 to say, who is this Jesus is the image.  
Oh, I've got to calm down.  
Yeah, when I get talking about this stuff,  


  
 Well, he is the image, dear Lord Jesus, he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.  
He is the icon of the invisible God.  
You know what that means?  
The invisible God, you cannot see God, but you can see the icon.  
Think about that computer or that device.  
 You don't see the application, okay?  
It's in the system.  
But then the icon is there that shows you its presence.  
And then you click on it.  


  
That word image is from the Greek icon, where we got icon.  
Jesus Christ, the Bible says, is the icon of the invisible God.  
 He's a representation of the invisible God.  
Our God is invisible.  
He's invisible to these eyes.  
And so Jesus comes as the image of the invisible God.  
Now this is mind-blowing.  
Who is Jesus?  
Jesus is the image of the invisible God.  
 That means the outward expression of the invisible God.  
When you saw Jesus, you saw God.  
No wonder, he said, if you have seen me, you have seen the Father.  
Hallelujah.  
 Let's go verse 16.  
For by Him, by this Jesus, we're talking about our solid foundation.  
Who is Jesus?  
By Him we're all things created, that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible.  
Whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things.  
Hear that, not some things, all things were created by Him and for Him.  
 talking about Jesus.  
Who is He?  
To get verse 17.  
And He is before all things.  
And by Him, all things hold together.  
All things consist.  
That means by the word of His power, things are where they are by His word.  
By Him, all things consist.  
Was He talking about Jesus?  
Jesus.  
 My, my, my.  
Look at this, verse 18.  
And he is the head of the body, the church.  
He's the head of the church.  
Who is the beginning, the first bone from the dead?  
That means the first to come out of spiritual death.  
How is it hard time to talk about that?  
 An amazing reality.  
Jesus Christ, the first to come out of spiritual, nobody ever came out of that bondage.  
Nobody ever came out of Satan's bondage.  
Nobody ever came out of death.  
Spiritual death.  
Separation from God.  
Nobody ever came out of that.  
But Jesus did.  
Because he paid the full penalty for every man.  
And he was without sin.  
 He was without sin.  
It should have been illegal for him to be in hell.  
But he went in our place.  
And because a righteous man was given for sinners, sinners were given his righteousness.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, dear Lord.  
 Look at this.  
Who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead?  
That in all things he might have the preeminence.  
Jesus Christ has the preeminence in all things.  
Read verse 19.  
It pleased the Father that in Jesus should all fullness the totality of divinity.  
 It pleased the Father that in Him to all divinity be tabernacles.  
Jesus Christ.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you Lord.  
I said, who is He?  
We got Colossians chapter 2.  
Let's read from chapter 2.  


  
Are you there?  
 Let's take it from verse two.  
What I want to give you is in verse three, but I just want you to pick the last few words of verse two so you can have it in context.  
That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ.  
Now, that's where I want to start.  
Christ in whom?  
 Christ, Jesus, all right?  
In whom I hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
What are you looking for?  
In this man, Jesus, I hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.  
Whether it's arts or science makes no difference.  
All the treasures of wisdom and knowledge  
 ahead in Christ Jesus.  
Who is this man?  
Who is it?  
Haya.  
Go to verse 9.  
For in him, dwelleth.  
Oh God.  


  
 That word dwelleth, it means to be settleds, to make a home somewhere.  
You have rested there.  
You're not going away.  
You have made a home there in whom dwelleth.  
Hi, look at that.  
All the foolish of the Godhead bodily.  
 If you wanted to find God in his totality in a body, he said, look at Jesus.  
In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead.  
Nothing missing.  
When you saw Jesus, you saw God in his totality.  
 He wanted to show his disciples something one time.  
He said, Peter, James, and John, he said, follow me.  
They went with him to a mountain.  
While they were there, the Bible says he was transfigured before them.  
They saw him in his glory.  
He said, man, oh, man.  
Wow.  
Peter said, master, let's stay here.  
Let's never go again.  
Let's stay here.  
 and then they saw two men appear with Jesus Elijah whom they had read about that one day the man was wasting to heaven with a child of fire where other prophets were watching he was taken away alive caught alive and taken into heaven they saw him with Jesus I don't leave that  
 Then was Moses.  
Then you Moses died, but nobody knew where he was buried.  
And now Moses stands with Jesus.  
Think what was going through their minds.  
These disciples.  
Who would you tell?  
They didn't know who to tell.  
How do you say, you know what?  
We went out today with Jesus and guess who appeared with him?  
 Then you say, Elijah, who was taken away many years ago.  
And then you say, Moses, who are you going to tell?  
They'll think you've gone nuts.  
How can they accept it?  
No wonder this disciples just get quiet.  
Let them tell anybody.  
 And Jesus warned them, he says, don't talk about it until the Son of Man is gone.  
He says, don't talk about it.  
Why?  
They think you're fools.  
They think you're mad.  
No one will believe you.  
Don't worry.  
Oh, their son is men appear with Jesus.  
And they didn't just suddenly appear like, where are we?  
The Bible says that we're having a discussion with Jesus.  
 a discussion.  
And it tells us what they were talking about.  
They were talking about the death that Jesus was going to accomplish.  
That's what they were talking with him about.  
One man who died, and another one who didn't die.  


  
And in, in all the world, the only man who died and never went to hell  
 was Moses.  
He didn't go to Hades.  
Elijah didn't even die.  
He just went, whoops, he was gone.  
And he wasn't the first man to have that happen.  
There was another one, Enoch, a prophet of God.  
The Bible says he went jogging.  
And just jogged right into heaven.  
 And the family went out looking for him.  
They said, Daddy went jogging.  
Where is it?  
And somebody said, well, the last time we saw him was over there.  
And then somehow he just vanished.  
The Bible says they couldn't find him because God took him.  
Then Moses died.  
Everybody who died went to Hades because salvation hadn't come yet.  
 but not Moses.  
When Moses died, Satan came as usual to take him.  
You know, there's a spiritual body and there's a physical body.  
I hear this.  
So Satan came.  
 to take him to where hell as it's taken everybody else because they were in bondage to him.  
And that's why men had to be born again.  
But when he came, Michael showed up there and said, no way.  
This one is special.  
I'm here to take him.  
Said and said, I'm here to take him.  
And they had an argument there.  
 And Michael finally had it, and he said, the Lord, even the Lord rebukedly.  
Satan took his hands off of Moses.  
And Michael took Moses away.  
So Moses never went to hell.  
Are you still there?  
OK.  
Oh.  


  
 We're talking about Jesus, right?  
In Him dwelled out of fullness of the Godhead bodily.  
And He, I like it when He brings us in.  
I said, who is He and who are we now?  
Now that He's saved us, Christ Jesus came into the world to save us.  
Okay.  
Yes, He saved me, but who am I?  
A solid foundation.  
Now I know who Jesus is, but who am I?  
 Look.  
And ye.  
Ye are complete.  
 in Him, which is the head of all principality.  
Jesus is the head of all principality and power.  
Ye are completing Him in whom also ye are circumcised.  
Ye are circumcised.  
Spiritual circumcision is talking about by the new birds.  
Look at it.  
In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands.  
In the pulling off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.  
I like it.  
 buried with him in baptism.  
When you were baptized in the water, you were buried with him in that baptism.  
Are you hearing this?  
Wearing also, he had risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who had raised him from the dead.  
When you were dipped into that water, it was an act that signified that you believed in the death and burial of Jesus.  
 And when that minister raised you back from the water, that was symbolic of the resurrection.  
Now you have a new life.  
Live the new life in Christ.  
Shout, amen, somebody.  
This is through the faith of the operation of God who had raised him from the dead.  
And you being dead in your sense.  
 And the only circumcision of your flesh hath he, hath he quickened.  
That means made alive together with him.  
God has quickened you together with Christ's.  
Having forgiven you all trespasses.  
 Hallelujah!  
Blood in half the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nearly into his cross.  
The condemnation against us has been known to the cross.  
I like verse 15.  
 and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made public display of them.  
He says, he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it.  
We shall have time for that.  
This is lovely.  
Glory to God.  
Oh, Hallelujah.  
We're talking about our solid foundation.  
 Who Jesus is and what has made us?  
Let's get some more.  
Go back to Colossians chapter 1.  


  
When we read in chapter 1, we started from verse 15, you remember?  
Now let's read from verse 20.  
 We stopped in verse 19, let's read from verse 20.  
Having made peace, now this is about the salvation, okay?  
Having made peace through the blood of his cross, he made peace between us and God.  
He reconciles to God.  
Having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself, by him I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven.  
 And you, that was some time a King Jamesville used to be.  
Earlier, an enemy is in your mind by wicked works.  
You that were so wicked is as yet now God has reconciled.  
Hallelujah.  
Being the body of his flesh through death.  
He's done it.  
This is in the body of his flesh.  
This was the death of Jesus.  
 to present you, hey, he saved us, and now look what he's made us, to present you wholly and unblamable, unblamable?  
You know what that means?  
An unapprovalable in his sight!  
 It doesn't matter what anybody thinks.  
This is what God thinks about you.  
He thinks you are holy.  
He thinks you're unblimmable.  
He thinks you're unapproachable.  
He's presented you to Himself in Christ Jesus.  
Now you can understand why we can be so bold when we pray.  
 Somebody said, how can you just talk to God like that?  
God is so great.  
You are so small.  
How dare you talk to God like that?  
Yes, because He presents me to Himself wholly and unblimmable and unapprovalable.  
He says, in His sight,  
 The way God sees me, not because of what I did or didn't do, but because of what Jesus did.  
Now he has given me the righteousness of Jesus Christ.  
That's what I got, not in my own righteousness, but the righteousness of Jesus Christ.  
How the world needs to hear it.  
And everyone who hears it suddenly finds his stands before the mirror of God.  
 As he hears it, it comes like a mirror.  
And he sees himself in that mirror.  
He hears the gospel.  
He sees himself wholly, unblimmable and unapprovalable.  
He sees himself as the righteousness of God.  
And he says, God, I've been wicked.  
I've been an evil man.  
And God says, but I love you.  
 You're valuable to me.  
I see me.  
With all I've done is his son.  
Don't look at what you've done.  
Look at what I've done.  
And then all you say is, yes, Lord.  
Yes.  
I'm not going to look at what I've done.  
I'm going to look at what you've done.  
It's bigger than what I've done.  
How big is your sin?  
His love is bigger than your sin.  
 Hallelujah.  
Our solid foundation, glory to God.  
How often we need to take our zers, take off our eyes away from what we've done, what we've been, where we've been, what we've got.  
And look at it.  
It reminds me of the man Abraham, a very important  
 experience he had with God.  
Genesis.  
You want to see it?  
Genesis chapter 15.  
And we'll read from verse one.  
After these things, the word of the Lord came onto Abraham.  
Now he was called Abraham and later God changed his name to Abraham.  
So he's talking about the same man, okay?  
 At these things, the word of the Lord came on to Abraham in a vision, saying, fear not Abraham, hallelujah.  
I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.  
And Abraham said, Lord God, what will thou give me?  
Seeing I go childless.  
Understood of my house is this a liaison of Damascus.  


  
 He says, Lord, you can see me.  
I go childless.  
I'm still childless because God had promised him a son before now.  
And he's concerned because God said, your seed will be so many.  
And he says, Lord, it looks like you're not seeing me very well.  
 He says, look at me.  
I'm still childless.  
I want you to see it.  
And Abraham said, he's still talking to God.  
That's verse three.  
He says, behold.  
What is behold?  
Tell me, what is behold?  


  
 He says, look, look, God, to me thou hast given no seed.  
You haven't done it.  
He says, look, you haven't given me any seed.  
And lo, that's another look.  
One born in my house is Monet.  


  
 He's talking about, he's serving the liaison.  
What did God say?  
And behold, the word of the Lord came on to him saying, this shall not be done.  
What he that shall come for out of the own bar shall be done.  
And he brought him for abroad and said, look now toward heaven.  
Oh.  
 Abraham said to God, he said, look at my house.  
It's a liaison.  
That's, that's my, yeah.  
So look at, look at my house.  
And God said, no, took him outside.  
He says, you've been looking at the wrong thing.  
They get it.  
And he brought him forth abroad and said, and said, look now into that house.  
No.  
 Look toward heaven.  
Every time in your life, you have to know where to look.  
Look toward heaven.  
David said, I will look onto the heels from whence come at my head.  
This is my help comes from God.  
Look toward heaven.  
Don't look into your house.  
 to find what you have and say, I don't have this and I don't have that and I don't have that.  
God said, you're looking at the wrong thing.  
He took him outside.  
He said, look toward heaven.  
This is one of the benefits of prayer.  
In prayer, we can really look toward heaven.  


  
That's what I enjoy about prayer.  
Because when I pray,  
 I don't see the impossibilities.  
I don't see the limitations.  
I don't see the problems.  
I see only God.  
In prayer, I really can look toward heaven.  
He says, Abraham, look toward heaven.  
He says, look.  
And when he looked, what he saw was stars, and God said to him, number them.  
 He says, there's too many.  
God said, so shall I see.  
Every time you look toward heaven, you will see the miracle.  
Are you hearing me?  
You see the miracle.  
When you're thinking, who will help me?  
Who will help me?  
God, who will do it for me?  
God will say to you, come outside.  
Look toward heaven.  
 Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
That's a map.  
Wow.  
Wow.  
So number one, our solid foundation.  
Okay?  
And we're talking about what Christ came to do, who He is and who we are.  
 Number two, our solid facts.  
You know, it dawned on me when I wrote these things down that they were all Fs.  
Our solid foundation, our solid facts.  
There are some facts.  
Hallelujah.  
There are some facts that you go through your mind.  
Some facts that should not be forgotten.  
 There are some facts that should be conscious of.  
Number one, the life and nature of God is working in me.  
See, now I know who I am, who has made me.  
He's made me the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  
I'm holding His presence, unapprovalable, unblamable.  
Now, I can see the life and nature of God  
 working in me, really working in me.  
Really?  
You remember the scripture we talked about yesterday in Romans chapter 8 and verse 11.  
He says, if the spirit of him, you remember that?  
Let's look at it again.  
If the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead, if that spirit lives in you,  
 He that raised the price from the dead shall also quicken your model bodies by his spirit.  
Make alive your model bodies.  
If that spirit lives in you, he will vitalize your model body.  
Your model body, debt doomed body, sickness ravaged body,  
 Disease ravage body is as if that spirit that quickened the dead body of Jesus.  
The Bible says the Spirit of God came upon the corpse of Jesus and brought him back to life.  
 He was very dead.  
Remember, a soldier tried to spare through his side in blood and water gushed out, proven he was dead, very dead.  
Jesus was, if he hadn't died before that spare, that spare would have killed him.  
Now he was very dead, and it buried him in the grave.  
But the Holy Ghost came on him.  
And the Holy Ghost is called a glory of the Father.  
 Hallelujah.  
Babylon says he was raised from death by the glory of the Father.  
Oh, Hallelujah.  
The glory of the Father.  
What a name.  
What a description.  
And yet Jesus was called the glory of the Father.  
And the Holy Spirit is called the glory of the Father.  
This is amazing.  
No one that Jesus called the Holy Spirit warned that it's exactly like me.  
 They'll pray the Father, and He'll send you allos paracledos.  
Another one exactly like me to go with you.  
Yes.  
The Holy Spirit raised Jesus from the dead.  
And that Holy Spirit lives in the quarters of your heart.  
He lives in your body.  
The Bible says, in that spirit that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you.  
 He will make alive your dead-dune body.  


  
How?  
Through his presence in you, he says.  
He didn't say when you get to heaven, he says, through his presence in you.  


  
 So I should become conscious that this bird is at work in me.  
The Holy Ghost parablets my body.  
The Holy Ghost is working in me 24 hours a day from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet.  
Every fiber of my being, every bone of my body, every cell of my blood.  
The Holy Spirit is alive in me, working in me.  
 Ah, solid facts.  
This is a fact, brother.  
This is a fact.  
It's happening now.  
It's real now.  
This is real time.  
Glory to God.  
The Holy Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is alive in me and is working in me.  
I've got the life and nature of God at work in me now.  
It's a fact.  
The word says so.  
Hallelujah.  
 It's a fact.  
We're talking about our solid facts.  
These are solid facts.  
These are solid facts.  
They must come into your consciousness.  
These are solid facts.  
In one of our meetings, one of our ministers conferences, a minister walked up to me, he said, I've got a question for you.  
I said, what is it?  
 He said, you preach and teach with a conviction.  
How did you come about this conviction?  
I said, what?  
This is what I believe.  
This is what I know.  
This is what I've got.  
This is what I am.  
It's what I've been in.  
 I said, there's nothing else outside of this.  
This is reality.  
He looked at me, he said, you sounded so when you talked about there.  
I said, yes.  
There's no other way.  
There's no other way.  
It must become your perfect conviction.  
That's why I said, our solid facts.  
These are solid facts.  
They're not questionable.  
 We have passed the realm of assumptions.  
These are no theories.  
These are facts.  
These are laws.  


  
So when I say I've got the life and nature of God in me, I'm not talking about some theory.  
I'm not trying to read up something.  
I'm telling you what is happening in me now, in my spirit, my soul, and my body.  
 These are solid facts.  


  
I ask people, what are your convictions?  
What are your convictions?  
Let's read Colossians chapter 1.  
Let's see.  
 from verse 26, he says, even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations.  
Hallelujah, a mystery.  
He says, but now he's made manifest to his saints, to whom God will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is, he says, this mystery is Christ in you.  
Christ in you, the hope of glory.  
Christ in you.  
Do you know what that means?  
Christ in you.  
 If you come to the consciousness that Christ is truly in you, what will that make you?  
Your reasoning will be different.  
Your language will be different.  
When you have the consciousness of Christ, truly is in you.  
But look at this man of God and what he says.  
 Look at this.  
Whom we preach, talk about Christ.  
Whom we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.  
Oh, look at verse 29.  
Where until I also lay most driving according to his working, which worked in me mightily.  
I said, the life and nature of God is at working me.  
Paul said he was convinced of this.  
He knew.  
 He was conscious that the Christ was at work in him, which worked in me mightily.  
Hallelujah.  
No wonder he cried out in Philippians 4.  
Go there.  
Philippians 4 verse 13.  
You will like this.  


  
 can do all things through Christ, which strengthen at me.  
I'm not a weakling.  
 I'm not a weakling.  
You know, the people who think, well, you know, I really can't do this.  
I'm so weak I can't do that.  
I can't do this.  
I've been sick for so long.  
I've never been able to do anything.  
Everybody knows I don't have any power.  
Everybody knows I'm so weak.  
I can't carry this.  
I can't lift up.  
I can't do this.  
Stop, stop, stop a thousand times.  
Stop.  
Think differently about our solid fact.  
 These are facts.  
These are facts.  
The life and nature of God is at working you.  
 And you say, I can do all things through Christ, which strengthen at me.  
I'm strengthened by the Lord.  
What did David say?  
The Lord is my light and my salvation.  
Whom shall I fear?  
The Lord is the strength of my life.  
Of whom shall I be afraid?  
The Lord is the strength of my life.  
He wasn't looking at his muscles.  
 The Lord is the strength of my life.  
Boy, I'm fixed for life.  
Hallelujah.  
I'll always be a success.  
The Lord is my light in my salvation.  
He is my light.  
There's no darkness around me.  
There's no darkness about my life.  
The Lord is my light in my salvation.  
Hallelujah.  
 You know what he meant by the Lord is my light and my salvation?  
When he said salvation there, he wasn't saying, being saying to a God.  
No, he meant salvation from any trouble, any problem, any crisis.  
He says, the Lord is my light.  
Where is darkness now?  
The Lord is my salvation.  
That's why he said, whom shall I fear?  
The Lord is my salvation.  
 The Lord God is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?  
This is when my enemies and my foes came up against me to eat up my flesh.  
They stumbled and fell.  


  
 The Lord is my light and my salvation.  
The Lord is my light and my salvation.  
He's my salvation.  
Come on, somebody.  
He's my salvation out in the mirror.  
He's my salvation.  
The Lord is a strength of my life.  
 of whom shall I be afraid?  
The Lord is the strength of my life.  
I can do all things through Christ who is tracing at me.  
I'm strengthened by the strength of God.  
I'm not a weakling.  
I'm full of power.  
I'm full of power.  
 And don't look at me like I'm smart.  
I'm full of power.  
Are you hearing me?  
I can't do all things to Christ that strengthens me.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Hundah bhasendalahiah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
I know who I am.  


  
 It's working in me.  
Speaking tongues, speaking tongues, speaking tongues.  
Oh, Gloria God.  
Aye.  
Amen.  
So for a second.  
You know, a lot of people wait.  
 A lot of people wait for trouble to come before they put these things to work.  
So when trouble strikes, they start making their confession.  
 The Lord is my strength.  
You are supposed to have made these confessions.  
You are supposed to have found yourself in these lights.  
You are supposed to have known yourself like this.  
You are supposed to have built this edifice, the spiritual edifice, so that no matter what comes against it brother, he will remain standing.  
Don't wait for trouble to come.  
 Don't wait.  
Hallelujah.  
Then the cancer attacks and then it's recommended.  
Cancer, you must die.  
Cancer, you must leave my body.  
Cancer, you must, you must, you must.  
If you have been talking like this, if you have known this before now, that thing wouldn't make you afraid at all.  


  
 Glory to God.  
Let's get something here.  
This is beautiful.  
Our solid facts.  
Our solid facts.  
Guess what?  
We live in the kingdom now.  
It's a fact.  
It's a fact.  
We don't live on the same street.  
That guy thinks we live on the same street because when we write the addresses, it seems like they are the same.  
No!  
 I live in a different street.  


  
Hallelujah.  
When live in two words, there may be function in Paripasu, but we live in two words.  
There's a spiritual word, and there's a physical word.  
Which one is more real to you?  
 For the cannally minded, the physical world is more real to them.  
They're children of the flesh.  
You know what the Bible says?  
Those who are children of the flesh, it says these are not the children of God.  
The children of the flesh are children of the senses.  
All they know is what their senses tell them.  
If their senses cannot perceive those things, then those things are not true, as far as they're concerned.  
They're children of the flesh.  
 and the children of the flesh, the Bible says, are not the children of God.  
Romans chapter 9, verse 8.  
That is, there which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God.  
For the children of the promise, the children of the word are counted for the seed.  
Did you see that?  
Hallelujah.  
 The children of the flesh are concerned about the things of the flesh.  
That's all they talk about.  
Freshly things, worldly things, carnal things, because they're kind of reminded.  
They're kind of reminded.  
They're not spiritually minded.  


  
Let's talk about that a moment.  
Good or Romans chapter 8, let's begin from verse 5.  
 Romans chapter 8, from verse 5.  
For they that are after the flesh do minded things of the flesh.  
Those who are after the flesh, what?  
Mind the things of the flesh.  
They set their minds, their attention on the things of the flesh.  
But they that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit, verse 6.  
For to be carnally minded is death.  
But to be spiritually minded is life and peace.  
Somebody say, man,  
 Number seven, because the kind of mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.  
It says the kind of mind is not subject to the law of God, and it cannot even be subject to God.  
Look at the next verse, this is terrible.  
So then, they that are in the flesh cannot please God.  
 They that are in the flesh cannot.  
That's the spiritual law.  
Cannot please God.  
Question.  
Are you in the flesh?  
Are you reasoning the flesh or reasoning the spirit?  
So there's a spiritual consciousness that children of God should have.  
Don't be kind of reminded.  
They that are in the flesh cannot please God.  
Hallelujah.  
 The era in the flesh cannot please God.  


  
Don't talk about it.  
Oh, do you know Jesus?  
You still there?  
We live in the kingdom now.  
We do.  
We live there now.  
These are solid facts.  
The facts.  
 Let's look at this.  
Colossians chapter 1.  
Let's read from verse 12.  
We'll live there now.  
I'm there now.  
That should be your confession.  
That should be your testimony.  
You know, we tell people testify.  
And sometimes they don't know what to say.  
Testify, testify, testify of the Word of God in your life.  
Look at it.  
Everybody read, want to go.  
 which had made us meet, that's King James 4, which had qualified us.  
He's qualified us.  
He's made us qualified to be, come on, partake us, uh-huh.  
I like it.  
He's qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.  
Look at the next verse.  
 who hath delivered us from the power from the domain of darkness in hath.  
Look, stop.  
Stop.  
Is this past tense, present tense or future tense?  
Who hath delivered us?  
 I found out a long time ago, when I discovered this scripture, I found out, never, never in my life should I need deliverance from the devil.  
Who hacked the leaver darts from the power of darkness in a hat?  
 is that past tense, present tense of future and have translated us.  
That means transferred us.  
He took us, he blocked us out of Satan's domain and carried us and planted us in the kingdom of his dear son.  
The Greek rendering says, the son of his love.  
I love it.  
 Translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love.  
In fact, the literal translation is love-son.  
Love-son.  
Jesus is God's love-son.  
I like it.  
Translated us.  
Deliver us from translators into.  
That means I was.  
 In that place, blocked out, translated, transferred into.  
Oh, so I am into now queer in the kingdom of his dear son.  
So is that where I am now?  
Yes.  
Do you need deliverance anymore?  
No.  
So what should I do when Satan tries to oppress me?  
 What should I do?  
If I was sleeping in the night time, I felt something press in my chest, and I'm trying to call the name of Jesus, and I'm going, ah, it's like I'm trying, I'm trying, but this, whatever this thing is, is trying to stop me from calling Jesus, and I'm trying until finally lets me go, and I go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,  
 We were delivered from the paradoxes.  
But his devil's been oppressing me.  
I'm really afraid to sleep now.  
Oh, God, please help me.  
No, a thousand times, no, a thousand times, no.  
Are you hearing me?  
Oh, God, I'm staying in my spirit.  
Oh, God.  
You know what the Bible says?  
 Okay, Revelation chapter 12.  
Let's read from verse 9, okay?  
Revelation chapter 12.  
From verse 9.  


  
 And the great dragon, let's talk about Satan.  
The great dragon was cast out.  
That old serpent called the devil and Satan, which deceived the whole world.  
He was cast out into the earth and his angels would cast out wisdom.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
Poor devil.  
Verse 10.  
 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, now is come salvation and strength in the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren.  
Stop, stop.  
This voice was speaking in heaven and it calls us brethren.  
Somebody say hallelujah.  


  
 So we are brethren of the heavenly.  
Look at that.  
 For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.  
Look at the next verse.  
And they, our brethren, they overcame him the devil by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death.  
Somebody shout hallelujah.  
They overcame the devil.  
 By the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony, that's why I tell you every time we have communion, make sure you are there.  
The other king, the devil, by the blood of the lamb.  
Jesus said, do this in remembrance of me.  
This was often, as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death till he comes.  
 When he died, we died with him.  
I hear him.  
When he was buried, we were buried with him.  
When God raised him up, we were raised together with him.  
Satan has no claims anymore.  
The blood speaks.  
The blood speaks my deliverance forever.  
The blood speaks my salvation forever.  
The blood speaks my liberty forever.  
Forever.  
 So every time we celebrate it with the bread and the cup, we say, thanks be unto God for this glorious gospel.  
Hallelujah.  
 He says they overcame the devil by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.  
The word of their testimony.  
So when you're there standing and saying, I don't know why Satan is getting the better part of me.  
I don't know why the devil is not my joy out.  
I don't know why I'm going through all this oppression at the devil.  
I'm so afraid.  
I'm so scared.  
I'm so stop, stop, stop.  
The only way you overcome Satan is by the blood of the lamb and the word of your testimony.  
 So testify.  
And say, even if the devil just pressed you on the bed.  
Now that you're up, you said devil, wherever you are.  


  
See, I'm the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  
I'm born of the Spirit, born of the Word.  
 And he said, oh, you're born of the world?  
Yes.  
You know what that means?  
I am the expression of the word of God.  
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
You know, some people haven't understood that.  
That's one of the facts, one of the solid facts.  
Did you know you are the word of God in flesh?  
You know, sometimes because maybe  
 You know, God's is by people are destroyed because of the lack of knowledge.  
You know who you are?  
These are solid facts.  
First Peter chapter 1, kombarabateki city, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,  
 First Peter chapter 1 verse 23, let's read.  
Being born again, not of corruptible seeds, but of incorruptible by the word of God, which limits and abides forever.  
Did you get that?  
You're born of the word of God.  
If you're born of a cat, you're a cat.  
 Is that correct?  
If you're born of a lion, you're a lion.  
And if you're born of God.  
No one that Jesus said, he are gods.  
And that was difficult for them to understand.  
If you're born of the word, what are you?  
It gets too much for some people.  
 Then question, are you born of God or not?  
Well, I know we're born of God, but we can't just go that far.  
Unbelief.  
Unbelief.  
So who are you?  
Your identity is lost, if you cannot say.  
 that you're born of Him when the Word says so.  
You saw it just now.  
You saw it.  
Didn't you see it?  
Being born against seed now.  
Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the Word of God, which liveeth and abided forever.  
Okay.  
Okay.  
With this in your mind, go to James chapter 1 verse 18.  
James chapter 1 verse 18.  
Look at it.  
 You ready?  
Of his own will, God's own will, begots, that means gave birth, begot he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of fast fruits of his creatures.  
Fast fruits means the best.  
All right?  
It's the best.  
The top crop.  
 The first and the best, that's first truth.  
Of his own will he begot us with the word, the word of truth.  
Okay, now let's look at another one.  
This is marvelous.  
I said you are the manifestation of the word of God.  
Let's see what the apostle said.  
Now we just read, we just read apostle Peter.  
We read apostle James.  
 All right.  
Okay.  
Let's read another puzzle.  
Paul this time.  
Go to second coordinates.  
Who cover up a dig a city?  
Are you in this place?  


  
Chapter three.  


  
 Woo-hoo, from verse two.  
You know, the first time I saw this many years ago, I remember I was just studying, you know, just studying and being, oh, you know, just reading, sometimes you know, you're just reading through and it's like you don't know whether you're seeing it or you're not seeing it, you know.  
Then, uh-uh, did I see that?  
I started looking at every word.  
 What is he talking about?  
Look at it.  
What is an episode?  
What is an episode?  
A written message.  
And it's often called an episode when it is fairly long.  


  
 Are you hearing me?  
It's a written message.  
It's a message.  
God's word to men is a message.  
That's God's word.  
He says the word that came from God, preaching peace by Jesus Christ.  
He is Lord of all.  
That's what's preached to Cornelius, the Romans in two.  
 The word, the message that came from God preaching peace by Jesus Christ.  
Now he says, you are our Epistle written in our hearts, known and read of our men.  
Our Epistle, you think, hey man, are we the Apostles Epistle?  
Isn't that nice?  
That's good, but it gets better.  
Verse three.  
 For as much as He are manifest.  
Look at this.  
For as much as He are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, minister by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in flashy tables of the heart.  
Did you hear that?  
You see, I read it so fast.  
And when you read it on your own so fast, you might just miss it, but look at it.  
 He says, for as much, he says, now he can tell you why he says you are our episode.  
He says, for as much as you are manifestly declared, to be the epistle of Christ, you are the epistle of Christ.  
You are the word of Christ, saints to all men.  
Oh God, it's too much.  
You know, I was reading it, and I said, Lord, it's too much.  
I said, I cried.  
I said, it's too much.  
It's too much.  
I cried.  
Oh God, it's too much.  
 I'm a message.  
It changed my way of thinking.  
I'm a message to all men.  
I'm a message to the world.  
Oh, God, I held my head.  
Oh, God.  
Oh, what an identity.  
I know who I am.  
It put springs in my steps.  
I know who I am.  
I'm a message.  
 I'm not an ordinary man.  
I'm a message.  
Wow.  
I'm the epistle of Christ.  
Christ is the epistle of God.  
Don't you understand what he's talking about?  
He's God's epistle to men.  
And I'm he's a epistle to men.  
No wonder he says, as my father sent me, even so send I you.  


  
 So he was the word made flesh.  
He says, the word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
And that word gave birth to me.  
So I am the word of God in flesh today.  
 So every step that I take in the volume of the book, it is written of me.  
No, I come to do thy will.  
Oh God, this is my life.  
I come to do thy will.  
Listen, stop living for yourself.  
There's a book about you.  
It is written in the volume of the book.  
Your life has been written.  
Stop living your own life.  
Live that life that's been written about you.  
 Do His will.  
He says, I come to do Thy will, O Lord.  
In the volume of the book, He just written of me.  
Every step I take.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm guided of the Lord.  
None of my steps shall slide.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
I'm a victor forever.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Greater is He that is in me.  
Then He that is in the world.  
 I am a success by the power of the living Christ, in the name of Jesus, Hallelujah.  
I am the word of Christ to the nations of the world.  
I know who I am.  
Hallelujah.  
 Yes, no wonder I can stand there and talk to a man who's deaf.  
He's been born deaf in both ears.  
He's never heard anybody, but he hears me when I say, open up in the name of Jesus.  
How can you explain it?  


  
 A woman appeared to testify four years later.  
She said, I was told I had only four months to live.  
And here I am four years later.  
Hallelujah.  
Because you walked into the healing school and received that word.  
Be here.  
Hallelujah.  
I am still there.  
Oh, this is amazing.  
Glory to God.  
 See why I preach the gospel.  
Nothing could be better.  
Nothing could be better.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory.  
Hear this.  
The Spirit of God is working in you.  
You are not an ordinary person.  
Be strong.  
Be strong.  
Be strong.  


  
 Pallelujah.  
Solid facts.  
These are solid facts.  
How you hearing me?  
These are solid facts.  
Unbreakable.  
Solid facts.  
Unchangeable.  
Solid facts.
