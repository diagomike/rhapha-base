title: The Year of the Gathering Clouds
---
 Hallelujah.  
It is a very special year.  
And I want to begin to share with you some important things all over the world.  
So many are tuned in to this meeting right now from all nations.  
 We've got thousands and thousands of outlets reaching out to so many right now.  
And this is a very special hour because the things I'm going to share with you are missiles into the realm of the Spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
In 2020 and 2021,  


  
 I had many programs with you on the platform of your love world specials.  
And that because the Lord was guiding me to encourage you and strengthen you through the Word of God and to inform you, to bring you His Word and inspire you.  
 so that through the Word of God, you'd be propped up and supported and prepared through those days of difficulty.  
And in that light, I said God's Word.  
And I'm sure it helped you.  
Yes, it did.  
It did.  
 And it still will.  
Amen.  
I want to begin reading to you from Ecclesiastes chapter 11 from verse number three.  
Ecclesiastes chapter 11 from verse number three.  
If the clouds be full of rain,  
 They empty themselves upon the earth.  
If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth.  
How true?  
This year, the clouds will be full and begin to empty upon the earth.  


  
 Are you hearing what I'm telling you?  
The clouds of prayer, faith and expectation.  
This year, those clouds will be full and empty themselves.  
Which means that it is a year in which prayer that you have prayed.  
Prayer that you have prayed.  
 The faith that you have expressed, your expectations that have already risen up in the clouds of God this year, they will empty in answers, they will pour out in answers, they will pour out in answers,  


  
 I'm telling you that this 2022, the clouds of prayer, faith and expectation are full and emptying out in the mighty name of Jesus.  
It's a special year.  
In Zechariah chapter 10, the Bible tells us in verse number one, ask ye of the Lord reign  
 in the time of the latter rain.  
So the Lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to everyone grass in the field.  
I want you to notice that it says, ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain.  


  
 The word tells us about the former rain and the latter rain.  
The former rain is also called the early rain.  
That rain is for sowing and the latter rain is for harvest.  
When it says to you, ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain,  
 He's saying it's the rain of harvest.  
That's a very special thing.  
Then it says the Lord shall make bright clouds, bright clouds, and give rain.  
Showers of rain.  
Showers.  
 to everyone grass, not some, but everyone grass, not some, but everyone grass in the field.  


  
This is remarkable because of what this means.  
 In James 5, when you read from verse 7, the word says, Be patient therefore, brethren, on to the coming of the Lord.  
Behold, a husband man waited for the precious foot of the earth and not long patience for it.  
 until he received the early and latter rain.  
Be also patient.  
Establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord.  
Draweth nine.  
So he's telling you that the latter rain just precedes the coming of the Lord.  
 So when you have the ladder rain, what follows is the coming of the Lord.  


  
So it tells us to be patient.  
Be patient.  
Right after the ladder rain, the Lord comes.  
 Hallelujah.  
The Lord comes.  
And this reign, from what we have seen in Zechariah chapter 10, when it says, ask ye of the Lord, reign the time of the Lord.  
The Lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain.  
 It means that there will be a revival and there will be a harvest and following that harvest will be one more thing that you need to see.  
Hallelujah.  
In St.  
John's Gospel.  
 Chapter 11.  


  
From verse 49.  
This was when Jesus was arrested and brought before the priest, the high priest.  
And all these priests surrounded Jesus.  
 The Bible says from verse 49, and one of them named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year said unto them, ye know not in a law, nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not.  
Did you see that?  
Verse 51, I want you all to read verse 51, one to go.  


  
 Did you see that?  
Read it one more time.  
One more time.  
Want to go.  
Now read verse 52.  
Everyone want to go.  


  
 Did you see that?  
First, it says, care has prophesied being the high priest that year that Jesus should die for the nation rather than one that the whole nation should perish.  
And then it says here from verse 52, and not for that nation only, but that also he shall gather together in one  
 the children of God that were scattered abroad.  
So Jesus was God's hand together, together, all the children of God from every nation.  
Hallelujah.  
It was Jesus' work  
 It was Jesus' ministry.  
It was Jesus' destiny to gather together in one, the children of God that was scattered abroad in all nations.  
Now, this is an extraordinary thing that we just read.  
A very, very important verse that we just read.  
 And the Bible tells us that from that day forth, they took counsel together to put Jesus to death.  
But you see, His death was going to make it happen.  
His death was going to make it happen.  
 Remember, he said that if I believed it up, I would draw all men unto me.  
And the lifting up meant his crucifixion.  
So they planned to crucify him, but they didn't realize that that was the fulfillment of the word of prophecy.  
And he will gather together in one, all the children of God that was scattered abroad.  
 Now, 2 Thessalonians chapter 2, chapter 2 and verse number 1.  
Are you following?  
2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 1.  
Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto Him.  


  
 Jesus, I want you to know that the gospel is a method of reaching people.  
It is a message of reaching people.  


  
It is the harvest time to win souls.  
 to reach the nations of the world.  
But there is a purpose.  
We have just seen it.  
His work is to gather together in one.  
Not just to say, I've won them and they are left where they are.  
He will gather them together.  
And so the Lord has appointed a day  
 in which he will gather them together from all nations unto himself.  


  
This is now would be situated by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him.  
And I want you to go to first Thessalonians chapter four.  


  
 And I'm reading from verse 14.  
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with you.  
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.  
 For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.  
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them.  
 in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.  
And so shall we ever be with the Lord.  
We have for comfort one another with these words.  
Jesus therefore came  
 Not just to win people to God, not just to save men.  
He came to gather together all the children of God of all nations.  


  
On to Himself.  
And the Bible says,  
 This gathering is not a gathering on earth, but that the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with His shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and those who have died already,  
 shall rise first.  
They will come out of death first.  
But I want you to notice something that it tells us because when they died, their spirits went to God.  
But their bodies never went there because they returned to dust.  
 But look what the Bible tells us.  
How many of you are here?  
Say, I'm here, Pastor.  
Thank you.  
I want you to look again in verse 14.  
He says, if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,  
 Even so them or so which sleep in Jesus, those who have died in Christ.  
That means Christians who have died.  
Look at it.  
Even so them or so which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him?  


  
You know what he's telling you?  
Their spirits will come with Jesus.  
 and pick up their resurrected bodies.  
Because in the Spirit, they cannot live the full life that God gave them without a body.  
They must have a body.  
And that's the reason for a resurrection.  
And for the body, for them to be men,  
 And not just disembodied spirits, because when a man dies and his spirit goes to God, that's a disembodied spirit.  
Okay?  
That's a disembodied spirit.  
So the Bible says, we'll rather have a body.  
So he gives us a body.  
He says to every seed his own body.  
So when the trumpet sounds as the Bible tells us,  
 Those spirits come with Jesus, and this is so fast in the drinking of an eye.  
So it's not gonna be a process that someone's gonna be watching.  
The Bible says, in a moment, in a moment.  
And I showed you how that there are two trumpets.  
I showed you the first trumpet,  
 When the first trumpet sounds, the dead in Christ will come out of them, out of wherever their bodies were.  
They will come out of death.  
The second trumpet, all of us who are alive and remain, will be cut up  
 Together with them, first trumpet, they come out of the graves, out of death.  
Second trumpet, we join them.  
The Bible says, we go to the clouds.  
We meet the Lord in the air.  
Hallelujah.  
 So this is the gathering together onto Him.  
We will gather together onto Him in the clouds.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
And let me explain something to you about this cloud for a second, because you need to know exactly what this means.  
 I should read that again one more time to you.  
First Thessalonians, chapter four.  
If you look at it in that verse 17, then we, which are alive and remain shall be cut up together with them in the clouds.  
Cut up in the clouds.  
 The Bible tells us how that Peter, James and John were with Jesus in the Mount of Transfiguration.  
And while they were there, Moses and Elijah appeared with Jesus.  
And then it says, and suddenly the cloud of God covered them.  
The cloud of God covered them.  
Now this same cloud,  
 If you would go in your Bible to Exodus chapter 13, from verse 21, and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night.  
That's that same cloud.  
 You go to Exodus chapter 16 and verse number 10.  
Exodus chapter 16 and verse 10.  
And it came to pass as Aaron speak unto the whole congregational children of Israel, that they look to what the wilderness and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the clouds.  
The glory of the Lord appeared in the clouds.  
 And notice something from Exodus chapter 40 and verse 38.  
For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day and fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.  
Think about it.  
And that's for 40 years.  
For 40 years they saw the cloud of God's glory upon the tabernacle.  
 by day and fire was on it by night in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.  
The cloud of the Lord was there.  
Hallelujah.  
This is really significant because you read in Isaiah chapter 63,  


  
 Isaiah chapter 63, from verse 9, in all their affliction, he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them.  
In his love and in his petty, he redeemed them, and he bore them  
 and carried them all the days of old.  
And the next verse tells you that angel of his presence is the Holy Spirit.  
So the Holy Spirit is the angel of God's presence.  
He was the one that was with them in that cloud of glory.  
It was his awesome presence.  
 And then you find the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians chapter 10.  
From verse one, more of a brethren, I would know that you should be ignorant.  
How did all our fathers were under the clouds and all pass through the sea?  
And we're all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.  
Interesting.  
 They were baptized unto Moses.  
King James translation says unto Moses.  
Most of the translations say into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.  
So this presence of God that they saw in the cloud,  


  
 Remarkable experience.  
Remarkable experience.  
Go to 2 Chronicles 5 from verse 1.  
Now I'll give you the background of this and you can read it for yourself later on.  
2 Chronicles 5 from verse 1 all the way to verse 14.  
 On this occasion, Solomon had built the Temple of God.  
And the priests were to take the Ark of God from the Old Tabernacle, which had been read by David.  
 Okay, to bring it into the new temple built by Solomon.  
And so the priests on this day of dedication of the temple brought the Ark of God into the place of the arkle or the most holy place.  
 And when that Ark of God was brought in there, the scriptures specifically tell us that there was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses put there.  
That means the commandments of God.  
That was all that was in the Ark.  
Now, you know, the Ark is an olden chest overlaid with gold.  
 as it brought it into the most holy place with the cherubins of glory over it.  
And all that was there was the commandments of God, meaning that the ark of God housed the word of God.  
And once it was brought into its place,  
 And the Bible tells us the priests, the Levites, they're saying yes, they began to minister to the Lord and sing to praise God and to thank Him.  
As they did it, the Bible says, the glory of God, this cloud, this same cloud of glory filled  
 the temple.  
So much so that the priests could not even stand to carry out their work in the holy place because of the glory of God that filled the temple.  
Two things you must observe there.  
Number one, they brought the ark into its place.  
Number two, the singers,  
 began to sing and to praise and thank the Lord.  
As they were doing this with the Word in its place, the glory of God was manifested.  
Don't forget what I just told you there because you're going to need it.  
Blessed be God.  
I said, blessed be God.  
 Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
What kind of a year are you looking at?  
What kind of a year are you seeing?  
What kind of a year is this?  


  
What is in this year?  
 I have told you before that a year doesn't bring something.  
When we define and determine the years, they are reference points.  
 For example, we are in 2022.  
Some people are sleeping.  
They are still in 2021 in some places in the world.  
And while we just entered, some already had entered, they are 2022.  
And if you go to Ethiopia, they are not in 2022.  
In fact, they are some seven or eight years behind.  
 In Ethiopia, it is 2014.  
Seriously.  
I know some of you didn't know that, but seriously, it's 2014 in Ethiopia.  
Officially, so I don't mean our church.  
It's 2014 in Ethiopia.  
So,  


  
 So it's, and then of course in China, they're gonna wait, they're gonna wait into January or so before they say that they enter a new year.  
So to them it's not yet new year.  
They're gonna wait for some time before they get into new year.  
So what I'm saying is that these are reference points.  
 Not because when the years come and it comes to the package.  
So, you know, people say, I don't know what this year is going to bring.  
Oh, we pray that the year will bring something.  
Uh-uh, uh-uh.  
My brothers and sisters, no, no, no.  
A thousand times, no.  
Don't wait for the year to bring something.  
You better take something into the year.  
Masaka Raba Kottiti.  


  
Did you hear what I said?  


  
 You take something into the year, don't wait for the year to bring something.  


  
And I told you something that's very, very important.  
Do you want to understand this year, what this year is, prophetically?  
 You know, I have to explain to you this message so you can hear it.  
And so you know how to walk in it because of everything that's about to happen.  
2022 is the year of the gathering class.  


  
 The clouds are gathering.  
The clouds are gathering.  
But this is the year of these gathering clouds to fulfill their purpose.  


  
 You know, in these, you have several gathering clouds.  
But my plan tonight is to tell you about the most important gathering clouds.  


  
There are gathering clouds of evil, I must tell you.  
And the Bible speaks of them.  


  
 gathering clouds of unrest, gathering clouds of wickedness that will culminate in some of the most atrocious things that this world has ever known, gathering clouds of war,  
 I told you several months back in 2021 about the polarization of the world.  
Many didn't yet understand the significance of that.  
But if you understand what is happening, there's not only the polarization within communities and homes,  
 which you're seeing in a greater degree than ever before.  
Lots of divisions.  
But if you look at the geopolitics of the world, you would observe a gathering class.  
Why is Europe  
 suddenly nursing anger against China and Russia because of what the Bible says.  
I told you before that China will not agree to go together with Europe.  
I told you because it is written in the scripture  


  
 And Russia also will not join together with Europe.  
Now you're seeing the division stronger than ever.  
Because of what the Bible tells us, China will do.  
And what Europe will be used for through the Antichrist.  


  
 But today, it's not them I want to talk about.  
I will discuss their matter later on.  
There is a more important one, you see.  
And I mean to tell you that there are more important gathering clouds.  
And I say to God's people, don't be moved at all about what the world is doing and what they are thinking.  
Don't even be moved at all.  
 Don't be moved at all.  
Let me show you.  
Manto Coraba Kasateki, Lee Grabaga Darabadi.  
In Isaiah chapter four, I wanted to notice something because I told you how that the kingdom that was first brought to Israel by Jesus,  
 When they rejected that kingdom, he said he will give it to a nation that will bring forth the fruits of it.  
And that nation is this chosen generation, this royal priesthood of the church.  
And it delivered the kingdom to them.  
And after we have run this kingdom, the spiritual kingdom of Jesus Christ, for 2000 years, the calendar will return  
 to the Jewish people to finish up the last week of Daniel's 70 weeks of prophecy.  
All right.  
Now from there, they go into the millennial period.  
But the blessings of the millennial period that they are going to be enjoying are actually the things that have been granted us through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for 2000 years.  


  
 Incidentally, it took so long, and yet many never understood the amazing blessings given to us, but this generation will not miss it.  
There is a determination by the Lord to fulfill His purpose, and for this course am I sent unto you.  
 From verse four in the book of Isaiah chapter four, when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the mister of by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning.  
Look at that.  
So when this happens to them, which was done for us in Christ Jesus 2000 years ago, they just get into that blessing for the millennium.  
 And I told you, I said, you want to know the amazing blessings given to every Christian and given to the Church of Jesus Christ.  
Apart from starting the Epistles, I said, go read what the Bible tells us will happen in the millennial period.  
Because every one of the blessings that they get in the millennium already was given us in Christ Jesus.  
 So the understanding of the millennial reign of Christ would tell you what you could have been enjoying in your life all along.  
Watch this now.  
And the Lord, verse five.  
 will create upon Mashikar Abahaya.  
And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, every dwelling place, and upon her assemblies.  
That means in every church, in every gathering, lekora satabaya.  
You know, a lot of times we talk about where two or three are gathered together in my name, they are mine, the miss of them.  
That's not joke, it's true.  
And what happens in every one of our gatherings,  
 Look at it.  
And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night, upon all the glory shall be a defense.  
The glory of God in your life is a defense.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
 The glory of God in the midst of the church is a defense.  
We are not defenseless.  
Rada bakonda rabakasya.  
This year, there will be an extraordinary manifestation of this glory, like most have never known.  
 And that's why I'm showing you how to let the church of Jesus Christ be a true church instead of a social gathering where people just do the thing they want to do.  
I said, bring the ark into its place.  
And what was all in the ark?  
It was all the word of God.  
Bring it to its place.  
Let the word of God gain the preeminence and let the true worship of God take its place.  
 If you will let the church of God, the assemblies of God be the true assemblies of God, then you will experience the extraordinary.  
The glory of God will be manifested there and the glory will be a defense.  
We are well defended.  


  
No one taking the church for a ride.  
 Mantokora satalabagades.  
Listen to it again.  
And the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion, every dwelling place of Mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and a smoke.  
This cloud separated Israel from Egypt.  
It separated them.  
And the Bible says,  
 It stood between them and was a light to issue and a darkness to Egypt.  
Yeah?  
That cloud is still here today.  
The extraordinary thing about this cloud.  


  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
I want you to look at the scripture.  
In 1 John, chapter 4, verse 4.  
Remember what it says.  
Yea of God, little children, and I've overcome them because, greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.  
 I'm going to show you something in the book of Revelation.  
Now, turn to Revelation chapter 12.  
Can we begin reading from verse nine?  
Revelation chapter 12 from verse nine.  
And the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan.  
In fact, just so you understand exactly what he's talking about.  
He go to verse seven, verse seven.  
 Since there was war in heaven.  
Now, there are three heavens.  
There are three heavens the Bible talks about.  
If you want to understand that, you can go to Second Corinthians chapter 12 from verse one.  
 Second Corinthians chapter 12.  
It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.  
I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.  
I knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago whether in the body I cannot tell or whether out of the body I cannot tell God knew it.  
Such and one caught up to the thought heaven.  
 caught up to the third heaven.  
Now you study about the heavens, you discover they are not four, they are three, okay?  
So he's talking about the third heaven.  
And in Genesis chapter one, where it says, the word says from verse one, in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.  
Now the word for heaven is actually in plural.  
 Okay?  
It's actually in plural.  
So you'd find it in most of the translations as God created the heavens and the earth.  
Okay?  
The Hebrew word is in plural.  
It is just like the word for God here is also plural, Elohim.  
Okay.  
Now,  
 Go back to that Revelation chapter 12 or in verse 7.  
Verse 7.  
And there was war in heaven.  
So which heaven?  
I said, there are three heavens.  
This war was not in the thought heaven.  
 Because the Bible tells us... Now, these three heavens, by the way, let me tell you what they are.  
The first one is the atmospheric heaven.  
Okay?  
The atmospheric heaven.  
The second heaven is the starry or planetary heaven.  
We've got the stars, the planets.  
 The third heaven, and the Bible speaks of all this, okay?  
The third heaven is the heaven of God's throne, where His throne is.  
God's abode, where God's throne is.  
That's the one that Paul was talking about in Second Corinthians chapter 12, the third heaven.  
So here you say there was war.  
 in heaven now this heaven is the heavenlies okay not in God's heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven  
 And the great dragon was cast out.  
That old serpent called the devil and Satan, which deceived the whole world.  
He was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him.  
So they no longer have a place in the atmospheric heaven, they cast out to the earth.  
 And the great dragon was casted out on a servant called the devil and Satan, which is the whole world.  
He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.  
And I heard a loud voice.  
You remember in Isaiah, when you read in chapter 14, when Satan was saying, I will exalt myself about the stars of God.  
He says, I will go beyond the second heaven.  
I'm going to the third heaven.  
That's what he said.  
 You remember that?  
He said, I want to go to the thought heaven.  
I will absorb myself and go beyond the stars of God.  
So he was going to go beyond the planetary heaven.  
He wanted to ascend to the thought heaven, but he was kicked out.  
That's the first casting out.  
And so he found himself has been running things in the atmospheric heaven.  
 But now he will be cast out of there.  
He will be.  
That moment hasn't come yet, but it's coming.  
Let's read.  
And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven.  
 Now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ.  
For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.  
The accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.  
I want you to know this happened during the Great Tribulation period.  
 We were no longer there.  
So it's not us.  
At the time of this war, we're already in heaven.  
Praise God.  
Michael doesn't fight for the church.  
Our angel Michael doesn't fight for the church.  
He fights for Israel.  
 I want you to understand.  
See, how do you know?  
Oh, it's there.  
Daniel chapter 12.  
Let's read from verse one.  
And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince, which standard for the children of thy people.  
Did you see that?  
Okay, you can read the rest of it all the way to verse seven, and it gives you a lot of information.  
 Praise God.  
But here's where we're going.  
Go back to Revelation where we're reading.  
And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, now it's come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.  
And they, our brethren,  
 They overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives onto the death.  
These are the tribulation saints.  
They overcame through the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony.  
Now the word translated testimony is Materia.  
Materia is very important here because  
 of what it actually means, okay?  


  
In 1 John chapter 4, verse 4.  
Listen to what it says.  
See this.  
They had their role, but the fight was done for them by angels.  
 The fight was done for them by angels.  
The angels only fight in our behalf in things we don't know about and things we don't know about and things we don't do anything about.  
In the exercise of our authority in Christ, they don't need to fight.  
 You didn't hear that.  
When you said to a devil a demon in the name of Jesus Christ, out!  
The angels don't need to do anything about that situation.  
Why?  
Because the demon responds to your authority.  
He bows to your authority.  
The angels don't need to do anything.  
The name of Jesus is where the authority is.  
 Are you hearing what I'm telling you?  
This is very important.  
So when Michael the Archangel went into that fight, they were fighting for those who were in a different dispensation than us.  
Because in our dispensation, we already overcame.  
You see it?  
We ate it into the victory of Jesus Christ.  
 He says, look at it.  
Look at it.  
First John chapter four verse four, ye have got little children and have overcome them.  
We're not trying to.  
We're not hoping to.  
How did we overcome them?  
Just because of something.  
We didn't do anything.  
Look at it.  
Because Greta is he that is in you.  
 We have overcome them because greater is heat that is in you.  
You didn't see it.  
Have you seen it?  
Somebody over there saw it.  
It says you have overcome them because greater is heat that is in you than heat that is in the world.  


  
He didn't say if we pray hard enough to overcome them.  
 He didn't say if we command them much, we will overcome them.  
He didn't tell us what to do so that we can overcome them.  
He says, you have overcome them.  
Why?  
Because Christ is in you.  
And Jesus said, cheer up, I have overcome them all.  
The one who already overcame them is inside you.  


  
 Look at 1 John, chapter 5.  
Look at verse number 4.  
For whatsoever is born of God, overcomes the words.  
Le rakabulta barras karabakaya.  
Le ingredi roscobra haatera mahandredigas.  
Whatsoever is born of God, overcomes the words.  
 What so ever is one of God overcomes the words.  
We are not trying to overcome the words.  
We have overcome the words.  
All you have to do is stand up and say I have overcome the words.  


  
 He says, this is the victory.  
Look at it, put it back up there.  
Put it back.  
He says, what so ever is born of God, of a coming the world.  
And this is the victory that will come in the world, even our faith.  
And our faith is expressed in our words and actions.  
And we have released words.  
And we have said the deep state will not take over the world.  
 not why we are still here.  


  
The world belongs to Abraham and his seed.  
And we are the seed of Abraham.  
The Bible says, if you belong to Christ, then are you Abraham's seed and ours according to the promise.  
The world is ours.  
 And we will crisscross this word, dominate this word, by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
No man for beating us.  


  
 Yes, there will be individual persecutions.  
Yes, there will be persecutions of groups of the church from time to time.  
But to put the whole church on the ground, hey, no way.  
We came out of there a long time ago.  
We are not going back on the ground.  
If they are thinking we're going to be hiding and running away, they have another thought to think.  
 Uh-uh!  
No, no, a thousand times no.  
We've gone too far to be quiet.  
La caba de le give her sotiki.  
Listen, I told you, the only reason we're able to do what we're doing today is because we put the devil on our feet.  
That's why.  
That's why.  
 This was not the plan.  
We should have been hiding, running, and saying we are not Christians.  
We are not very sure we are Christians.  
Please, sorry.  
But no.  
La Caba Sataramades.  
I told you, the vaccine project is doomed.  
It's doomed.  
It's doomed.  
They're struggling for nothing.  
 Because as long as we are here, there will be no such mandate.  
As long as we are in this planet, Rakosse, Blakira, Alagron, to break the aragodoske shia.  
It's a joke.  
Who is he that speaks it and it comes to pass?  
When the Lord commands it, it's a joke.  
 We have overthrowned the project.  
We have canceled it.  
We have liquidated it.  
We don't speak in tongues for nothing.  
whatsoever is born of God.  
Overcoming the words.  


  
 We don't fear, they are fear.  
Aya, Marleke Ribusa.  


  
Ah?  
Do you think we speak in tongues for nothing?  


  
 That cloud, that was over Israel, that cloud, the Bible tells us we have this treasure in ethnic vessels.  
That cloud has come to reside in us.  
That angel of God's presence now dwells inside us.  
 I know who I am.  


  
Yeah.  
We are controlling things from the realm of the Spirit.  
No, they are not in charge.  
Don't you hear the name of Jesus?  
Don't you know what that name is?  
 For God has so highly exalted Him.  
I'm giving Him a name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus Christ every knee shoots power!  


  
 It doesn't matter that the parliament said so.  
They power to the name of Jesus.  
It doesn't matter that the executive branch said so.  
They power to the name of Jesus.  
It doesn't matter who their supporters are and their finances.  
They power to the name of Jesus Christ.  
That name is not for nothing.  
When I believed in Jesus, I believed it all in my heart in Jesus Christ.  


  
 So I know in whom I have believed.  


  
He's greater than every title.  
He's greater than every force.  
He's greater than all the armies of the world put together.  
 And He said unto me, as He has said to you, I am with you always, even unto the end of the age.  


  
Listen, we will serve Jesus.  
We will serve God joyfully.  
Nothing can be done about it by anyone.  
 Everything that God has access to do, we will do.  
Everywhere he has access to go, we will go.  
No man forbidding us.  
No power stopping us.  
None can stand against us successfully.

Ecclesiastes chapter 11.  
Ecclesiastes chapter 11.  
 verse number four.  
He that observant the wind shall not sow.  
And he that regarded the clouds shall not reap.  
Don't regard their clouds.  
When you hear their news, their own gathering clouds and how they are putting their forces together.  
 to match against us, to make decrees against us, to try to destroy our work, to try to destroy the church.  
Look at it.  
He that observed the wind shall not sow.  
He that regarded the clouds shall not rip.  
Listen, disregard them.  
Disregard them.  


  
 Don't be, it's not what they said they want to do.  
What they just announced they are doing.  
When you take it, I want to tell you, when you take it, you look at it, maybe it's on the newspaper or it's on your screen or whatever.  
If it's the one that you can hold, like on the newspaper, put it down, say, I neutralize it in Jesus name.  
If it is on your device that you are saying it, you put your hand and say, I neutralize it in Jesus name.  
Pah, kahyarabasiya.  
Don't fear him.  
 Don't pass their news.  
Don't spread their news.  
Only after you have neutralized it, say, I have neutralized it.  
If you want to show it to your brother, say, look at it.  
Look at this, say, but it is neutralized.  
Neutralized, liquidated.  
 I want you to understand what is going on right now.  
The Bible tells us Jesus is the high priest of our confession.  
Everything we say, Jesus takes it.  
Are you hearing me?  
He's the high priest of our confession.  
He's the high priest of our profession.  
So everything we say is used in the kingdom.  
 And it is offered before the Father.  
These words are not empty.  
And when you look at that thing and say, I neutralize it in Jesus' name, Jesus takes it as your confession, as your testimony, as your record.  
He says, this is the record.  
This is the testimony.  
This is the witness.  


  
 So when we say we are at war, we know what we're talking about.  
And we are releasing words, words, words, words, words, words, words.  
They say, oh, in your company, they said so and so, ma shikara, la gabaya de gebosa.  
You say, I counsel it in the name of Jesus Christ.  
I neutralize it in the name of Jesus Christ.  
 And when you have done it, rejoice.  
Will you rejoice?  
Whatever they are saying from that moment, don't care.  
You know what you have done in the spirit.  
You have finished the matter in the spirit.  
You just laugh, laugh, laugh, and laugh, and check it out.  
If anything should come out of your mouth and say, I refuse to fear.  
 I'm born of God.  
I have overcome the words.  
Whatsoever is born of God.  
I'm born of God.  
I have overcome the words.  
I am born of God.  
I have overcome the words.  
The clouds are gathering.  
I said, the clouds are gathering.  
 The most important ones are our clouds.  
And even in the spirit, you have to understand what the Bible says.  
Did you know there are clouds of witnesses?  
Did you know that the Bible talks about individuals as clouds?  
Did you know that?  
Some people are clouds without water.  
 But we are clouds full of water.  
Hallelujah.  
We are full of water.  
Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
And our gathering is not too far away.  
Our gathering on to him is not too far away.  
Are you hearing me?  
It's not too far away.  
 But we are not escaping out of here.  
I am.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
We are living here in victory in the name of Jesus Christ.  
That's how we live here.  
We check out of here in charge.  
We check out under Nogrosipa.  
I am.  


  
No, we're not running away.  
 We're not escaping through the rapture.  
What the father wants to see is how we paralyze the wicked one.  
How we paralyze the forces of darkness.  
We have overcome the words.  
Lift your hands and speak in other tongues.
