title: Increase In Grace
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 The Bible says, in the beginning, this is St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 1 and verse number 1, it says, in the beginning was the Word.  
And the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  


  
He gives  
 preeminence to the world.  


  
The Bible lets us know that God's word is God.  
He emphasizes the infallibility of his world.  
 And then he gave us his word.  
He gave us his word.  
What did I tell you he gave us his word for?  
Can I hear you?  
He gave us his word to what?  
To make us.  
Yeah.  
 Because Jesus Himself is the living Word.  
He is the Word.  
So He gave us the Word to make us His Word.  
We were born of His Word.  
Remember that the Bible is being born again out of corruptible, see, but of incorruptible by the Word of God that leave it and abided forever.  
We were born of the Word of God.  
 So it's not surprising that he would engineer his word to make us his word.  
So that we become the expression of his word.  
 You see, the Word of God that we share with you has the ability, the divine ability to make you an absolute success in everything, an absolute success, incongruable, the message that we share with you.  
 It doesn't matter who that word meets you.  
Doesn't matter what level you are in life when it meets you.  
Doesn't matter how bad your case is when it meets you.  
If you let that word come into you, take a hold of your spirit.  
It'll produce in you what it talks about.  
Alleluia.  
 Glory to His name forever.  
You're producing you what it talks about.  
You just keep taking it in, taking it in, and living by it, acting on it.  
Day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.  
Hallelujah.  
 And nothing in this world can put you down.  
Because the word is dependable.  
Praise the Lord.  
From tonight, I'll begin to share with you along the lines of our message for the year.  
All right?  
 Okay, and this is the year of the sevenfold increase.  
And I want you to say to three people, this is my year of the sevenfold increase.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Praise the Lord.  
Thank you.  


  
 Number one is the increase of grace, right?  
Increase in ability, knowledge, fortunes, wisdom, speed, and accuracy.  
And tonight I'll begin with the first one right there, grace.  
Increase in grace.  
Hallelujah.  
Wow.  
I want us to  
 Look at the Bible first of all in Second Peter chapter number three Second Peter chapter number three You found it Or looking at verse 18  
 What does it say?  


  
 Yeah, it says, but grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, to Him be glory, both now and forever, amen.  
But grow in grace.  
The word grow is taken from a Greek word, oxano.  
It means to give increase, to give increase, to grace.  
 That means increase in grace.  
All right?  
Increase in grace.  
We're talking about grace now.  
Increase in grace.  
You see, notice something.  
He didn't say that God at this point, he didn't say that God would increase the grace, but he said to us to grow in grace.  
Now the Bible also says, and God will make all grace abound towards you.  
 In other words, you've got something to do with it and he's got something to do with it.  
He can make all grace abound towards you.  
But then he says for you to give increase to it.  
In other words, grow in it, in a grace that God has given to you.  
There's something that you have to do.  
Now,  
 Speaking from the Bible, the word grace comes from a Greek word which many of you know carries, all right?  
Carries.  
And, you know, there's a general definition of grace that a lot of people are familiar with.  
You say, what is grace to say on merited favor?  
 But that is from the negative standpoint of the definition of grace.  
Now, there's not a wrong with that.  
I'm just telling you that they're looking at it from the negative standpoint on merited favor.  
I don't deserve it, but he gave it to me.  
He favored me.  
But that is a very limited definition of the word grace.  
 given to us from the Greek background carries.  
Grace actually refers to the divine influence on the heart.  
The divine influence on the heart reflected  
 in life reflected on the outward expression.  
In other words, it is the outworking of an inward influence.  
 It is the outworking of an inward influence.  
The divine influence in your heart.  
Divine, that means it's got to do with deity, God.  
Hallelujah.  
So the Lord impresses upon your heart through his word and the Holy Ghost.  
And then, whatever is deposited,  
 by that influence is seen on the outside.  
It shows itself on the outside.  
It's revealed outside.  
Then we can say like they said about the early church, they said they saw the grace of God.  
 on them, the grace of God.  
They saw the grace of God.  
How can you see the grace of God?  
You only see the outworking of the grace of God.  
It's like saying we saw the wind blowing.  
Well, you really don't see the wind.  
You see the effects of the wind.  
Is that right?  
When you see objects moving and the branches, the leaves of a tree moving this way or that way, you say, oh, it's a strong wind.  
 You see, you can feel it.  
It's the effect really.  
You don't see the wings.  
So the grace of God on its own cannot be seen on teal.  
You see what it produces.  
Hallelujah.  
Now, when  
 when the influence, the divine influence works out within a man's spirit.  
There are things that you see outwardly.  
There are things that are revered on the outside.  
Number one is acceptability.  
 Sometimes I wish every Christian in the world would understand this message.  
It would change so many things about their lives.  
Number one is acceptability.  
Grace, I said, is the divine influence in the heart that reveals  
 It's self and outside.  
You see the outworking of grace.  
You see it in a man's life.  
Number one thing that you see is acceptability.  
Something about that man.  
Something about that woman that pulls you, that attracts you.  
 Now, that doesn't mean everybody's gonna like you, but every well-meaning person will.  
You see, you will have persecutors to be sure.  
Look at Jesus, the Bible said, little children came to him.  
Little children.  
Come on, people heard him gladly.  
Something about grace.  
If this grace  
 It works within you.  
You see, it's a divine infants in your heart and it shows on the outside.  
If it works within you, you would observe one acceptability.  
Sometimes we have people who say they can understand.  
They go for an interview.  
They are disliked or they start a job after two weeks.  
Nobody wants to see them.  
What you need is grace.  
 You need grace, grace in your life.  
Now, this grace we're talking about, I want you to remember, we're not talking at this point of a merited favor, God extending his grace toward me, to receive me, to accept me.  
That's not what we're talking about here.  
That's not what he's increasing.  
 He's given us all of that already.  
And that's what Jesus down here, all right?  
And He died for us and brought us into salvation.  
He already gave us that.  
Now we're talking about grace in your life.  
Grace working through you.  
Alleluia.  
Acceptability.  
Something about you.  
 You might be the new kid on the block, but everybody wants you.  
Something about you.  
Whether you're telling a story, you're singing, you're cleaning, you're sweeping, you're doing whatever it is.  
If that thing follows you, it singles you out.  
It singles you out.  
They just don't know why.  
 They are attracted towards you to give you this contract.  
You might be the least qualified of them all, of all the applicants.  
If grace is working in your life, it looks like they want to give it to you.  
You see, and that's very important.  
 Doesn't matter what job, doesn't matter what it is.  
If that thing works in your life, that's it.  
That's what he's telling us to grow in.  
He says we can grow in it because you see, some of us function in grace to different measures from other people.  
You know what?  
You can turn it on in your life.  
 And another beautiful thing he is, if you use it and use more of it, and use more of it, God can always give you more.  
If you add more to it, and then you use more of it, and use it and use it, then he adds to it.  
And guess what?  
In 2009, God says, I'm increasing it.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Grace, grace, grace.  
 I said it produces in your life acceptability.  
Acceptability, grace.  
They just can't understand why.  
You see that?  
Nature responds.  
Nature responds to you.  
Would grace working in your life?  
 And remember, he said, to grow in it.  
So there are levels.  
How are you hearing this?  
There are levels.  
Some people start out a trade, a business of some sort, and nobody comes to their shop.  
They can't understand why.  
So they think that they need to cast out networks.  
See, if you're a Christian,  
 Don't be negative in your thinking.  
Think positively.  
These are trying to cast out devils looking for the demon that's troubling you.  
Why don't you increase the price?  
Somebody said, I can understand.  
I haven't gotten a promotion for several years.  
What are you waiting for?  
This is the thing that does it.  
This is what does it?  
 I've been tremendously graced.  
I'm telling you, I've been tremendously graced.  
I can't... I don't know how to put it in words to anybody.  
So, you know, a lot of times you hear me say, my life is forward and upward.  
Right?  
Because of grace.  
 The grace is abundant.  
And he just orgies me on.  
He just, you know, it just takes me on.  
More and more grace.  
More and more grace.  
This thing works within me.  
There's no demon hatched out of hell that knows how to stop it because it doesn't stop.  
 Hallelujah.  
And my responsibility is to grow in it.  
Take advantage of it.  
You see, Paul wrote a letter to Timothy and he says, stand strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.  
Take advantage of it.  
That's what the world says.  
Take advantage of it.  
If I get into anything, it's got to grow.  
 It's got to multiply.  
It's got to produce results.  
It's got to.  
It cannot fail.  
Why?  
Because I only get involved in something if the grace of God is going to be involved in it.  
You see that?  
So I get into it, waste the grace of God, grace.  
I take advantage of that grace.  
Are you getting it?  
 Say to somebody, grace.  
Grace produces acceptability.  
Say it again.  
One more time.  
See, the people who don't understand some of these kind of things, they mean well.  
They are honest.  
They are willing.  
They try to do something nice to other people, and they're always rewarded with  
 hatred.  
You know, after all you've done, they don't like you.  
After all you've done, the pay you were evil.  
And then you feel frustrated.  
You don't know what you're going to do.  
 Now, if I ever get repaid with evil by somebody that I've treated with, I never care.  
You know why?  
I only get greater.  
I never care.  
Because, you know, I taught you something a few years ago.  
I would say to you, say this, I may be here today, but come and see me tomorrow.  
 See?  
Because if you give a little time between now and the next time you see me, the next time you see me.  
You see, I keep going higher and higher and higher and higher.  
I just keep going higher.  
Why?  
Grace.  
Just about Grace.  
 That's what it is.  
That's what it is.  
Grace.  
See, the race is not to the swift.  
And the battle is not to the strong.  


  
It's when that man walks in at the opportune time.  
And that's what Grace does for you.  
Grace locates you.  
 brings you in at just the right time.  
Just the right time.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Just the right time.  
Glory to God.  
Look at that scripture again.  
It says, but to grow up in grace.  
Say, grow in grace.  
 Hallelujah.  
Grace brings you what?  
Acceptability.  
Number two, it brings you benefits, advantage.  
Grace gives you the advantage.  
Did you hear that?  
The advantage.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 The advantage.  
Grace gives you the advantage.  
The advantage.  
Back in the university, I remember telling my classmates, I said something to them.  
I said, I'm 10 years ahead of you.  
I didn't know then that it was more than 10 years, you see.  
At that time, that was what my fate could peak.  
So I said, I'm 10 years ahead of you.  
So what do you mean?  
I said, I'm 10 years ahead of you.  
But that's what I said back then.  
 But that was grace.  
Because I said, all the things you're going to be struggling for in life, I already have them laid up.  


  
First year, that's my first year in school.  
Just a young kid, yeah?  
Well, that's what I said to.  
That's what grace does for you.  
Grace gives you the advantage.  
 the advantage.  
Now, accept your conscious of it, it will not work.  


  
I hear me.  
See, just because it's in the Bible doesn't mean it's going to work.  
See?  
There are things that just don't work because they exist.  
 Now, are you listening to this?  
Just because it's in the Bible doesn't mean it's going to work.  
First, you've got to be conscious of it.  
You've got to recognize it.  
Say this again, I got grace working for me.  
Working for me and working in me.  
 Grace, you see, grace, you see, beautifies your spirit.  
You see, because grace is the glory of God working in a man's spirit.  
Grace beautifies your spirit.  
It is the glory of God working in a man's spirit.  
And you know what?  
If that grace beautifies your spirit, it will show on the outside.  
 It was showing the outside.  
You see the glory of God in your life.  
You know, that's where that song really came from.  
You know, I can see in you the glory of the Lord.  
Yes, I love you with the love of the Lord.  
I can see in you the glory of the Lord.  
So in you, I can see in you the glory of the Lord.  
 What part of you did I see that glory in your intestines?  
So, the trying to say something.  
The song is communicating a spiritual truth.  
So they're not talking about trying to look into your body.  
They're talking about the glory of God, but this is the beauty of the spirits.  
 I can see in you the glory of the Lord.  
Yes, I love you with the love of the Lord.  
I can see in you.  
Can you see it in you?  
Yes.  
Can you see it in anybody else?  
Yes.  
You sure?  
Yes.  
You know, if you can't recognize the grace of God and somebody else, chances are you don't know it at all.  
And so you can't recognize it in your life.  
 I know when I see the glory of God, the grace of God in somebody's life.  
I know.  
I know because that's where I walk.  
I know.  
I know.  
I know when I see it.  
I never work against it.  
I never work against it.  
You work against it, you are done for.  
See?  
It says, anyone who falls on this stone shall be broken.  
 I mean, whichever way you work against it, whichever way you're in trouble, you fall against it, you break.  
If it descends on you, grinds you to power.  
He said, solve, solve.  
Why persecute this doubt, me?  
It is hard for you to kick against the brakes.  
He said, it is hard.  
What you're doing is terrible for you.  
 And God wasn't angry.  
Jesus wasn't angry at him.  
Here's the one kicking against Christ.  
And the Lord said, look, you fall against this stone, you get broken.  
I'm not even angry.  
If I get angry at you, you begrown to power them.  
Alleluia.  
So grace gives you acceptability, and grace gives you the advantage.  
 the advantage.  
Somebody's trying to sell something.  
Two years you've been holding it, trying to sell it, nobody's buying it.  
And yet this thing is good, but nobody's buying it.  
Now what you need is grace.  
Grace.  
With grace.  


  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
 Then, favor.  
Grace brings you favor.  
Isn't that amazing?  
We're talking about favor, and yet, you know, it's one of the definitions of grace itself.  
But brings you favor.  
And that is akin to the advantage that it gives to you.  
Favor.  
 Fable.  
Who are you?  
What everybody is looking for?  
God gives it to you.  
They call you.  
Oh, that's a queuing up wedding for it.  
Somebody second the telephone to ask for you from a farm.  
Say with me, I got this thing working in need.  


  
 What the hell is there?  
Applying, pleading, crying?  
Trying to get all the connections working?  


  
Glory to God.  
Favour.  
It gives you favour.  
If you're working with somebody, it gives you favour with the boss.  
 You just have favor with the boss.  
Not because you try to do anything.  
But this thing is working.  
Gives you favor with your seniors, gives you favor with your juniors.  
It's amazing.  
He walked in Jesus.  
Barbara says he had favor with God and with men.  
 favor.  
Hallelujah.  
Look around and say, hey, get this thing working in you.  
Look around.  
He said, Hallelujah.  
You know, I'm trying to think, is there somebody here?  


  
 Favor.  
Good is turned towards you.  
You see that?  
It's turned towards you.  
And when you go wrong, forgiveness seems to be abundantly available.  
The other guy that doesn't have it, who paid dearly for his errors,  
 And his mistakes are not as grievous as yours.  


  
Then they say, I don't understand.  
This world is in balance, in society.  
Somebody said favor is not fair.  
And it's true.  
Favor is not fair.  
Doesn't play fair.  
Favor doesn't play fair.  


  
 See, there are five of us qualified.  
Let me tell you something.  
It's not everybody who you find that is rich that stole money to be rich.  
Are you listening to me?  
And not everybody who got that job paid somebody money to get it.  
It's not everybody.  
Some people walk in divine influence.  
Divine.  
 Divine.  
Fiver is working for me.  
I'm divinely favored.  
Favourite of the Lord.  
I am the favored of the Lord.  
I'm favored big.  
Sit again.  
I'm favored big.  
Hallelujah.  
 Glory to God.  
Let me let you into a divine secret.  
Do you know, as I'm sharing with you ministering to you right now, favor is being increased, grace is being increased in your life.  
That's what it is.  
Hallelujah.  
 You see, it's one of those things that the Spirit of God called me to do, all right?  
Now you look at these fingers, it was not our choice to make this a thumb who were born that way, right?  
It wasn't our choice to make this look like this and this like this and this like this, right?  
They're not the same.  
 the band in different ways, and that's God's choice, right?  
In the same way, he called some of us and gave us something to give.  
One of the things that the Spirit of God raised me with and anointed me with was not only to teach and preach, but uniquely  
 to while communicating knowledge to impact also what it talks about.  
For example, if I start talking about healing, people start getting healed.  
While I'm still talking about healing.  
If I'm explaining faith, people don't just understand faith, which is beautiful, but why they understand in faith their faith grows.  
 faith is impotent.  
So why share an ungrace with you?  
So that's what happens.  
See, you see, I had to tell you, I had to tell you so that you'd be awake to it and receive it into your spirit.  
 receive it into your spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Glory to God.  
All right, so we say grace brings acceptability and grace gives the advantage.  
Hallelujah.  
And now we say grace also does what?  
Brings you favor.  
Fable.  
Fable.  
 Never say things like, well, we don't know if we'll ever get to our tongue.  
No, you are not ordinary.  
You're not like the others.  
You were chosen.  
Chosen for favor.  
You're chosen differently.  
You start understanding, if I go to that place, I'll get it.  
If I go up there, I'll get it.  
 Because favor works in me.  
Favor works in me.  
You know, I have the mentality.  
If I ever want anything, I'll get it.  
Anything, anything, anything.  
I better not want it if I don't want it.  
See, because if I do, it's coming.  


  
 It's favor, favor.  
Maybe you need to understand something about your heavenly father.  
He wants the whole world to know how much he loves you.  
I wanted to get that.  
It's so important.  
He wants the whole world to know that he loves you so much.  
He wants the whole world to know.  
 That's what the Bible says.  
He likes to prove his love for you to the whole world.  
He wants every, he boasts of you.  
Now you say me with all my stupidity, with all my mistakes.  
Get this straight.  
He is the, I am, and you are the, in him.  
 You are in Him.  
You're in Him.  
He sees you covered in Christ.  
He sees the end from the beginning and from ancient times, things not yet done.  
He sees what the Word will make of you.  
So all he says is, yield to my Word.  
 work in my world.  
That's all he's calling for.  
Hallelujah.  
Did you get the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the  
 There are many people who never let joy work out through them.  
But when grace, when grace functions in you, it will also reveal itself in joy.  
It's called joy unspeakable and full of glory.  
It means joy indescribable.  
Joy indescribable, unfathomable.  
They can't understand why that God is so joyful.  
 Didn't know why.  
Your life is always up there, up, up, up, up, up, up.  
It's because of what's on the inside.  
You know, a lot of people you always have to ask me, what's the matter?  
You know, they're always looking sad.  
They're looking like, you know, the whole world has broken down.  
No.  
 No, if the Spirit of God works within you, inside will be joy unspeakable and full of glory.  
It will show on the outside.  
It will show.  
The people who have worried look.  
You can tell, they're worried.  
And they don't mind telling you, I'm very worried.  
 I'm very worried.  
In fact, I'm very worried about this.  
I'm very, very worried.  
You're very worried no wonder your life is like this.  
And you see, what you're worried about controls your life.  
No, I don't get worried because the Word of God says for me to worry not.  
He says be anxious for nothing.  
 Have no anxiety about anything, anything.  
Have no anxiety.  
When news comes to you about something, be composed.  
Because before it ever came to you, your father knew.  
Your father knew.  
He didn't hear age when you heard it.  


  
 You know, I got this, you know, the Word of God gives us a way of thinking, all right?  
Now, my way of thinking about anything is that whatever happens already happened.  
 You see it?  
In other words, God already saw it because he lives in eternity.  
He already knew everything about it and I just got to find out.  
So what?  
He's got the answers.  
So all I have to do is wait for the answer.  
How did he find the way out of it?  
How did he?  
 How did he, because he already knew about it and knew the answer before I was born?  
Don't you understand who he is?  
So if you trust him, you'd not be worried.  
He said, Lord, you already knew about this, then before I ever happened on the scene.  
So how do we get out of this?  
 Lord, what's the way you produce for this thing?  
How did you solve it?  
Because the answer, oh, glory to God.  
You know, a few years ago, I told you something.  
I said that the answer to every problem comes with the problem.  
In other words, every problem comes with the seed of his own answer.  
No problem ever comes to you.  
 except it came with the answer.  
Did you catch that?  
The answer, the solution is there.  
It's in the problem.  
It came to you because you are the one that had the solution.  
Problems gravitate towards their solutions.  
Get that idea.  
 They gravitate towards their solutions.  
And when a problem comes to you, it's because you are the one wheeled in the answer.  
Oh my!  
Oh, I wish everybody could catch this thing.  
Why are you in that problem?  
Because God gave you the solution.  
You've got it.  
You've got it.  
Your life has to be a testimony.  
The bigger the problem, the bigger the testimony.  
 So instead of worrying and worrying about, I don't know how I'm going to do.  
I don't know how I'm going to do this mess.  
Hey, stop.  
Stop.  
Where is the answer?  
How?  
Okay.  
What is the answer?  
Then the spirit says, look inside.  
Look inside.  
Because inside you from the heart have the issues of life.  
Out of your heart have the issues of life.  
 Your spirit works like a fountain.  
From there, all the answers come out.  
The Bible says, the spirit of man is a candle of the Lord, searching the inward parts of the belly.  
The spirit of man, your spirit is where the light of God is.  
Hallelujah.  
Did you catch that?  
 Joy, joy, grace brings joy, grace brings joy, joy.  
Did you know if you prayed in the Holy Ghost and took your mind away from all of those problems before long, you'd be laughing in the spirit.  
Now why does it bring that laughter to your spirit?  
Because that's the state of your spirits.  
 And when you receive that laughter within your spirit, don't stop and then go back to what you used to be.  
Sad, unhappy, worried about all these things.  
You're worried about this and that, your problems are many.  
I said, Lord, I have many problems, many problems.  
I don't even know where to start from.  
Oh, it's a confusion.  
I don't even know where to start from.  
 You don't even, I don't know who to tell.  
What I'm going to, I don't know who to tell.  
You don't know who to tell.  
You don't need to tell anybody.  
Solve the problem.  
Solve it.  
Then you're in it so that your testimony can be heard.  
Hallelujah.  
Yaw.  
Yaw.  
Yaw.  
 Joy.  
Joy brings what?  
Gladness.  
You get it?  
Gladness.  
Happiness is one of them, one of the characteristics of joy.  
The joy is a big word.  
Laughter is in joy.  
You see that?  
Gladness, happiness, laughter, they're in joy.  
When you're joyful, you'll have these three.  
Gladness of hearts.  
 lightness of spirits, that heaviness is removed.  
He got laughter.  
Amen?  
Laughter.  
It's there.  
Then happiness.  
That's why each one of these is less than joy, because joy has all of them.  
 We sing that old song years ago.  
I got joy like a river, joy like a river, joy like a river in my soul.  
I got joy like a river, joy like a river, joy like a river, joy like a river in my soul.  
You sing it?  
Joy like a river in my soul.  
I got joy, joy.  
 Like a river!  
Flowing, flowing, flowing!  
Glory, hallelujah!  
Flowing!  
God!  
You know, sometimes, especially, you know, in my room, I've got a winner.  
That's it!  
Woo!  
Glory to God!  
And I'm doing all that running in my room.  
 I'm just, you know, I got my door shut and I'm like, whoa!  
Oh, glory to God!  
I take another run.  
Then, oh, thank you.  
Oh, glory to God!  


  
You know, I'm not, I'm not, um, some of you are physically big.  
You understand what I mean?  
Somewhat large.  
So, since I'm not that large, sometimes I go, oh, glory to God!  
Woo!  


  
 Hallelujah!  
Hallelujah!  
Hallelujah!  
John!  
I don't wait for somebody to make me happy.  
You know, some people, if they're not, they're sad about something, you turn on the TV and they're  
 looking for some comedian to make them happen.  
They want to forget their sorrows from them.  
But that doesn't work.  
Life is spiritual.  
And we're talking about something that wins.  
Not something that just happens for the now and then later you pick up the problem from where you left off and you know, just recycle the whole thing.  
No!  
 in your prayer.  
Your.  
Your.  
Because you know, even when there was a problem to deal with and you had to pray about it, after you have prayed.  
Won't you leave the thing for God?  
How can you pray and still get up worried?  
 Then tomorrow you pray again, the same thing.  
So what's up and say, I'm praying about each brother.  
You're praying about it?  
You don't look like God hurts you.  
Did he hear you?  
I believe he heard you believe.  
You don't know if he did.  
Did God hear you?  
I think so.  
You think so?  
Jesus said, when you pray, believe.  
 When do you believe when you pray?  
Believe works that you receive them and you shall have them.  
That's what he said.  
You know sometimes we pray like I remember one time I was praying a few years ago.  
I believe that was somewhere  
 Maybe 92.93 somewhere, a spring, praying about something, just almost worrying myself about it.  
And after praying for a while, I decided maybe I need to add some more.  
So I'm going to my room and now I'm going to fast now.  
 So because I needed to really get God to understand.  
But this thing is serious.  
You know, I need His attention to, you know, because He didn't seem to be seeing anything.  
So I got ready to pray.  
As I got ready, I heard, what do you want?  
I thought, I've been praying about this thing for several days.  
Does He not understand?  
I thought, what's that?  
I tried again.  
 He said, what do you want?  
Oh, I thought, I want to then suddenly I was in the spirit and the Lord said, he didn't say any, he just did like this.  
Go.  
Go.  
I should just go.  
 He said, because there's no problem.  
Go!  
Go and do what you're doing.  
He did something very similar one time.  
I believe I mentioned that, oh, that was an issue.  
I lay down and the Spirit of God came right close to me.  
He said, get up.  
Go and do your work.  


  
 Oh, I shouldn't worry.  
See, let me tell you something.  
God has never allowed me to worry.  
I would have liked to worry because worrying... You see, worrying, you see, the luxury of worrying is enjoyable.  
I remember, you know what, years ago while still in my parents' home,  
 They couldn't understand how someone would not know his problem.  
They called me once.  
My dad said, sit down there.  
When somebody doesn't know what worries him, he said, he's very bad.  
That means that the person really has a problem.  
He said, don't know what your problem is.  


  
 When I left there, I went to my room and told God, do I have it properly?  
You know, what do you see?  
Because the way of faith is different.  
The way of faith is different.  
He says, count it all joy when you go through diverse tests.  
Count it all joy.  
If you're not learning the things of God, you count it all worry when you go through diverse tests.  
 Don't you know what I'm going to?  
You wouldn't even allow anybody to be happy around you.  
Once you come home, even if they're watching TV, they put it off.  
I mean, because Mr. Warrior has come.  
And when you walk in, you are really like... Who put on this radio?  
They put it off, put it off, put it off.  
You want everything off, the air seat off, everything off, not nice around you.  
It's just... Yes.  
 You influence the whole house with your worry atmosphere.  
Man, you call everyone, let's pray.  
With your worry.  
Let's pray.  
Let's pray.  


  
You know what?  
 I remember several years ago, this was sometime 1986.  
A friend that used to know me, because I used to boy, I could preach hearts.  
I'd preach, I'd preach a few God-owned people, if I was true with you.  
If you hadn't done that crying, I wouldn't let you go.  
 I believe the meeting was tough and hot when people were really over their scenes and they... I said, pray!  
Pray!  


  
Sometimes we come in and say, the reason they're not enough miracles, we're not seeing a lot of miracles,  
 He's because a lot of you are not living right.  
That's why nothing miracles.  
Everybody is true.  
Every time I was through with them, serious things.  
Imagine when in the house of God, no prophecy.  
No prophecy.  
Tomorrow, we'll begin a series of fast and prayers.  
And ready.  
 We were working on tea.  
The spirit of God opened the eyes.  
Oh, the gospel of Jesus Christ, gospel.  
Good news.  
Oh, he gave them beautiful ashes.  
 He gave them the oil of joy for money, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.  
I was acquainted with the spirit of heaviness.  
We went on on like Jeremiah of old.  
But now I found now what the gospel brought was different.  
 A friend of mine came to see me when I changed.  
And when I changed, I was seeing miracles every day.  
I was seeing people giving their hearts to Christ every day.  
People receiving the Holy Ghost, everything changed.  
I said, is this what the core revival is?  
It's an everyday experience.  
It was a revival I had read of.  
The things I had read of.  
And they said, pray, pray, pray.  
John Wesley said, you have to pray, pray, pray, pray, pray to get it.  
 Charles Finney said, you move, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, pray.  
And I was finding what they got, but I was no satisfied.  
I was seeing the kind of thing for the professor of greater days.  
And I didn't see in Charles Wesley, John Wesley's ministry.  
I didn't see blind eyes open.  
I studied the ministry.  
 I didn't see deaf ears on stuff.  
I didn't see lame rising to walk.  
But people get their lives to Christ.  
I said, there's nothing else.  
I'm seeing people giving their lives to God.  
Charles Finney's own, each time he preached the word, somebody fell down there.  
Another person fell down there.  
I was seeing this much more than what they described.  
But I was no satisfied.  
 I said they had to be more, so I thought that I should do more of what they said.  
I didn't see that something was missing from what they did.  
Until I studied the scripture, I saw what was missing.  
Then I said, no, I get all of it.  
I don't want to let anything go.  
All the prayer they talked about, I will have.  
All the fasting they talked about, I will have, but there's more.  
There's more.  
He was more than praying.  
 There's more.  
There's a love walk for the child of God.  
That's difference.  
There's a love walk.  
That's difference.  
That brings people out of their burdens, brings people out of their sicknesses, out of their diseases, love that brings them out of their tears.  
That love is different.  
But how can you transmit it if it doesn't work through you?  
 How can you give somebody joy if your joy cannot be seen?  
Then I found out that when I prayed, I found myself dancing in the Spirit, but when I came and I met the people, I was stiff like this and talking like this and up like this, but I couldn't pray with that same thing that I enjoyed in my prayer.  
 until God said, I show you these things so that you can live in them.  
Then I act to you with the poke of recognition.  
And I became free.  
 I could say praise the Lord and allow that joy to flow from me out.  
I could dance in the spirits, outwardly there, there where there were in a fountain as I danced in the Holy Ghost.  
Somebody else was dancing in the Holy Ghost and the next was dancing in the Holy Ghost.  
And then somebody who was blind began to see, someone who was lame got up to walk.  
Miracles just, oh boy, I said, my goodness.  
 the release of the spirits.  
Listen, the Bible says, where the spirit of the Lord is, there's liberty.  
There's liberty.  
People are not stiff and afraid to operate.  
Where the spirit of God is, there's liberty.  
You find you can run as a glory of God.  
Hallelujah.  
Right there.  
 You're no longer like this.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
You know, being concerned about who's there.  
You are free.  
You're released.  
Oh, you're born to prophesy.  
The prophecy we were fasting and praying for one or two persons to prophesy.  
 Suddenly, the move of the Spirit changed it.  
People were queuing up, wetting their tongue to prophesy.  
Everybody received the gift.  
People began to see visions, revelations, things changed.  
I changed my preaching to.  
Hallelujah.  
So I'm coming as a glory to God!  
Wow.  
This is what someone said to me.  
 It looks like you're not as... I knew what he was going to say, because we knew each other.  
We preached the same thing.  
He said you're not as a born born.  
He was... He was at a loss to find words to explain.  
I don't know how to put it.  
You seem to be...  
 too friendly with the brethren.  
I said, can you explain?  
He said, you know, there was this.  
I said, I know what you mean.  
I said, I know what you mean.  
But God took it away from me.  
Guess what?  
He didn't quite listen to that.  
He wasn't sure.  
That was 1986.  
 All right, as I've two years ago, he was still looking for somebody begging somebody for 30,000 now.  
That's a guy that we were preaching together, two years ago.  
He's still publicistic, started to judge and close, started to judge and close.  
And looking for a job,  
 I mean, his life is just not together because he couldn't understand this and wanted to go the other way.  
But the other way has got a problem because that thing is not real.  
It's just some stiff people trying to make other people stiff.  
That's what it's all about.  
It's just some people with self accusation trying to accuse other people so that they can all remain at a certain level.  
 Those who are not free, don't like others to be free.  
You see it?  
Joy.  
The grace of God brings joy.  
Peter called it joy unspeakable.  
Joy indescribable, unfathomable.  
This joy unspeakable and full of glory.  
It is full of glory.  
It is full of glory.  
Joy.  
 You are not spiritual just because you look serious.  
That's the point.  
I'm sure you're getting it now.  
But just because you're looking serious doesn't mean you're spiritual.  
And those who laugh, you'd think they're kind of, that's why they laugh.  
 No, have you ever seen me laugh like a fool?  
No?  
So it doesn't mean that when you laugh something's wrong with you.  
No, but I believe in laughter says you're unspeakable full of glory.  
My laughter is full of glory.  
Are you listening to me?  
No, I laugh with the difference.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Hey, go with a gun.  
The next one.  
Liberality.  
 You see, he brings liberality into your life.  
What I call it is giving and receiving.  
I'll explain that.  
Liberality.  
Meaning that grace, working in your spirit, causes you, it opens a channel.  
What we call a two-way channel.  
A giving and receiving channel.  
A giving and receiving inspiration.  
You see that?  
 Grace working in you causes you to release.  
It's a grace.  
Giving is a grace.  
It's not everybody that works in it.  
You say, how can you give such, how can you give such a mount to God?  
They won't even say, God, they say, how can you give such a mount to church?  
They see it as church.  
You know, canal, they say, how can you give such a mount to church?  
But it's a grace.  
 When that grace works in you, suddenly he opens up what you call giving and receiving liberality.  
Now, when he opens up that capacity to give, an inspiration to give, it equally because it never, giving never comes without receiving.  
You see that?  
Once that release is made, he opens up your capacity to receive.  
You see that?  
 Liberality, a two-way channel, giving and receiving.  
You find your spirit, you just love to give.  
It excites you to give.  
It excites you.  
It excites you.  
 All the time you're thinking, who am I gonna give this thing to?  
Glory to God.  
I wanna give, I wanna give, I wanna give.  
Sometimes you're looking forward to going for service.  
Why?  
You have a seat, you want the plans.  
You just want to give.  
You're looking forward to a service.  
What time is the service starting?  
As if you didn't know, you're like, when is the service starting?  
It's working in you.  
 Because also God has produced within your spirit that capacity to receive.  
Giving is a grace.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Say thank you Lord Jesus.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
You know, a lot of times when God is guiding your spirit to give,  
 You may not even know why.  
You may not even know why.  
But you have to learn to create a ministry within.  
A ministry of giving.  
Are you hearing me?  
That is when you've lifted... Look at it, it's like this.  
First there is a calling.  
A grace.  
The grace calls you.  
 your chords through grace.  
And then with that calling, you're learning, you're learning, learning on the work.  
Then you find yourself a servant of the first, at the beginning order.  
So you are serving at the beginning order.  
Then you come to a servant of a higher order.  
Okay?  
 you are able to perceive and even guide others while you're doing it yourself.  
Then it grows into the ministry.  
Let me put it like this.  
If you're faithful in a simple gift of the Spirit, that gift would eventually create a ministry  
 A ministry here is not an organization.  
A ministry is a continuous, consistent and spiritually systematic way of serving by the Holy Ghost.  
Are you hearing me?  
Giving is the same.  
You can graduate in giving until you become a minister in giving.  
 When you become a minister in giving, what happens is this?  
You have come to that level.  
Let me look at, let me understand this.  
First, there is a gift of the Spirit.  
Okay?  
Now, I find myself, I wait.  
And if that gift is working in me, I will minister.  
Okay?  
Maybe to the sick.  
Even a gift of prophecy.  
I can, maybe if it comes.  
All right?  
But you graduate to that another level.  
 Get to another level.  
If I wanted to receive a word of prophecy for anybody here, he wouldn't take me long.  
He wouldn't take me long.  
Now, before I couldn't do that, see, I started out from somewhere.  
The inspiration would come if the inspiration came, great.  
If it didn't come, but it has become a ministry.  
 Which means I have been given the keys, the tools, all right?  
To receive a word for someone or for a group of people.  
You see that?  
The tools to receive that word because it is a ministry.  
I'm called into that ministry and I've been given that ministry.  
The same thing with healing.  
I can tell somebody comments to me on Tuesday.  
 it will be over.  
How do I know that that thing will work on Tuesday because it has become a ministry?  
You see that?  
It has become a ministry and I'm given the tools to make that available.  
And all I need will be that man's face, that woman's face.  
So I don't try to control faith.  
 I don't try, you know, to, like, wait for that ministry.  
Because now it's working.  
It's an everyday thing.  
Every time I'm in the Spirit, it works.  
Can you see that?  
And I often am expected to be in the Spirit.  
Anytime, anywhere, any day.  
Are you getting what I'm telling you?  
Glory to God.  
 So that's the same thing, that this liberality, how it's produced in your life becomes a ministry.  
And when it becomes a ministry, what happens is you are enabled in the same way to receive anything from God and give it.  
For example, somebody's in need of something.  
You have the ability to the Spirit.  
You're granted the tools to receive what that man cannot receive and make it available.  
Is it a father?  
 They need, they need, they need a property.  
They need this, they need that.  
And I'll receive it in the name of Jesus.  
Now imagine your life coming to that level.  
Listen, when it becomes a ministry, I said, you're given the tools in the Spirit.  
This thing just works through you.  
You find it bubbling in your life.  
 You're learning to call things into being.  
And then you find yourself living beyond money.  
What does that mean?  
Money no longer controls you.  
 You are no longer thinking of, do I have this available or do I not?  
You are no longer controlled by how much it is in your account.  
See, at a smaller level, you find yourself, when you want to do something for the Lord, you'll be calculating.  
What about this?  
You calculate it, calculate it, calculate it, and then it works.  
So, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
I'm going to give you this.  
But you come to that level where the Spirit of God walks through you.  
Like we receive healing for people.  
 Are you hearing that?  
Like we can receive a word for someone.  
We also can receive financial blessings, material blessings for people.  
We call them into being.  
Oh glory to God!  
Don't worry, you get there.  
Some of you are almost there.  
The many of you here are almost there.  
 Who knows, maybe this year you're getting inside.  
We're giving becomes a ministry.  
Hallelujah.  
At that point, say Gabbar, say Christalomai, Lee Mando-Gobra-Gassate, Shobraniki, Solvabadi.  


  
Aya, how many have I given you?  
One, two, three, four, five.  
 I got six and seven, number six.  
Pleasure.  
Pleasure.  
Pleasure.  
Oh, glory to God.  
He says, they shall spend their days in pleasure.  
How do I explain this?  
There are not many people who live a pleasurable life.  
Not many.  
 You know, it's not like, it's not like, okay, let's go on jog.  
Why?  
Because you're trying to lose weight.  
I'm talking about pleasure.  
You're doing it because you love it.  
All right?  
And now you can find time for it.  
Not just because, you know, I need to walk out.  
Not that one.  
You just like to.  
 And now you find that same pleasure, that feeling can come spiritually too.  
And then you find that as it works, you please God.  
Let me put it this way.  
Let me put it this way.  
God cares about you being happy.  
Did you know that?  
 If you were playing the game, the Lord would not be upset with you.  
Some people don't understand that.  
They think, God gets upset.  
They say, when did Jesus ever find himself on the football pitch?  
And everybody say, no time.  


  
Now, I'm not excusing those of you.  
 who have become fans of Manchester United, and you watch through the night, brick night or that, Manchester!  
Man, you!  
No, no, that's not what I'm talking about.  
Here's the point.  
As you find yourself doing something pleasurable, the desire to please God is strong.  
 You see that?  
Your life is actually alive for him.  
And that's the most important thing.  
Your life is alive for him.  
It's alive for him.  
Even your study becomes pleasurable.  
You find your love  
 You love things around you.  
You love, you take pleasure in the things that God has made.  
See, let me explain something to you about the relationship between you and the things that God made.  
There's a connection because you come from the same source.  
I can understand people who see something like this and step on it and destroy it.  
Very destructive.  
 They see things in nature and destroy them.  
Very destructive.  
They don't take pleasure in the things of God.  
But read the Bible.  
He took pleasure in his creation.  
Grace gives you that pleasure.  
You take pleasure in the things of God.  
It's a kind feeling.  
A kind and happy feeling that accepts others.  
 He loves to give to them.  
See that?  
Hallelujah.  
When you're at home, are you pleased to be at home?  
No, tell me.  
Some people get home and once they're at home, they say, that's why I like to be in church.  
Once I come to this house, carry the atmosphere from here to the house.  
 You get it?  
Take it because that's what we're talking about.  
Christ has filled you.  
Christ has come to live within you.  
Christ has given you grace.  
Take that grace into your home.  
Take it in there.  
Hallelujah.  
The last one is the word gift.  
Gift.  
 Did you know that grace brings gifts into your life?  
The grace of God in you deposits an uncanny ability to do what others cannot do in your spirit.  
Grace brings you a gift.  
 It might be a gift of singing, like we have some of our singers.  
That's what grace has done.  
Grace might give you the ability to fix things.  
Some people are so good in repairing anything.  
Anything!  
Some are so good in understanding certain things.  
 Some areas, I mean, they love to read about those things.  
They enjoy reading about them.  
They seem to have an uncanny ability to function in that area.  
It's a gift, and you need to recognize it.  
Because if you fail to recognize it, it will weaken.  
And the power of God cannot be on it, to use it to magnify you.  
 Look into your life, you'll be amazed.  
What has been deposited?  
Some are so good in fixing other people's hair.  
Once it's you, the person that you're walking on her hair will just be sleeping.  
She will wake up with something beautiful and happy.  
Some other people, you go to that salon by the time, what is all this now?  
They look at the eye like this, this is not what I told you, this is not what I told you.  
Take the money, this is not what I told you.  


  
 but you have those ones who are being called everywhere.  
There's something about their hands.  
The gift is there.  
Grace brings a gift.  
Look into your life, you will find at least one powerful gift given to you by grace.  
Grace has brought it.  
Grace has brought it.  
 Look at it and build on it.  
You have some people, they're so gifted.  
Even if it's only 5,000 era you give to them to begin a trade, they'll multiply it.  
Before long, they have 15,000.  
They just have a way, they sell.  
The trouble with such people is they don't know how to connect with God.  
Grace begets grace.  
 In other words, grace reproduces more grace.  
But for more grace to come, you have to know what to do with the one that he has given you.  
And then you can grow in it.  
It says to grow in grace, grow in grace.  
Why is it that?  
Ask good as you are in selling.  
Ask good as you are.  
Why are you still broke?  
Ask yourself a question.  
 Anything anybody has given you to sell you've been able to sell so easily After all that Three months later you are back to being broke.  
You are back to zero Someone has to try and help you again.  
You start again and once you start selling people start buying you make profit Then you are back again To zero something is wrong.  
How can you have such a gift that is wasting away?  
 Stand up a little spring.  
Well, shout hallelujah.  
I got grace working in me.  
Whoo!  
Grace!  
It's working, it's working, it's working, it's working!  
It makes me acceptable.  
It gives me the advantage.  
Can you shout him in, somebody?  
Hallelujah.  
 Grace, working in me, brings me fame, oh, joy.  
Hallelujah.  
I got it working, working, working, working, working, working, working, working, working in me.  
It's working in my life.  
Grace, lifting me up off the ordinary.  
 I'm functioning at a high level.  
Grace is working in me.  
High grace.  
Sandege posato la mandele poscha.  
Speaking of the towns, praying the Holy Ghost.  
Liberabasando de posato la mande.  
Grande posato la mande.  
Sabradege said de la mande.  


  
 Shaman de gebo sa pradellaman de diva so ta ka bashata.  
So ra ma shandala marikalabha sitti ubra geso sa pradellaman.
