title: Isaiah 60
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 Isaiah 60, written by one of the greatest prophets of old, and now given a more detailed, vivid understanding and application in today's church.  
All they gathered themselves together, they come to thee.  
Hallelujah!  
He's a sea.  
Can you see them coming?  
Can you see souls coming?  
 A little one shall become a thousand.  
I wanted to see this.  
This is the ability of the Spirit granted you.  
Isaiah 60.  


  
Glory to God.  
 All right, now let's see where we're at.  
And God's time to go.  
And this is nice.  
The book of Isaiah chapter number 60.  
Isaiah chapter 60, and we will start reading from verse one.  
And I want you to follow this carefully because it's so, so powerful.  
It says, arise, shine for thy light is come.  
 And the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.  
Notice the tenses.  
He's not making a promise.  
He says, the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.  
Blessed Lord, the glory of the Lord is risen upon me.  
Hallelujah.  
From the holy darkness,  
 shall cover the earth and gross darkness, the people, like you're hearing about today, all around the world.  
But the Lord shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee.  
Glory.  
His glory shall be seen upon you.  
 In other words, others are going to look at you and they're going to say, wow, glory to God for you.  
Hallelujah.  
I like it.  
Oh boy.  
And the Gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rise in glory to God.  
 Look at this.  
Lift up their eyes round about and see.  
All they gathered themselves together, they come to thee.  
Hallelujah!  
Pastas, are you hearing this?  
He's a sea.  
Can you see them coming?  


  
Can you see souls coming?  


  
 And some of the fellows are going to be wondering what you're doing, how come people are coming to your church?  
Why are they coming to your church?  


  
Well, this is the time.  
Hallelujah.  
 Some of you, you prayed, you labored, you tried, you toiled, you did so much.  
Well, lift your eyes now!  
Because they're coming!  
Hurry the card!  
They're coming!  
 He says, lift your eyes, look round about you, see all they gather themselves together.  
They come to thee, thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nussed at thy side.  
Then thou shall see and flow together shall amen somebody."  
Wow, look at this.  


  
 verse 5, then you will look and be radiant.  
Your heart will throb and swell with joy.  
I know you're not saying that in the King James, I need that.  
I did that purposely.  
Glory to God.  
 because I noticed something in the King James there, in that verse five, that doesn't rhyme how we put it today, when it says that in heart shall be enlarged.  
And when you talk about the enlargement of the heart, that's a medical problem.  
And so I decided to skip that translation for a moment.  
Glory to God.  
Because I'm not going to join King James to confess negatively.  
 Hallelujah.  
So he says, because the abundance, the abundance of the sea shall be converted onto the, the forces of the Gentiles shall come onto the, shall amen.  


  
Look at verse seven.  
 Look, no, no, no.  
For six is nice.  
The multitude of comers shall cover thee, the drumdaries of median and evil.  
All they from Shiba shall come, they shall bring gold and incense, and they shall show forth the praises of the Lord.  
Whoo, go away!  
The coming with gold.  
That's money.  


  
 So you see, it's not only the needy that's going to come.  
There are those that will come with gold.  
Glory to God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
All the flocks of Kida shall be gathered together onto thee.  
The rams of the buyers shall minister onto thee.  
They shall come up with acceptance on my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.  
Hallelujah.  
 Who are these that fly as a cloud and ask the dogs to their windows?  
Surely the eyes shall wait for me.  
And the ships of Tash is first to bring thy sounds from far on the silver and the gold with them onto the name of the Lord thy God and to the holy one of Israel because he had glorified thee.  
Remember, he justified you, sanctified you, glorified you.  
Hallelujah.  
 See, I'm living in Isaiah 60 right now.  
And the sons of strangers shall build up thy wars, and their kings shall minister unto thee.  


  
 Verse 11, Therefore thy gates shall be opened continually.  
They shall not be shot day and night.  
Wow!  
Look at it!  
That men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles.  
Shout Amen somebody!  


  
 for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish.  
Yeah, those nations shall be hardly wasted.  
The glory of Lebanon shall come on to thee.  
Did you hear that?  
The glory of Lebanon shall come on to thee.  
Is there anybody here from Lebanon?  
You're from Lebanon.  
The glory of Lebanon, we receive in Jesus name.  
 Oh, are you still there?  
Do you know what this means?  
The glory of Lebanon shall come on to thee.  
We're receiving from Lebanon.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Oh, come on here.  
Look at this.  


  
 The glory of Lebanon should come unto thee, the third tree, the pine tree, and the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary.  
And I will make the place of my feet glorious.  
The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come unto you, bending to you.  
Did you hear that?  
 And all they that despise thee shall bow themselves down at the source of thy feet.  
And they shall call thee the city of the Lord, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.  
Shout, amen, somebody!  


  
Wow!  
 Look at the B part of verse 15.  
He says, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations.  
Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shall suck the breast of kings, and thou shalt know that I the Lord am thy Savior, and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob, shall amen somebody.  
And he's not through yet.  
 Verse 17, for brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron.  
Hallelujah.  
This is marvelous.  
I also make that office as peace in that exactus righteousness.  
 Valen shall no more be heard in thy land, West in all destruction within thy borders, but thou shalt call thy war salvation, and thy gates praise.  
The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee, but the Lord shall be on to thee, and ever last in light, and thy God thy glory shall amen.  
Whoo!  
Are you still there?  
 It's not over yet.  
That sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon withdraw itself, for the Lord shall be thy never lasting lights, and the days of thy money shall be ended."  
Hallelujah!  
Thy people also, ah,  


  
 Look at that!  
Thy people also shall be all righteous.  
They shall inherit the land forever.  
There's no unrighteous member of the church because we all have the righteousness of Christ.  
That people shall all be righteous.  
Oh, glory to God.  
This is amazing.  
 And then he goes, they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my planet, the work of my hands that I may be glorified.  
Look at verse 22.  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  


  
 Look at it right there A little one shall become a thousand  


  
 Now, I want every pastor to look.  
Keep that scripture up there.  
I want every pastor to look.  
I want you to see this.  
This is the ability of the spirit granted you.  


  
Did you hear what he said?  
A little one shall become a thousand.  
He says, if we're talking about a church,  
 He's still a young church.  
We are still just a small church.  
He says, you're talking about a thousand members.  
You're talking about a thousand.  
So if you've been 50 members, if you've been 100 members, he's showing you the way you're going right now.  


  
 Don't tell me.  
It'll take so much.  
Oh, it'll take a miracle.  
Well, that's what we've been reading here.  
That's the miracle we've been reading here.  
And I want to just say it.  
He's given you the miracle.  
Didn't you hear it?  
He's already done it.  
He says, now, lift your eyes and look.  
He says, they come from far.  
They're coming from everywhere.  


  
 And then he says, a small one, a strong nation.  
So, so, so, even a small one becomes a strong nation.  
A small one becomes a strong nation.  
What about those that were not small?  
That means nation of nations.  
Can you see it now?  


  
 Here's where we're living right now.  
We've added from this conference, here's where we're living.  
Here's your vision.  
Here you're seeing it.  
What God is doing with your life.  
What is doing through your life.  
What is doing in your life.  
Hallelujah.  
For the Lord hath glorified thee.  
 He's done it.  
He's done it.  
I want you to listen to this.  
You remember, if you take an orange seed, how many of you ever saw an orange seed?  
Anybody?  
What does it look like?  
I know, you know, in today's world, we're the seedless grapes, seedless, orange seedless and seedless and seedless.  
In a few years, there are going to be people who have never seen a seed.  
 So I'll not be surprised if there are some of you already here who have never seen an orange seed.  
But how many of you have seen an orange seed?  
Anybody here?  
What does it look like?  
Small, right?  
What's the color?  
Okay, white of different shades, you know?  
Anybody can, I mean, you can pick any shade of it, but that means you know what it looks like.  
Imagine this, when you put that little seed on your palm,  
 Did you know it's got the potentials for the roots, the stem, the branches, lots of orange fruits and many seeds in each one of them?  
And when you look at that seed,  
 You wonder what can this seed do?  
All that seed needs is to be placed in the right environments.  
God already programmed inside that seed everything it requires for the roots that are necessary for the stem and the branches and the leaves.  
 and the fruits with many more seeds in them.  
The programming was done by God.  
And until you place that seed in the right environment, you may never know what it could do.  
I'm looking at you.  
Through the word that the Holy Ghost has given us tonight,  
 Every one of us has that program in our system.  
Every one of us is programmed for greatness, for success, extraordinary.  
He says it is not by might.  
It is not by power, but by my spirit, say it to the Lord.  


  
 One of the things you've done for yourself this week is to be in the right environment.  


  
And you're going to learn more and more how to always be in the right environment.  
There's a spiritual environment and there's an athlete environment.  
 And God's people need to learn, they need to be taught how to be in the spiritual environments.  
When the children of Egypt went out of Egypt and headed for the promised land, the Bible tells us they carried their own environment with them.  
Did you hear that?  
They carried their own environments.  
 They didn't find themselves in the Echlie environment.  
No, they carried theirs.  
The Bible says the presence of God was over them as a pillar of fire by night and as a pillar of a cloud by day.  
They were protected from the heat.  
 of the day and protected from the cold of the night.  
They carried their own atmosphere.  
They carried their own environments.  
They lived in God's environments.  
Are you hearing me?  
And in the name of Jesus, every one of you, you are called to walk in God's supernatural environments.  
And you walk in the light of it.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
 Say, I'm in God's environment.  
Hey, hey, I'm in God's environment.  
Boy, I feel this thing all over me tonight.  
Glory to God.  
I'm in God's environment.  
Hallelujah.  


  
My, my, my.  
No one I think differently.  
 No wonder I talk differently.  
Are you listening to me tonight?  
I'm in God's environment.  
I carry my own atmosphere.  
By the Holy Ghost, I live in God's, and he lives in me.  
Can you shut him in somebody?  
Oh, glory of God.  
No wonder Jesus said, I'm in my father, and my father is in me.  
 He lived in God.  
He said, you are not of this world.  
He already brought you into his own place.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
So you're going to be conscious of your environment.  
Conscious of where you are.  
Speaking other tongues, speaking other tongues.  
 Hallelujah.  
Pray in the Holy Ghost.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.
