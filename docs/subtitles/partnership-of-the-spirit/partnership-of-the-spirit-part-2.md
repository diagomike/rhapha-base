title: Partnership of the Spirit Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 Your journey starts here.  
We show you where you should be.  
Get you what is required for the journey.  
Then we tell you how to get there.  
Life's journey is exciting.  
Don't miss your way.  
Hear the directions.  
Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
 We are His partners.  
That's why He's so keen on this thing.  
The Bible says the Lord working with them.  
The Lord working with them.  
They went for their priests everywhere.  
The Lord working with them.  
By the Holy Ghost.  
Working with them.  
Once you go out in His name, He will join you.  
The Lord working with them.  
Performing the Word.  


  
 He says, ask of me.  
Ask of me.  
I said, not everybody's asking.  
Not many are taking advantage of God's invitation.  
Ask of me and I shall give thee the heathen for that inheritance and the outermost parts of the earth for thy possession.  
Did you see it?  
Read for me.  
Want to go.  


  
 Okay, let me read to you in a newer version like the NIV, several others who say the same thing.  
Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance.  
The ends of the earth, your possession.  
He says, ask, and I'll give you the nations.  
When are you going to ask?  


  
 This is how I'll give you the nations for your inheritance.  
It's time to lay claims.  


  
In every field, it doesn't matter where you function.  
In every field you can ask.  
It says, ask and I'll do it.  
 So what do you do?  
You ask and you don't say, okay, I'm gonna wait until God does it?  
No, when you ask, you receive because he already gave you the word.  
There's not going to be no.  
You understand?  
He's not gonna say, I'll think about it.  
No, he says, ask and it's done.  
So be bold to ask, take the limits of and be bold.  
 and say, this cell, we are moving from 15 to 400.  
And when we get to 400, that's 400 strong, 400, 400.  
That's a whole lot of workers.  
That means we can go for 4,000.  
And the same way that you put your faith to work for your finances, you put your faith to work for soldiers.  
 Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, I receive 200 new people into this fellowship, 200 new people.  
And when you say that and you receive in the name of Jesus, then He will give you visions, ideas on how to get them.  
You go to work.  
You go to work.  
The grace has been made available.  
 If we didn't have the grace for it, we shouldn't be talking about it.  
But we do.  
Hallelujah.  
We do.  
And it's working.  
It's working.  
It's working, producing resource.  


  
I receive Hallelujah.  
 I'm not sure the many pastors who realize that they could do that every month.  
You can determine how many people are going to come to church next month.  
And you set your goal, set that vision before you, and decide.  
And of course, you work with your level of faith.  
What your faith is being raised for.  
 You don't understand that.  
I mean, if you're already, you can't stand there, you know, you've got 1,000 members.  
Name is the Father in the name of Jesus next Sunday, next Sunday, 40,000.  
God will say, if I give you 40,000, you're not ready for that.  
Why?  
Because you need workers.  
You need to train people for it.  
He's ready, but you need to train people for it.  


  
 You've got to train people for it.  
The Holy Spirit is the one that does it.  
Remember when the children of Israel asked for meat in the Old Testament.  
They said, what part of this manner?  
Every day, manna, manna, manna.  
And you know the meaning of manna.  
It means what is this?  


  
So they said, we're fed up.  
They said, Moses, we want real meat.  
 And Moses said, you're so many.  
How can you expect God to give you a myth?  
Do you expect God to kill all the beasts of the field?  
Hey, come on.  
Don't ask for that.  
And they said, if he's God, you give us meat.  
We want meat.  
 So they saw troubled Moses, the Bible says, they went and stood at their doors, the dead doors, all the men stood at their dead doors, weeping and moaning.  
Oh, the onions and the garlic that we had in Egypt.  
We had meat in Egypt.  
Now all these years, manna, manna, manna, manna, manna.  
 And the Bible says, God heard their cry.  
And he called Moses.  
He said, come.  
They're asking for meat.  
Moses said, don't mind them.  
God said, no, I will mind them this time.  
I'm going to give them meat.  
Moses said, Lord, will you kill all the animals in the bush?  
Because of these people.  
He said, I don't have to do that.  
I will give them meat.  
 Moses was troubled.  
And when God said that Moses couldn't believe, he said to him, is the Lord's hand shuttings?  
Is there anything impossible with me?  
He said, you will see what I will do.  
He said, these guys are asking, can God furnish a table in the wilderness?  
He said, you will see it happen.  
 And finally, Moses that are getting excited, God said, tell them to get ready.  
They will eat meat until it comes out of their nostrils.  


  
And now, you know, Moses can figure out what God was going to do, you know?  
And they were ready.  
And then the Bible says, oh, hallelujah.  
 It says, God send us strong wings.  
The same wing that went through the Red Sea.  
That's the Holy Ghost.  
 It was the Holy Ghost who did it.  
The Bible says the wind, this wind of God brought quares, squares of big birds, brought quares all the way.  
These quares were flying to the camp of Israel.  
And when they got to the camp, they landed.  
And then they kept landing on the camp, landing and landing until the whole field was full and they were landing on each other.  
Heaps and heaps of birds, no space to touch and they touched down on themselves.  
 And the children of Israel came out and they carried birds and carried birds.  
There was no need to try to tie them in your house.  
No need to.  
I mean, it was everywhere.  
God said, you won't meet.  
Now eat.  


  
They had money enough.  
 So much to say about that, but the area I want you to notice is that the wind of God brought the queers to the right place.  
If he could bring the queers to the camp of Israel, he can bring the sinus to your fellowship.  
He'll bring them to your cell meeting.  
He'll bring them to the church services.  
Can you shout amen to somebody?  
You know, when I first started this part of the Bible, I said, Lord,  
 It's so easy.  
Now, next Sunday, I want the quiz.  
Bring the sores in next Sunday.  
Lord said, no, it's not like that.  
So how?  
There are other things to put in place.  
You don't have everything else in place, do you?  
I thought, oh.  
 What else do I need?  
It's like you gotta train people.  
These are souls, you don't want them to come and go away.  
You wanna keep them.  
You gotta train people.  
You have to have good plans.  
Oh, they don't just go into comfort services.  
If you have 1,000 members, you have at least 1,000 problems.  


  
 You see that?  
They don't just come.  
They come with their burdens, with their problems, with their challenges, with their anger, with their frustrations, with sicknesses and diseases, infirmities.  
They come with everything like that.  
Very few come with testimonies.  
I mean, you passed as you know, there are few people who come to see you and say, Pastor, I want to see you because I have some testimonies to share with you.  
There are few.  
Most others  
 You've got problems.  
And, you know, after hearing all the problems, the kinds you never imagined existed.  
After hearing all, you go like this.  
Except God keeps you straight.  
You fall out.  
Things you never imagined possible.  
Now you're hearing them as a pastor.  
You go,  


  
 or through the spirits, you can do anything.  
You can handle anything.  
Alleluia.  
So you gotta listen to the Holy Ghost.  
Listen to him.  
He's ready.  
He says, ask of me and I'll give you.  
Ask and I'll give you.  
Ask, ask, ask, ask and I'll give you.  
He's ready.  
Are you ready?  
Thank you.  
Other on the day,  
 We're talking about some things, then.  
We got to the book of Revelation, you remember?  
And I was explaining to you how that verse of scripture got my attention years ago.  
He said, and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.  
Revelation chapter 20 and verse 15.  
Anybody whose name was not found in the book of life.  
 was cast into the lake of fire.  
What is this book of life?  
The book of life is a book that God revealed to his servants of prophets, very early in the history of the church.  
And when I say the church this time, I'm not just talking about in the New Testament.  
Right back in your Testament, Moses spoke of God's book.  
 in which was written the names of God's people.  
The prophets talked about that same book.  
He's always revealed that he has a book in which he's written the names of those who belong to him.  
When does someone's name get in the book of life?  
I know there are those who say that when you're born again, God writes your name in the book.  
Well, Moses was not born again.  
 How come his name was in the book?  
In the Bible, he doesn't talk about when he's going to write someone's name in the book, but he does talk about taking someone's name out of the book.  


  
Moses implied that his name was in the book.  
 Exodus 32, verse 32.  
Exodus chapter 32 and verse 32.  
Moses here was speaking to God and he says, yet now if that would forgive their sin and if not read the rest.  


  
How could he blot him out if it's not already in there?  
 Right?  
So Moses is telling us his name is in the book.  
And he knew his name is in the book.  
His name was there.  
So, and Moses was not born again.  
You say, why?  
I thought Moses was born again.  
No, no one could be born again until Jesus came.  
Jesus was the first to be born again.  
You say, oh, what about all those who came before Jesus?  
That means you don't know the meaning of being born again.  
 Being born again is not an expression of turning over a new leaf.  
Being born again means that you have come out of death.  
That's what it means.  
That you have received life from the dead.  
That's why it's called born again.  
You were dead already.  
 And you've received life from the dead.  
And no one could receive life from the dead until the first one came out of death.  
And his name is Jesus.  
The Bible says Jesus was the first begotten from the dead.  
And he heads up the new creation.  


  
So until Jesus resurrected, no one could be born again.  
 And it means that that one who's come out of death has received eternal life into his spirits.  
And that eternal life was only made available by Jesus Christ.  
So all the others didn't have eternal life.  
They had a promissory note.  
God made a promise that when the Messiah came, they would have it.  
And that's how when Jesus went to Hades,  
 When he went to hell, the Bible says he led captives in his stream.  
He brought them out of hell.  
Now their promise had been cashed.  
He brought them out of Abraham's bosom.  
You remember in the 27th chapter of the Matthew's Gospel,  
 He tells us that many of the saints who slept came out of the graves after his resurrection.  
That means when Jesus came out of the grave, he was the first to come out.  
He brought the others out.  
And people saw men and women who died years and years and years ago in the Holy City.  
They were amazed to see them in Jerusalem.  
 Can you imagine?  
Can you imagine seeing your grandfather of the fort and fifth generation?  
You didn't even know his name.  
Now he shows up and suddenly you recognize him.  
To be your grandfather to the fourth generation, you recognize his face.  
Imagine if Jacob showed up in your presence tonight.  
And you knew it was Jacob.  
 That's the kind of thing that happened.  
And that little kid screamed.  
And Madison said, what is it?  
What is it?  
He said, I chose.  
What is it?  
What is it?  
I saw Gidion.  
Gidion.  
That's Gidion.  
 Gideon?  
What's Gideon?  
Gideon?  
Gideon of all.  
You think he was crazy?  
And she went into called the father.  
The father ran out.  
What is it, my boy?  
This is I saw Gideon.  
Gideon.  
And why is he arguing with his son?  
There's another one running down the street.  
He just saw someone else of another generation.  
I saw Isaiah!  
Isaiah the prophet!  
 That's the kind of thing that happened in Jerusalem.  
There was holy commotion.  
And their testimonies were so astounding that they could not be denied.  
They saw them.  
And the Bible says they came out of their graves, which means people went to the graveyards and saw the stones had been moved.  
 There was proof that it didn't just come out spiritually.  
No, the barrisers, they came out of their graves.  
You say, who opened those graves?  
Don't forget, at the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, they have been an equic.  
The barris says, uh-huh, now you get it.  
He says, and the rock splits.  


  
He shook up the whole earth.  
 And God knows stones cracked up.  
It was easy.  
There was a preparation.  
The Bible says they came out of their graves, not just that they appeared.  
They came out of their graves.  
Man, oh, man.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
If you had your house built over somebody's grave, it showed up in your sitting room.  


  
 Think about that.  
My goodness.  
Imagine a light shot showing up in your sitting room.  
Because you built your house about this brain.  
The son of God came out and I came out with him.  
Bye!  
And he's done.  
So where are they all going?  
 Glory to God.  
One of these days, brother.  


  
We are checking out of here.  
And it will not belong.  
Getting out of here.  
That's what this is all about.  
Getting sex.  
 getting set.  
That's what this is all about.  
Eyes are looking up to the Son of God who's coming again soon.  
He's coming.  
He's coming.  
And now you're ready.  
He's coming.  
 Are you ready to meet him?  
The Bible says the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.  


  
It's going to happen.  
And that will not be the first time that someone was taken away from here, alive.  
Enoch was taken away from this world, alive.  
 Elijah was sticking away from here alive, cut away from here alive.  
And finally, Jesus in another way, he wasn't cut away, he just went, alive.  
And he says in the same manner that he left,  
 He'll come back.  
He'll come back.  
What I was thinking about, we've received salvation.  
Christ is coming back for us.  
Oh, when He comes, we will go with you.  
What about the guy who's not ready?  
What about your cousin who's not ready?  
What about your brother who's not ready?  
 What about your sister who's not ready?  
What about your wife who's not ready?  
What about your husband who's not ready?  
What about your children who are not ready?  
What about your parents who are not ready?  
What about your friends?  
What about those with whom you work who are not ready?  
What about your neighbors who are not ready?  
I want to read something to you.  
Remember this.  
Revelation, Book of Revelation chapter 20.  
Let's read from verse 9.  


  
 And the went up, on the break of the earth, encompassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city.  
And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.  
Then, under devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire.  
 Now, the scripture we read verse 9, it's talking about how things are going to end up in this world.  
And the final battles that will be fought in how God's going to end up this whole stuff.  
But right after that, he shows us  
 how they're going for this judgment.  
So judgment day will come.  
You say, how long from now?  
There are many things to happen before that judgment day.  
The one that we're waiting for, which is the very next significant event for the church is the rapture of the church.  
About every significant thing that God said will happen before the rapture has happened.  
 Are you hearing me?  
There's one more thing, but he didn't tell us that that should be before the rapture.  
But it's going to be close to the rapture.  
And Bible indication is that the rapture would take place before it.  
And that is the signing of the treaty  
 with Israel.  


  
It is either the rapture takes place just before it, or when you hear the announcement, and we are not gone yet, get ready because it will just be at the doors.  
 Now you see the treaty.  
You never heard about that.  
Well, they are working on it.  
They already have the draft.  


  
But I want to read the more disturbing parts to you as a disturbing because we can be talking about we're going to heaven, but I'm asking, what about all those others who are not ready?  
 Aren't you going to do anything about it?  
Dear Lord Jesus.  
All right, back to verse 10.  
Put verse 10 again in Revelation chapter 20.  
Let's see how much we can take.  
And the devil had to see if them was casting to the lake of fire.  
So you can see Satan's future is clear.  
He's going to the lake of fire and he knows it.  
 That's his future.  
And the devil that deceived him was casting a lake of fire and brimstone.  
Who are the beast and the forest prophet are?  
He's talking about beyond the Christ.  
The under Christ will go to hell in the lake of fire.  
So that's his future.  
And the forest prophet, well, that's another personality that worked with him.  
And shall be tomato day and night forever and ever.  
You know one guy said to me one time,  
 I don't mind going to hell.  
I won't be the only one there."  
He said, all of us bad guys will be there and we'll just be enjoying ourselves.  
I said, let me tell you something.  
That's not the last point of call.  
It's not the last place.  
After that place, you're going to another place.  
I said, where is that?  
I said, it's called the lake of fire.  
He said, where?  
I read it to him.  
Lake of fire.  
I said, in that one, you can't see the next person because everything is fire.  
 You open your eye fire.  
You open your mouth fire.  
Every way is fire.  
You can see the next guy.  
So there's no such thing as someone else is going to be singing and you're going to be dancing.  
There's no space between for something else.  
It's all fire.  
It's called a lake of fire.  
I said, if you're thrown into water and you open your mouth, what do we enter?  
Water.  
You open your eyes, what do we enter?  
Water.  
I said, in lake of fire, you open your mouth.  
Fire.  
Eyes.  
Fire.  
It's all fire.  
 And there will be no day where God is going to say finally, let's bring them out their lessons.  
No, the Bible says it's eternal damnation.  
Listen, it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  
We have been saved.  
Thank God, thank God.  
What about those who have not recognized the salvation that Christ brought?  
 I read it to you today, there's no other name on the heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.  
Let's keep reading, put the scripture back there.  
And I saw a great white throne.  
This is the judge being thrown.  
I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away.  
Can you imagine the throne shows up and the earth bounces back?  
 But there's no place to go.  
The earth and the heavens kicked like ramps.  
When the throne showed up, this is the awesomeness of God.  
You're talking about vibrations?  
No, they're skipping.  
That's what it tells you.  
And there was found no place for them, verse 12.  
And I saw the dead.  
Those who had died.  
 He said, I saw the dead, small and great.  
Whether it was the peasant, he was there.  
Whether it was the Caesar or the Pharaoh, they were there.  
Look at that.  
And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God and the books were opened.  
 At your people, when you see things with us today, make no mistakes.  
Man hasn't created anything that he didn't see from God.  
God put these things in our minds.  
He talked about cars and airplanes today.  
Didn't you read the child of fire that took Elijah to heaven?  
God already had vehicles.  
He already had.  
This is not new.  
The books were open.  
Books in heaven?  
No wonder you got books.  
 The books were opened in heaven.  
I said, why do we make chairs?  
Because God has a throne.  
We just read it.  
He said, I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it.  
So it was a chair.  
You don't have anything that God didn't already have.  
He uses just the caricature of the real.  
 The Bible says he wore a robe.  
Now you can see why you're dressed.  
Somebody thought that when God made Adam an Eve, he put them there, you know, to be climbing like monkeys, and they had nothing to wear.  
But thank God they fell, they sinned against God.  
No one, they gave them something.  
Come on.  
He always planned that they should have something to wear, but not through sin.  
There was a higher life planned for them.  
 That's right.  
And I saw the dead, small and great stand before God and the books were opened.  
In another book, notice two sets.  
The books were opened.  
Then another book.  
All right.  
And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works.  
So everything that anybody ever did is in those books.  
There are books and books and books.  
And their works were written in those books.  
 No one is going to leak a fire for something he did.  
You're going to see what it takes someone to leak a fire.  
You see it in a moment.  


  
Verse 13.  
And the sea gave up.  
So those who are perished in the sea, there was no hiding place.  
They came out.  
 He said, what if the person was born to ashes?  
Come on, don't think, stupidly, even those who were buried nicely.  
Didn't they decay?  
They'd decay into the dust.  
And yet the barrisays, they came together.  
Didn't you see the valley of drag bones?  
Where is the girl's dude?  
 He said, as I prophesied, bone came to its bone.  
He says, there was a noise, and there was a chicken.  
Every bone found its own bone and joined together.  
And before long, they were covered with skin, muscle and skin, and they stood up.  
All right, let's go.  
He says, and the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and dead in hell.  
 When someone dies, who doesn't know God?  
Who doesn't know Jesus?  
He goes straight to hell.  
You see that?  
He goes to hell.  
Hell is a waiting place.  
It's a place of torment, but it's still a waiting place.  
After hell, the judgment, then liquefied.  
Look at it.  
And the sea gave up the dead, which were in it, and dead and hell, delivered out of the dead, which were in there.  
 And there were just every man according to their works.  
You see, God is so, he doesn't want anyone to have this idea of, I don't know why I'm here.  
I don't know, all your works have been written.  
So first is to let you know what you did.  
Before he says now, let's see where you go.  
 He says, they were judged according to their works.  
There's nothing you will ever do or say that will not get into God's book.  
Verse 14.  
And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire.  
This is the second death.  
Okay?  
Verse 15.  
 And whosoever was not found, written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.  
Whosoever was not found.  
What happened?  
How does this book of life, whose name is there?  
And whose name is not there?  


  
 Whosoever was not found, written in the book of life, was cast into the lake of fire.  
Turn to the book of Daniel, chapter 12.  
We are reading from verse one.  


  
Hi, oh Lord Jesus.  
You know, I read the scriptures.  
 And I weep, and I weep, and I weep.  
And I think, Lord Jesus, how much more can we do?  
So much more, so much more, so much more.  
Look at this.  
And at that time shall Michael stand up, Michael the Archangel.  
 Now, the angel of the Lord is speaking to Daniel the prophet and giving him this wonderful revelation of the future.  
And at that time shall Michael stand up.  
The great prince, we stand it for the children of that people.  
That means that Michael stands for the children of Israel, okay?  
And there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was, since there was a nation, even to that same time.  
And at that time, that people shall be delivered.  
Every one that shall be found written in the book.  
There it is again about that book.  
 That book.  


  
Verse two, and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth, those who have died, shall awake son to everlasting life and son to shame and everlasting content.  
Oh God.  
 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament.  
And they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.  
And I said, Lord Jesus, I'm one of them.  
I'm going to turn many to righteousness in the name of Jesus.  
Not they that turn some to righteousness.  
He says, they that turn many to righteousness.  
 The Bible says he that we net souls is wise.  
They that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the feminine.  
And they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever.  
What are you waiting for?  
This is serious.  
This is serious.  
There's no middle ground.  
 Psalm to everlasting life, he says, that's verse two.  
And he says, in Psalm to what?  
Shame and everlasting content.  
If you love anyone, preach the gospel to them.  
Preach the gospel.  
If you have to cry, preach into them, cry and preach it.  
Yes, weep for their souls.  
 And if you find you are unable to weep for lost souls, start weeping that you could not weep.  
I'm serious.  
If your heart is so hardened, that you are unable to weep for lost souls, be sorry for yourself and start weeping for yourself.  
Because if you don't weep today, you will weep in the wrong place.  
I will show you now.  
I will show you now.  
Book of Ezekiel chapter 3.  
 Ezekiel chapter 3.  
This is no game.  
It's no game.  
If it's a game, when the finish is okay, let's start the game.  
This is no game.  
This is for real.  
Ezekiel chapter 3, and we're reading from verse 17.  


  
 Is that Son of Man?  
I have made thee a watchman.  
Onto the house of Israel.  
Therefore, hear the word, I'm trying to show you God's way of thinking.  
Are you hearing me?  
Okay.  
Son of Man, I have made thee a watchman onto the house of Israel.  
Therefore, hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me.  
Verse 18.  
 When I say unto the wicked, thou shall surely die, and thou give us him not one in nor speak as to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity.  
But his blood I will require at thy hand."  
You know the meaning of requiring his blood at your hand?  
That means he will ask for you in his place.  


  
 Verse 19, yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, not from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul.  
If you warn them, you have delivered your own soul.  
But if you don't, he says, that man will pay for his evil deeds.  
This is what our requires blood from your hands.  
 I couldn't keep quiet.  
After reading this years ago, I couldn't keep quiet.  
No.  
I couldn't.  
I was going to preach to anybody and everybody.  
Because I don't want God to require the sin as blood from my hands.  
 You know, I remember that song, that old song, the saints used to sing as they thought about the senors.  
No, no, the senors voice you hear.  
Gone, gone, they have gone, they have gone marching to join the glorious ones.  


  
 The sinner that doesn't receive the gospel is only going to regret at the end.  
This is no no.  
The sinner's voice you hear.  
Gone, gone.  
They have gone.  
They have gone.  
It's talking about us.  
Marching to join the glorious ones.  
No no.  
 Had I known?  
He would say, I would have gone to church.  
Had I known?  
I would have believed the gospel.  
Had I known?  
I would have listened to my cousin.  
Had I known?  
Had I known?  


  
Well, we've got to do something.  
We can't wait for that moment.  
 We can't wait.  
Satan wants to see to eat that he gets as many as many as many of God's creatures as he can into this destruction because he doesn't want to go to lake of fire alone.  
He doesn't want to go alone.  
The Bible says it was prepared for the devil and his angels.  
He didn't say it was prepared for human beings.  
He was prepared.  
The lake of fire was prepared for the devil and his angels.  
But they are going to drag others with them.  
 because they feel they know that that's the only way to touch the heart of God.  


  
So that's a painful moment for Jesus to see those for whom he died still going to hell even though he had done everything that should have been done.  
 But we are His partners.  
That's why He's so keen on this thing.  
The Bible says, the Lord working with them.  
The Lord working with them.  
They went for them priests everywhere.  
The Lord working with them.  
But the Holy Ghost working with them.  
Once you go out in His name, He will join you.  
 the Lord working with them, confirming the word.  
You're not going to be preaching the loan.  
He'll be there to confirm the word.  
Why are you talking on the outside?  
He'll be talking to them on the inside.  
That's why I said, be filled with the Holy Ghost so that he can't work with you.  
You become his witnesses.  
Witnesses are proof producers.  


  
 You know, this is a song we used to sing.  
Let the love of God shine through you in the leader things you do.  
Light your world, and though your light may be reaching only two or three,  
 Your world, light your world, light up your world.  
In the little things you do, is as though your light may be touching only two or three.  
It doesn't matter.  
That's still good.  
The Bible says, for everyone lost sin and that repents, there's joy in heaven.  
Everyone.  


  
 Light your world, light your door.  
Let your love go.  


  
 Let the love of God shine to you In the little things you do Light your world through your life and in which you all need to run free Light your world just one more time  


  
 And the love of God's shining through the giving.  
Give a little face you do.  
Light your world.  
And though your life may be, rich in only two or three lives.  


  
 Yes.  
Sit down.  
That's what you're going to do.  
Light up your world.  
Let the love of God shine through you in the little things you do.  
It doesn't matter that your light can only reach two or three.  
Go ahead and light up your world.  
Let others see the light of Christ in you.  
 Hallelujah.  
Oh, thank you Holy Spirit.  
Remember everywhere that God has placed you.  


  
 is your mission field.  
Everywhere you work is your mission field.  
Hallelujah.  
At this moment, I want you to pray because God is going to use you.  
God is going to use you.  
God is going to do big things with your life.  
Open your mouth and pray.  


  
 When we hear the word, we've got to act on it.  
If you have not received salvation from Christ, you can do so right now.  
I've seen these words.  
Heavenly Father, I believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God.  
I believe He died for me, and I believe God raised Him from the dead, and He's alive today.  
 I declare with my mouth, Jesus Christ is Lord of my life from this day.  
And by my faith in his name, I receive eternal life into my spirit.  
Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul.  
I have eternal life now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.  
 If you pray that prayer, God hurt you and answered you, and salvation is yours now.  
That means you have received on your life.  
You have received eternal life.  
That means you're born again.  
You have the new life of Christ.  
Congratulations.  
God bless you.  
If you just said that prayer along with Pastor Chris, congratulations.  
Welcome to the family of God.
