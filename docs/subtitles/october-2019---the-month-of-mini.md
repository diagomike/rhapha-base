title: October 2019 - The Month of Ministry
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and he left us with a message to tell the untold, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and his unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Now, this month is a very special month.  
Beautiful month.  
Beautiful month.  
And you're going to do what God is asking you to do.  


  
 Some months, you know, when we announce what the message of the month is, and some months, you really get excited.  
Woo!  
Some months, you're not very sure whether to shout or not to shout.  
Especially the ones that come with responsibilities.  
So,  
 Okay, it's a partial crisis preparing us for this guy in there.  
Well, it's a very nice one, really.  
Especially when you understand what God's talking about and what His positioned you to be.  
So, I'm going to read, let me tell you what happened.  
Out of praying.  
And just...  
 looking in into the month.  
And the Lord showed me an umbrella.  
And I said, an umbrella, what's the umbrella?  
That's wonderful.  
An umbrella.  
You know what an umbrella is?  
 that light collapsible canopy you carry when it's raining or when it's sunny, right?  
That's wonderful.  
All right, so I'll read you some scriptures here.  
Very touching how the Lord thinks about his people.  
Isaiah chapter four,  
 From verse 5, the Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night.  
For upon all the glory shall be a defense.  
The glory shall be what a defense.  
That's wonderful.  
 and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a comet from storm and from rain.  
What do you think about that?  
I wonder what's going through your mind.  
What do you think?  
Isn't that wonderful?  
That's lovely.  
 That's lovely.  
But he hears the key.  
Look at it.  
I don't read it again.  
Listen to it.  
The Lord will create upon every dwelling place of Mount Zion and upon how assemblies are clogged and smoked by day in the shining of a flaming fire by night.  
 For upon all the glory shall be a defense."  


  
What does that suggest?  
What does that suggest?  
Heavenly President, what are you thinking?  
What does that suggest?  
It's connotes protection.  
 Protection, right?  
Yes, sir.  
That's wonderful.  
So, he's talking about protecting his people, right?  
Yes, sir.  
And the glory, he says, shall be a defense, right?  
Yes, sir.  
This is powerful, but watch, watch.  
This is great, but it gets greater.  
 This is really great.  
Thank you.  
Thank you.  
God bless you.  
You know, a lot of times, a lot of times many Christians find themselves in the position where they're like, oh God, I need your protection.  
I need this.  
You know, we love it.  
God would do this for us.  
 All right?  
Protect us with this amazing glory.  


  
If Jesus is who he claims to be, and the Holy Spirit is who and what the Word of God says he has,  
 And all of what God has done, according to the Scriptures, to now to be true.  
As these all are, then I kind of think, no more should be expected of him.  
And he's aware.  
So I want to show you what he says here.  
This is lovely.  
Isaiah,  
 Amazing, it's still the same Isaiah.  
Chapter 32, from verse one, is, is, behold, the king shall reign in righteousness.  
He must be talking about our king, right?  
There's only one king that can reign in righteousness.  
What are you thinking?  
Absolutely.  
 A king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule with justice in King James' in judgment.  
That means with justice.  
That means the princes are ruling together with him.  
All right?  
Good.  
And boy.  
Do you have the NIV?  
He says C, verse one.  
 see that king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice.  
Each man will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm.  
Uh-oh.  
What we read earlier, God's saying, I'm going to protect you.  
In this one, he says, you are the protector.  


  
 See the difference?  
All right, each man he says, each man will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in the desert and a shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.  
Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed and the ears of those who hear will listen.  
 Why is this important?  
Because when Jesus came, he says, according to Isaiah, the prophet, he says, you have ears, but you will not hear.  
You hear and can understand.  
You see and you can perceive.  
Why?  
Lests you hear and understand and believe and I have to and get converted and I have to heal you.  
 Uh-oh, cherubah, right?  
So they were dull over hearing.  
So when he preached, they said, this is a hard saying, who can hear it?  
They got angry with him.  
But God is saying, in your day, they will listen.  
They will listen.  
Hallelujah.  
 And the mind of the rash will know and understand.  
And the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.  
Somebody say hallelujah.  
So what's about to happen?  
This is a month of ministry.  
 You are taking your place.  
I want you to notice something.  
I want you to notice in Romans chapter 5 or 17, there we receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life.  
They shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ.  
So the princes that are reigning, ruling with justice.  
This is now hallelujah.  
 Glory to Jesus.  
So, His told us in His word that they would receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ.  
The life is given you to live now.  
In this time, we will determine what you will do in the ages to come.  
 This is the place of preparation.  
This is the place of determination.  
Here is the school of life.  
And that's why you have to take the word of God seriously, because you're being trained to reign.  
And the reigning is not just here, I tell you.  
No, this one is your learning authority here, your learning it.  
 So you're learning it, and then you qualify.  
And then in the ages to come, you'd carry out what you've been trained to do in this day and time.  
Hallelujah.  
Blessed be God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.
