title: Christâ€™s Purpose in You - Vol. 2 Part 5
---
 One thing is sudden, if you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 I want to share something with you in the light of what we've been talking about Christ's purpose in you.  
All right?  
So I said there are a lot of people who when they read the Word of God or hear the Word of God, they wonder that in their own lives they don't see the reality of the world.  
 And so there's a disconnect between their understanding of the world and their daily life.  
But then I was sharing with you that there are four  
 factors that are necessary for us to translate from a theoretical approach of God's Word to the real practical experience of the Word of God every day.  
Praise the Lord.  
And I gave you number one as what?  
Knowing.  
Knowing.  
 And we said that knowledge there is a revelation knowledge.  
It is Gino's school.  
You remember that?  
How many of you remember our series of teaching on three kinds of knowledge?  
All right, you remember?  
The second point we said necessary was what?  
We said this is the other Wednesday, the upper Wednesday.  
Okay, so knowing  
 is one, and that's revelation knowledge.  
And then the second one is reckoning.  
That means to consider it to be so.  
First, you've got to know it.  
You've got to know.  
And the knowledge is not just science knowledge.  
It is not scientific knowledge.  
 It is revelation, knowledge of God's word.  
And that secondly, you've got to acknowledge what you know.  
That means you've got to reckon it to be so.  
Now we pick that word, reckon, from Romans chapter six and verse 11.  
And it is an accounting word.  
And there's a reason I have to point that out to you.  
 It's on there.  
Romans chapter number 6 verse 11.  


  
Read it for me.  


  
 He says, recon yourself to be dead.  
Recon, recon, recon.  
Recon yourself to be dead.  
I said, it's an accounting word.  
That means no place for assumption.  
He says, account yourself.  
The Greek is logismai.  
And that's where you get to log.  
That's where you get it from.  
 It means counting to be so.  
If it's 10, it's 10.  
If it's 25, it's 25.  
Okay?  
You can't count it to be 13 and write 15.  
So there are no assumptions here.  
So when God says, account yourself to be dead to sin.  
He means exactly what he says.  
 Count yourself to be dead to see, and then count yourself to be alive to God.  
Now, so what do I do?  
I have to declare, accept and declare, that I am dead to see and alive to God.  
I've got to see it that way.  
That's what it says, record on yourself to be so.  
That means consider it to be so.  
In that it's finer.  
 What if I say to God, I can't consider myself to be healed because I feel the pain.  
I feel the trouble.  
I can't consider myself to be bold because I'm always afraid.  
What will God's answer be?  
God will say, that's why you are experiencing what you are experiencing because you want to put your experience ahead of truth.  
You get it?  
 You're putting experience ahead of truth, but you can't put your experience ahead of truth.  
Because life is the expression of what we have believed.  
Your life today is the expression of all you have known and accepted.  
The Bible says, as a man think it, so is he.  
Your character.  
 Your outward character, the character of your daily life, is actually the character of your thoughts.  
And the character of your thoughts is the sum total of the information you have endorsed in your mind.  
So as you think, that's the way your life is.  
 So, if I want to change the way my life is, what should I do?  
Change my way of thinking.  
But how can I change my way of thinking without changing the source of my thoughts?  
I've got to change the source of my thoughts.  
To God's word, God gives me materials to think with.  
He gives me His word, His revelation to think with.  
Now, if your life is always on CNN and BBC, your life is always, I mean, that's all you meditate on,  
 the news magazines, newspapers, and so on and so forth.  
And that would be the character of your life, full of fear, full of apprehension, unstable.  
Because those materials don't give faith to your spirit, they bring fear to your spirit.  
So you look at life with a lot of apprehension, fear,  
 Let me give you a simple example.  
If you were told that a friend of yours or a cousin of yours had a health problem and you said, what kind of a health problem?  
And they said, oh, malaria.  
You would say, oh, I see.  
 And so what has he done about it?  
You don't have the fear of malaria because in your day you are aware that they have a kill for malaria.  
 But many years ago, they had no cure for malaria.  
It was a killer disease.  
If somebody had malaria many years ago, they would say, oh God, oh God, oh God.  
It's finished because they knew they had no cure for malaria.  
You there?  
Yes.  
So they were afraid of malaria.  
 But soon as they found the cure for it, they stopped being afraid.  
Now all that is based on information.  
I know that most of you didn't study pharmacy or pharmacology or whatever it is.  
I know most of you didn't, some of you did, but not all of you.  
But there are a lot of you who know about medicine.  
 I mean, if you feel the pain on this side, you know what to take.  
If it's over here, you know what to take.  
It's here, you know what to take.  
You just know them.  
Doctor in the house.  
You know what I'm talking about.  
Not because you know what's in the tablet.  
You just have faith in these things.  
 I mean, you pick it up from the shop and then you read and read and read and read and tell you all this kind of stuff.  
Yeah.  
Mm-hmm.  
Mm-hmm.  
For headache, school, some fever.  
And then you watch it on TV.  
That guy goes like this.  
And then... Then the next day, you go get it.  
 Okay, so that's based on information, right?  
Okay, now if you heard that someone had been struck with a bowl of fever, or they told you that friend had HIV, why?  
Because you heard there's no cure.  
 And so, you're waiting and hoping one day somebody will say there's a kill.  
See how we live our lives?  
Depending on someone we don't know.  
Who I have on there found a kill?  
Who are they that should find the kill?  
 We're hoping that someone, somewhere will spring up and say, we found it.  
Ah, praise God, I was wondering why I wouldn't anybody do so.  
You see, but God has not left His children to be victims in life.  
Are you hearing me?  
 When you become a Christian, that means when you are born again, because I've seen some people say, are you a Christian?  
Oh, yes.  
Are you born again?  
They say, no, no.  
I'm a Christian.  
Born again?  
No.  
How can you be a Christian without being born again?  
He said, yeah, my uncle is a Christian.  
He's just like, he's not born again.  
 Jesus said, except a man be born again.  
He cannot see the kingdom of God.  
Somebody said, it depends on what you mean when you say born again.  
It depends on what you mean.  
No, what did Jesus mean?  
That which is born of the flesh is flesh.  
And that which is born of the spirit is spirit.  
So to be born again is to be born of the spirit.  
 And Peter said, being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible by the word of God that limits and abides.  
So it means to be born again, to be born of the word of God.  
Right?  
Okay.  
Are you born of the word of God?  
No, no, no, I want to know.  
I want to know from you.  
Are you born of the word of God?  
Yes.  
You sure?  
 born of the word of God?  
Who told you?  
You know.  
How did you know?  
Do you feel it?  
It's in the word, right?  
The Bible says you're born of the word.  
If you're born of a dog, what are you?  
Are you sure?  
 If you're born of a cat, what are you?  


  
If you're born of the word, what are you?  


  
Now, this is where many miss it.  
Look, it makes sense until it gets too big for their religious theology.  
 If you're born of the world, what are you?  
They can't accept that.  
If you're born of a human being, what are you, human being?  
If you're born of God, what are you?  
What did Jesus mean when He said, He are gods?  
And all of you are children of the most high.  
 You know, the question is, what kind of life?  
What is a Christian?  
Who is a Christian?  
So why do I study something and it's theoretical?  
Then, when I close the book, I look ordinary.  
I want to show you why.  
You ready for it?  
Tonto Book of James.  
James chapter 1.  
 The other son, do you remember I said something?  
We are not called to obey the word, but to do the word.  
And I explained to you there's a big difference between obeying the word and doing the word.  
No one can obey the word.  
 because to obey the word is to be outside the word.  
You can't obey the word, they failed in the Old Testament, and so God had to change his style, his method, and to make sure we are born of the word, and so we can live the life of the word, so we do the word.  
Okay, James chapter one, I want you to begin reading for me from verse 22, one to go.  


  
 Did you hear that?  
Do as of the word.  
Okay, verse 23.  
Aha!  
Okay, stop.  
I want to show you something.  
Listen.  
You know, when I said to you, there's a difference between doing the word and obeying the word.  
You know, anybody could say, well, maybe it's just semantics.  
You know, Pastor Chris is just trying to split ass.  
 All right?  
No, I'm not trying to speed hairs.  
I'm just trying to show you what the word says.  
Now, the Word of God will show you what he means by doing the Word.  
You see it now.  
You ready?  
Okay.  
Read verse 23.  


  
And not a doer, uh-huh.  


  
 Stop.  
What did he say?  
Anybody who is a Hera and not a Dua, he says, is like someone who sees his natural face in a mirror and when it turns away, he forgets.  
He didn't say anything about doing anything.  
 He looks as his face in a mirror when he turns away he forgets.  
Now, what should he have done not to forget what he saw and to act as though he knows what he saw?  
 What does that tell you about a duo of the word?  
A duo, therefore, is one who looks at his natural face in a mirror, and when he turns from the mirror, he remembers.  
He remembers.  
 So when I look at the mirror of God, what is the mirror of God?  
The word of God.  
When I look at the mirror of God, it says, you are a new creation.  
When I turn, I still remember I am a new creation.  
So when you ask me, what are you?  
I say, I am a new creation.  
I don't forget.  
You still there?  
 All right, let's look at verse 24.  
Read verse 24.  


  
Verse 25.  
Hallelujah.  
Mag that word.  
Whoso look at into the perfect law of liberty.  
 Another version says, God's word that makes man free.  
Then I like another translation.  
He causes God's love for free man.  
Hallelujah.  
All right, read that verse 25, but who's so?  


  
 He be not a forgetful here about a doer of the work.  
What work?  
The work of faith.  
The work of faith.  
You don't forget.  
He says, this man shall be blessed in his deed.  
Who's so look at into the perfect law of liberty and continues there in that means and continues to look.  
That means setting your gaze on the word.  
 He being not a forgetful hearer.  
Say, I'm not a forgetful hearer.  
Say it again, I'm not a forgetful hearer.  
Can you see that?  
Now, who enjoys the perfect law of liberty?  
Who is that man that will be blessed in his deed, the man who hears and does not forget?  
He does not forget.  
So what does he do?  
If he does not forget, he remembers what he looks like.  
 He remembers.  
Hallelujah.  
The Word of God says, I aim the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  
So as I study, I can see that I aim the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  
So when I close the book, I don't forget.  
 I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  
So what's going to happen?  
Okay, let's get back to our four factors.  
Why you have this in your mind?  
Factor number one is what?  
Factor number two?  
Factor number three?  
No, I haven't told you.  
No.  
 Come on.  
Factor number three.  
Okay, trying to guess, huh?  
Okay, you ready to write it down?  
Walking in the light.  
That's factor number three.  
What does it mean to walk in the light?  
To walk in the light means to walk in the Word of God.  
The Word of God is light.  
 The word of God is light.  
It's called a true light, which lighted every man that commented into the world.  
Amen?  
In 1st Epistle of Saint John in chapter number one verse seven, he says, if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.  
Oh, that means there's where the connection begins.  
 Look at it, he says, John 1 John 1 7, right?  
He says, if we walk in the light as he is in the lights, what does that mean?  
I walk in the light of my healing as he is in the light of my healing.  
In other words, what does the water God say about my health?  
As far as God is concerned,  
 Okay, listen to this.  
Did you know, did you know, did you know that as a Christian you don't need healing?  
Are you listening?  
I know.  
Sometimes you know we're trying to get healed.  
 because we are suffering a pain or some affliction of the body, so we're trying to get healed.  
But as a Christian, you don't need healing.  
What you have is your divine health.  
Now, that is important.  
Your divine health is what you have.  
Now, Satan's  
 Manipulation will be to try to make you forget that you... I wish... Okay, listen to this, very important.  
Is this all right here?  
In the book of Isaiah, when you study from chapter number three, you read verses four and five,  
 Isaiah the prophet came many years before Jesus came.  
All right?  
And before Jesus came, he saw the Messiah.  
He saw that the Messiah would come.  
He saw that healing will come to Israel.  
 And then he began to prophesy concerning Jesus.  
He was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.  
We hid as its way of faces from him.  
He was despised and we esteemed him not.  
Surely he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.  
He had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.  
 He said, surely he had born.  
He saw him in the spirits, a vision of the future.  
And yet, slain surely, he had borne our graves and carried our sorrows.  
Oh, we like sheep have gone astray.  
We have torn every one to his own way.  
And the Lord had laid on him the iniquity of us all.  
 So he borrowed our griefs, he carried our selves, he took our sins, our punishment for our sins.  
All of this Isaiah saw.  
He said he was wounded for our transgressions.  
Now the man's looking.  
Jesus hasn't come yet.  
This is so many years before Jesus will come.  
 In his first advent, all right?  
So, as he says, he was wounded for our transgressions.  
He was bruised for our iniquities.  
The chastisement for our peace was upon him.  
And with his tribes, we are healed.  
But with his tribes, the Hebrew connotation is with a death-dealing blow, one crushing blow.  
 We are here.  
Oh, then came Jesus.  
And when he came, as he healed, the Bible says, as it is written, himself bore our sicknesses, our infirmities and carried our sicknesses himself.  
 as it is written, himself.  
Then he died and was buried.  
And then ascended, he resurrected and ascended to heaven.  
And then the apostles went preaching.  
When they went preaching, what did Peter say?  
Turn to first Peter.  
I wanna show you something that's important.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah.  
 First Peter, chapter one.  
Read verse one into verse two.  


  
 Who is he riding to?  
He's riding to pilgrims.  
Scattered throughout ponches, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Basinia.  
What's he talking about?  
He's riding to the Jews scattered abroad.  
Are you listening?  
He's riding to the Jews scattered abroad.  
He was the apostle to the Jews.  
 Why, Paul was the apostle to the Gentiles.  
Now, he's writing to these Jews, scattered abroad.  
And then he tells them something.  
Turn to chapter 2.  
Are you there?  
From verse 21, read.  


  
Leaving us an example, uh-huh.  
 Twenty-two.  
Twenty-three.  
Twenty-four.  
Aha.  
Alleluia.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Remember, Isaiah prophesied to the Jewish people about the common Messiah, just as I explained to you.  
Now, Peter is writing to the Jewish Christians.  
He knows very well they will understand the message of the prophets because they read these words all the time in the synagogues.  
Then he says to them,  
 for even here on two way he called, verse 21, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that he should follow his steps, who did no sin, neither was God found in his mouth, who, talking about Christ, who when he was revived, revived not again, when he suffered it threatened not, but committed himself to him that judged it righteously, who his own self.  
Now, he's going to say what Isaiah said,  
 Isaiah said, Bahus tribes, ye are healed.  
Look, ye are healed.  
Because Christ is coming.  
He shows up, he gets crushed by the power of God for us, sacrificed of God for us, and with his tribes, the death, till, and blow.  
With that, you are healed.  
 Peter says, who his own self burr sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sins, should live on to righteousness, read the rest of it, want to go.  
Isaiah looks  
 to the cross, and says, by whose stripes he adhered, then can Jesus and fulfilled it?  
Now he has fulfilled it, he's gone to heaven, and Peter looks back, and says, by whose stripes he were here.  
He are not here.  
He were here.  
What's Peter saying?  
I want to tell you what color, but she color.  
 Can you catch this?  
Can I tell you what Peter's telling you?  
He's not telling you that you were healed yesterday.  
No, he's looking at the redemption.  
He's looking at the redemption that occurred before the new creation.  
Remember, the new creation is not the redeemed man.  
 Jesus healed us and died for us.  
When he died, we died.  
That man that was redeemed was redeemed.  
He was free by the death of Jesus.  
He healed by the stripes of Jesus.  
Are you listening?  
The stripes and the death of Jesus.  
 were for the redeemed man.  
And so the man was redeemed.  
But that's not what God wanted.  
That's not what he was looking for.  
Because if you heal them, you'd need to heal them again.  
 So God had a plan.  
The plan was not to heal you.  
The plan was not to save you from sin.  
The plan was not to redeem you.  
To redeem means to save by paying the price.  
That's not enough.  
 What we got in Christ is not a redemption.  
What we got?  
Oh, dear, I wish you could understand the graduation from the man that's  
 channel and natural that comes to Christ, to the baby in Christ after his come to Christ becomes a baby in Christ.  
All right, he calls them children.  
And after that he calls them young men.  
After that he calls them fathers.  
In other words, you become spiritual.  
So there's a difference between the babe and the spiritual man in Christ.  
When you're maturing the things of God, you see, you don't need healing.  
 What do you need?  
Nothing.  
You say nothing?  
Oh, yes.  
Because it says all things are yours.  
Why?  
You are the Jewish heir with Christ.  
Are you listening?  
The life in you is not the human life.  
Turn there.  
Romans 8.  
Are you there?  
Romans 8.  
 Have you seen it?  
Verse 10.  
Maybe I should read to you from verse 8.  
Romans chapter 8, verse 8.  
So then, they that are in the flesh cannot please God.  
Uh-oh.  
They that are in the flesh cannot please God.  
Can you see?  
They that are in the flesh.  
What do you mean flesh?  
It means senses.  
They that function according to the senses.  
They that walk according to their sight, according to sensory perception cannot please God.  
 They cannot please God.  
The Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God.  
What is faith?  
Faith is the response of the human spirit to the Word of God.  
Did you hear that?  
Alright now.  
So, so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.  
Verse 9.  
But he are not in the flesh.  
But in the spirit.  
Say amen.  
 And that's Paul's description of me.  
He says, he are not in the flesh, but in the spirit.  
And as a yes Lord, I'm not in the flesh, but in the spirit.  
Glory to God.  
I'm not in the flesh, but in the spirit.  
You see, there's somebody struggling.  
Oh God, please, deliver me from the flesh.  
No, thanks be on to God.  
I'm not in the flesh, but in the spirits.  


  
 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be, that the Spirit of God dwell in you.  
Now, if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of this.  
Look at verse 10.  
Powerful.  
And if Christ be in you, see Baha'ah.  
If Christ be in you, is Christ in you?  
That is the question.  
That is the question.  
If Christ be in you.  
 The body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.  
That's a little difficult in construction.  
And if you look at the italicized words, you'll understand certain words were missing in the original manuscript.  
So I'll read properly to you what it says.  
And if Christ being you, though the body be dead because of sin, yet the spirit gives it life because of righteousness.  
 He says, do your body be crushed because of sin?  
Are you listening to this?  
Do your body be bruised and battered because of sin?  
He says, the Holy Ghost gives it life because of righteousness.  
Why?  
Look at it.  
Sin brought death.  
Sin brought wickedness.  
Sin brought sickness.  
Sin brought depravity.  
Sin has brought poverty.  
Destruction to man.  
 Sin has done that.  
Sin has done that.  
He says, do your body be dead because of sin?  
He says, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.  
Why?  
Because righteousness has come.  
That's what Jesus came to do.  
He came to make us one with God.  
He came to give us righteousness.  
 The Bible says, Christ became seen for us that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.  
He says, there is therefore now no condemnation, no judgment to those that are in Christ Jesus who work not after the flesh.  
That means not after the senses, but after the spirits, for the law, Kaya.  
 That's Romans chapter 8 verse 2 for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.  
 Listen to it.  
Listen to it.  
Listen because this is so powerful.  
He says the law of the spirit of life.  
In other words, there is a law of the spirit of life.  
He says that law has been introduced into my spirits.  
He said the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.  
Was the law of sin and death?  
The law of sin and death works in the human body.  
Why?  
 It works in the human spirit and works in the human body.  
It is the law that God gave, the soul that seen it, it shall die.  
That law is encapsulized in the law of Moses.  
That law is what works in the human being that makes him sin.  
He just sins.  
He just has to sin.  
 Paul said, I find another law working in the members of my body, controlling me and making me go to sin.  
He says, while in my mind I want to serve God, I find another law, bringing me into captivity to the law of sin.  
He said, Oh wretched man, there I am.  
Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  
He said, I thank God through Jesus Christ our law.  
 meaning the solution has come in Christ Jesus, says for what the law could not do, in that it was weak to the flesh, God sending his own son, in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who work not after the flesh, but after the spirit, shouting in sombre.  
Hallelujah.  
 Then you say, I've got the law of the Spirit in me.  
Let me tell you, when sickness attacks your body, when fear attacks your spirits, don't be afraid.  
Say, I've got the law of life in me.  
I've got the law of life in me, hallelujah.  
Are you listening?  
 Sometimes sickness attacks a home.  
Sometimes death attacks a home.  
Sometimes fear attacks a home.  
And terrible things begin to happen in the house.  
Evil things begin to happen as those Satan has come to sit in the family.  
Don't cry, because if you cry nothing will happen.  
Are you listening?  
 Jesus gave you the power of a Tony to use his name.  
Are you listening to this?  
You say, I refuse to fear.  
In the name of Jesus, I refuse to fear.  
I refuse to be defeated.  
I refuse to give up that which God has given me.  


  
 I say I refuse to fear.  
I refuse to give up.  
Then you know what?  
I said we're talking about the third point, walking in the light.  
All right?  
Walking in the light means walking in the Word.  
The fourth one is walking in the Spirit.  
There's a difference between walking in the Spirit and walking in the light.  
Are you still there?  
Leebakara.  
 Sombarabahaya.  
Tell somebody Christianity is a living thing.  
He's an everyday victorious life.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Everyday.  
A victorious life everyday.  


  
Live and work in the spirits.  
What is this one working in the spirit?  
 In Galatians chapter 5 and verse 16, read it for me.  
Galatians chapter 5 verse 16, want to go.  


  
Did you see that?  
Read again one more time.  


  
 This I say then, walk in the spirit.  
And then he says, and he shall not fulfill the loss of the flesh.  
In other words, you don't have problem with the flesh if you walk in the spirit.  
 Walk in the Spirit.  
Now, walk in the light means in the light of the Word.  
This is what the Word of God says, so I'm going to hug this way.  
This is me.  
This is what it says about me, and that's how I will be.  
So, if he says, this is what I am, this is what I am.  
That's walking in the light.  
Now, what do you mean walk in the Spirit?  
First of all, you've got to understand that there is an outward man and there is an inward man.  
 The outward man is the body that you see.  
The inward man is the real you.  
That's your spirit.  
That's the real you.  
That's the inward man.  
That's the man that's born again.  
The spirit man.  
Not the one that's wearing clothes.  
The real man is the man on the inside.  
 He's called an inward man.  
Peter calls him the hidden man of the heart.  
That's the human spirit.  
Now that man is the one that's born again.  
That's the you.  
That's the you that God sought to save and brought into the light.  
That's you.  
Now, our physical body is regulated by our senses, our five senses.  
 But the human spirit that's called the heart, the hidden man of the heart, the human spirit, now is born again.  
So when I say I am born again, that's my spirit.  
My spirit is born again.  
My body is not born again.  
My body is the same body, but my body is affected by the life of my spirit.  
How are you listening to this?  
When you're born again, your body doesn't change.  
 But your body is affected by the life of the Spirit that dominates it.  
All right?  
Now, this Spirit is where the character of the man is.  
This Spirit, that's where your character is.  
That's the real person.  
 That's the man that goes to heaven or goes to hell, not the body.  
You say, what does your spirit look like?  
Well, your outward man is the image of your spirit.  
Come on.  
That's the image of your spirit.  
Your outward appearance  
 is the image of your spirit.  
So your spirit doesn't have two noses and four nostrils.  
It's got one, two eyes, one head.  
Now, turn the Gallegia into chapter five.  
Have you seen it?  


  
 Read for me from verse 22.  
I don't know what you say.  
Verse 22.  


  
 But the fruit of the Spirit.  
Now, many people think that because it is the word spirit there is in capital S. They think it's talking about the Holy Spirit because many Bible students understand that a lot of times when the capital S is used, they're referring to the Spirit of God as against when the small letter S is used, okay?  
 This is one of such places where there is an arrow because the word there is not referring to the Spirit of God.  
How do you know?  
Well, because Jesus said, I'm the van, he had the branches.  
What carries the fruits, the branches?  
All right?  
So he's definitely not talking about the Holy Spirit, he's talking about the recreated human spirit.  
Your human spirit.  
 So read it now with that in mind.  
Want to go.  
The fruit of what?  
What spirit?  
Say my spirit.  
Okay, go on.  


  
The fruit of my spirit is love.  
 Hey, the fruit, the fruit, the fruit, the fruit of my spirit.  
This is the fruit of your spirit, your born-again spirit.  
God is telling you, this is something that you have.  
You will never have to pray for it.  
It is the fruit of your spirit.  
 It is the product of your spirits, because your spirit is born again.  
This, oh, this is beautiful.  
Listen, but the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffered, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, against such, there is no law.  
So this is my character.  
So again, this is my character.  
 This is my character.  
All right, now, if you function with this, go back to the same chapter 5 Galatians.  
I want you to look at verse 14.  
Read verse 14.  


  
Did you see that?  
All the law is fulfilled in one word.  
 In this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."  
What is he saying?  
That if we walk in love, we have fulfilled the law.  
And love comes out of my spirit.  
So if I walk in love, I have fulfilled the law.  
Hallelujah.  
 So what should I do now?  
Train my spirits to be productive in the things of God.  
Train my spirits to be productive in the things of God.  
Train my spirit to be productive in the things of God.  
So I find that I have an excellent spirit, an excellent spirit, because I train myself to be productive in the things of God.  
 So my perception of life is different.  
See, faith, I don't have to cry for faith.  
Faith is in my spirit.  
Come on, look here, look here.  
Look at all those things that are in your spirit.  
Galicians, chapter 5, verse 22.  
See, love is in my spirit.  
Joy is in my spirit.  
Can you see that?  
Now, you have some people that are not joyful.  
Oh, joy is in my spirit.  
I can be joyful in the midst of trouble.  
 Peace is in my spirit.  
Long-suffering as temperance in my spirit.  
Gentleness is in my spirit.  
See, I'm a gentle person.  
Now, maybe someone told you you're not gentle.  
The praise God, I can be gentle now.  
Because it's in my spirit.  
 Goodness.  


  
Goodness.  
He's dealing with a divine quality.  
Then he says, faith.  
I got faith in my spirit.  
I have faith.  
I don't struggle for faith.  
I have faith.  
And my faith.  
 will change things for me.  
I can change anything.  
By an act of my faith.  
Faith.  
I got faith.  
I got faith.  
I got faith.  
Meetness.  
Hallelujah.  
Shiba Kalamande.  
Shobra Kamaseti.  
 See, I don't fight for patience because I've got patience, that's long-suffering.  
I've got patience.  
I've got patience.  
I know how to wait.  
I may not like to wait, but I know how to wait.  
Say, walk in the Spirit.  
Now, that's the beginning of training your Spirit to have the right character before your Spirit can be a sure guide.  
 or you didn't hear me.  
Hallelujah.  
Give me the four factors, want to go.  
Again.  


  
 and walking in the Spirit.  
And then you begin training your Spirit to be dependable.  
Begin training your Spirit to be dependable with these things I just read to you.  
When you train your Spirit to be dependable with the right character, then you can be guided through your Spirit.  
 When we start praying now, what are you going to do?  
You stare at your spirits by praying in tongues.  
Glory to Jesus.  
Praying the Holy Ghost now.
