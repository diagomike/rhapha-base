title: The Gift of the Holy Spirit
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 You are shining and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 People gather in their thousands for meetings with the man of God, Pastor Chris.  
There is always a release of the supernatural and enormous impartation of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding at these meetings, bringing about an unveiling of deep truths that keep the attendee  
 on the pathway of unending prosperity and all-around success.  
This same experience was played out at the International School of Ministry Ministries Network Conference 2014 held in Johannesburg, South Africa.  
The day three of the three-day conference witnessed the drawing of curtains of the conference.  
It was a gathering of ministers and delegates to strategize to further God's vision for world evangelization.  
 In this impactful and inspiring DVD, the man of God, Pastor Chris, takes the ministers through the classic teaching, the three cardinal gifts expounding on the gift of the Holy Spirit.  
We started on Monday to discuss three cardinal gifts of God.  
 in Christ Jesus through the gospel.  
And we said the first one is eternal life.  
And we gave some explanation.  
The second one we said is righteousness, the righteousness of God.  
And we discussed that yesterday.  
And tonight  
 What is causing the third one, which is what we found in Acts chapter 2 and verse 38.  
Can we read that verse again?  
Acts chapter 2 and verse 38.  
Can we have it?  
 Then Peter said unto them, repeat and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins.  
And he shall receive the gifts of the Holy Ghost.  
So that's the third one.  
We said, it's the gift of the Holy Ghost, the gift of the Holy Ghost.  
So we said, these are gifts of God.  
 Eternal life is a gift of God.  
Righteousness is a gift of God.  
You cannot work enough to obtain eternal life.  
You can't get eternal life by paying the price for it.  
There is nothing in this world that you could ever do to give you eternal life.  
It's a gift of God.  
And the same thing about righteousness as we talked about last night.  
 The Holy Spirit of God now, by the way, the King James translation uses Holy Ghost.  
Ghost and Spirit are one and the same thing for the King James translation.  
So it's Holy Spirit, same thing King James calls Holy Ghost, it's Holy Spirit.  
But you know, in some languages, they don't have a word for Ghost.  
They use the same word for Spirit as they use for Ghost.  
 But even though a ghost is a spirit, every spirit is not a ghost.  
So it's actually a misnomer to have it called Holy Ghost in King James' rendering.  
So it's actually better as Holy Spirit.  
But for those of us who are used to King James, we will continue to say Holy Ghost from time to time.  
Hallelujah.  
 So this Holy Spirit of God is a gift.  
He is God's gift to us.  
What is so important about this gift?  
Just as the first and the second one are so important.  
The gift of God is eternal life.  
 Tunnel life is so important.  
Without eternal life, you don't have the same nature with God.  
There's no communication.  
There's no relationship.  
See, tunnel life is God's life given to you.  
How important is that?  
See, so righteousness, same thing.  
So important, without righteousness, you can't stand before the Lord.  
 So these are very important gifts.  
So the Holy Spirit is an extraordinary gift to us as God's children.  
And first, because the Holy Spirit  
 If I want to use computer language, today's computer language, the Holy Spirit is like the downloader.  
You see, without the Holy Spirit, you can't get heavily materiality into the human system.  
It takes the power of the Holy Spirit to download, you see, heavily fires.  
You get it?  
Aha!  
The heavenly materiality into the human system.  
 It takes the Holy Spirit to do that.  
It takes the Holy Spirit to give you the understanding of God's Word.  
It takes the Holy Spirit for you to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  
You would not know that without the Holy Spirit.  
There's no reasoning in this Word that can convince you that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  
No human reasoning will ever convince you.  
There's no way.  
Because how do you know God?  
Who is God?  
 He can't even know you.  
It takes the Holy Spirit to introduce you to the Heavenly Father, to help you accept that truth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.  
Only the Holy Spirit can help you understand that.  
Only the Holy Spirit can help you accept the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.  
The sacrificial death of Jesus Christ.  
 the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the ascension of Jesus Christ.  
Only the Holy Spirit can convince you that the blood of Jesus Christ was adequate for our salvation.  
Only the Holy Spirit can help you understand all of that.  
Without the Holy Spirit, you've never knew it.  
You've never accepted it because there are no human parameters  
 for judging this.  
So when you find that you can accept these things, understand that the Holy Spirit has means that to you.  
You know, because we don't see the Holy Spirit, and we don't touch the Holy Spirit with our hands, and we don't relate to the Holy Spirit to our senses.  
Sometimes even when it means that's to us, we don't realize it's the one.  
For example,  
 When Jesus acts His disciples, whom do the men?  
Who the men say I am?  
And they say, well, some say you're John and Baptist.  
So they say you're Elijah, one of the prophets.  
He says, whom do you say I am?  
And they weren't so sure.  
Only Peter looked around and said, I know.  
You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God.  
Jesus' response was, Simon, flesh and blood, didn't reveal this to you.  
 He was my father.  
You see, he had to tell Peter.  
Peter didn't know he was God who revealed that to him.  
He didn't even know it was a revelation.  
See, Jesus had to tell him.  
And how did the father reveal that to him through the Holy Spirit?  
That's the work of the Holy Spirit.  
 And so I want you to understand that the gospel that we have been given, that we have been charged with to take to the notions of the word is a gospel that cannot be humanly accepted.  
So don't be surprised if they don't listen to you.  
There's no way for an ordinary man to accept it.  
So we need help from God because we had to be helped to accept it.  
Others must be helped to accept it.  
 Psalm 127.  
Let's look at verse 1.  
You have it Psalm 127, verse 1.  
I want you to read it.  


  
 Every pastor should know this.  
Accept the Lord build the house.  
They labor in vain that build it.  
Accept the Lord build the house.  
They labor in vain.  
If you're trying to build the Church of God, build the ministry for God, you're wasting your time.  
It's not going to work except the Lord does it.  
 Jesus said, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
He didn't say, come, let's build the church together.  
Did he say that?  
No.  
Did he say, help me build the church?  
No.  
He said, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
If you build it, the gates of hell will prevail against it.  
But if he builds it, the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
 He said, I will build my church.  
Accept the Lord, build the house.  
They labor in vain that builds.  
They labor in vain.  
So Jesus said, I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
I will build my church.  
The gates of hell shall not prevail.  
 He gave us the Holy Spirit.  
Honestly, the Holy Spirit is God.  
The Holy Spirit is God.  
The Holy Spirit is the voice of God.  
The Holy Spirit is the extension of God.  
You see it?  


  
 That's who the Holy Spirit is.  
The Holy Spirit is God at work.  
That's the Holy Spirit.  
God at work.  
That's the Holy Spirit.  
And for us to have the Holy Spirit in us is an amazing reality.  
 The Bible says the angels are still looking into it.  
They try to figure it out.  
How did this happen?  
But it's God's love for us.  
That means that God himself has taken a cold himself in us so that we are no longer ordinary beings.  
But now we are full of God.  
Did you know that that's God's plan?  
That you be full of God?  
Did you know?  
 Okay, let me just show you.  
Ephesians chapter 3.  
Let's begin reading from verse 14.  
For this course, this is Paul writing, and it says, for this course I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.  
You see, it's one family.  
 Some are in heaven and some are here, right?  
Glory to God.  
Yeah, of whom the whole family in heaven under His name, that He would grant you, you see He's praying for the church.  
This is the Spirit's prayer, that He would grant you according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with knights.  
That's miracle working ability.  
 by His Spirit in the inner man.  
He wants us to be strengthened by the Holy Ghost inside us.  
This prayer of the Spirit evidently is the will of the Father because it's the inspired prayer for the church.  
Such that none of us should be weak.  
 None of us should be all, Lord, I am so weak.  
No, that you be strengthened with might by the Holy Ghost in your inner man.  
You are strong inside.  
You may look feeble outside, but inside you you are strong.  
This is God's desire.  
It's God's dream.  
It's God's plan for ever one of us.  
 If you ever feel like you're not strong inside, pray this prayer for yourself.  
You put your name there that he wouldn't hurt me according to the riches of his guru, to be strengthened by his spirit in my inner man.  
And when you pray that prayer, don't wait for something to happen.  
 because it's God's will revealed.  
All you say is, I receive, therefore in the name of the Lord Jesus, He has granted me, according to the riches of His glory, that I have been strengthened, therefore am I is strengthened with might by the Holy Ghost in a man.  
I'm strengthened of God.  
Hallelujah.  
I told you you must respond to God.  
Respond to God.  
 So you can pray this prayer for a thousand years and it will not do anything for you until you receive it.  
Your response, you can keep praying it, you've got to receive it.  
You've got to receive it.  
It's a prayer written, but where is the response?  
Can you see it?  
 So I received, he has granted me, according to the riches of his glory, to his trainings, therefore am I strengthened with might.  
By his spirit in my inner man, I am strengthened of God.  
Hallelujah.  
Imagine when you're brewing, and say, Father, I thank you today, I am strengthened with might, by the Holy Ghost in my inner man.  
Glory to God.  
 All right, now, we get the next verse.  
We get the next verse.  
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.  
You see that?  
That's a prayer.  
But he does dwell in my heart by faith.  
He dwells in me by faith.  
That can settle in your hearts.  
Make a home.  
And he's done that.  
That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.  
That he, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend.  
 with all saints, what is the bread, and length, and depth, and height?  
And to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge."  
That's he?  
Oh, look at it there.  
That's where we're going to.  
That he might be filled with all the fullness of God.  
You see that?  
All of this is God's will.  
 This is the Spirit's prayer for the church.  
That means this is the will of God that we might be filled with all the fullness of God.  
As Jesus was filled with the fullness of God, God's desire is that I be filled with the fullness of God.  
No wonder he says be filled with the spirits.  
 Be filled with the Spirit.  
If you are filled with the Spirit, you are filled with God.  
Or he is himself God.  
This is God's plan.  
Imagine if every member of the church is filled with God.  
Filled with God.  
Not filled with doubt.  
Not filled with unbelief.  
Not filled with fear.  
But filled with God.  
What life we would live.  
 Then you understand Christianity, joy unspeakable and full of glory.  
So we end at the church singing with joy.  
Everyone is happy, everyone is dancing, full of joy, full of joy.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to His name forever.  
 So that's God's plan.  
That's God's will.  
That will be filled with the fullness.  
With the fullness.  
That means nothing left out.  
With the fullness of God.  
Repet with the fullness of God.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, you know, we don't always feel so.  
Even though the Holy Spirit lives in us.  
We don't always feel like He does.  
 And that's why sometimes we feel the anointing of God and sometimes we don't.  
There's a difference between the anointing and the spirits.  
The anointing is the working of the spirits in your life.  
The anointing itself is not the person.  
The Holy Spirit is a person.  
But there is an influence of that person in your life.  
That's the anointing.  
That's why you can feel  
 the anointing, but the person of the Holy Spirit, you may not feel him.  
Because you see, he is not occupying some area of your life.  
He is one with your spirit now.  
He is mingled with your spirit now.  
He is one with you.  
The Bible says, he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.  
Not two.  
One spirit.  
You are joined with the Lord.  
You are one spirit with him.  
 No return, God.  
So, sometimes you feel the anodulation of God.  
Oh, I feel the anodulation all the time.  
When I say all the time, I don't need every second.  
I mean every now and then.  
 Because if we were to stay with the feeling of the anointing, I'm not sure we'll be able to do it.  
I think I can explain it.  
Because when I feel the anointing of God's spirits, a lot of times it's like cars of power going through me, going through me.  
And sometimes it increases so strong.  
It just keeps going through.  
It's going through.  
 And it doesn't mean that you've got to use it for something at that time.  
It's just the presence of God that you're feeling and enjoying, ecstatic, wonderful, awesome.  
Sometimes it's a dear Lord, Jesus.  
It's wonderful.  
Oh, they're not in the Gods yet.  
 They just enjoy it.  
They just enjoy that warm feeling of the Holy Ghost.  
Born to come in this next segment on the three cardinal gifts, Pastor Christ elaborates on the laying on of hands as a practical ministry of the Holy Spirit and ministering the gift of the Holy Ghost as a supernatural manifestation of God's Spirit in the life of the Christian.  
You will also understand its importance in ministry.  
 the Northern and God.  
And it's things that we cannot control.  
There are things that we cannot control.  
You know, the Bible says the spirit of the Prophet is subject to the Prophet.  
But that doesn't mean everything.  
See, that doesn't mean everything is subject to you from God.  
There are things that are done by God.  
There are things that are  
 beyond us.  
Sometimes they are beyond us.  
Sometimes they are known, for example, why do people fall?  
Even when they are thinking, I will never fall.  
And they are picked from the ground.  
Because it was beyond them.  
You see, that was the blessing of God, but it was beyond them.  
 Sometimes I feel that function, that I know by bridging my body in a way that I cannot stop it.  


  
It's not our making.  
 The things that happen.  
And we need to recognize the Holy Spirit's work in our lives and encourage the work of the Holy Spirit.  
One of the things a lot of God's children need to understand is that God's work needs to be encouraged.  
How do you encourage the work of God in your life by responding?  
By responding.  
Eli taught Samuel to respond.  
That was to encourage God's work in his life.  
 He was being raised to be a prophet.  
He had to learn how to respond to God.  
Why was it that in the Bible they had the sounds of the prophets.  
They were in like a school of the prophets of some time.  
Because they were being trained on how to receive the Word of God and how to give the Word of God.  
You see, other prophets had to train the other prophets.  
God raised prophets like Elijah, Elijah to train others.  
 and they began to learn how to receive the Word of God and how to give the Word of God.  
What we're doing here, we didn't start it.  
It's been there since Bible days.  
From time to time you will see how God will raise someone to inspire some others, to help some others.  
 When the children of Israel needed to be brought out of Egypt, God sent a man.  
By this is by a prophet, Israel was delivered.  
And by a prophet was Israel preserved.  
By a prophet.  
This is by an angel, by a prophet.  
And the reason is, the inauguration of God is in a person, a human being.  
He puts that unknown in a human being and sends that human being to you.  
 And what he wants to do at that time is to recognize the analogy.  
If you are pastoring people, and those people don't recognize that the analogy of God is on your life, to help them through the office of a pastor, you cannot help them.  
They have to recognize it.  
You see, they have to recognize it.  
 And if you actually stand in that office and you function in that office, that anointing will go through you, work through you to help you.  
That is the Spirit's calling on your life.  
But that is the Spirit's blessing for them.  
Sometimes things like this have to be taught.  
Don't expect that they should just know.  
They may not know.  
And when you teach such things, teach them with humility,  
 All right?  
Don't teach them because you seek anything from them.  
Don't teach them that because you seek to oppress them, or compare them to do anything.  
No, just teach what the word says, so they may know.  
Because if they know, then they can respond.  
If they know, then they can respond.  
Many years ago, a great bar of rabbits administering healing to some people.  
He would say to them, do you believe I'm anointed?  
 with the healing power of God.  
And if they said, yes, then he reached out his hand and touched him, and they got healed.  
Because they had to respond to the unknown.  
They had to accept the unknown.  
He was not alone in that.  
Same thing.  
You started the Bible.  
You said, you've got to accept that prophet's voice.  
You've got to accept the ministry that is sent to you.  
And when you accept it, it will work.  
It will produce results.  
 If they didn't accept Jesus, they couldn't be blessed.  
If we didn't accept Him, we couldn't receive Him.  
We have to believe who He is to blind men followed Jesus.  
They were calling Son of David, have mercy on us.  
Son of David have mercy on us.  
He was quiet.  
Until He got to the house.  
Then He said to them, do you believe I am able to do it?  
And they said, yearlong.  
Then He said, receive your sight.  
 according to your faith bead on to it.  
Their eyes were open.  
He said, do you believe I'm able to do it?  
Just because you're crying doesn't mean you believe.  
So he asked them, do you believe I'm able to do it?  
Hallelujah.  
So this is very, very important.  
And for someone else to believe in the anodean of God that is on our lives, we must first believe it.  
 Do we recognize that an order?  
Do you realize that your pastoral ministry is not of men?  
Do you realize that the ministry that God has called you into is not human?  
Do you realize it's of God?  
Do you realize that the things you're doing you cannot do without him?  
This is the power of the Holy Spirit in your life.  
Do you accept that this is of God?  
It's not your own ability.  
If you can accept it, it will produce more results.  


  
 The Holy Spirit is a gift of God to us.  
And it is a gift that everyone, it's not proper when we say it is a gift.  
He is a gift.  
Because He is a person, you see.  
He is a person.  
He is God's gift to us.  
And so when we  
 Minister to the church, just like the other day I said, everyone who has not received the Holy Spirit should step aside, so we could have you minister to, so you could receive the Holy Spirit.  
And Sarah went over there.  
I understand there were over 100 of them who went over there and received the Holy Spirit.  
Now in the church, the same thing.  
If the members of your church are not filled with the Holy Spirit, you will have a terrible job.  
It'll be difficult for you.  
 It'll be difficult for you.  
If people are not yielded to the Holy Spirit, they'll have arguments, they'll have difficulty believing what you're saying, you know, telling stories about others in church, angry with one another, full of envy and bitterness and so on, they have to be filled with the Holy Ghost.  
See, it's the pastor's responsibility to see to it that they have filled with the Holy Ghost.  
Hallelujah.  
 There's a gift of God that's very important.  
It's called the lainon of hands.  
I'm not sure whether some of you realize that the lainon of hands is a gift of God.  
Everybody doesn't have it.  
It's a gift.  
You would notice some of the ministers who talk to you.  
You would notice that there are those who, when they lay hands on people, something happens.  
 All right?  
Then there are those who lay hands on people.  
You don't see any visible thing.  
Nothing really seems to happen.  
All right?  
Now, why is it so?  
Because the lainon of hands is a gift.  
 And so many states are given that gift.  
For example, the gift of prophecy is a gift.  
Everyone doesn't have the gift of prophecy.  
But it's God's will that every one of us should have the gift of prophecy.  
Because it told us to desire more, to prophesy, than any other gift.  
So we could be a blessing to the church.  
 You see, that's the same thing with lain of hands.  
One eye is the gift of lain of hands so important.  
First of all, maybe I should just read just one scripture.  
When you study more, you'll discover it for yourself.  
When you turn to the book of Acts, let's look at chapter 8.  
Let's begin with verse 16.  


  
 Okay, for us yet, he was falling upon none of them, only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus next.  
Then laid their hands on them, something about Peter and John who was sent to go lay hands on those who received Jesus in Samaria.  
 then laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost.  
Next verse.  
And when Simon, Simon the social, who had given his heart to the Lord, then Simon.  
When he saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money.  
 Next verse.  
Say and give me also this power that on whom so ever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghost.  
Stop there.  
What is he asking for?  
What is he asking for?  
Tell me something.  
What is he asking for here?  
 the ability to lay hands on people so that the Holy Ghost would be given.  
He is not asking for the Holy Ghost here.  
He was among those who received the Holy Ghost.  
Read the previous verses.  
He was among those who received the Holy Ghost.  
So, but he noticed that through the lainon of the apostles' hands, the Holy Ghost was given.  
So, he says, he gave the money.  
He said, give me this power.  
 You see it?  
So that anybody on whom I lay my hands would receive the Holy Ghost.  
So, are we clear what he's asking for?  
Is it clear to you he's not asking for the Holy Ghost?  
Because anyway he already received the Holy Ghost.  
So he's asking for the ability to transfer or transmit the Holy Ghost to someone else by the linen of hands.  
 Let's read it again, saying, give me also this power that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.  
So he's offering money to get this ability to lay hands on people.  
That's what he's asking for.  
That's what he's trying to buy.  
All right, next verse.  
But Peter said unto him, thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with thee.  
 The minority receives the Holy Ghost.  
So Peter refers to the layman of hands as the gift of God.  


  
So you see, it's a gift of God.  
And every minister of God that's called to take the gospel needs to have that gift so that you have the ability to transfer the blessings of God.  
When we lay hands on people, we  
 release into their lives, blessing, spiritual blessings of God.  
And so this is important.  


  
And so if you don't have that gift, you need it.  
So some ministers don't realize that it's a gift.  
So some some fantastic things about it.  
 They put hands on people and push them down.  
They say all kinds of nasty things because they don't know what it is.  
They don't know what it is.  


  
Don't leave here without it.  
Don't leave without it.  
 But was that ministering and release in the knowledge of God?  
Actually, as I'm sharing, the knowledge of God is giving you, you know, release.  
But there are certain moments where you're going to be prompted by the Spirit to just lift your hands like this.  
And when you do, the knowledge of God will settle on your hands.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
 Then you find that all of us are increasing in the glory of God.  
The testimonies were hearing from Pastor Azba and from Evangelist Al-Aqaman and others.  
All these testimonies will increase in all of us.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
And in every nation, a glory of God be manifested.  
In every city, a glory of God be manifested.  
 Hallelujah.  
Okay.  
Now, I told you yesterday, I was going to say some things about the gifts, minister with the gifts of the Holy Spirit.  
Now, if you study in 1 Corinthians chapter 12, you read from verse 7, and you'll find that there's a list of  
 spiritual gifts, the called manifestations of the Spirit.  
These are manifestations of God's Spirit in our lives.  
These are supernatural manifestations.  
Every one of them listed there is supernatural.  
And then of course, if you would read in Romans 12th chapter from the sixth verse,  
 You'll also see some other gifts of God that are listed there.  
And these things will show you these supernatural things that happen with us.  
And among all of these gifts, you have two particular gifts that are very, very important.  
Actually, they're three in a way, but these are the Otran's gifts.  
 the gift of prophecy, the interpretation, the gift of diverse kinds of tongues, and then the interpretation of tongues.  
The reason these utterance gifts are so important is because they are the doorway to the supernatural.  
They themselves are supernatural, but they are like the entrance into greater gifts.  
See?  
 They usher you into the other gifts, into greater manifestations of the Spirit.  
And that's why when he tells us, you may all prophesy in that by course.  
That means every one of you, one by one, if you have the time, the whole church can prophesy one after the other.  
That's how important prophecy is.  
That he says every one of us is good.  
Then he tells every one of us to desire the gift of prophecy.  
 Because prophecy brings that encouragement, exhortation, comfort to the children of God.  
See, you're stared in your spirit, you're strengthened in your spirit, okay?  
The gift of prophecy does that for you.  
And when you are so strengthened, when you're so encouraged,  
 When the Spirit of God asserts you like that with inspiration, what happens is you have the boldness to do more.  
You have the boldness to cast out devils.  
You have the boldness to lay your hands in the sick.  
You have the boldness to preach the gospel.  
You have the boldness to do all the things that God has called you.  
You're so inspired of God.  
That's why the Autran's gifts are so important.  
So in the churches, don't quench the spirits.  
Don't quench the spirits.  
 There can be, you see, every service cannot be dedicated to it.  
But there can be certain services, quite the manifestations of the Spirit must be allowed.  
Otherwise, you will quench the Spirit.  
I told you yesterday, there are many churches that are supposedly churches filled with the Spirit, you know, the pastors believe in it, and they know all of this, but you don't find these manifestations, because they have no time for them.  
 No time.  
Month after month, not a single gift of prophecies in manifestation.  
Yet they believe in it.  
What is happening is they are continuous.  
So these things are necessary.  
Find opportunity for them.  
Create time.  
Create certain services.  
Even if it is once in months that you have such special services.  
Make sure you do.  
Give time.  
 to the manifestation of the Spirit in the church.  
Because you see, the more you have the Spirit, after all, what did he call the gift?  
Let's look at it.  
First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 7.  
Let's look at it.  
First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 7.  


  
 Why should you give time to the manifestation of the Spirit in the Church?  
How do you get yourself in the consciousness of the Spirit who prayers these and many more?  
You will learn in this concluding segment of the teaching, the three cardinal gifts.  


  
Read it.  
One, two, go.  


  
 They say, it's the manifestation of the Spirit.  
He calls this gift the manifestation of the Spirit.  
And then he says, it's given to every man to profit with all.  
That means for the common good, for the good of all of us.  
So these gifts are called the manifestation of the Spirit.  
So if we are not having these gifts in operation, what are we doing?  
We are stopping the manifestation of the Spirit from taking place.  


  
 So, encourage the manifestation of the skin.  
Not only in the prayer meeting, in the church.  
And a lot of times, the services that most men must attend  
 there we need the manifestation of the Spirit, more than any other service.  
Because there is where people need to be straining.  
A lot of the weak members of the Church attain those services, which we call main services.  
But they are the services we hardly give time to the Holy Ghost.  
It's a problem.  
So we keep on having weak churches when we shall have strong churches.  
 Hallelujah.  
Don't be afraid of those who are always looking at their watch when they are sitting in church.  
If the manifestation of the story is strong, they will stay.  
I mean, when I have a program called atmosphere for miracles lie.  
Now, when I have that meeting, they are aware before they come that the service will be at least eight hours.  
Can you imagine that?  
 They already aware before coming that the service would be at least eight hours.  
And so there's a time to enter and there's a time to close.  
And so if you're not staying till it's eight hours till we are done, don't come.  
And people still rush the tickets.  
Why?  
Because imagine for eight hours it's a supernatural power of God in demonstration.  
 When you come out of that place, you are soaked with God.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 They don't understand.  
They think they just come and just see Pastor Chris.  
Pastor Chris is just ministering to people.  
It's not like that.  
Like in this meeting now, we haven't called for a healing line, have we?  
We met day before yesterday.  
We met yesterday.  
We haven't called for a healing line because it's a different kind of meeting.  
Glory to God.  
So, give time.  
 to the manifestation of the Holy Spirit.  
Deep time.  
And when you do, don't say, okay, what do we do?  
How do I know what to do?  
The Holy Spirit will inspire you.  
He will show what will happen.  
The question is whether you have received the Holy Spirit yourself.  
If you have received the Holy Spirit, then he will manifest himself through you.  
When you preach or teach,  
 Before you do, learn to pray.  
Learn to pray.  
Praise God.  
Are you following what I'm saying?  
What am I saying?  


  
You know, I was telling you about prayer, the importance of prayer.  
 before you go to preach or teach.  
And I want to tell you why.  
It's not because you've not been praying.  
And then what kind of prayer should you pray?  
It is not so much about what you're going to say.  
As it is about getting yourself on that the anode.  
 getting yourself into the consciousness of the Spirit in prayer.  
And the prayer I'm talking about is not making war with God as if God is responsible for the lost sinners.  
No, he's responsible for their salvation.  
He didn't make them lose salvation.  
He is the one saving them.  
 He is the one wanting to heal them.  
So I'm going to talk about wrestling with God.  
You know, the old saints call it wrestling with God that we wrestle with him until he agrees to save them.  
But he didn't cause the problem.  
He is the solution.  
So in prayer, what kind of prayer should you pray?  
I'll give you the illustration from something that happened to me.  
How I got to learn this in a conscious way.  
 out a friend of mine.  
And I led him to the Lord.  
And so we began to preach together.  
He followed me a lot of times and I went to minister.  
So I taught him everything he knew.  
But there was something that God was going to teach me now through him.  
 And this was remarkable.  
And you can see how important it was because I took it all these years with me.  
Now, we were probably somewhere maybe 18 years old, 19 years old, somewhere.  
And when I would be going for any of these meetings, oh boy, I'll pray.  
 I would pray, I would pray, I would pray.  
I would talk and talk and talk and shout.  
And pray until my voice got hoarse already from prayer.  
So, by the time I got to preaching, I had little voice left.  
So, we were having another meeting and he was the one to preach on that occasion.  


  
 I said, I'm waiting, the meeting will be somewhere around 4 or 5 p.m.  
And all afternoon, I'm trying to get him to get ready.  
But each time I came, he was like sleeping.  
I didn't know whether to wake him up or not to wake him up.  
So I waited a while.  
While I was waiting, the bed began to shake.  
 What's that?  
Then it calmed down.  
So I decided to find out he was still in that position as though he was sleeping.  
So I went back.  
After a few minutes again, this vibration, the whole bed was shaking!  
So much!  
 Then, calm down again.  
I checked and I stood there.  
Until the next time, it shook.  
The vibration was so much.  
Hi!  


  
He wasn't saying anything.  
 So I left there, went back, and I was waiting.  
After a couple of more shaking like that, not vibration, he got up, started getting dressed.  
Now he was speaking in tongues, and he was talking, and I said, are you ready?  
He said, yes.  
 who went for the meeting.  
It was extraordinary.  
It was extraordinary.  
In fact, one of the miracles was a guy who was paralyzed.  
And instead of commanding the fellow to be healed, he said, receive the Holy Ghost to the paralysed man.  
 And when he said, receive the Holy Ghost, the man received the Holy Ghost and bounced off what he was lying on.  
Completely healed.  


  
Well, what was it?  
What was it doing on the bed?  
I'll tell you.  
I'll tell you what he was doing on the bed.  
 Because from then, I said, I do it.  


  
It's a very simple thing.  
It's called meditation.  
Meditation.  
 Meditation in prayer is so vital.  
Meditation in prayer is so vital.  
Meditation.  
Give yourself to meditation.  
Meditation.  
Then through meditation, your spirit will be conditioned.  
Conditions.  
 So the influence and atmosphere of the Holy Ghost for that meeting or for whatever the Spirit's plan is for your life at a particular point in time.  
Meditation.  


  
 give yourself to such meditation as to let the Holy Ghost.  
I'm not talking about, you know, just mere rumination on the Word.  
That's not what I'm talking about.  
I'm not talking about you quoting some Scripture, you know, I'm not talking about meditating on Scripture.  
That is another type of meditation.  
And that is important.  
You meditate on the Word.  
That is very vital.  
What I'm talking about right now is not the meditation on the Word.  
It's the meditation on the Spirit.  
 Are you following this?  
Remember this.  
We are born of the Word of God and we are born of the Spirit of God.  
That's what the Bible says.  
It says we're born of the Spirit and then it says we're born of the Word.  
So who are we born of?  
What are spirits?  
 Because you see the Word without the Spirit will not work.  
The Spirit without the Word will not work.  
Because the Spirit is the Spirit of God and the Word is the Word of God.  
And the Word of God became flesh and built among us.  
Without the Holy Spirit he couldn't do whatever he would say to do.  
So we are born of the Word through the Spirit and we are born of the Spirit through the Word.  
 So the word is important in your life, and the spirit is important in your life.  
So meditation on the word is one thing, and that is what many pastors know about, not many know about the meditation on the spirits.  
So this is the one I'm bringing to you understanding now, meditation on the spirits.  
Recognize that you have to meditate on the spirits.  
When you meditate on the spirit, he will transport you.  
 There is where you have the realm of visions and revelations.  


  
When you meditate on the spirit.  
You see, meditation on the spirit is actually communion with the spirit.  
You see, you set your heart on Him.  
Like this is my Son giving you heart.  
And let your eyes observe my wings.  
You see,  
 Let your eyes observe my wounds.  
So when you're meditating on the Holy Spirit, He starts taking you, He starts showing you things.  
Jesus says, I do what I see my Father do.  
You see, I see my Father.  
How?  
My vision.  
He knows what His Father is doing.  
So He does what the Father does.  
And who is this Father?  
The Holy Spirit.  
 So if you will meditate on the Holy Spirit, he will show you.  
Jesus said, he shall show him greater things.  
Talking about himself.  
Jesus said, the Father will show him greater things and he will marvel.  
He said, the Father will show him greater things.  
And the people will marvel.  
The first time when I started ministering to people en masse, you know, and I would say,  
 to receive the knowledge of God, and then by the hundreds, you know, it doesn't matter how many people, and they receive at once, the power that comes on them at once.  
What happened was, I was having this meeting, and I was going to pray for many leaders at once, just several years ago.  
And it was afternoon.  
 And I'm getting ready for the meeting to hold in the evening.  
And I began to say to the Lord, there are going to be many people to minister to.  
What do I do?  
I was thinking, how am I going to minister to them?  
Did that mean, what am I going to do?  
And the spirit of God took me to this scripture.  
He shall show him greater sense than the human mind.  
And the spirit said to me,  
 He'll do all at once.  
All at once.  
I said, all at once.  
Then he showed me in the spirit.  
Now, I'm lying down on a sofa in the after.  
And I'm meditating on the spirit of God.  
And he tells me, this is what you're going to do.  
He says, you give the word, and I'll do the rest.  
 And I said, yes, Lord.  
Thank You.  
Then, you see, the Spirit is showing me what He's going to do.  
And showing me what I have to do.  
So, I get ready.  
It's about time.  
I go for the meeting.  
 Get up the platform, and after preaching, and I call that group out, and they don't know what to expect.  
They're standing out there, and I'm on the platform.  
Then I say, in the name of Jesus, take it.  
And the whole group, almost a thousand of them, under the power.  
All at once.  
I said, Lord, that's faster than I could have done 10 people.  
 I said, that's faster.  
I said, I prefer that one.  
See, he can do anything so fast.  
So fast.  


  
Alleluia.  
So we have to accept the gift of God.  
You know, many years ago, I remember, as a man of God,  
 I saw a video of him.  
This was, interestingly, I didn't know anything about him until somebody showed me that video.  
And I was probably, I think, somewhere about 17, 18 years, somewhere.  
And this minister of God, oh, he said was.  
 by the gifts of the working of miracles.  
Stand up on your feet.  
In that one was he.  
And I went to the other one.  
And I said, by the gift of the working of miracles, stand up on your feet.  
And he got healed.  
And I was thinking, how did he know that that was by the gift of the working of miracles?  
 Even though I excelled in seeing miracles, I hadn't understood a lot of that yet.  
You're trying to learn.  
And I found out, yes, you can know.  
Just like you know, you've got a word of prophecy inside you.  
You haven't given it yet, but it's bubbling inside.  
You don't have to know everything you're going to say, but you know that the word is bubbling up in you.  
Same thing with all the gifts.  
That's the way the gets dead within you.  
 See, they start barbling up for expression.  
And so the man knew he had the work in the miracles.  
And by the gift of the work in the miracles, he caused those people to get healed.  
And they were healed.  
Hallelujah.  
I said, I thought that was wonderful.  


  
 So, you see, learning these things, they are practical things, and they're practicable.  
These are things in the Word of God that we should put to work in ministry, to put them to work in ministry, to be a blessing to others.  
They may be a blessing to others.  
Some of you who  
 You used to prophesy.  
You don't prophesy anymore.  
You stopped prophesying a long time ago.  
You have to start again.  
You have to start again.  
Because prophesy is very important.  
You should start again.  
Because it will lead you into greater things.  
Greater manifestations of the Holy Ghost.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
 And you know that there's such a thing as giving our faculties, you know, we've got our natural faculties with which we relate with the natural world.  
We also have spiritual faculties with which we relate with the Spirit realm, all right?  
 If we have to bring something from the Spirit Realm into this word, then there has to be a connection between our natural faculties and our spiritual faculties.  
For example, if I'm seeing something in the Spirit and I'm talking about it in the natural world, I am bringing something from the Spirit Realm into the natural world.  
 The ministry of a gospel is like that.  
We are bringing spiritual realities into this natural world so that men can heal, understand and act on the message so it can produce resolve for them.  


  
 The time of impartation was a special time of strengthening and invigoration for the ministers as they received increased grace and propelling words that will help them carry out ministry effectively.  
One truth rang through every delegate's testimony.  
The new level of ministry they had just stepped into by reason of the three-day confidence.  


  
 you
