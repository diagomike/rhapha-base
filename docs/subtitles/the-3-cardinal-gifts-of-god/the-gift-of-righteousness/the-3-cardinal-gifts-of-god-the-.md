title: The 3 Cardinal Gifts of God The Gift of Righteousness Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirit.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 The earth is being filled with the knowledge of the glory of God through the anointed ministry of our man of God, Pastor Chris.  
He has helped thousands of people discover a victorious life in God's Word.  
Cutting across all continents, people gather at meetings with the man of God, Pastor Chris, and witness the miraculous coming back with testimonies.  
 It was no different at the International School of Ministry Ministries Network Conference with Pastor Chris.  
This conference is an annual training platform exclusive to the ministers of the gospel from all around the world.  
 This year's edition, which held in Johannesburg, South Africa from the 7th to the 9th of April 2014, was a time where delegate ministers received aspirations and were informed from God how to do more in their Christian walk of faith.  
It was a three-day meeting full of glory and power.  
 The man of God, Pastor Chris, taught on the three cardinal gifts of God, which he mentioned to be the gift of eternal life, the gift of righteousness, and the gift of the Holy Spirit, emphasizing to the ministers the importance of living in the reality of these gifts.  
Watch as Pastor Chris continues his teaching on the gift of righteousness, taking the ministers on a journey far above the realm of religion.  
 be inspired as you watch.  
This message unveils the kingdom of God, the reality of the kingdom of God.  
What Jesus came to do?  
What he brought to this world?  
Did you think he came to die just to bring up another religion?  
There were more than enough religions in the world before Jesus came.  
The world never needed another religion.  
 This world doesn't need religion.  
This world needs reality.  
Truth.  
Christ Jesus.  
But you know, they think Jesus is a religion.  
That's what they think it is.  
They think Christianity is a religion.  
And it's not.  
It's a life of God and a human person.  
Hallelujah.  
It's eternal life at work in the human being.  
 the kingdom of God walking in you.  
He says, Christ in you, the hope of glory.  
Hallelujah.  
Christ in you, the hope of glory.  
Remember what he says, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  
But Christ in you, that glory that was lost, glory has been regained.  
 But you know, every time I say that, I like to point out something.  
Because I never like people to run away with the wrong idea.  
When they think that we have been restored to what Adam and Eve used to be in the garden.  
And I have to help them understand.  
No.  
Christianity does not restore us to what Adam and Eve used to have or be in the garden.  
No.  
 The Bible says, we were not born when you're born again.  
You're not born after the first Adam.  
You're born after the second and last Adam.  
Jesus Christ.  
So we have not been restored to what first Adam used to be.  
No, we're born after the second Adam, the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Hallelujah.  
 That's where we are.  
I'm in Him and He is in me.  
Glory to God.  
So you can understand everything that we do.  
Just has to be excellent.  
Because I have an excellent spirit.  
I'm excellent.  
I'm excellent.  
And I'm full of glory.  
My life is full of glory.  
 Imagine if you hadn't understood something like this, and you get to church next Sunday, and you get behind the pulpit, and you say, praise the Lord, and they go, hallelujah.  
And you say, I'm excellent and full of glory, huh?  
And some of the folks might think that you've lost your mind, or maybe, let's say our little pastor is becoming proud.  
Because your language has changed.  
 See, I'm excellent.  
You know, when they say, how are you doing?  
How are you?  
You say, oh, I'm excellent.  
I'm full of glory.  
I'm excellent.  
I'm full of glory.  
It's not enough to say fine.  
You're more than fine.  
You're excellent and full of glory.  
Hallelujah.  
 It's about your life.  
You're working together with Christ.  
Oh, I love this.  
Genesis chapter 5.  
Let me show you something.  
Genesis chapter 5.  
Let's read verse 24.  
Read it for me.  
Can you see it?  
Want to go.  


  
 This is amazing.  
Enoch walked with God.  
Can you work with God?  
Enoch walked with God.  
And you know, when he was 65 years old, was when he had a son named Methuselah.  
And then after he had that son, he lived 300 years.  
 Now, as before him lived many years, but he lived 300 years, 300 years for Methuselah to watch his father walk with God.  
No wonder he was the man who lived longest in the world.  
Methuselah lived longer than anybody else.  
 He was there.  
He watched his father walk with God for 300 years until the man just jogged into heaven.  


  
Hallelujah.  
What kind of a man was he?  
The Bible tells us he was a prophet of God in the Book of Jude who had told us a prophet.  
This man was a prophet.  
 So he was no ordinary person, a prophet of God.  
He was the one who said, the Lord comes with tens of thousands of his saints.  
He says he comes with tens of thousands of his saints.  
How could he have such a vision?  
He tells you what manner of man he was.  
He walked with God.  
 and they couldn't find him, for God took him.  
The Bible says before his translation, he had the testimony he knew.  
He had the testimony that he pleased God.  
He knew it.  
See, when you please God in your life, you can know it.  
It's not a guesswork.  
I don't know whether God is pleased with me or God is going to say, Oh Lord, please.  
 Please have mercy on me, please be pleased with me.  
No!  
You can know.  
You see, the Bible tells us that our spirit bears witness with the Holy Ghost.  
The Holy Spirit of God bears witness with our spirits.  
That we are the children of God.  
There's a witness.  
The Bible says he that had this record, he that believes in him had this witness in himself.  
You have the witness in yourself.  
It's in your heart, in your spirit.  
You know it inside you.  
If you don't have it in you, you need to be born again.  
 Hallelujah.  
Oh, the righteousness of God.  
What a gift.  
What a gift.  
What a gift that I don't have to attain it.  
You know many don't understand.  
They look at the righteousness of God from its results rather than from its source.  
Right living, that means living rights.  
 Right living is a resort of righteousness.  
Right living is not a righteousness.  
It is a resort of righteousness.  
So there are many who think that if they could live rights, then they will have the righteousness of God.  
No, you could never become righteous by living rights.  
It's not possible to become righteous by living rights.  
It's not possible.  
 Why?  
How could you live what you don't have?  
Which law do you want to apply?  
Old law or new law?  
Is it the Old Testament law that could not be obeyed?  
The Old Testament law that has been abrogated, abolished?  
Is that what you want to follow?  
It's been abolished in a way.  
And plus that it was only given to Jews.  
 And even if you're a Jew, you have no right to follow it today.  
It's been abrogated, abolished, wiped away.  
You don't need to follow it.  
It's been replaced by a new one.  
And this new one is given to the sons of God.  
Hallelujah.  
So why would you want to try to live according to the old law?  
 So if you say the new one, what does a new one ask you to do?  
It demands two things.  
One is that you believe in Jesus Christ.  
And the other one is that you walk in love.  
Two things you cannot do until you have Christ in you.  


  
So you can achieve it.  
You can walk in love.  
 He must have Christ to walk in love.  
He must have Christ to live right.  
So here's the other thing.  
Until you are righteous, God does not expect you to produce righteousness.  
God will be remiss to ask you to do what you couldn't do.  
 That's why He gives you righteousness.  
Knowing that once you become righteous, you can live righteously.  
So right living is the result of your righteousness.  
So once you receive the gift of righteousness, now you can live right.  
Now you can please God.  
Now your life will be the manifestation of His righteousness, of His goodness, of His holiness.  
All of this will come out of you.  
And you will also know it and you'll be happy about it.  
 Because your life will be the life on the Word of God, living out the Word of God.  
Hallelujah.  
That's what makes Christianity beautiful.  
Text it away from the realm of religion.  
Makes it beautiful.  
Every day you enjoy being a Christian.  
You just keep saying, what a life, what a life, what a life.  
Because it's full of glory all the time.  
 How can you explain in life where the Bible tells us that there's no disadvantage to you and you know it?  
All things work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are the cord according to his purpose.  
All things work together for good.  
No matter what happens, you just stand there and you shake your head and say it's working out for my good.  
Hallelujah.  
No disadvantage.  
 No disadvantage.  
No matter what happens, the scripture is clear.  
All things, all, not some, all things work together for good to then that love God.  
Nothing for your disadvantage.  
Nothing.  
It's not there, it doesn't exist.  
All things work together for good to then that love God.  
That's me.  
I love God.  
 And you see, because I love God, and he ought to be better than I am, if I thought I was better than God, then I'll say, I love God so much, and I can understand why he's doing this to me.  
You know, that's how some people think.  
God knows I love him.  
So why is he doing this to me?  
What you're trying to say is you are better than God.  
You think you love God.  
You are so kind to God, and he's mistreating you.  
 But if you dare think that God's a good God, then you say, I love God.  
So I know all things are working out for my God.  
So when I tell you, are you aware that this and this and this is, are you aware, you say, does it matter?  
Does it matter?  
That's your response.  
See, that's my response.  
Does it matter?  
 You see, that's not a factor.  
I don't change anything.  
It can change who I am.  
You see, it can change the glory in my life.  
Is that a factor?  
You care about that?  
No, no, no, I just want you to know.  
You just want me to know.  
I know something better than that.  
Glorious things are spoken of the whole city of God.  
Hallelujah.  
 Oh glory.  
These glorious things are spoken of thee, all city of God.  
Who am I?  
The city of God.  
Hallelujah.  
That's where I belong.  
 It's time to change your language.  
It's time to upgrade.  
It's time to raise your vision.  
Still to come in this classic teaching on the three cardinal gifts of God.  
Learn more about righteousness, sanctification, and justification all in this power-packed segment ahead.  
Watch as Pastor Chris teaches the ministers the right pattern to preach, encouraging them to preach the gift of righteousness, not the message of condemnation.  
 be inspired as you watch.  
Glorious things are spoken of thee.  
Not demeaning things, not unhappy things.  
No, no, no, a thousand times, no.  
Glorious things are spoken of thee.  
Hallelujah.  
That's why I walk, that's the, that's the, that's the, I said, I said, raise your vision.  
Raise your vision.  
 Stop looking at the darkness.  
Raise your vision and help the congregation to raise their vision.  
Change your language.  
Become conscious of what you say to the church because they are the body of Christ.  
Don't talk them down.  
No!  
Never come into the church with a message of condemnation.  
 They are beaten enough and broken enough outside than to come into the house of God and be beaten again.  
They come to the house of God to be strengthened, to be encouraged, hallelujah, so they can go out there and win with confidence.  
Never let them come into the church and be brought low.  
 And then they go out, you know, people come to church like this, and then they go like this.  
It's not good.  
When they come to church like this, let them go out shouting, go away!  
Whoo!  
Then you know they've been in church.  
They come out to the car park and go, whoo!  
Go away!  
See?  
And then he's flinging his car keys and you know, go away!  
 Not like he just got a whip in the church.  
He just got cained in church.  
And everybody's going back home like this.  
Hello, brother.  


  
Look at the disciples of Jesus.  
One day, I mean the former disciples of John, they've been with John, John the Baptist.  
 And John the Baptist, you know, he was like Elijah, Jeremiah.  
He was like one of them prophets, you know?  
That's the way he was.  
Always looking out for your sin.  
Your sin shall find you out.  
That was John.  
And when the people repented, he said, who told you to repent?  


  
That's John the Baptist.  
 So, two of his disciples, one day, went to see Jesus.  
When they got to Jesus' house, they were surprised that he had a house in the first place, because they had been following John to the wilderness and everywhere, you know.  
It was a hard life.  
So, this time they came with Jesus, and they were so surprised.  
Read your Bible, I'm not making this stuff up, it's there.  
So, they were looking around.  
 And then they kept asking Jesus questions and asking questions and asking questions and it was getting dark.  
They knew it was getting dark.  
They didn't want to go back.  
They're asking Jesus questions until they thought like, we can't really go back tonight.  
And Jesus said, all right, it's dark.  
You can stay.  
They stayed not only that night.  
They never went back to John.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
I mean, this was wonderful.  
This was wonderful.  
I mean, how do you like it to come to a place where when they pray, it's not do it Lord, do it Lord, do it Lord, do it Lord, do it Lord.  
Ah, do it, do it, do it.  
No, you just say in the name of Jesus and it's done.  
Hallelujah.  
Go rid of God.  
 No need to pound on God.  
Do it Lord, do it Lord, do it Lord.  
Hey, do it Lord.  
You don't need that.  
If you say it once, he will hear you.  
If you have to say it again, he don't have to shout at him.  


  
So they came to Jesus and they just loved him.  
He was different from John.  
 And listen, this Jesus we're talking about is Himself God.  
I mean, you want to copy somebody?  
This is the real deal.  
Jesus Christ.  
It doesn't get better than that.  
So if you want an example, that's the man.  
You can get any better.  
So when they got to Jesus, they had found their rest in place.  
 This was what their soul was seeking.  
Oh, they knew they had arrived.  
Why do we go back to John?  
We are home now.  
We are home now.  
Glory to God.  
It's so important.  
This is righteousness.  
The nature of God.  
Hallelujah.  
It's the nature of God.  
 Preach it, teach it, help them understand that God has made them righteous in Christ Jesus.  
And that it is a gift.  
They don't have to struggle for it.  
They don't have to attain it.  
It is unattainable.  
But it is a gift on the blood of Jesus Christ.  
Somebody paid to make it happen.  
And here's another thing.  
That makes it even more beautiful.  
 You see, righteousness, even though it was a gift, it was a gift well deserved.  
You say, what?  
I thought that was the unmerited favor, not quite, and I want you to hear me well.  
Righteousness was given to us, not as an unmerited favor, but a gift well deserved.  
Why?  
I'll explain.  
 You see, Christianity didn't start before the cross.  
Christianity didn't start on the cross.  
Christianity started after the resurrection.  
What does that mean?  
When God raised Jesus from the dead, He was raised  
 with the righteousness of God.  
Are you following this?  
And the Bible says, we were raised together with him.  
He says, Thou art my son.  
This day have I begotten thee.  
Jesus was born again.  
Can you see that?  
So he was the first of the new creation.  
And we came to life with him.  
So we were new creations in Christ Jesus.  
 Not what we were before.  
Not the sinus who deserved no mercy.  
Not the sinus who were condemned.  
No, all our sins were buried with him.  
Our old man was crucified with him.  
 Our old nature was crucified with Him.  
All of what was condemnable was crucified with Him.  
And when Jesus was raised from the dead, a new creation came up with Him.  
This is the second Adam, Hallelujah.  
And we came up a new creation, no pasts.  
And because we were His creation,  
 He gifted us with righteousness.  
Can you see it?  
This is not unmerited.  
No.  
We didn't create as ours.  
We didn't work for it.  
We deserved to have it because we belong to Him.  
We are His new creation, so He gave it to us.  
He made us so.  
Can you see it?  
I don't know if you've got that.  
Very important.  
 where those Christianity began.  
Until you know that, you'll have problems with how you work with God.  
You won't realize that you are, it says, therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God throughout Lord Jesus Christ.  
Do you know what that means?  
Being justified by Romans of the 5th as well.  
Being justified by faith.  
Let me explain that.  
It means being declared righteous by faith.  
That means acquitted, declared not guilty.  
 That means we were brought to the judgment seat.  
And when we stood before God's judgment, He said these are new creations.  
They are not guilty.  
 Understand the justification was not because somebody paid for us.  
I want you to understand this I want you to understand this Jesus paid for the whole world of sinus Christians are not sinus Christians are not from the world Christians came from after the dead barrier they came with a resurrection a new creation That's Christianity That's why they're justified  
 The whole world was paid for by Jesus.  
But when you believe in Jesus, you are recreated.  
You are born again.  
You are a new creation.  
You are justified.  
Hallelujah.  
 So you walk as a man that's justified.  
I got a new life.  
Barbara says he was delivered on account of our transgressions, on account of our sins, but he was raised again for our justification, glory to God.  
So justification is one of the biggest words of the New Testament.  
We talk about righteousness, sanctification, justification.  
These are all so powerful.  
You need to understand what justification really means.  
That's why I explained it to you.  
 Hallelujah.  
You're justified because you're a new creation.  
He says, if any man be in Christ, oh, what a song.  
What a song.  
This is climactic.  
He says, if any man be in Christ, he is.  
He is.  
He's not going to be.  
He's not hoping to be.  
He is a new creation.  
All things are passed away.  
All things are become new.  
Hallelujah.  
 Oh, what a song.  
What a song.  
What a song.  
Sing it to the nations of the world.  
That's why we're telling men and women to come into Christ.  
Because if you come into Christ, you will become a new creation.  
Your path will cease to exist.  
And here's the beautiful thing.  
When he says a new creation, he means a new species.  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.  
He means a new type of man.  
Do you understand?  
 He says, of his own will, he begat us with the word of truth.  
We were born with the word of truth, that we should be a kind, a type, a type hallelujah, a species of fast fruits of his creatures.  
Shout out to him and somebody.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 a new type of man.  
We are not what we used to be.  
There is a newness of life.  
We are not what we used to be.  
Can you shout amen, somebody?  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
We have to tell it everywhere.  
 This is what Jesus came to do.  
He came to give us a new life, to make us new creations, a new type of man.  
This is another kind of human being with the divine nature.  
Hallelujah!  
Oh, glory to God.  
No wonder we cannot be overcome.  
We are a new type of man.  
 Can you see it now?  
A new type.  
A new kind.  
We cannot be broken.  
We cannot be defeated.  
We have victors forever.  
Hallelujah.  
Every one of us is a champion.  
Can you shout amen to somebody?  
Hallelujah.  
Oh glory to God.  
 This is the International School of Mystery Ministers Network Conference with Pastor Chris.  
Do you know that in the mind of God, each one of us is a success?  
Everything you require to fulfill all that God has called you to do is already available.  
Learn more about these and much more as Pastor Chris concludes this insightful teaching on the gift of righteousness, showing the ministers how to speak and relate with the Word of God.  
 Watch and be fired up.  
You have to tell the whole world?  
Let them know why Jesus came, what he came to do.  
You know, a lot of people say, oh, Jesus came to do this and just question, did he accomplish it?  
Was it done?  
Yes, I'm the fruit of it.  


  
 I'm his joy.  
The Bible says he shall see his seed.  
He shall prolong his days.  
And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hands.  
So I'm his seed.  
I'm his joy.  
He's happy about me.  
I'm the fruit of his work.  
 Hallelujah.  
Look at divisions chapter 3 verse 20.  


  
Now on to him that is Abel.  


  
 unto Him that is able to do, exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us.  
Can you see it now?  
Not according to the power in heaven.  
Not according to the power that's coming from heaven.  
 according to the power that works in us.  
What is this power able to do?  
Look at it.  
To do abundantly says exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.  
According to the power that works in us.  


  
 I said, he's walking in me.  
Every fiber of my peer, every bone of my body, every cell of my blood, in my whole spirit, my soul and my body.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, for the God.  
Woo!  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  


  
Oh, and the God.  
 Oh, glory to God.  
Glory.  
Sit down.  
Glory to God.  
Glory to God.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Tell somebody, say I'm a success, I'm a success.  
Yes!  
Woo!  
I'm a success.  
Hahaha.  
Yeah, I know, I know.  
I'm a success.  
Hallelujah.  
Hey!  


  
 You know, tomorrow I'm going to be talking about the thought gift.  
 And I already told you that's the Holy Ghost, right?  
So we're talking about that tomorrow.  
But you know what I'm thinking?  


  
Can you imagine God's plan?  
But each one of us is a success in the mind of God.  
 You know, there are people who failed, not because God wanted them to fail.  
They failed because they were ignorant.  
God said, my people are destroyed, defeated, broken, paralyzed for the lack of knowledge.  
The knowledge of the Word of God.  
That's the only thing that leads to a Christian being defeated in life.  


  
 I refuse to be ignored.  


  
And you know, the sun about God's righteousness in you, it causes everything to work out in accordance with His righteousness.  
 You see, it is a righteous thing with God to do you good.  
I want you to understand the Scriptures.  
It is a righteous thing with God to do you good.  
It is His righteousness to be good to you because that is His nature.  
Can you see it?  
Which means everything.  
It is consistent with His righteousness to channel all necessary resources towards you.  
 such that you don't lack anything, anything.  
For all the daughters called you to do, it has to be your mentality.  
You've got to accept this as reality.  
In fact, I want you to even say it now.  
Say, I have everything that I require for all the daughters called me to do.  


  
 Turn to 2 Peter chapter 1.  
Let me just show you this.  
See, until your life becomes the Word, when you talk, you talk the Word.  
Your life is the Word of God in action.  
That's the way it's supposed to be.  
But you keep growing.  
You see, you keep growing, learning more and more.  
 Yeah, 7 Peter chapter 1, we read from verse 1, just want to show you something.  
So Simon, Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God.  
Did you see that?  
They obtained what?  
Like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God, now save you Jesus Christ next.  
 Grace and peace be multiplied onto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.  
Grace and peace can be multiplied in your life.  
You want more grace?  
More peace in your life?  
No need to cry.  
He says through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord, that knowledge is epipnosis.  
You understand?  
He's dealing with absolute knowledge, specialized knowledge, knowledge that relates with that which is known.  
 That's a pygnosis.  
The epignosis of God and of Jesus our Lord.  
So it's a knowledge with relationship.  
It's not a kind of knowledge.  
You say, I know this, this function.  
No, that is not a pygnosis.  
In a pygnosis there's a relationship with what you know.  
All right.  
So through the knowledge of God now of Jesus our Lord.  
Next verse.  
 According to this divine power, look at the tenses.  
According to this divine power, half a given unto us.  
What kind of a man was Peter?  
You can see it from his writing.  
Look at that.  
According to this divine power, half a given unto us are things that pertain unto life and godliness.  
I just told you, I said, everything you require to fulfill all that God has called you to do is already available.  
It's right there.  
 He's the vine power has made it available.  
Look at it right there.  
According to He's the vine power has given unto us.  
That means has granted us all things that pertain unto life and godliness.  
That what godliness refers to your life of godliness, the things that God has called you to do, your life in God.  
That's what he's talking about.  
 You see that?  
And it says, through the knowledge of him that had called us to what?  
Glory and excellence.  
That's what that word virtue is.  
He's called us to glory and excellence.  
So what a life.  
I'm called to glory and excellence.  
Not in short of it.  
My life is for glory and excellence.  
Come, what may?  
My life is for glory and excellence.  
 That's it.  
So what is it you require to fulfill the godly life that God has called you into?  
It's available.  
You say, I have it.  
Satan may try to tell you, how are you going to get it?  
He says, shut up, devil, I got it.  
I have it already.  
Then he says, show it to me.  
So I don't have to show it to you.  
We walk by faith, not by sight.  
Reply with the word.  


  
 If it is consistent with my Aeon, it will come to me or get to it.  
I'm in my journey.  
Everything that is good for me, necessary for me, has been granted me.  
It cannot elude me, because I'm walking in the light, as he is in the light.  
So what fellowship won't be with another.  
So I'm in fellowship with God.  
I'm walking in the light.  
 as he is in the light of my supply.  
In the mind of God, there's no luck to me.  
The Lord is my shepherd.  
I shall not work.  
So I say, I refuse to luck because the Lord is my shepherd.  
See, that's the way I put it because I always have to give God my response.  
 You know, David said, the Lord is my shepherd.  
I shall not once.  
So I said, Lord is my shepherd.  
Therefore, I refuse to lack.  
I refuse.  
I refuse to lack.  


  
Glory to God.  


  
 Some of you are finding the word coming out, the bubbling out of you.  
Even while you're sitting there, it's bubbling.  
Just, if it's bubbling like that, just let it come out.  
You don't even have to shout, just let it come out.  
Because that's the prophetic power that's working in you.  
It's bubbling.  
It's finding expression, you know?  
And you just let it go, kapaseya, all gay boy.  
I have it in the name of Jesus Christ.  
 I don't know what you've been looking for.  
I don't know what you've been praying for.  
But there's a word bubbling inside you right now.  
Hallelujah.  
He's inside you right now.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Say I'm full of life, I'm full of life.

I reject pain.  
I reject pain.  
I reject disease.  
I reject every affliction on the body.  
I'm full of life.  
I'm full of life.  
I'm called to glory and excellence.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.

Thank you Lord.  
I'm full of love.  
Hallelujah.
