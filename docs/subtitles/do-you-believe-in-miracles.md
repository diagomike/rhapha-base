title: Do You Believe in Miracles
---
 What I want for Jesus You are my friend.  
The Bible says, for to warn is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit.  
The ninth verse says to another faith by the same Spirit.  
 And then it says, to another, the gifts of healing, to another, the working of miracles.  
But it is by the Spirit of God.  


  
And as we preach around the world, they come by the tens of thousands, the hundreds of thousands,  
 and millions of them and they come to hear the word and to be healed of their sicknesses and their pains and afflictions.  
Many times we pray for them en masse and miracles happen without even touching anybody and so many are healed.

 Wave those crutches so I can see them.  
So many are restored to hell without even touching them.  
 We lay hands on people because Jesus said to lay hands on them.  
We speak the word to them because Jesus said to do the same.  
And we minister to them in exactly the way Jesus did in Bible days and they get Bible results every time when they believe in Jesus.  


  
 And Jesus said to me, tell the whole story to the whole story.  
And someone asked a question, do you believe in these miracles?  
How do you open their eyes?  
How can a lemon start working?  
 What is the source of your strength?  
At different times in life, people require these supernatural manifestations.  
Miracles are recorded for us in the Scriptures so that we might have faith in the power of a living resurrected Christ.  
The healing miracles performed through the ministry of Pastor Chris are done through the power in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God.  
 I believe in this miracle Is this him yesterday and today?  
He thinks my God is here to take you back He is here to help me out He is the source of my blood  


  
 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with Him.  
In the same way, for this purpose, God anointed Pastor Chris and He is doing the same things Jesus Christ began to do and teach.  
 Jesus healed many people, so many, many people, and He is still doing it today.  
In Matthew 8 verse 16, the Bible records that, when the even was come, they brought unto Jesus many that were possessed with devils, and He cast out the spirits with His word, and healed all that were sent.  
Many times in meetings with Pastor Chris, we witness the continuation of the works of Jesus Christ.  
 The Bible tells us how that Jesus gave the word.  
He would say, rise up and walk.  
Paul did the same thing.  
He would say, stand up.  
They just gave the word.  
They just spoke the word.  
Many times in these meetings, Pastor Chris just gives the word of knowledge or calls out specific cases.  
Someone who came into this place with a terrible spinal problem, you've been healed in your spine.  
 If you will move your back, move your back.  
That pain is gone, that trouble in the spine is gone.  
But someone with a very painful breast cancer that's being healed right now, nothing is burning up tonight.  
The pain is leaving you and that cancer dies in the name of Jesus.  
 At times, he stands in front of the sick person and gives an instruction, commanding the devil's out.  
We find someone who is carried in for the meeting, suddenly walking, jumping and running.  


  
 It's amazing and cannot be explained humanly.  
Many times, Pastor Chris also touches some and lays his hands on others, as Jesus did, and they are healed.  
In one of our many crusades, thousands gathered to hear the Word of God, to be taught by this great man of God.  
 They started coming from the early hours of the morning in anticipation of their miracles.  
And like in Bible days, they brought many that were sick with diverse diseases that he might heal them.  
Great was the faith of the people.  
And when they even was come, the man of God, Pastor Chris, stepped into the stadium with great power.  


  
 In that meeting, Cristiano, a 57-year-old woman who had suffered motor neuron disease from birth, received a healing touch.  
What happened to your limbs?  
I had a disease called motor neuron disease, and it affects the whole nerves.  
And the whole nerves?  
Yes.  
So it starts from the brain.  
The nerves collapse, and you can't move any part of it.  
 For how long has this been?  
I was born with it and said my mother was... You were born with it?  
Yes, my mother was trying to abort and... Your mother was trying to abort you when you were... In her womb, right?  
How old are you?  
I'm 57.  
You are 57!  
Bring that, bring that thing.  
 You're feeling the power of God, right?  
She's already feeling the power of God.  


  
You're feeling the power of God.  


  
Can we remove this grace?  


  
 Just a moment.  
You have to have this.  
Can you imagine growing up with things like this?  
Where's the second one?  
See that?  


  
Now, precious Jesus,  
 Thank you.  
Thank you.  
Thank you.  
Thank you.  
Woman in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.  
Our God is in you.  


  
 Would I have two people pick her up on either side?  
Pick her up.  
Hold her up.  
Now!  


  
 The power of God is on our.  
The power of God is on our.  


  
Yeah.  


  
Pick her up.  
Come.  
Come.  
 Perfect.  
On the side.  
Great.  
That's it.  
That's it.  
That's it.  
Okay.  
That's it.  
Pick up your leg like this.  
Do that faster.  
Somebody's there.  
Hallelujah!  
Come.  
Come.  
Let's go.  
Let's go.  
That's it.  
That's it.  
 And he gets stronger and stronger.  
Do it faster!  
Yeah!  
Yeah!  
Look at that man!  
How this brings to mind the story of the man laying from his mother's womb who set up the gate of the temple called beautiful in Acts chapter 3.  
And he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising God.  
Jesus is wonderful.  


  
 And the Father got me disturbed to me.  
I felt some heat by the side of my ear.  
And the whole body was shaking.  
And all of a sudden I felt some coolness.  
Cool.  
That was cool.  
I started walking.  
Praise the Lord.  
God is awesome.  
God is wonderful.  
I thank you, Jesus.  
I thank you for coming for me.  
Christina Liet, and Stern, and what, and praised God.  
 That night, Pastor Chris taught the Word of God's grace, which was able to build the people up and make them whole again.  
And surely, the Word taught built them up and made them whole.  
Eternal life is the God type of life.  
If you have that life, it'll destroy sickness in your body.  
If you have that life, it'll make you strong and healthy.  
 If you have that life, no disease or infirmity can occupy your body.  
Now that's a fact.  
Most afflictions of the body are caused by demons.  
And Jesus said in his name, we shall cast out devils.  
You know what you're going to do today?  
When we begin praying, if it's your leg,  
 You're gonna turn to your leg and you're gonna say, Devil, come out of my leg.  
Are you ready?  
Hallelujah.  
If it's somebody that you brought here, who's close to you there?  
 You're going to turn to that person.  
And if it's blindness, or it's leanness, or any kind of sickness or infirmity, you're going to say, Gevo, come out of him, or come out of Ha in the name of Jesus.  
 The people received the message into their faith-filled hearts.  
And when the hour came, Pastor Chris Prane, he commanded the Devils to come out of the people, giving words of knowledge.  
As he did, miracles erupted all over the stadium.  
Shouts of joy every day, resonating several parameters outside the stadium.  
It was electrified.  
Right now!  
Put your hand over the wing, you need a miracle!  
 If it's a deaf ear, put your finger into the deaf ear.  
Wherever you are right now, for no future lies up and walk.  
Get up and walk.  
Get up and walk.  
Get up and walk.  
Get up and walk.  
Get up and walk.  
Get up and walk.  
Get up and walk.  
Get up and walk.  


  
 There's a miracle on another one!  
There's another miracle on another one!  
Oh, my goodness!  
You're back here on another one!  


  
 That's a young guy on a little ball just past 13 years old.  
You can't get blind.  
You are here.  
We see the sights.  
We see the sights.  
We see the sights.  
You are here because I have to look at everybody.  
She's here.  
She's here.  
She's here.  


  
 Now, I see a lady with a Timo in the ear.  
You have a Timo in your ear.  
What you are here right now.  
That Timo is gone.  
It's gone.  
It's gone.  
Put your finger in to find it's gone.  


  
 You're a poor side-out, you're never here tonight.  
You're my judges.  
You're a poor side-out, you're never.  
There's another wheelchair over there.  
I'm not a poor side-out.  


  
 So many received their miracles that night.  
The poor had the gospel preached to them.  
The blind received their sight.  
The lame walked.  
The death burned.  
Incurable diseases were cured.  


  
 Sometimes, just when someone may think, how do these things happen?  
And some people even ask, are these miracles real?  
Yes, these miracles are real.  
Irrefutable testimonies abound of God's saving power in the lives of those who come to Him in faith.  
Those who believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.  
Such was the story of Gugu.  
 On one fateful day, Google was shot and the bullet went through his head leaving him completely paralyzed.  
He wasn't able to talk, move or do anything by himself.  
He had to depend on his family for everything.  
 Google was brought to the healing school of Christ Embassy.  
I got the message that he was shot when he came back from Orange Farm.  
The bullet went through his head and he's in ICU.  
I was totally shocked.  
He could not eat.  
He could not like speak.  
He couldn't do anything.  
 We are taking him to bed, he cannot wash himself, he cannot do anything by himself.  
And his right hand is the worst cause this one at least can move but his whole body, he cannot do anything.  
So we feed him and he cannot talk.  
This is what he is using to call for attention.  
 Because when he's sleeping, he can't even like tell himself around so he calls for attention and his lips like during the day he has to sleep to get dressed because he has like bed sauce here and so he has to lie on his stomach because if he lies on his bed sauce they won't get any better so he's not working now  
 And he's quiet, he's not speaking.  
The only thing he's using is a pot that has like alphabets, he tells us with that, that this is what I want, I need food now, I'm fine.  
Something's wrong maybe with this thing, the condom that he's using to renate.  
 He cannot go by himself to the loo, we have to pick him up from the pet, put him on the wheelchair, take him to the restroom.  
So... Hey, it's a big, big, big thing that has happened to my cousin.  
I'm not happy with what I'm seeing now.  
I wish that God could help him and restore him the way he was and he's a good and bright young man.  
 I want to see him achieving all that he wanted to achieve his IT diploma and getting where he wants to get the medical report said that the bullet like damaged  
 his brain so he is paralyzed he cannot do things that he could normally do like his legs and no longer find it affected his bitch and his hands like his body they bullets that touch his brain it touch the part that affected him  
 Here we see Google's cousin helping him out of the wheelchair, but Google cannot respond as he is paralyzed.  


  
Notice a appendage on his right arm.  
That is a support for his fingers, because he can't even support his fingers.  


  
 and the bandage on his leg is covering a sword that has refused to heal.  
So pathetic and it was in this state that he was brought to the healing school.  


  
 like the Syrophoenician woman in the Bible who expressed her faith in Jesus for her young daughter's miracle.  
Over 2,000 years later, Gugu's mother expressed her faith in Jesus Christ too, and she got the same result.  
And this is the day that Gugu has been waiting for.  
Pastor, I know you're a man of God.  
My son had a gun shot.  
He was shot.  
I know when you pray for him he'll be healed completely today.  
He'll stand up and walk.  
I know, Pastor, and I believe him.  


  
 Now the man of God begins to mean stir to him.  
He lays his hands on his head.  
The man of God lays his hands on his chest, transferring the power of God into his body.  


  
He continues to transfer the power of God into Google's body, causing a complete transformation, correcting the brain damage and the spinal cord injury.  


  
 He instructs him to move his leg.  
Wow!  
Look at that!  
That is the power of God!  
The man of God lays his hands on his legs, causing strength to come back into his legs.  
He blows on him the annoying thing.  


  
And now the man of God is transferring the annoying thing into his hands.  
 Look at that.  
Google is flexing his fingers.  
That was impossible for him to do before.  
Glory to God.  
Street.  
And a man of God instructs him to get up.  


  
And Google is up on his feet.  
And he is walking on his own.  
Praise the Lord.  
This is amazing.  


  
 Look at him taking off his wristband, Harlan Liu Yang.  


  
See, as he rejoices over his miracle, with his hands up in the air, giving praise to God Almighty, this is a remarkable miracle.  
Glory to God.  


  
 Today, Google is completely healed.  
What more can be said?  
The Bible reports in Matthew 1531 that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb speaking.  


  
 The main being made whole, the lame walking.  


  
And the blind scene and they glorified the God of Israel.  
So it was in some meetings with Pastor Chris.  
This young lady came in for this meeting with one leg three inches shorter than the end.  
Now they are equal.  


  
 This young boy came in for this meeting with his left leg two centimeters shorter than the right leg.  
During the meeting, the left leg grew out.  
 This is your song.  
Yes.  
What happened?  
He got a car accident about three years ago.  
Three years ago.  
And the left leg became shot up by about two centimeters.  
And as you were praying this night, his left leg started shaking.  
And he later told us that they are now the same length.  
He could feel them the same.  
Yes.  
And as we are coming, it was continuing to be shown.  
Come back!  
Come back!  
 Come back!  
He's gone!  
Come back!  
Amazing!  
We never can fully comprehend the greatness of God and the wonders of His power.  
 Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.  
And His fame went throughout all Syria, and they brought it to Him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy, and He healed them.  
 As in Bible days, many come with various ailments and long-time conditions seeking for a miracle for that condition they are faced with.  
Some come having been given up to die.  
Some others have tried all known medical solutions to man, but have found no cure.  
Amongst numerous moving cases witnessed at the healing school is the story of Mabico.  
 Young Mobiko was diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosis, accompanied by thrombocytopenia, a systemic autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the body cells and tissues resulting in inflammation and tissue damage.  
 It began in December 2011, when she started feeling striking pain in her left thigh.  
As the condition grew worse, Rebecca's left side became stiff, numb and weak.  
She was unable to walk by herself, go to school or do things girls her age would do normally.  
She had to be on steroids for a prolonged period.  
Eventually, she became confined to the wheelchair.  
As a mother, it's hard to watch my child sobbing like this.  
 And even if I'm at work, I'm not working.  
I'm not free at work.  
I'm not working right.  
I'm not concentrating.  
As a young girl, 15 years old, her dreams, her dreams are just cut off.  
She's unable to go to school.  
She's unable to do things for herself.  


  
 I don't know that this lifestyle that it was this realistic, this disease that I have and I don't know that my mother found this way because she's being strong for me always smiling always there when I need her so I didn't know  
 that it gets her up inside to simulate this.  
But I have to go on in life.  
Yeah, it's hard.  
And today, Mbego is present, having so much faith in her heart that she will be healed.  


  
 Now the man of God is before Mpego, he helps her to help beat.  
He begins to minister healing to her body.  
Wow, that's the power of God go through Mpego as she falls to the ground.  
The power of God is going through Mpego right now, healing every sickness in her body.  
None Mpego is being helped after her peace.  
 Hallelujah!  
Can you see that Rebecca is taking her steps?  


  
Now she is jumping with excitement, knowing that she is here.  
This is the manifestation of the power of God.  
Praise God!  


  
 I couldn't walk, but I couldn't jump, but I couldn't jump.  
Now I couldn't bend, but I can bend down and go up.  
A few weeks later, we see a transform the Biko still testifying.  
 months after Labiko is still testifying.  
What more can we say?  


  
 This is the manifestation of the power of God.  
Again time would allow us to make mention of Sophia Clement.  
Sophia was a perfect picture of good health until 2005 when she started experiencing pains.  
 Sofia suffered from lumbar cervical spondylosis, and as a result, she could no longer walk and was confined to a wheelchair until she had an encounter at a meeting with the man of God, Pastor Chris.  
I was thinking that all the time we were praying, he should have received a miracle.  
This song is for you.  
 I believe this is your season.  
It's time to shine again.  
Come and sing it to her please.  
I believe this is your season.  
It's time to shine again.  
 Sing it to her.  
I want you to listen to this song.  


  
 In a world where there's seasons and times God says it's your season It's time to shine again It's time to arise and walk God says it's your time today It's time to shine again  
 He's time to shine again.  
I believe this is your season.  
It's time to shine again.  
 So shine the air.  
Hey, I believe.  
I believe this is your season.  
It's time to shine the air.  
Hey, watch that.  
This is your season.  
 Come out of her!  
Come out of her!  
Come out of her!  
Come out of her!  
Come out of her!  
Come out of her!  
Come out of her!  
Come out of her!  
Come out of her!  


  
 This is your season!  
You can't fight again!  
You can't fight again!  


  
 This is her sister, her eyes are full of tears.  
Jesus is wonderful.  
Come.  
Up.  
That's it.  
Look at me.  
Look at me.  


  
 It's time to shine again It's time to shine again It's time to shine again It's time to shine, baby It's time to shine, baby It's time to shine, baby It's time to shine, baby It's time to shine  


  
 It's time to shine  


  
 Please put your hands together for Sofia Edwards.  


  
 And as the response to this miracle was on the day it occurred, the congregation watching this testimony was also overwhelmed with joy at the glorious intervention of God which they were witnessing.  
 Even though the atmosphere in the auditorium was so charged with excitement as people witnessed the mighty hand of God's demonstration in Sophia's life, the revelation of God's love through her story rocked tears to the eyes of many, tears of gladness and deep appreciation that couldn't be held back.  
Today, Sophia is living a normal life again.  
 Someone asked a question, do you believe in this mirror?  
She can even read with it!  
How do you old parents like that?  
Can you see me?  
It's how many fingers?  
How many people like that?  
The matter got its due number.  


  
 These are just a few of so many cases, we have witnessed in the ministry of this great man of God, Pastor Chris.  
Like Christina, Google, Libeepo, Sophia and so many others, we have not mentioned in this volume, there is no impossibilities with God.  
One truth that resounds through the scriptures is God's desire for His children to draw them out.  


  
 Take up your better work It's time to leave again It's time to face the mountain And save your must remove Open your eyes and see Open your ears and hear It's time to see again And it's time to hear again  
 Take up your bed and walk It's time to leave again It's time to face the mountain And say you must remove Open your eyes and see Open your ears and hear us It's time to see again And it's time to hear again  
 For anything is possible Won't pull your heart and receive Dry bones, dry bones, shall I believe again?  


  
 In the name of Jesus In the name of Jesus In the name of Jesus In the name of Jesus  


  
 The healing miracles performed in our ministry are done through the power in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God.  
And right now, I want to pray for you.  
No matter what it is that you want the Lord to do for you,  
 I believe he's not only willing, he's going to do it.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus, I pray that the anointing of God's Spirit will rest upon you now.  
I pray in the name of Jesus that health will spring up in your body, that you be healed, that the pains will cease, the infirmity will cease,  
 Does he believe you that he be healed today?  
Let the power of the Spirit of God sarge to your being and make you whole right now.  
In Jesus name, be me.
