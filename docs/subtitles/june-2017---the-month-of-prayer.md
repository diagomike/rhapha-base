title: June 2017 - The Month of Prayer
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and he left us with a message to tell the untold, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and his unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Glory to God.  
All right, let me quickly share some thoughts with you.  
This is the month of June here.  
It's the month of prayer.  
You know, we began this in the month of June.  
 and several years ago.  
And throughout that month, we were praying.  
What we've been doing ever since is the month of June is dedicated to prayer.  
So we pray every day.  
Now, you know, I send you a post for prayer on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and I leave out the other days for, you know, the other kinds of prayer, meetings and sessions you want to have.  
But in the month of June,  
 We pray every day.  
So this month, what you're going to do is this.  
On Mondays, we're praying 12 noon as usual and 10 p.m.  
Then on Tuesdays, 10 p.m.  
On Wednesdays, 12 noon as usual and 10 p.m.  
Then on Thursdays, 10 p.m.  
On Fridays, 12 noon as usual and 10 p.m.  
And on Saturdays, 10 p.m.  
 Then, of course, on Sundays, we have times of prayer in the churches, and we all do that.  
So what we're adding in the month of June is Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, 10 p.m.  
each day.  
So every day of this month, we are praying.  
Very important.  
15-minute session, not too long, but very, very important.  
And I want to talk to you about this.  
 You know, prayer is very important.  
Can we read from the visions chapter six and verse number 18 from the amplified version?  
I would ask Pastor D'Ola Phillips to read that verse.  
 says prayer at all times on every occasion in every season in the Spirit with all manner of prayer and all manner of prayer and entity to that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance  
 intercedent in behalf of all the saints, God's consecrated people.  
Very important.  
Very important.  
I want to bring that part of it again.  
It says, pray at all times on every occasion, in every season, in the Spirit, with all manner of prayer.  
Another translation says, all kinds of prayer, suggesting to us that there are different kinds of prayer.  
 And so, when you study the scriptures, you'll find that there are different kinds of prayer.  
And that these different kinds of prayer go by different rules.  
Now, one of the reasons some people, a lot of people, don't receive answers to their prayer is because they're trying to use the rules for a certain kind of prayer for another kind.  
Something or prayer is prayer.  
But it's not true.  
It's not true.  
There are different types of prayer.  
 And very quickly, let me just list for you several different kinds of prayer.  
And I'm going to give you eight different kinds of prayer here.  
You've got to pray our faith.  
You've got to pray our agreements.  
You've got to pray our intercession.  
The prayer of commitment.  
Prayer of worship.  
Prayer of consecration.  
 Then we've got praying in tongues, praying in the spirit, praying in the spirit, praying in tongues.  
And then we've got corporate prayer.  
Now these are different kinds of prayer.  
And they go by different rules.  
Now the corporate prayer we're talking about is congregational prayer.  
These are all different types of prayer.  
The first set of them  
 I have to do personal prayer.  
Now, we don't have time to go into all of them, but I'm going to read some things to you here.  
So, Mark's Gospel chapter 11, verses 22 and 23.  
Pass the cake, can you read that verse?  
In Mark's Gospel chapter 11, from verse 22 and 23.  
It says, And Jesus answering said unto them, Our faith in God.  
 for very very I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, without removed and without cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his hearts, but shall believe that those things which is said shall come to pass, and shall have whatsoever is said.  
Now that is the prayer of faith.  
 For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he said shall come the past, he shall have whatsoever he said.  
So the prayer of faith addresses the situation and it's got something to do with you or someone under your charge for the period that is under your charge.  
So that's the prayer of faith.  
 You talk to the situation, you talk to that thing, and that's the way it is, and you don't say it many times.  
The prayer of faith is not prayed repeatedly.  
See, who so ever shall say unto this mountain?  
That's the prayer of faith, and it's very, very important.  
Then there's the prayer of agreement.  
 That's the second one I listed for you.  
In that second one, I will read St.  
Matthew's Gospel, chapter 18 and verse 19.  
Pastor, beautiful, how can you read that first?  
Yes, thank you, sir.  
Again, I say unto you.  
These are the words of Jesus.  
That if two of you shall agree on it, as touching anything, that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  
 for way two or three.  
I dare to delay my name.  
There am I in the midst of them.  
Now, this is very interesting.  
He is here not particularly referring to a congregation, like the whole church.  
This is not really a congregation or prayer.  
He says, way two or three.  
He didn't swear all of you.  
All right?  
He's not dealing with so many people, even though he can work for many people, because it's two or three or more.  
 Here, he's dealing with two or three.  
You and a friend, you and a brother, you and whoever.  
So he says, again, I say to you that if two of you shall agree on earth, there has to be an agreement.  
You both have to agree on what it is you're desiring.  
 Maybe one of you needs something, and you want someone to agree with you to get this done.  
It can be done.  
But you can't say, I agree, and then right after you say, I don't know what I would get it enough.  
Or I hope so.  
You can't hope and faith don't go together.  
Look at this.  
Again, I say to you that if two officials agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them or my father, which is in heaven.  
 What do you require?  
The two of you are more?  
Two or three of you?  
Number two, you agree on earth?  
So you can say, I'm asking Saint Francis of Assisi to join me in prayer.  
Or Saint Mary in heaven to join me in prayer.  
Or your uncle that died many years ago because he was very spiritual, he says she joined you from heaven.  
No, you've got to be on earth.  
The rule says two of you.  
If two of you shall agree on earth,  
 You gotta be on earth.  
So you say, what if we're flying on the plane and we have taken off, we're not on earth?  
That's an interesting one.  
As at the time of this riding, okay, they were not flying the air.  
But here's the beautiful thing.  
Even though you're flying the air, the authority you will have is still working in the earth.  
 Okay, and possibly the things that you're asking for will have to do with earth.  
And that actually says about your body.  
That's really what it means.  
Two of you on earth, the earth, your body is from the earth.  
So that's actually what it's referring to.  
So don't think that if you're flying, that you are no longer on earth.  
No, your body is at least.  
Everyone that has passed out of the body cannot pretty spray out.  
 For the Bible says they are terrestrial bodies and they are celestial bodies.  
So you got to be in a terrestrial body to pray this prayer.  
So understand the room.  
All right.  
So he says shall be done for them of my father, which is in heaven.  
Now the third one that I listed to you is what I'm really going to zero on because that's the one you're going to need this month, the most.  
 It is the prayer of intercession, the prayer of intercession.  
It is a very important kind of prayer.  
I'm going to ask Pastor Della Phillips to read for us.  
Ezekiel chapter 22, from verse 29 to verse 32, verses.  
Ezekiel chapter 22.  


  
 The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy.  
Yay, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.  
And I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it, but I found none.  
Terrible.  
Terrible.  
Terrible.  
I want you to read it from the NIV or amplified any one of them.  
 I won't listen to this.  
It says the people of the land practice extortion.  
The people of the land practice with extortion.  
So it's not like corruption, all right?  
Extortion.  
 Uh-huh.  
And commit robbery.  
Yes.  
They oppress the poor and needy.  
The practice, the extortion, they commit robbery.  
Uh-huh.  
They oppress the poor and needy.  
They oppress the poor and needy.  
And mistreat the foreigner.  
And mistreat the foreigner.  
Denying them justice.  
Denying them justice.  
Think about this.  
He's talking about all the terrible things that we see in many nations today.  
And the Lord says here, in verse 30, He says, and I sought a man among them  
 who should build up the wall or make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy, but I found none.  
 Now look at what happened.  
It says, therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them and I've consumed them with the fire of my rock, their own way have I recompensed upon their heads their own way.  
What does that mean?  
They're suffering from what they produce for themselves.  
Now they're consuming themselves.  
They're destroying themselves.  
 Understand this, there's a lot of evil in our nations today, in our cities today.  
We can't just be quiet.  
We can't just be praying, oh God, please, just stop it.  
It is not the cause.  
We have to understand what prayer of intercession is.  
It says here to make up the hedge, to stand in the gap.  
But I should not destroy it.  
 It means taking the place of these people and in their sitting in their behalf for their forgiveness.  
Like when Jesus' father forgives them for they know not what they do.  
Do we pray like that or do we just get angry and curse?  
Do we just get angry and say nasty things against them?  
Have we prayed that the Lord should forgive them?  
Have we prayed like that?  
 Have we prayed for our cities?  
The Lord should have mercy on those who are doing this terrible things.  
Or do we just get angry and ask why isn't the government doing something?  
Why isn't the government doing this?  
Even the government can't do it.  
We've got to pray.  
Because the spiritual controls the physical.  
Our world has been run from the spirit realm.  
The demon spirits of darkness that are causing people to do this wicked works.  
 and accept and pray and intercede in their behalf.  
On behalf of the people, because he says, to stand in the gap for the land, he says, for the land.  
So that's referring to the people.  
Accept and pray.  
Nations can be lost.  
This month, I want us to stand in the gap for our nations, for our cities, pray for them like never before.  
Every day of this month, we're going to pray for them.  
 pray for your country, pray that the Lord will forgive them for their sins, for the evil of their doings, pray, stand in the gap that they've been not destroyed and consumed of their own evil works, so that the Spirit of God will cause the goodness of God to be seen in the land, will cause the results of evangelism to come up  
 to the fore.  
You see, we are doing a lot of things, our winning souls.  
We don't want evil to prevail.  
We want good to prevail.  
The Bible says for goods to rejoice over evil.  
That's what he wants to see.  
And if that is what we want to see, we're going to pray for the nations in a seed for them.  
 and see wonders taking place in our cities, in our countries.  
This month, don't speak against the leaders of your country.  
No, pray.  
Pray this time, asking that they be forgiven of the sins of the wrongs.  
The Lord already knows about all the terrible things people do.  
We just listed them.  
He talked about extortion.  
He talked about deception.  
He talked about wickedness, robbery.  
All of these things are there.  
 He already knows, but he says he wants us to stand in the gap and pray for them.  
And then we'll find beautiful things happening.  
We also have to pray for the church in a seat for the church and expect wonderful things to take place.  
You know, the prayers that he wants us, go to Colossians chapter one.  
Let me read something to you.  
Colossians chapter one, from verse number nine,  
 He says, for this course, we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you.  
That means we'll pray for you all the time.  
We don't cease to pray for you and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.  
 This is not a prayer for yourself.  
This is a prayer for the church.  
This is a prayer for other Christians.  
What about those in your cell?  
Are you praying for them like that?  
Or are you complaining?  
Oh, they don't like coming for the meetings.  
The reason they don't like coming for the meetings is because you're not praying like this.  
 If you pray like this, you find that the cell members, you know, they start responding.  
The church members start responding.  
Look at it.  
This is for this cause since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you and to desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will, of God's will, in our wisdom and spiritual understanding, that he might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God's.  
 Trying to think with all might, according to his glorious power, on all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness.  
Wonderful.  
That's what God wants to see if we would pray like this for them.  
Now, look at Ephesians chapter 1, from verse 15.  
And I read that first part of it to you.  
And then I'm moving to the amplified version.  
Look at it.  
 Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love on all the same, sees not to give thanks for you.  
Make an mention of you in my prayers, sees not to give thanks for you.  
Make an mention of you in my prayers.  
I like it.  
Look at verse 17, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,  
 The Father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.  
Look at the way it's put in the amplifiers.  
For I always pray to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Glory, I always pray.  
This is a continual prayer.  
In the accessory prayer is not something you pray once and let go.  
 Notice, you are not praying this for yourself.  
You're going to pray this for somebody else.  
Pray this for your cell members.  
Pray this for that person you just led to Christ.  
Pray this for the church members.  
And every pastor ought to learn to pray this for the members of the church.  
 Very important.  
For yourself, how do you relate to this?  
No, you don't pray this for yourself.  
You respond to it.  
You receive it.  
You apply it, appropriate it to yourself.  
You say, for example, you say, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, has given me the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.  
The eyes of my understanding have been enlightened.  
That's the way you apply to yourself.  
 You declare that it is done.  
You're not praying it for yourself again and again.  
No, you're praying for somebody else.  
It's an intercessory prayer.  
And you're going to pray this month for others.  
And you'd be amazed by the time we're through at the end of the month.  
You're going to see tremendous resource in the lives of others.  
This is what we want to see.  
Glory to God.  
 So get yourself ready.  
This month, you are praying as the Holy Ghost is leading us to intercede for others.  
We must intercede.  
We must pray for others.  
It's our job.  
We've got to stand in the gap for others.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Glory to God.  
Glory to God.
