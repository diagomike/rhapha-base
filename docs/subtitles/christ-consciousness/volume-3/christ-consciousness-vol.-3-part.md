title: Christ Consciousness Vol. 3 Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It will make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 What is Christ?  
That's the anointing that makes him who he is.  
What is a Christ consciousness?  
What is consciousness?  
You're dealing with awareness.  
There is an awareness in life that changes your state and your estate.  
Therefore, your success as a Christian is dependent on your consciousness of Christ.  
You enter every day with a sense of victory, with a consciousness.  
 of mastery.  
Listen as Pastor Chris takes you through the journey of developing the consciousness of a victor in this series titled Christ Consciousness.  
That only happens when you have Christ Consciousness.  
God bless you.  
In the next few minutes, I'll try to round off our subject on Christ Consciousness.  
 I hope that you have learned something.  
I want to, you know, in the course of our discussion in the last few services, we looked at a very direct definition of consciousness.  
But if you have listened to the message carefully,  
 You should have had a little broader idea than just the scene on him of awareness.  
I try to read for you a richer definition of the word, consciousness,  
 So you can put it together with what we have said so far.  
You ready for it?  
A sense of identity, including the attitudes, beliefs,  
 and sensitivities held by or considered characteristic of an individual or group  


  
 Did you get that?  
Do I have to repeat it?  
A sense of identity including the attitudes, beliefs and sensitivities, held by  
 or consider characteristic of an individual or group.  


  
Do I have to repeat it?  
Thank you.  
So you see,  
 When we talk about Christ's consciousness, it has a lot to do with our identity, our attitudes, our beliefs, and our sensitivities.  
Praise God.  
 There's a thought sometimes that we need to be careful of both in theory and in practice.  
And so we know it's place.  
Where is right and where is wrong?  
Some people say that Christianity is the imitation of Christ.  
You get it?  
 They said that Christianity is the imitation of Christ.  
And Christianity is not the imitation of Christ, but that's what religion communicates to us.  
As Christianity, it is the imitation of Christ.  
One of the things that I've come to  
 have come to notice among many believers, many Christians, is that they don't study their Bible.  
There's too much ignorance of the Scriptures.  
They don't study the Bible.  
So they say things that sound like they should be in God's book, but that's religious thinking.  
 because it sounds nice.  
And that doesn't make it true.  
But because such a thought is generally hard to be true, we accept them.  


  
Now, if we said,  
 Let us say the Lord's Prayer.  
Most Christians go, ah, Father, which I didn't heaven.  
Why?  
Because millions of them have been taught in school, right?  
From when they're growing up and in their homes and in churches.  
That the Lord's Prayer is that prayer.  
Ah, Father, which I didn't heaven.  
Ah, look, be that.  
It is just gone.  
You don't have to tell them which prayer.  
Just say, the Lord's Prayer.  
And they go, ah, Father, the chorus is for you.  
 Because they think that's the prayer.  
That's the prayer of the Lord that the Lord taught us to pray that prayer.  
But the Bible never says the Lord taught us to pray that prayer.  
He says, the Lord said, after this manner, therefore, pray.  
In other words, pray with these formats.  
He didn't say, pray this prayer.  
 Well, they have prayed that prayer for many years.  
Some people have prayed it every day of their lives, and they're more than 70 years old today.  
Well, think about it.  
75 wasted years of praying the wrong thing, every day.  
No matter what else he says to God, he will finish it with this one.  
In conclusion, our Father, which I didn't have, because they think the Bible says Jesus studies the disciples to pray that prayer, and he didn't.  
 You have to study the word to find out that that's not what he said.  
Because everybody says that's what he said.  
All like we talked about the do of the other day.  
Where people believe that the do is the symbol of the Holy Spirit.  
And it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter who does it.  


  
What's wrong is wrong?  
 It's a form of idolatry creeping into the church, but they don't know it.  


  
So ever most Christian ministries and churches have a dove as part of their logo.  
 The birds fly and it's got a dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit.  
And it is absolutely wrong.  
First for the fact that the Bible didn't say that the Holy Spirit came in the imagery of a dove, but that he descended the way a dove descends.  
 He was talking about the method of dissent.  
That's what I was talking about.  
Secondly, because right from the beginning God said, do not represent me with any image.  
 He said to Moses on the general visual, he said, when I spoke to you from out of the fire and from out of heaven, he said, did you see any fum?  
They said, no, sir.  
He said, therefore, never represent me with any fum.  
What does God look like?  
He looks like you.  
 The Bible says he made man in his own image.  
In the image of God, made he him, male and female.  
All right, he created them in his own image.  
Jesus said, if you have seen me, you have seen the Father.  
What did Jesus look like?  
Like you.  
 All right?  
And he said, God looked like him, and he looked like God.  
And then he says about the Holy Spirit.  
He said, I'll pray the Father, and he shall send you allos paracletus.  
Meaning another one that is exactly like me to go alongside you.  
Not heteros paracletus.  
Heteros would mean another one of a different kind.  
But allos means another one of exactly the same kind.  
 In other words, the Holy Spirit looks like Jesus, who looks like the Father, who looks like you.  
So the Holy Spirit, if you want to represent the Holy Spirit with any form, put your picture there.  


  
Not the picture of a dove.  
It's an insult to God.  
 But you see they don't know it.  
You see it?  
Because it's been there for a long time and just because the lie has been in office for a long time doesn't make it true.  
Longevity is not legality.  


  
So why do they do it?  
It's for the same reason they do a lot of other wrong stuff.  
 They have no time to study the Bible.  
They don't care about it.  
And then it feels nice to have a dove in your, you know, very beautiful picture.  
So he says, the Holy Spirit is like a dove.  
He's not.  
He descended like a dove.  
It doesn't look like one.  
It doesn't act like one.  
 The description of the Holy Spirit is given to us in the book of Daniel, is given to us in the book of Revelation.  
And every time the Holy Spirit was spoken about in the scripture from Genesis to Revelation, always it was the picture, the imagery of a man.  
Never the imagery of a bird.  


  
 And when John was talking about the Holy Spirit, when he said that he was given a sign that on whom so ever he sees the Holy Spirit descend in the fall of a dove, he should know that this is the one who was sent to baptize the Holy Spirit and fire.  
That means that is the Christ.  
 And then he told the people.  
He said, he is the one.  
I saw the Spirit descend on him in the full of a dog.  
If he had meant to them, if the Jews standing there had thoughts like many people think today, if they had thought that he meant that the Holy Spirit looked like a dog, they would have stoned John to death.  
 They would have killed him because they were Jews.  
And they know the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, is one with God, and looks like God, and must not be represented as looking like a bird or a far-footed beast.  
They would have stolen to death, but they knew that's not what he meant.  
They knew he meant the way he came from heaven and landed on Jesus.  
Like he said, a word was sent, and it alighted on Jacob.  
 That's the- that he's given the imagery.  
You see?  
So, it's- it's amazing.  
 that anybody would come years after.  
You don't know how this came about.  
It came about in the dark ages when there were selling images, crosses, the crucifix, they were selling them and selling the dov, okay?  
To Christians the by, because they wanted to raise money back in the dark ages, they needed money.  
And they were selling this thing, selling crosses and selling dov, flying like the Holy Spirit.  
So they said, this is the Holy Spirit.  
And they bought it.  
 And so many were the crucifix today and when the bird or put it on their logo or in the church.  
That's how it came.  
A deviation from the truth.  
You never find the representation of the Holy Spirit as a bird in all of the writings of the New Testament.  
So why do we do it?  
 Even as I say these things, there are those who will not want to change it.  
I don't know what I want to do with the dog.  


  
 You see, why is it that they have a limited manifestation of the Holy Spirit in their lives and in ministry?  
Because they don't know Him.  
They think He is a bird.  
You see it?  
So there will be a limitation.  
The expression of God through your life will be to the limit of your understanding.  
The more of Him you know, the more of Him can be released through you.  
 Hallelujah to Jesus.  
Glory to God.  
God said, oh, bama, mama, mama.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
Are you born again?  
Wow.  
I got the life of God in my spirit.  
So I know who I am.  
 You know, Jesus came to raise sons of God.  
That's what he came for.  
Not failures.  
Not failures.  


  
Not failures.  
Not beggars.  
Think unto race, religious beggars.  
 begging him, begging him, begging him for a house, begging him for a job, begging him for a car, begging him for a wife, begging him for a husband, begging him for a child.  
Oh God, be cool.  


  
He says, if the spirit of him, that raised up Jesus from the dead,  
 dwells in you.  
He that raised the Christ from the dead shall also vitalize your mortal body by his spirit, that dwell it, that resides in you.  
Think about it.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 Christianity is the expression of divinity through you.  
He has taken up his abode in you.  
Let me show you some that you love.  
Oh boy.  
Ah, St.  
John's Gospel.  


  
 St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 14, I will read to you from verse 23, the words of Jesus.  
You're ready for this?  
Verse 23, Jesus answered and said unto him, if a man loved me, he will keep my words.  
Hallelujah.  
 If a man loved me, he will keep my words.  
And my father will love him.  
And we will come unto him and make our abode with him."  
Oh boy, I like that.  
This is if a man loved me, he will keep my words.  
He'll do what I tell him.  
Then he says, and my father will love him.  
And we will come unto him and make our home with him.  
 He'll come on reside, right there with you, and in you.  
Because you see, the Father and Jesus come to you in the Holy Spirit.  
And Jesus said, He is with you, but shall be in you.  
And now He is in us because He came to live in us.  
And that has been fulfilled.  
Amen.  
Amen.  
So the Holy Spirit lives in me.  
 All right, can I show you some news?  
First Corinthians.  


  
Whoo-hoo, glory to God.  
Dear, you've got to get this.  


  
I want to read the first Corinthians at six.  
We'll read from verse 16.  


  
 You there?  
Okay, what?  
No, ye not, that he which is joined to an harlot is one body.  
For to say that he shall be one flesh.  
Did you get that word?  
A harlot, he says.  
One who is joined to an harlot is one body with a harlot.  
Who is a harlot?  
 Prostitute.  


  
Now, firstly, he lets us do that wrong.  
Don't get involved with a prostitute.  
Don't get involved with a harlot.  
But you see, people get distracted with that.  
 Overlook the more important thing that he's trying to say.  
So, don't get involved with the Hallowed He says, because you get involved with the Hallowed, you become one body with the Hallowed.  
For two said he shall be one flesh, but, verse 17.  
I want you all to read verse 17.  
Thank you.  
But he that is joined onto the Lord is one Spirit.  
 He that is joined onto the Lord is one spirit.  
Now that's remarkable.  
The one who's joined onto the Lord is one spirit.  
Now we're talking about Christ consciousness.  
There's an awareness that makes you a victor.  
 All right?  
Now, the knowledge, the consciousness of what you have inside you activates the power.  
And put it this way again.  
Listen to this because it's very, very important.  
I know you want to write.  
Okay, write quick.  
 I don't know what came to your mind that you want to write, but go ahead and write it, whatever it is.  
And then I want you to pick this.  
Many Christians have received the Holy Spirit, okay?  
All right?  
But what did Jesus say about the Holy Spirit in Acts chapter one verse eight?  
He says, but he shall receive power.  
Power, what is power?  
Power is the ability to cause changes.  
That means the dynamic ability.  
 to cause changes.  
So simply put, he said, he shall receive power, the dynamic ability to cause changes, because the word is dunamis.  
All right?  
For power, it means a miracle working ability.  
You can cause changes.  
 Now he says, you shall receive the dynamic ability to cause changes after that the Holy Spirit, or when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.  
When a Christian therefore receives the Holy Spirit, he receives the power to effect changes.  
He has power to effect changes.  
 That's why He left us in this world as an agent of change.  
You see that?  
So those that God has given the power to cause changes are the believers, the Christians.  
So the Bible tells us when you read in Romans after 18 verse 19 that the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the manifestation, the showing up,  
 The revealing of the sons of God, the heroes of God, the mature sons of God.  
Why?  
Because they have the power to effect changes.  
So the whole creation that's been growing in pain, in travail has hope.  
 The Bible says to the hope of the creation is that they might also be liberated, brought into the liberty of the sons of God, which means that the sons of God are enjoying a certain kind of liberty, which is the liberty of the spirits.  
What kind of liberty is that?  
It means that they cannot be disadvantaged, nothing can put them in bondage, not they are indestructible, absolutely indestructible.  
 It is the liberty of the spirits.  
They can do what they want.  
They can achieve what they want.  
They can go where they want.  
Do you understand that kind of life?  
It is the life of an absolute victor.  
So the Bible says the whole creation grows, wishing and waiting to be thrust also into that liberty of the sounds of God.  
 Because they are the ones that God has given the power to cause changes.  
Okay?  
So how come that many, many Christians who have received this Holy Spirit don't have the power being manifested?  
Because they don't understand how the power works.  
Listen, electricity was in the world for thousands of years.  
 There was as much electricity in the world 2,000 years ago, 4,000 years ago as there is today.  
How come that people didn't understand electricity or use it for their benefit because they didn't know nothing about it?  
When they discovered it, the lives were improved.  
You get it now?  
And that's very important.  
 It brings to my mind something in the scripture.  
You know, Jesus says, I don't know how to work.  
And Buddha, Buddha lived about 500 years before Jesus Christ.  
He came before Jesus.  
And guess what he said?  
In fact, Buddha means the enlightened one.  
But when he was dying, he said, I'm still sick in the truth, still searching the truth.  
 But he was the enlightened one.  
Searching the truth.  
Jesus was not enlightened.  
Jesus was light.  
Can you see the difference?  
Jesus was not enlightened.  
Jesus, he says, I am the light of the world.  
I don't need light.  
I give light.  
I am the light of the world.  
 He didn't say, I'm searching the truth.  
He said, I am the truth.  
He said, I am the way, the truth and the life.  
Jesus didn't need life.  
He was the life.  
He didn't need truth.  
He was the truth.  


  
You see, the power of Jesus was not what he said.  
It was what was in what he said.  
 because several statements made by Jesus were made by many other philosophers.  
But it was the power that was embedded in what he said.  
That was the difference.  
It wasn't the miracles, because the Bible says though he had done many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him.  
So the miracles didn't change them.  
 But there's something about the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
There's something about it.  
Something about it.  
In Romans chapter 1, we read from verse 16, Paul said, I'm not ashamed of a gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation, to ever warn that beliefs.  
 to the Jew first and also to the Genta.  
He says, for in it, in the gospel, in that message is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.  
The righteousness of God is revealed in it.  
The character of God, the nature of God, the power, the glory of God is revealed in it.  
When you hear the gospel, the power of God, the glory of God, the nature of God is unveiled and it imparts your spirits.  
 Hallelujah.  
And when it does, you become like him.  
In other words, it produces in you what it is.  
You get it?  
So that's why he doesn't call us enlightened ones.  
He calls us light.  
We are also light as he is.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Glory to God.  
Glory to God.  
Mine, oh, mine.  
Whoo-hoo.  
Mine, mine, mine, mine.  
So with this wonderful Holy Spirit in your life, and God has told you that when the Holy Spirit came into your life to receive power,  
 The ability to effect changes in your family, in your own body, in your own life, in your work, in your business, in your finances, anything.  
Look at Jesus.  
That's the way he functions.  
Never disadvantaged, unperturbed.  
This is my peace.  
I live with you.  
Peace.  
 Said, I've given you peace, not the way the world does it.  
They make an announcement and say, there's peace now.  
And everybody's still troubled.  


  
But when he gives you peace, your heart is at rest.  
And his peace is not just quietness, it is a rest with prosperity.  
In other words, you are at peace and everything is going on well.  
 Hallelujah.  
And if ever the devil shows his face, you're telling the care of.  
That's the way it is.  
So I said, I don't understand.  
Sitan has just been missing of my business.  
So what are you doing about it?  
And that's why I need prayer.  
You don't need prayer.  
You don't need prayer.  
Tell the devil to go.  
 And he will go.  
That's what Jesus said.  
He said, these signs shall follow them that belief.  
He didn't say, these signs shall follow evangelists.  
No, he said, these signs shall follow them that belief.  
In my name, they shall rule over demons.  
He said, they shall cast out, cast out devils.  
You know, you come into a place and say, who put this thing here?  


  
 In my name, they shall cast out devils.  
I remember reading one time, you know, many years ago, I was reading a book by a certain evangelist.  
And in his book, he said, we ought to realize that we ought to talk to Satan with some respect.  
I thought, dear God, dear God, ought to talk to Satan with some respect.  
Don't you know what Jesus said?  
Cast out, cast, cast.  
Do you know?  


  
 The synonyms will be kick out, throw out, push out, with force.  
Not push out, guys, push out with force.  
Kick out.  
That's not respectful.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Well, now we talk to the devil with respect.  
 Oh, no.  
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  
Oh, yeah, I know that Michael and Satan had an argument over the body of Moses, and Michael didn't say anything but the Lord, the Lord rebuked the, that's what he said to Satan, but that's Michael!  
 At the time that it happened, did you know why Michael spoke to him like that?  
He wasn't because Satan used to be his senior.  
It was because Satan at that time had atomic authority, which was higher than angelic authority.  
Because when Adam fell in the garden, he submitted his authority to Satan.  
That's how Satan became the god of this world.  
 So when Michael met him, Michael was respecting the authority of Adam, which Satan had now taken.  
When Jesus gained the second Adam, being born again by the resurrection from the dead, he said, in my name you shall cast out devils.  


  
 So we have a higher authority than Adam had, a higher authority than Satan had, than Michael had.  
What is our authority?  
I'll tell you.  
The Bible says, when he died, we died with him.  
Jesus Christ, when he was buried, we were buried with him.  
When God raised him up, we were raised together with him.  
 And now He says, we are seated together with Him in the heavenly realms.  
That's our authority.  
Our authority is not the authority of a religious person.  
Our authority is the authority of the very blessed Son of God, Jesus Christ.  
We come in His name.  
We function in His name.  
Do you understand what we're talking about?  
 Satan will not have a negotiation with Jesus.  
Jesus will not stick down to his level.  
And talk about how okay now.  
All right, so you have to leave.  
You know that these are my people.  
Jesus!  


  
Ha ha ha.  
 He said, I'll be here Satan far from heaven as lightning.  
Therefore, I give you power authority to tread, tread upon suppings and upon scorpions and over all the power, the ability of the enemy.  
And he says, nothing shall buy enemies.  
Hey, glory to God.  
 Nothing shall by any means hurt you.  
If Satan showed up in your room, you don't have to be scared of him.  
You open your eyes and look at him.  


  
 Remember, years ago, I was sleeping, but you know in the Spirit, if you are large in the Spirit, you don't sleep in the Spirit.  
Except you are not large.  
If your Spirit is alive and awake, even if you are sleeping, if there is an activity of the Spirit that concerns you, you wake up and you know on this  
 Evil spirit came right into the room, power slipping, and my eyes just opened, and I turned to him.  
What is he in?  
I couldn't get to say the rest of it before he was out.  
I didn't get to say the rest of it.  
And he was gone.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Listen, Christ is in you.  
Do you know what that means?  
His life is in you.  
The life of Christ, when you receive the Word, you see, the Word of God is the life of God.  
 All right?  
The Word of God is the nature of God.  
The Word of God is His very, is His essence.  
Okay?  
Now, when you hear the Word with your ears, it goes through your mind  
 which is the door to your spirit.  
If you are accepted, it will go into your spirit.  
If you don't accept it with your mind, it will not get into your spirit.  
That's why the Bible says that those who received seed by the wayside and the birds came and picked them up were those who heard the word and didn't understand and Satan came immediately and stole the word.  
When the Word of God gets into your heart, into your spirit,  
 It becomes parts of your spirit.  
As the food you eat, when it goes into your body, becomes part of your body.  
Did you know that?  
It becomes part of your body.  
So the water God becomes part of your spirit.  
And then as you meditate on it, in your mind, you are transmitting that word back to your body.  
 Through meditation, the water God goes into your body and becomes part of your body.  


  
How important it is for us to meditate on the world.  
This headaches, colds and fevers that people complain about will be a thing of the past.  
 if they understood the ministry of the Word of God.  
How the Word of God functions inside us.  
That's why Jesus said, man shall not live by bread alone, by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God.  
Meditate on the Word.  
Receive the Word into your spirits.  
Hallelujah.  
Receive the Word into your spirit.  
 If you're an engineer, you become a better engineer, if you had the word in you, the word will enlighten you.  
If you're a businessman, you become a better businessman.  
If you're a teacher, you become a better teacher, why?  
Because the word, through the spirit, the agency of the Holy Ghost, acts on our mentality.  
You see that?  
The word of God has an impact on our mentality.  
Our thinking changes.  
 Our ability to conceptualize completely broadens to an extraordinary range, extraordinary amplitude.  


  
That's the ministry of the Spirit of God and the Word of God in your life.  
You become super intelligent.  
 This is God's plan for His children.  


  
Those who function in the Old Testament, Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who only meditated on the meated revelation that they were given in the Old Testament, were tested with others.  
And they were found to be ten times better.  
 The meditation on the Word of God puts us at a completely different level from the rest of the world.  
You can practice this and I'm telling you, if there's any way for them to measure your intelligence, I give you one month of meditation on the Word, just a few hours every day, and go meet them, let them test you.  
 Your ability to comprehend things will be far, far different, far above the natural man.  
Now some of you have never, you've never practiced this thing.  
That's why you've never understood this.  
You've never understood the impact of the world in your life.  
 So you think that it's like this, you know, think about the guy who eats food and thinks that the food just goes to his stomach and he's either going to pass it out or he's going to throw it away.  
No.  
What size there is you?  
That some of that food gets into your body.  
Now, when it gets into your body, it becomes a part of your body.  
It literally becomes a part of your body.  
You can't find the food anymore.  
 Not because it has expired or it has been consumed.  
No.  
I'm talking about the one that has mingled with your body and has become a part of your body.  
That's the reason you grow.  
There's a nourishment.  
It's become a part of your body.  
An inseparable part of your body.  
That's the way the word does.  
That's how the word of God comes into you.  
 That's why you need to meditate on the Word of God all the time.  
Because you're going to be the reflection, the outward working of what you've been hearing.  
The Word of God was given to build us, to build us.  
Hallelujah.  
You still there?  
 Doesn't matter where you are in life.  
If you take the Word of God seriously, he will change everything about you.  
You know, some people think, well, if I give so much time to the Word of God, I'll never have time for my family.  
I'll never have time for my job.  
I'll never have time for my business.  
I'll never have time for my school.  
No, you're wrong.  
Why?  
Because the Word of God will show you how to have time for all of them.  
Hahaha, praise God.  
 You see that?  
The word of God will bring everything else in.  
You talk about your job, you talk about your business, you talk about your finances, talk about your family, talk about your month, talk about everything that concerns you.  
You tell you how to work on your time, a push in your time to different things.  
So you haven't heard the word or learned the word if it hasn't showed you how to a push in your time properly.  
Because all of that is in the word.  
 Hallelujah.  
See, why do people get sick?  
Why is it that a man that was, everything was alright with him and then suddenly there's something growing in his body that wasn't there before?  
How weird did the cancer come from?  
Where did the tumor come from?  
Something brought it.  
 He could have come from the food or the drink, something he ate or drank, or something he ate or drank.  


  
I know for some, what does it mean?  
Well, that's like Jesus saying, yet a little while I am with you, yet a little while I am with you.  
So they say, what do you mean, yet a little while, yet a little while?  
 Well, either something he ate or drank in a physical, or something he ate or drank in words.  
That's where all of those things will come from.  
 So I didn't say, I've never been sick in my life.  
I don't know where suddenly got this diabetes from.  
I don't know where I got this hypertension from.  
Well, you got it from something you ate or drank.  
In words or in food and drink down on your table somewhere.  
 If it didn't come from something physical, it came from a thought that you received, a word that you read or you heard that had the ability to sow a seed in you.  
All that was necessary was a seed, a gem of sickness, a gem of disease.  
It could be so small you can't see it with your optical eyes.  
 It's like looking for bacteria with your ice.  
No, you don't find them like that.  
Just a little jump.  
Let's plant it in there.  
And that's growing because the environment is favorable.  
You see that?  
The environment is favorable.  
And that's growing.  
And you say, I don't know where this thing came from.  
Well,  
 If you will use the Word and let the Word get into your body, the Word of God will sanctify your body.  
It will make your body impenable to sickness and disease.  
Then ask the Holy Spirit, we're talking Christ consciousness, do you understand?  
 See, when was it Christ in you the hope of glory?  
Christ is the anointed one.  
And that anointed comes into your life.  
And that anointed will never come without the word.  


  
 So Christ in you mingles with you.  
You become one divine creation with him.  
We just read it.  
He that has joined the Lord is one spirit.  
You become so much one with God until that oneness is revealed even in your physical body such that when disease comes as it comes to your body is that dying on contact.  
 on contact.  
So we are no longer the ones who are afraid to touch.  
That's why Jesus sent us the lay hands on the sick.  
We can lay hands on anybody.  
Doesn't matter what sickness they have, we can't go with the infection.  
Why?  
Because we have another life.  
 Do you realize that you're actually dead to the world?  
That's what the Bible says.  
You're dead to the world.  
That means the things that affect people of this world cannot recognize you to function in you.  
As far as they are concerned, you're dead.  
You're dead to them.  
 Oh, didn't you read what Paul said?  
He said, I'm dead to the world.  
The world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.  
That means as far as I'm concerned, the world's dead.  
And as far as they're concerned, I'm dead.  
So we're dead to each other.  
He said, I'm crucified unto the world.  
And the world is crucified unto me.  
I'm dead to them and they're dead to me.  
We don't meet.  
Glory to God.  
 So you see that sickness is all over.  
Defeat is all over.  
Disease is all over.  
Fear is all over.  
Because even though we live in this world, we are not of this world.  
We are from, oh glory to God, we are from another country.  
It's called Zion.  
 We belong there, and they that dwell therein shall not say, I am sick.  
All right now, you know, you just quoted scripture, right?  
They shall not say, I'm sick.  
So some of them say, I am tired.  
I've been very strong for three days.  
 You know, things like that.  
You see, this thing is not a game.  
This thing is reality.  
I hear me.  
It's not us trying to look for what to say.  
No, we tell the truth all the time.  
We're trying to look for words to ever... How are you?  
I'm getting better.  
Oh, I'm strong.  
 You know, I said, OK, if you are strong, come on, do this now.  
Say, I mean, I'm strong.  
Hey, carry it now.  
I need to rest.  
I'm very strong.  
You know, kind of self-deception, because they... Let me explain something.  
They don't understand the meaning of speaking the word.  
They don't understand it.  
 You are not trying to cover up something.  
You're telling the truth.  
And when you tell the truth, you put yourself in it.  
If it was true that you were strong when you said, ah, am strong, you'd carry it.  
You see that?  
 That's faith.  
Faith is the stance of things hoped for.  
The evidence of things not sinned.  
So your faith at that point is not, I'm strong, I'm strong.  
No, it is the proof of the word.  
Evidence of things not sinned.  
Evidence, evidence is proof.  
 So you cannot see that I am strong.  
You cannot feel that I am strong, because you can feel the heat coming from my body.  
So he's got fever.  
So Anya, you can't see it, but I've got evidence that I am sound.  
So what I do, what I ought to do, that well people do.  
 That's evidence.  
That's my fate at work.  
That's how come Jesus will say to a man who couldn't walk, get up and walk.  
The man should have said, my legs are weak.  
Or my legs are strong and remain there.  
No, if they are strong, according to the word now, you get up.  
He said to a man with a withered arm, stretch for your hand.  
He couldn't, he couldn't.  
Yet Jesus said, stretch it for us.  
 And there was that faith, evidence, proof of what you don't see, proof.  
So you prove the word in your life.  
So when you say you're a prince of God, prove your princely nature at work, at home, on the way, everywhere you are, because you are the best of the Lord.  
Prove your blessing.  
The Bible says, walk out your own salvation.  
In other words, manifest it.  
 Hey, are you catching it?  
Are you receiving it?  
You know sometimes we just feel like we're gonna carry our whole thing and put it right into somebody.  
But it doesn't work that way.  
You gotta hear it.  
 See, you hear it, you let your spirit get a hold of it, you meditate on it, and then you put it to work.  
You say to yourself a thousand times, I know who I am.  
Hallelujah.  
I'm a victim in Christ Jesus.  
Doesn't matter how you used to think.  
Say, oh, that guy, he's reasoning is terrible.  
Something is wrong with his brain.  
Then you come and say, yeah, that was a long time ago.  
I'm a changed man.  
Praise God.  
 I'm a change man.  
You're a change man?  
Yeah.  
How?  
I've been meditating on the work and it's changed my mind.  
Changed my thinking.  
Hallelujah.  
I think different.  
I'm a success.  
You're a success?  
Oh yes, I am.  
Yes, I am.  
Father, I thank you.  
You're leading me today.  
I worship you, King of Glory.  
I am going out today and I'm getting some real good job.  
 I have direction in my spirit, I'm going to say the right thing and I'm going to do the right thing because Christ in me the hope of glory.  
 I have an excellent spirit in the name of Jesus.  
I have an excellent spirit.  
I've got divine favor on the left hand and on the right.  
I've got divine favor everywhere I go in the name of Jesus.  
And I have the spirit of dominion.  
I cannot be intimidated by circumstances of people or events.  
I am full of God and full of the Holy Ghost.  
Thank you, Father, in the name of Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
 And you know what, you get that giant killer mentality in your spirit.  
You got it inside you.  
You become a winner 24 hours a day.  
Seven days a week.  
52 weeks a year.  
Are you hearing me?  
Oh yeah.  
Say this with me, the life of God is in me.  
Every fiber of my being.  
Every bone of my body.  
 Now, you know what I just said, that you just repeated.  
If you said that and said it with your spirit and said it, letting your spirit go through your whole body, it will burn up everything that is not of God in your body.  
It will.  
It will.  
It will.  
If you said it the first time, and there was no difference, say it again.  
 Put your hand in there.  
You say, I'm possessed and I win.  
You wake up the next day and you see it, you laugh.  
The verses resist the devil and he will flee from you.  
 You know, sometimes they're praying about something and they want to change, and they say, the pray, and they say, oh God, they're discouraged because of what they see.  
Never be discouraged.  
Are you hearing me?  
Listen, listen.  
This is an important secret of the Lord.  
The Bible says, the secret of the Lord is within the fear Him.  
Do you understand?  
Let us read it together.  
You ready?  
Book of Joshua.  
Chapter 1.  
 Are you ready?  
Okay.  
Read verse 8.  


  
Okay.  
Okay.  
Thank you.  
But let me read it to you.  
 And I want you to listen carefully because that's not where I'm going to stop.  
This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, not thy heart, but thy mouth.  
Notice what God says and what he doesn't say.  
This time, he didn't say the heart.  
He said, the book should not depart from your mouth.  
That means the message inside it, right?  
Must be in your mouth.  
 Okay.  
But thou shalt merde there in day and night, thou mayest observe to do according to all that's written therein, for then thou shalt make thy way.  
Thou shalt make thy way.  
You are the one that will make your way, prosperous.  
He didn't say, then I shall make you prosperous.  
He said, thou shalt make thy way.  
Prosperous.  
 And then thou shall have good success."  
Now, notice, verse 9, have not I commanded thee?  
Be strong and offer good courage.  
Be not afraid.  
Neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee without so ever thou goest.  
Hallelujah.  
Have you seen that?  
He says, be strong.  
 And what?  
That's what you need.  
Let's read from verse.  
I want to show you another thing.  
Now, read from verse five.  
I want you to notice something.  
The first part I read to you had to do with success and prosperity.  
All right?  
Okay.  
Well, let's look at something here from verse five.  
 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life.  
As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.  
I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.  
Be strong and of a good courage, for unto these people shall thou devine from inheritance the land which I serve unto their fathers to give them."  
Read verse 7 again.  
 And stop.  
Now notice how many times God said to be strong and of good courage.  
In verse 7, He seemed to be passionate.  
He seemed to save at all of His heart to this man Joshua.  
 He says, only be thou strong and very courageous.  
That's all God's asking for.  
He says, look, I'll be with you.  
All I want from you is that you be strong and very courageous.  
No matter what happens, you say, it's well, good.  
 Everything's going to be all right.  
He says, be strong.  
In other words, don't chicken out.  
Don't become afraid.  
He says, be strong.  
Stand your ground.  
No matter what happens, just stand your ground.  
And then he says, and very courageous.  


  
 So there's no room for discouragement.  
Say, actually, what's happening is that I'm getting discouraged.  
What do you mean, you?  
No, I'm a man.  
Even in a natural life, it's insulting for men to say, I'm getting discouraged.  
You're what?  
You are what?  
 Say the way things are just green, I'm getting discouraged.  
Do you think it's fashionable?  
Do you think for a moment that it sounds nice to speak in an effeminate way?  
I'm getting discouraged.  
 Doesn't matter what you're discouraged about.  
You shouldn't be.  
That language shouldn't come from you.  
You shouldn't be a part of your vocabulary.  


  
I've tried.  
I've done it all.  
In fact, at the time, I became discouraged.  
Look at you.  
I became discouraged.  
You think it's nice communication.  
Like those guys that say, it's scary.  
 You and Junio, we announced that Junio would not come daddy.  
Is he scary?  
You say, oh yes, he's scary.  
With your hawky chest, he's scary.  
Never say, I'm scared, you're scared, scared.  
 I'm afraid, I'm afraid the weird things are going, I'm afraid you.  
You're afraid.  
He said be not afraid.  
I'm afraid, why most you have it in your language?  
Do you know who you are?  
You're not an ordinary person.  
I'm afraid it's going to rain tomorrow.  
Do you have to be afraid to say it?  
 Do you have to be afraid that it's going to rain tomorrow?  
I think it's going to rain tomorrow.  
Or it might rain tomorrow.  
Why am I afraid?  
I'm afraid they may not come.  
I'm afraid they may not make it early.  
My fear is that this whole thing... She stop talking your fears!  
Listen, when you talk fear, fear is a spirit.  
 Before long, you don't take a hold of you and bind you.  
Then you say, you don't know where this trouble came from.  
My fear is that it may not work.  


  
My fear.  
So you know you have a position called fear.  
Your own fear.  
Your property called fear.  


  
 This my headache has been, your headache, this, this my headache has been coming off and on.  
This my asthma, this my, this my, this my hypertension, this my, you've claimed it, then you say you don't know why it's not going away.  
It's your possession and as long as you declare it's yours, God will not take from you what you have claimed is yours.  


  
 My problem, this my problem, since it's my problem.  


  
Say this with me, I'm a child of God.  
I have a new language, and it's the language of the spirit.  
It's the language of a victor.  
I win all the time.  
 I'm not saying again, I win all the time.  
No, no, I want to get into your spirit.  
I win all the time.  
Hold on, hold on.  
You can't say that with the feeling of defeat.  
I win all the time.  
Hey.  
Do you win all the time?  
I win all the time.  
We win all the time.  
We win all the time.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
I know who I am.  
I win all the time.  
Glory to God, I win all the time.  
I'm making progress.  
I'm moving forward.  
I'm a victim.  
Glory to God.  
Amen.  
 The word of God is in me.  
The life of God is in me.  
Christ in me, the hope of glory.  
He's in my spirit.  
He's in my soul.  
He's in my body.  
I carry the divine presence.  
Hallelujah.  
Lift your hands to what heaven and just worship the Lord and thank Him.  
Glory to God.
