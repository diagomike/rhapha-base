title: Attitude
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
I want us to look at a few things in the Bible.  
There are certain things that define your personality, your fulfillment, and your value, your attitude,  
 It's very important.  
Somebody said years ago, attitude the way to altitude.  
Good rhyme.  
Your attitude, your way of doing things, your way of seeing  
 what you want to say.  
You know, we can say something that is right with the wrong attitude.  
And that destroys the right thing that we said.  
You know, a lot of people in life  


  
 A lot of people are not necessarily doing something wrong or saying something wrong.  
They just have a bad attitude.  
They just have the wrong attitude.  


  
A lot of times we hear wrongly, not because what was said was wrong, but we had the wrong attitude in listening  


  
 Did you know that one of the reasons certain people have, they find themselves taking one step forward and then two steps backward?  
And then some other times everything seems to be all right, but spiritually they're not fulfilled.  
So wrong attitude.  
The trouble is a lot of people who have  
 the wrong attitude, hardly discover that they have a wrong attitude.  
So they blame everyone else around them for the things that go wrong about them.  
They think someone else is responsible.  
And no one is responsible, they just have the wrong attitude.  
 Your attitude can define your personality.  
It can define your fulfillment.  
Do you know there are people who are not fulfilled?  
They're not fulfilled at home, they're not fulfilled in their family?  
Always it looks like they're in the wrong house.  
 You know, I shouldn't be in this house.  
This is not the right house.  
Some feel like they're in the wrong family.  
They feel they came through the wrong family.  
I should have never been born in this family.  
You know, they got the wrong energy, but they don't realize it.  
They think everyone else is the problem.  
Same thing at work.  
You know why there's so much?  
I mean,  
 Oh boy, the multitude of people that are, they're still having exodus.  
The journey from one company to another, from one organization to another, they just can't be somewhere.  
 Why?  
They got the wrong attitude and don't know it.  
So they think those there are their problems.  
 They always see their wasted years.  
The wasted time.  
I wasted my years in Chevron.  
I wasted my years in Mobile.  
I wasted my years in the federal government.  
I wasted my years in the Ministry of Justice.  
I wasted my years in the Ministry of Education.  
They've wasted their years everywhere.  
That's the way they think.  
But always, they have felt it was someone else who didn't discover their greatness.  


  
 See?  
So they know they're available.  
But why can't anybody else find your value?  
Because chances are, you've got the wrong attitude.  
The wrong attitude.  
There's so much to learn from Jesus.  
Many times in your life when you want to make progress, find out  
 about the Master's attitude and find out those whom Jesus praised.  
Did he praise anybody?  
Why did he praise the ones he praised?  
You can read some more, study through the Old Testament as well and find out those whom God praised.  
Why did he praise them?  
What was peculiar to them?  
 What was in their attitude or in their character?  
That was so impressive to God.  
When I look at the new Testament section of the Bible, one of those characters that come to mind is John the Baptist, because of what Jesus said about him.  
He said, of all men born of women,  
 There's no greater than John the Baptist.  
That's powerful.  
That's powerful.  
He said, John the Baptist was greater than them all.  


  
But then he said, the least in the kingdom of heaven.  
Hey, come on.  
Can we read it?  
All right.  
 Somebody's gospel.  


  
Chapter 11, I'd like to begin reading from verse seven.  
Are you there?  
And as they departed,  
 Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, what went he out into the wilderness to see?  
A reed shaken with the wind?  
But what went he out for to see?  
A man clothed in soft raiment?  
Behold, they that were soft clothing are in King's houses.  
 But what went out for the sea, a prophet?  
He's asking them, you know, they had gone out to see John the Baptist when he was ministering.  
A lot of people went out to see him, to hear him.  
And Jesus now is asking them, when you went out to see John, what in the world did you think you were going to see?  
Who did you think he was?  
That's what he's asking them.  
 Verse 9.  
But what went ye out for the sea?  
A prophet?  
Yea, I say unto you, Ain, more than a prophet.  
 For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I've sent my messenger before thy face, which I'll prepare thy way before thee.  
Verily I say unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not reason of greater than John the Baptist.  


  
 Not withstanding, I want you to notice, not withstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  
And that's important for us to understand.  
Notice he didn't say he that is least in the kingdom of God.  
He said he that is least in the kingdom of heaven and there's a big difference.  
I remember sharing with you a long time ago  
 What was the title of that message?  
The kingdom, the power and the glory, yeah.  
And then I explained to you the difference between the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of God.  
The kingdom of heaven is that which Jesus has come to establish in the earth.  
 Jesus is the head of the kingdom of heaven, and the kingdom of heaven is actually here in the earth.  
The kingdom of God includes everything, but Papa God is the boss of that one.  
And he sent Jesus to establish the kingdom of heaven in the earth.  
And that is the kingdom of which we are apart.  
 That kingdom started here when Jesus came.  


  
Are you listening to this?  
And took off after his death, burial and resurrection.  
So it's actually the church of the New Testament.  
 Okay?  
So that's function in India Earth.  
So that means he is talking about those who are joint heirs with Christ.  
How are you listening to this?  
He's talking about us in the new Testament.  
 The only reason it says that we are greater is because we have the body of Christ.  
And each one of us has been exalted to that place where we are seated together with Christ.  
So it's not just something about us as people, but us as the body of Christ.  
Amen.  
 glory to God.  
That's really powerful.  
Okay.  
Now, notice how Jesus commended John.  
So what kind of a man was John?  
How could Jesus come in such a man?  
If Jesus said the man was so great and no one born  
 as a human.  
Was that great or greater than John the Baptist?  
I'd like to find out what does the Baptist say more about him.  
Praise the Lord.  
Who did you turn to?  
St.  
John's Gospel.  
Chapter three.  


  
 Let's go down to, let me begin reading from verse 22.  
After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea, and there he tarried with them and baptized.  
 And John also was baptizing in Anon near to Selim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized.  
For John was not yet cast into prison.  
You get it?  
Now John the Baptist was ministry.  
He was baptizing people and Jesus also had come to baptize.  
So Jesus was baptizing somewhere and John was baptizing somewhere.  
 So now Jesus the Baptist and John the Baptist.  
But the Bible does tell us that actually Jesus left the baptism to his disciples to help out with when he was there.  
 All right, now, verse 25.  
Then there are rows of questions between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.  
Now remember, baptism is one of those things in the Bible.  
Let me put it this way.  
I don't know how many of you might have encountered people who tried to spit hairs about water baptism.  
 They say that water baptism can be done in any way by a passion.  
You can do it by pouring the bottle of water on somebody's head.  
You understand?  
Spring clean?  
All of these things.  
Or you can just take a bath and you're baptized.  
You know?  
 They say, why do we say that to be baptized you've got to be dipped into the water?  
So you've got a problem with those who baptize by dipping into water.  
Now here in Bible days they have that problem.  
 So notice what the question was.  
It says there are rows of question between John's disciples and some of the Jews about the term used was purifying.  
Another term would be washes.  
I want you to get it right.  
Now, get to understand this background.  
 Among the Jews based on the law, they purified everything by washing.  
They didn't eat with those plates until they were washed.  
Not just washed like, you know, washed with soap and get it clean.  
No, it was ceremonial cleansing.  
It had to be washed religiously.  
 If they went out to the marketplace, they didn't come to worship God.  
In fact, they didn't mention the name of God until they had their baths.  
Are you listening to this?  
Now, when they wrote anything, if they got to the name of God, if they were writing a letter to somebody and they got to the name of God, the man stopped before he would write God's name, he would go and have his bath.  
 You understand?  
It was that serious.  
So they had to purify every time by washing with water.  
And then they also had the sprinkling of blood.  
But that of sprinkling was done by the priest.  
But every Jew understood washing.  
They didn't go to the temple cards without washing.  
 So now they find one man called John.  
He doesn't just wash them.  
Now, let me remind you about some of these washes.  
Some of these washes didn't mean you.  
Like I told you, like washing the plate with water.  
No, they could sprinkle water on it.  
And that's, so it's ceremonial washing.  
 So it signified that it had been cleansed of its uncleanness.  
So the sprinkled water on it or pasted through water, so many different ways they did.  
And just to be sure, this thing was ready for the Jew to use before God.  
So now they find people are going to John and John doesn't just  
 Sprinkle water on them.  
John doesn't just pour water on them.  
John dips them into the water.  
And they got to start.  
And they said, what kind of beautifying is this?  
Must someone be dipped into the water?  
So that's why they called him John the Baptist.  
Now the word baptism from where they got the Baptist,  
 came from the Greek translation of the New Testament, the word baptism.  
It means to deep completely into, to completely immerse.  
So they associated John's kind of purifying with the complete immersion of the persons.  
 That's what distinguished between John's kind of purifying and the Jews' kind of purifying.  
They didn't dip people into the water.  
They sprinkled water on them.  
And here's this John dipping them completely inside.  
I say, hey, man, where are you from?  
And so Jesus now comes on the scene and he's not washing them like the Jews were doing.  
 or sprinkling water on them like the Jews were doing.  
He's acting like John the Baptist.  
He's dipping the people also into the water.  
You get in the background?  
Okay, let's read.  
We are reading verse 25 again.  
Then there are rows of questions between some of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying.  
And they came on to John  
 and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan.  
See, they were there when Jesus, when John said some things about Jesus after the baptism, he baptized Jesus.  
And that's another very powerful area.  
Okay, we'll talk about that.  
So they knew Jesus and John had met.  
They were there.  
And they heard the things that John said about Jesus.  
 Now they find Jesus baptizing people too.  
So they come to Jordan and they say unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou bear as witness, behold the same baptize it.  
He is dipping people into water too.  
And all men come to him.  
So many people are coming to him.  
They're still in your show.  


  
 And so John answered and said, who is that guy?  
Oh, come on here.  
What you reading?  
John answered and said, the mind is bigger than him.  
And what you got?  
John said, we'll see on the last day.  
Only true believers have you.  
 I don't know what he said.  
Verse 27, John answered and said, a man can receive nothing excepting the given him from heaven.  
Oh, glory to God.  
What an answer.  
Listen, we're trying to find out about the man John, his attitude.  
What kind of a man was he?  


  
 I want to remind you that he didn't know Jesus as good as you do.  
The man was spoken to by the Spirit of God like he would talk to anyone of you.  
That's the way the Spirit of God spoke to him.  
 and said the one on whom you see the Spirit of God descend on him like a dove or in the form of a dog, the same you see that baptize him with the Holy Ghost and with fire.  
That's all.  
And he knew by prophetic revelation who Jesus was.  
He didn't know him from anywhere else, it was prophetic revelation.  


  
 So he could have been in competition with Jesus.  
He could have been upset.  
Just say, come on, man.  
You're not supposed to be baptized.  
I'm the Baptist.  
I've born a witness concerning you already.  
You just go die for them if that's right.  
I'm the Baptist.  
Why didn't you do that?  
 He said, let's read his words again.  
Verse 27, John answered and said, the man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven.  
Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ.  
 but that I am sent before him.  
He that had the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.  
Oh, I like that.  
This my joy therefore is fulfilled.  
I like that attitude, attitude, attitude, attitude, attitude, attitude.  
 Your attitude can determine, can define your fulfillment in life.  
There are people who are never fulfilled, not because things are gone wrong, but because they have a bad attitude.  
They have a bad attitude.  
 He said, look, my joy is to hear the bridegroom's voice.  
He said, the one who owns the bride is the bridegroom.  
The friend of the bridegroom rejoices to hear his voice.  
He said, my joy therefore is fulfilled.  
I'm okay.  
I'm glad.  
Are you not the drummer?  
The TV never shows your face.  
 You just keep drumming and it's only the, it's only the solos that they show, hand to the drummer.  
Why can't anybody see your face?  
And yet you're the best drummer.  
I said, look, I helped make that music work.  
My joy is fulfilled.  
What is your attitude?  
It matters what you're looking at in your life.  
 the things that make us unhappy in life.  
The things that make us unhappy.  
The things that pain us.  
Sometimes we even develop the attitude of the man Heyman in the Bible.  
Do you remember Heyman in the Bible?  
 who had become so great, he was next to the king because the king promoted him.  
And every time he passed by, everybody stood up because Prince Heyman was coming through.  
But there was a man who never bowed to Heyman because he was a Jew.  
And that man knew the wickedness of Heyman.  
His name was Mordecai.  
 And when Heyman noticed that the guy never bowed to him, he thought about what he was going to do until some friends came to him and said, have you noticed?  
 Have you noticed that that man mother care never bows when you pass by?  
He said, I thought so.  
Just wasn't sure where or not it was because of me or something.  
He said, it's you.  
Every time you pass by, he doesn't, the rest of us will bow except mother care.  
What did Heyman say?  
His pride was hurt.  
He couldn't take it.  
 His pride was hurt.  
He couldn't take it.  
He said, look, to deal with mother care alone is a disgrace for me.  
Our finisher with all his people, his uncles, his cousins, everybody, all his friends, everyone that's associated with him.  
And he went for it to do it.  
But God stopped him in his tracks.  
 Why is it that sometimes some of God's children take up the attitude of, hey man, that someone who doesn't greet you and nothing cannot leave your mind?  
Every time I come, he can't see me.  
He acts as if I'm so small.  
Until you are so upset when they are, I'm so small you can't see me.  


  
 Did you lose anything?  
Why did you care?  
The guy doesn't greet you.  
He doesn't make you less than you are.  
You go ahead and greet him anyway.  
I'm going to try to be nasty and say, good morning, no.  
Well, don't get nasty.  
Just be nice.  
Be yourself.  
Don't care about those things.  
Have the right attitude.  
 the right attitude.  
Ask yourself a question.  
If God didn't bless me like this, without being anybody to be seen, why should I care?  
That's the way you should think.  
It pays when the Spirit of God corrects us about our attitude so that we can walk right.  
You still listening?  
So you come to a point in your life where you don't care about those things.  
 They just don't matter.  
You develop the right attitude.  
When the wrong attitude shows up, near it, get it out of your life.  
And when you act correctly, you have the right attitude, God will continue to promote you.  
The Bible says, God resists the proud.  
He elbows the proud.  
 The more they try to rise by themselves, the more he elbows them.  
He resists them.  
They think it's someone else that's resisting them.  
No, no, no, it's God.  
He resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.  
The humble just keeps moving forward.  
But the proud, you know, they can... I mean, I'm something, you know?  
They can't understand.  
Who does it?  
Who?  
You know?  
 But God looks at that humble fellow over there and exalts you.  
God's promotions cannot be forced by human beings.  
And when it's God who's promoting you, it doesn't come with bitterness, it doesn't come with anger, it doesn't come with jealousy.  
Are you listening?  
The right attitude.  
I know where I'm supposed to be by now.  
That is not from God.  
 Who told you you're supposed to be someone?  
No, the rest is not to the swift.  
The battle is not to the strong.  
What makes you better than someone else?  
I know where my mates are talking.  
Really?  
So I'm not talking in prison.  
It's true.  


  
I know where my mates are.  
See, because I'm here.  
What?  
 God resists the power.  
But it gives grace, grace, grace.  
I have seen people with abilities, unable to move.  
Why they are grumbling and getting angry where they are, but they have so much abilities.  
They know, all those know that they have abilities.  
But as they move, God says, why?  
 The Bible says, home do yourself therefore, only the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.  
In due time, there is a due time.  
There's a due time.  
It might be in your office, and you've not been promoted for 10 years.  
You watch your genius go ahead of you.  
Home do yourself.  
 He will exhort you in due time.  
When that due time comes, those 10 steps will not elude you.  
That he may exhort you in due time.  
We don't all journey through the same route.  
It doesn't mean Festo start, it will be Festo finish.  
 One of the things you should be careful about in your life is the temptation to measure yourself with other people.  
Look at John.  
Look at John.  
Read him.  
Let's go again to that portion we're reading.  
 We read again verse 29.  
He that had the bride is the bridegroom.  
But a friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and hear at him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.  
This my joy, therefore, is fulfilled.  
He must increase, but I must decrease.  
What an attitude.  
He must increase, but I must decrease.  
Jesus himself was humble.  
 Did you read when he came to be baptized by John?  
The crowd came, Jesus was among them.  
When he got to Jesus' turn, the Holy Ghost descended on him and John saw it by the Spirit and knew him because that was the sign given to him of God to recognize Jesus.  
Then John stopped and said, Master, I'm the one who has need to be baptized of you.  
 Does thou come to me?"  
And Jesus said, go ahead and baptize me.  
He said, for it behooves us to fulfill our righteousness.  
We have to fulfill our righteousness.  
He said, go ahead and baptize me.  
So John would lay hands on Jesus.  
 No, no, no.  
You know, I know there are people who compete about later on and says, nope, this is my head.  
Only God has put his hand.  
Someone's saying to lay hand to him, say, oh, hey, hey.  
Is it you?  
Hm.  
Hallelujah.  
 Jesus said, go ahead.  
Let it be so.  
It's our responsibility to fulfill all righteousness.  
And was there and let John baptize him, dip him into the water and bring him out.  
Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
 There are things in the Word of God that sometimes I think some of us miss.  
When you turn to Saint Matthew's gospel, chapter five.  
Saint Matthew's gospel, chapter five.  
There's so much to gain in the Word of God.  
From verse one.  
 And seeing the monitudes, he went up into a mountain.  
And when he was set, his disciples came onto him and he opened his mouth and taught them, most teaching Jesus.  
He opened his mouth and taught them, saying, blessed are the poor in spirit.  
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  
Notice he didn't say the kingdom of God.  
He said here, the kingdom of heaven, the poor in spirit.  
 Who are the poor in spirit?  
For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  
The kingdom of heaven is about a lifestyle and authority.  
It's about a lifestyle and authority.  
That's what the kingdom of heaven is about.  
It's about a lifestyle and authority.  
 Now Jesus says, that life belongs to them.  
That authority belongs to them.  
The poor in spirit.  
The poor in spirit.  
And then he sees the kingdom of heaven.  
The kingdom of heaven doesn't function in heaven, it functions in the earth.  
Now here are two things that can help you understand what is meant by the poor in spirit.  
 One, is that he said, in spirit.  
And two, he said, what belongs to them?  
The kingdom of heaven, which functions in the earth?  
The kingdom of heaven functions in the earth among human beings.  
Physical beings, the spiritual beings, but they live in physical bodies.  
And yet these ones are poor in spirit.  


  
 How then could the Kingdom of Heaven belong to them?  
Watch this.  
The Kingdom of Heaven has come to us by Jesus Christ.  
We have become joint heirs with Him.  
So in the realm of the Spirit, we are absolutely wealthy.  
We've got well-on told.  
We are absolutely wealthy.  
 But then, we function in the earth.  
And in the earth, He's given us authority, meaning there's nothing that we can't get by the use of that authority.  
So how can you then be poor in spirit?  
Because in the realm of the spirit, you'll reach.  
Then in the earth, you've got authority, you can get what you want.  
 So how can you be poor in spirit?  
Very good.  
Look at Jesus.  
The Bible tells us he didn't seize upon his reputation as the Son of God, but laid down his glory.  
It tells us something about  
 How we can, let me give you a simple example, Jesus, a young rich young ruler came to him one time.  
You remember the story, rich, that's the way the Bible describes him, rich young ruler, that means a young prince, what he was rich.  
So the young man came to Jesus and said, good master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?  
 And Jesus said, you know the commandments.  
Keep them and you shall live.  
He said, which one?  
Because he had done something.  
He had lived right.  
So he said, which one?  
And Jesus went, thou shalt and thou shalt and thou shalt.  
When Jesus was through, the man said, all these have I kept from my youth.  
What else do I lack?  
 Then Jesus said, all right, go and sell what you have and give it to the poor and come and follow me.  
The Bible says the man was sad and went away.  
 What was that?  
What was Jesus saying?  
Was Jesus against what the man had?  
No, if that's where he would have said it the first time.  
That wasn't a problem.  
Jesus wanted the man to have the kind of attitude that was, I want you.  
Nothing else can satisfy.  
Jesus said, go sell what you have, give it to the poor, and come and follow me.  
 No, no, no, he didn't.  
He went away.  
He went away.  
He means that chance.  
What, when Jesus is blessed at the poor in spirits?  
For if such is the kingdom of heaven, that means those who have in spirits, given up everything.  
 You may see a lot with them, but they have counted all those things, but don't.  
That's what Paul said.  
You've done to a point in your life where nothing matters.  
And everything you have is for the peppers of the kingdom of God, the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
Nothing satisfies.  
Nothing is important to you.  
In spirits, you have given up those things.  
 You know you can be wearing a watch, an expensive watch, but you have given it up.  
In other words, you've come to a point in your life if the Spirit God says, hey, can you give this to someone, or can you give that in the offering?  
Phew, no arguments.  
You get what I'm saying?  
You've come to a point in your life where nothing really matters to you.  
That's the poor in spirit.  
They have spiritually in themselves given up everything.  
 So it doesn't matter what you see with them, those things don't own them anymore.  
Blessed are the poor in spirits.  
To them belongs the kingdom of heaven, Christ's kingdom that has been established here in the earth, to bring the lifestyle of heaven and the authority of heaven into this world to bless men's lives.  
Hallelujah.  
 Are you still there?  
What's the second one?  
After you said that, what's the next verse?  
Blessed, verse 4, blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted.  
Who are they that mourn?  
He's not saying blessed is that man whose uncle died and he was mourning.  
He's not saying blessed is that man whose child died.  
No, he's not talking about that kind of mourning because Jesus was a prophet.  
 And he's using prophetic language here.  
All right?  
He's using prophetic language.  
And it's important to understand it.  
When you read about the prophets, you'd see prophets who mourned.  
And the Bible tells us how they'll put ashes on their head or tear their clothes.  
 Because they mourned.  
What was their money about?  
They weren't mourning because they lost something.  
They were mourning because of the children of God.  
Who had either gone into captivity or because something went wrong and God's people had become victims or that the people weren't serving God the way they should have been serving God.  
And so they mourned in intercession.  
That's what he's talking about.  
He said, blessed are they, that man, for they shall be comforted.  
 How has this affected you?  
In your life, do things concerning other people get your attention?  
It's one of the problems we have among Christians today.  
They hear that so and so doesn't go to church anymore.  
They don't learn.  
They don't cry in prayer.  
To them,  
 Something's wrong with the church, or something's wrong with the person, and that's all.  
Nobody's praying.  
Nobody's praying.  


  
It's as though many of us have become so callous in our hearts.  
You know, one of the beautiful things that I enjoy looking at is when I see the names of certain people  
 You know, people who today there are ministers or leaders, you know, among us, there are ministry all over the place.  
And I have the names in different fires.  
And people don't know what those names are doing there.  
But I wrote them down for intercession, spraying for them.  
If I notice someone had a terrible attitude, I put his name there.  
 If I noticed someone who probably wasn't consistent, comes today, you don't see him the next two weeks, you talk with him, and then he gives you all these kind of funny answers, put his name there.  
I've got names of several people.  
That's how comes some of you here are very serious now, but that's what I was doing.  
Yeah?  
 There's some people I just noticed in church, maybe because I talked to them or someone told me, I found out that they just never was stable in their business.  
But they had abilities.  
But nothing was going right.  
I knew the answer.  
Intercession.  
Intercession.  
I'm not talking about, oh God, I remember John Brown in prayer.  
Do it for him Lord, do it for him Lord, do it for him.  
 That's not the kind of prayer I'm talking about.  
Crying, crying.  
Crying.  
I just would know that this prayer session I'm going to have is a crying session.  
That's what I just gave.  
It's not crying.  
I must cry today.  
I have a message titled, try tears.  
Some of you have never heard it.  
 because I know that tears work.  
They work on some of you.  
You know what I'm talking about?  
Some people can't get some things from you until it's that crime.  
And when you say, ah, okay stop now, stop, stop.  
It works for God too, sometimes.  
But it has to be according to the word, not kind about what is already given you.  
 He's just not crying, they're bawling.  
He pray.  
Oh God.  
He make him a preacher.  
He pray like that.  
He will preach it.  
He will tell everybody.  


  
 Blessed are they that mourn!  
He says, for they shall be comforted.  
You see, when we start seeing those resorts, we are rejoicing like this glory to God.  
Look at that guy, he used to be a rascal.  
I look at him now.  
I get him now.  
Thank you, Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
I look at him now.  
Something about the attitude, I said, attitude is important.  
 Attitude.  
Attitude defines your fulfillment.  
It defines your value.  
When we talk about value, remember we read about John the Baptist and what value Jesus placed on him because of his attitude.  
All right?  
And then fulfillment.  
He said, my joy therefore is fulfilled.  
We find that in the life of Moses as well.  
If you read, turn the book of Exodus.  
 Exodus 32, Exodus 32, and from verse 10.  


  
God, one time, was very angry with the children of Israel in the days of Moses.  
 He said, get out of my way, get out.  
Let me finish them.  
Listen, are you ready?  
From verse 10.  
Now therefore, let me alone that my rot may wax hot against them and that I may consume them and I will make of the great nation.  
Look up.  
I don't know if you were Moses.  
Listen to what God said.  
God's so angry against the children of Israel because of some things that don't run.  
 And he said, get out of my way.  
Let me finish these people.  
I'll consume them.  
Then I will make a great nation from you.  
What do you have thought?  
It's true.  
It's stiff-necked people.  


  
Let's see.  
 And Moses besought the Lord his God and said, Lord, why God thy rod what's hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?  
Wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say, for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth, torn from thy rod, from thy fierce rods, and repent of this evil against thy people?  
 He got in the way.  
God said, leave me alone.  
Let me consume that.  
He said, leave me alone.  
That means God felt held back by Moses' prayer.  
He said, I will raise another people from you.  
You have a great nation.  
Who not have been wonderful?  
 Is it of saying the God of Abraham who said the God of Moses?  
But Moses wasn't after his own name.  
He said, oh God, what if the enemies should hear?  
They would say you couldn't take them to that promised land.  
That's why you killed them in the mountains here.  
Please turn from your first, your first rocks.  
Please, what an attitude.  
No one that the Bible says God said about Moses that he was the meekest man on the face of the earth.  
 That's what God said about Moses.  
He said Moses was the weakest man on the face of the earth.  
Hi.  
As I think about those that God has commended, find out something about their life, their attitudes.  
Why did God praise them?  
Why was God so pleased with them?  
Why was it so identified with them?  
 Copy that attitude.  
Copy it.  
Same book, same chapter.  
Run down.  
Diverse 31.  
That's Exodus 32.  
Verse 31.  


  
 And Moses returned on to the Lord and said, oh, these people have seen the great sin and have made them gods of good.  
Yet now, if thou would forgive thy sin.  
And if not, blot me, I pray thee out of thy book, which thou has written.  
What a risk!  
He says, oh God, forgive thy sin.  
If you want, blot me out.  
 What do you think?  
That's serious.  
That's pretty serious.  
He's so connected himself with the people.  
Let me tell you something.  
Our struggle to make ourselves great is useless.  
Learn the value of his own praise in your life.  
 learn the value of his own acceptance.  
If God has accepted you, it doesn't matter who does not accept you.  
Don't measure your life by what others think about you.  
Oh, so you mean you're doing that?  
Don't worry about what others say.  
Fulfill God's calling with humility.  
 Use that attitude.  
Always choose to be humble.  
Because the man that is humble, the Bible says, will be exalted by God.  
That's what the Bible says.  
Lift your hands toward heaven and worship you.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Worship you, honor him.  


  
 May His name be glorified in your life.  
Worship Him.  
Pray, may God's Spirit guide you to have the right attitude every time, no matter what happens.
