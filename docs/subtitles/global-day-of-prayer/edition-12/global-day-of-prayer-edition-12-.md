 you  


  
 Prandolong Rosie, Bracoondalarabakasi, the Karidegestis.  
Cleared Agoramasandagandigilagrucetikimu,  


  
 Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Praise God.  


  
 Now from that documentary you just saw.  
I detail you about that wickedness that was being planned.  
And you've actually begun hatching out  
 That's a tannic plan.  


  
And this is one of the reasons that God's people must learn the word of God and live in it.  
You have to.  
There's no other way.  


  
 Because the Bible tells us that as we journey closer to the coming of the Lord, so much of this will happen.  
Let me read that to you from 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse 1.  
He says, this no also, that in the last days, perilous times shall come.  
 Difficult times.  
Difficult times shall come.  


  
And he tells us why.  


  
The reason is in verse 13.  
Evil man is his.  
 and seduces, deceive us, shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.  
That's the reason.  
Now, on the surface, if you're reading it, you would think verse two is what the reason is.  
No.  
Verse two is a result.  
 says, for men shall be lovers of their own selves, curvatures, boastless, proud, blasphemous, disobedient appearance, unthankful, unholy.  
Without natural affection, truth-breakers, force-acuses, incontinent fears, despises of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures, more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof,  
 And he says from such, turn away.  
And he lets us know why.  
Because evil men seduce us.  
So works worse and worse.  
Deceiving and being deceived.  
And it will breed so much selfishness.  
So much hatred.  


  
 mistrust.  


  
And you go to Romans chapter one, Terrisus, about the heart,  
 of these depraved minds, and why they're that way?  
From verse 28, Romans chapter 1, and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, see, they don't want to have anything to do with God.  
You talk about God to their, no, no, no, they want, they say, take religion out of us, and God is not religion.  
 but they don't understand it.  
So they say, we don't want God in this.  
And so the Bible says, and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind.  
 to do those things which are not convenient.  
Being filled with all unrighteousness, fun occasion, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whispers, but by this, haters of God.  
Think about that, haters of God.  
Despiteful, proud, boasters, then look at that next line.  
Inventors of evil things.  
 like coming up with these genetically modified mosquitoes.  
Pretty ending that they are trying to, of course, that's the selling point they tell you.  
The reason for it is so that they can take care of the natural ones that are dangerous to humans.  
 So they're releasing this modified wands to go out and destroy the natural wands.  
We didn't need it because already several countries are malaria free.  
They already know what to do with those mosquitoes.  
But no, they're not satisfied.  


  
 The countries that are not yet malaria-free are in their situation, their condition, not because they can't afford it, but because of politics, because of the same people who want to sell malaria drugs to them and want to leave them to die.  
So millions of people still die of malaria when they're not supposed to be dying of malaria.  
 Not only is there a cure for malaria, there's also enough signs to eradicate malaria.  
So the problem is not malaria or the mosquitoes.  
They just discovered what to do.  
 And the malaria drugs are absolutely ineffective against these genetically modified mosquitoes.  
And I told you, there will be virus carrying mosquitoes.  
And that's exactly what has happened.  
That's what they've done.  
So these are inventors of evil things.  
 As a child of God, you have to know the Word of God enough to stay healthy and strong because Christ has given us the life eternal life that's beyond this sicknesses and diseases that people suffer with.  


  
 So getting God's word, we have a lot of time to talk about that.  
But tonight, we are concluding our global day of prayer.  
This month of December, that's a very special one.  
This is the 12th edition.  
And I want to specially thank  
 All the amazing, wonderful ministers of the gospel who led us in prayers since last night.  
They were just a short while ago.  
Thank you so much for sharing the word of God with us and leading us in prayer.  
Thank you.  
I pray that the Lord will bless you.  
 bless you again and again, bless you immensely, bless your work and your ministry.  
Thank you so much.  
You know, when we work together like this, they can't beat us.  
They can't beat us.  
And you would have observed that we didn't have Pastor Benny Hinn today.  
Well, that's because  
 There's a special occasion, especially being organized in Dallas today for his 70th birthday.  
So today is his birthday.  
And Pastor Benny, we love you so much.  
We thank you for  
 what you've done with the Word of God and the ministry that God gave to you to affect our lives.  
And for over 40 years of ministry, you've impacted the nations of the world.  
I don't know that in those 40 years, anybody made that kind of impact around the world.  
Thank you so much.  
 Thank you for this blessed ministry of the Spirit that you brought to all of us, millions around the world.  
So today, we especially thank you, thank you, and we celebrate you.  
Can we sing it to him, happy birthday to you?

Now, just a moment, I want you to do something.  
 everywhere around the world.  
I want you to wave like that and sing it with us to pass the Benny and then post it on King's Chat.  
I'm gonna make sure he gets to see yours.  
All right?  
So let's do it.  
Happy birthday to you.

 We love you so much, and we thank you for your love, for your friendship.  
Thank you so much.  
I love you.  
God bless you.  
You may be seated.  


  
Now, I want to read you a few scriptures as I feel because, you know,  
 The whole book is big.  
So what I'm going to read is a lot of scriptures with a few compared to what the book has.  
So I'm going to be reading probably almost 40 verses, so you just get ready.  
I want to read to you all of Nehemiah chapter 9.  
I want you to follow carefully.  
 as we read.  
And then I'll go into chapter 10 and read a few.  
And then, of course, just a little explanation there.  
And then we pray and then we'll look at the Scriptures again at some of the Scriptures.  
 All right, so you get ready.  
Now, in the 20th, I'm reading from, this is the King James translation.  
Maybe I should read to you from, because we're not, we're not reading a lot of scriptures.  
 might be easier for a newer version, just so more people can understand how we read.  
All right, so let's read from the new King James version.  


  
But when we get to the names, you're gonna find a lot of nayas and aayas, so don't worry, we just pronounce them the best way we can, whatever they mean.  
 the illness of the names will be offended.  
They already in heaven.  
All right.  
Now on the 24th day of this month, the children of Israel were assembled with fasting in sacklets and with dust on the heads.  


  
Then those  
 of Israelite lineage separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers and stood up in their place and read from the book of the law of the Lord their God for one fourth of the day and for another fourth they confessed and worshipped the Lord their God.  
 Then Jeshua, Bani, Kagnil, Shabanaiah, Bani, Shabbanaiah, Bani, Antinani, or Kenani, stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice of the Lord, their God.  
And the Levites, Jeshua, Kagnil, Bani, Hasabniah, Shabanaiah, Haudija, Shabanaiah, Pothahiah,  
 said, stand up and bless the Lord your God forever and ever.  
Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all, blessing and praise.  
You alone are the Lord.  
See the praising God here.  
You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens with all their hosts, the earths and everything on it, the seas and all that is in them.  
 and you preserve them all.  
A host of heaven worships you.  
You are the Lord God who chose Abraham and brought him out of all of the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham.  
You found his heart faithful before you and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the heatites, the Amorites, the parasites, the Jebusites and the Gagasites to give it to his descendants  
 You have performed your words for your righteous.  
Now remember, they've gathered together with fasting and then these are words they're saying to God through these Levitical leaders.  
 You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and heard their cry by the Red Sea.  
You showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his servants, and against all the people of his land, for you knew that they acted proudly against them.  
So you made a name for yourself as it is this day, and you divided the sea before them so that they went through the mist of the sea on the dry land.  
 and the persecutors you threw into the deep as a stone into the mighty waters.  
Moreover, you led them by day with a cloudy pillar and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the road which they should travel.  
You came down also on Mount Sinai.  
 and spoke with them from heaven and gave them just ordinances and true laws, good studies and commandments.  
You made known to them your holy Sabbath and commanded them precepts, studies,  
 and laws by the hand of Moses, your servant.  
You give them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought them water out of the rock for their thirst and told them to go in to possess the land which you had sworn to give them.  
But they and our fathers acted proudly, hardened their necks and did not heed your commandments.  
They refused to obey and they were not mindful of your wonders.  
 that you did among them, but they had in their necks, and in their rebellion, they appointed a leader to return to their bondage.  
 But you are God, ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, abandoned in kindness, and did not forsake them.  
Even when they made a molded calf for themselves and said, this is your God that brought you up out of Egypt and worked great provocations, yet in your manifold mercies, you did not forsake them in the wilderness.  
 The pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day to lead them on the road.  
Nor the pillar of fire by night to show them light and the way they should go.  
You also gave your good spirit to instruct them and did not withhold your manner from their mouths.  
And gave them water for their thirst.  
Forty years you sustained them in the wilderness.  
They lacked nothing.  
 Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.  
Moreover, you gave them kingdoms and nations, and divided them into districts, so that to possession of the land of Sihan, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of our king of Bashan, you also multiplied their children as the stars of heaven, and brought them into the land which you had told their fathers to go in and possess.  
 so the people went in and possessed the land.  
You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands with their kings and the people of the land.  
But they might do with them as they wished, and they took strong cities and the rich land and possessed houses full of all goods, systems already dug, vineyards, olive groves,  
 and for trees and abundance, so they ate and were filled and grew fat and delighted themselves in your great goodness.  
Nevertheless, they were disobedient and rebelled against you, cast your law behind their backs and killed your prophets who testified against them to turn them to yourself and they worked great provocations.  
 Therefore, you delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who oppressed them.  
And in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven.  
And according to your bonnet mercies, you gave them deliverance, who saved them from the hand of their enemies.  
But after they had rest, they again did evil before you.  
 Therefore you left them in the hand of their enemies so that they had dominion over them.  
Yet when they returned and cried out to you, you heard from heaven.  
And many times you delivered them according to your mercies and testified against them that you might bring them back to your law.  
Yet they acted proudly and did not heed your commandments, but sent against your judgments, which, if a man does, he shall live by them.  
 and they shrugged their shoulders, stiffened their necks, and would not hear.  
Yet, for many years, you had patience with them and testified against them by your spirit in your prophets.  
Yet, they would not listen.  
Therefore, you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.  
Nevertheless, in your great mercy, you did not utterly consume them, nor forsake them.  
For you are God, gracious and merciful.  
 now therefore our God, the great, the mighty and awesome God who keeps covenant and mercy.  
Do not let all the troubles seem small before you that has come upon us, our kings and our princes, our priests and our prophets, our fathers, and on all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria unto this day.  
However, you are just in all that has been following us.  
 for you have dealt faithfully, but we have done wickedly.  
Neither our kings know our princes, our priests, nor our fathers have kept your law, nor hid at your commandments, in your testimonies with which you testified against them.  
 but they have not served you in their kingdom, or in the many good things that you gave them, or in the large and rich land which you set before them.  
Now did they turn from their wicked works?  
Here we are, servants today, and the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its bounty.  
Here we are, servants in it, and it yields much increase to the kings you have set over us.  
 Because of our sins also, they have dominion over our bodies and our cattle at their pleasure.  
And we are in great distress.  
And because of all this, we make a sure covenant and write it, our leaders, our Levites, and our priests seal it.  
Now you go into chapter 10 from verse number 28.  
 Now the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the Singers, the Netanyahu, and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the land.  
 To the law of their God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, everyone who had knowledge and understanding, these joined with their brethren, their nobles, and added into a curse and an oath to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses, the servant of God, and observe and do all the commandments of the Lord our Lord and his ordinances and his status.  
 We would not give our daughters as wise the peoples of the land, not take their daughters for our sons.  
Either peoples of the land brought worth or any grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we would not buy it from them on the Sabbath or on a holiday.  
And we'll forgo the 70 years produce and the exacting of every debt.  
Also, we made ordinances for our zeros.  
 to exact from our zeros yearly one-third of a shekel for the service of the house of our God, for the subreed, for the regular grain offering, for the regular burnt offerings of the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the set feasts, for the holy things for the sin offerings to make a tournament for Israel and all the work of the house of our God.  
Well, we thank the Lord for the reading of the scriptures, and I hope that you were listening  
 they were in great distress in those days.  
And they realized that the evil that had come upon them right from the carrying away into Babylon until the decrees that brought them out of Babylon  
 They realized it was because they sinned against God.  
They did the wrong things.  
They broke his covenant, broke his laws.  
And so, he had a way of repenting before God.  
They understood that their calamities were a result of their disobedience.  
And what's so beautiful here is that they made the fastet that came together.  
They knew that God was merciful.  
 and gracious to them.  
And in fact, they emphasized that in their prayers to God, they knew that if they would genuinely repent and set things right, God will have mercy on them, and they'll prosper again.  
And everything will be all right.  
So they made three important decisions from what we read.  
 First was a decision to prioritize the word of God and keep it.  
They decided to obey the commandments of God that he gave to them through Moses, the servant of God.  
Secondly, they made a decision to separate themselves from the world.  
They separated themselves from the others, from the Gentiles.  
 And also, within that context, decided not to marry into them, nor allow them marry into them.  
And thirdly, they made a decision to prioritize God's house in their finances.  
They set a certain amount aside for the service of the house of God, and also made up their minds made a decision  
 in this prioritizing of the finances to give their first fruits under God, their tides under God, their special offerings under God, in accordance with instructions of Moses, the man of God.  


  
This was what they did.  
That God hasn't changed.  
 He's the same God that we serve today.  
He's merciful of loving kindness.  


  
And so when God's children stray and find themselves in a strange land,  
 in the land of luck, in the land of pain, the land of sickness, disease, infirmities, unfruitfulness.  
And they realize that's not where they're supposed to be.  


  
Then they search their hearts.  
 and get rid of anything that is not of God in their lives.  
And turn to the Lord in humility, this same God, in his loving kindness.  
But only does he forgive.  
He blesses them again.  
 blesses them again.  


  
In 2020, I told you that the strain of the church allowed so many terrible things to happen, where the church became  


  
 So mixed up with the words, you could hardly tell whether we were having church or whether we were part of the words celebrations.  
There was hardly any difference.  
We measured our successes  
 with the same parameters that the world used.  
We thought like them, we acted like them.  


  
And so, while the message of fate was being preached,  
 where as fateless and unfaithful as could be.  
And then when COVID came and churches were forbidding from meeting, it was easy for many to embrace it, accept it, and prepare themselves to live that way.  
 that church, as we knew it, was gone.  
And around the world, many pastors were paid to make it so.  
Churches were promised sums of money so they could keep their people humble and accept  
 a new way of life.  


  
This was easy because the hearts have been turned away from the things of God.  
Haven't been blessed of God and haven't had  
 Our restorations, we must not allow ourselves, go back to where we were before March 2020.  
We must never go back there.  


  
We must never go back there.  


  
 Because I told you the adversaries haven't changed their minds.  
And I told you what the Lord said in 2020.  
He said, you're dealing with the prince of Assyria.  
And really you go and check the Bible and see how the Assyrians dealt  
 With Israel, you don't understand.  


  
These are spirits that don't give up.  
They're continually looking for an opportunity.  
They're always looking for a way to dominate you, to destroy you.  
They're not your friends.  


  
 These are under Christ's spirits.  
In fact, an Old Testament identification of the anachrist is the name the Assyrian.  
That term is used prophetically for the anachrist.  
You'll see that in Old Testament, in several occasions.  


  
 So that spirit doesn't come to make friends with you.  
It comes to set up an anacry system.  
And we must not fall to where we were.  


  
We must not allow it happen again.  


  
We have to be  
 the praying church.  
We have to be a church that is in true service to God, not serving ourselves.  
Many were preaching for the purpose of their selfish ambitions, not for God.  
 Many will carry out ministries in different ways.  


  
Hardly for God, mostly for themselves.  


  
And that's why it was easy to give up the church.  
 They were told, don't worry, you have a new way of making money.  
So they didn't care.  
They're gonna have a new way of making money.  
They're gonna have a new way for fame.  
They didn't care.  
So the church didn't mean anything to them.  


  
Because they were not true soul winners.  
So it didn't matter.  
But if you were a true soul winner,  
 If you had the heart of the Master, there's no way you'd have ever accepted that.  
You'd have never accepted it.  
I couldn't.  
There was no way I was gonna accept it.  
It was never gonna be okay for me.  


  
So at this time, I want us to pray  
 for the next one hour, because I still have some things to tell you along these lines, but haven't read those scriptures.  
I wanted you to see what things were like in their Mayas day, and how they prayed, how they thought about God, and how God in His mercy.  
 Consider them.  
Bless them again and again and again.  
And they made these decisions, simple decisions.  
And I believe that these were the kind of decisions that we made and came out of COVID.  
And I'm saying that we've committed ourselves to God's word.  
 to keep it.  
We've also separated ourselves from the world.  
And we've also prioritized our lives, including our finances, in the things of God.  
And having done this, let's not go back.  
Let's not go back.  
And we would see  
 the glory of God in our own lives.  
First, we'll see it in our lives as individuals, we'll see it as groups, we'll see it in the body of Christ the world over.  
And the result of that would be how it affects the world.  
 And you see it, I'm gonna read scriptures to you, but now I want us to pray everywhere.  
So if you're just joining us, you probably didn't hear the things I said before now, but now we're praying, we're gonna pray for one hour.  
So let's begin right away.  
With these things in mind that I shared with you, go ahead and pray.  
 And if you know how to pray in the spirit, pray in the spirit.  
And along with your prayers, there'll be lots of thanksgiving to God.  
You'll find reasons to be grateful to God, even thanking Him for His loving kindness.  
Like what we read, how come the Lord is so gracious?  
So forgiving.  
Go ahead and pray.  


  
 you
