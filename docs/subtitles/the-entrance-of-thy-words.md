title: The Entrance of Thy Words
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 During the second service this morning, I made some announcements and gave the opportunity for questions, but I asked that the questions be written.  
 And one of the questions wasn't really in line with the announcements, but I thought to refer to it  
 I believe a question was from a young man.  
He said, why is it that many people suffer for a long time before they are breakthrough?  
How many of you ever thought about that?  
Have you ever thought about it?  
Why is it that many people suffer for a long time?  
 before their breakthrough, and that is if they do have a breakthrough.  


  
Why did this offer a long time?  
But I actually thought that what I shared with them during the service was a good answer to that question.  


  
 Why do many people suffer for a long time?  
Because most people are headstrong in the wrong direction.  
That's why I said something about that during the service.  


  
 For example, Jesus said, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.  
And then we don't follow.  
And if we don't follow, how will he make us?  
During the  
 IPPC 2008, there were certain things that we shared and maybe I'll bring some of that to you now as we try to answer that question and make some references.  
Okay.  
What did we say about following Jesus?  
Jesus said, follow me and I will make you  
 We said, follow, follow Jesus in what, what, and what?  
Number one, follow Jesus in the Word.  
And number two, through the Word.  
And number three, by the Word.  
All right, so number one, follow Jesus.  
Come on.  
 in the Word, through the Word, by the Word.  
Now, let's look at it.  
And the theme scripture was what?  
What Jesus said, follow me and I'll make you.  
What was that?  
Matthew chapter 4 verse, turn to it.  


  
Have you found it?  
 All right, read it for me.  
Again.  
Who said it?  
What did he say?  
He said, follow me, and I will make you  


  
 Thegers of men.  
He didn't say, follow me and try to be.  
Follow me and pray to be.  
He said, follow me and I will make you.  
Our responsibility is to follow.  
But how to follow a lot of times is the problem.  
How do we follow Jesus?  
 Now, if you had been living in Jesus' day in Jerusalem or all Israel, you might have thought that when he said, follow me, it meant, OK, come along with me from street to street, all right?  
And that would have been easy.  
But did you know there was a man that followed him from street to street and didn't quite make it?  
 What was his name?  
Judas.  
Judas followed him from straight to street and didn't make it.  
He lost out with God.  
Betrayed Jesus.  
So it wasn't enough to follow him from street to street.  
So searching through God's word we find  
 What is talking about the first one is to follow him in the Word.  
Find Jesus in the Word.  
Who is Jesus?  
Who is he?  
Why do we say follow him in the Word?  
Because that's where we locate him.  
He said, search the scriptures for they are they which teach of me.  
So,  
 Jesus, the Bible, tells us, is the living word.  
He is the living word.  
He is the word of God made flesh.  
Remember that.  
St.  
John's Gospel chapter 1 and verse 14.  
Read that for me.  
St.  
John chapter 1.  
Read verse 14.  
What's there?  
 But the word became flesh.  
Some versions read the word was made flesh.  
The word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
The word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
And we beheld His glory, glory as of the only begotten of a father, full of grace and truth.  
 So Jesus is the living Word.  
He is the Word of God made flesh.  
So follow Him in the Word, the written Word.  
So the written Word is all about Jesus.  
Look at Jesus in the Word.  
 Travel with him through the Word.  
As you study the Word of God, you find Jesus.  
You can travel with him.  


  
You can tell how Jesus thought.  
You can tell what his mind was like.  
You can tell what he believed.  
 And you can tell how he acted and how he would act today.  
Because it's all there in the world.  
When he encountered someone that was impatient, how did Jesus respond?  
When he encountered someone who hated him, how did he respond?  
 When he encountered someone who was friendly, how did he respond?  
What did he say to the selfish ones?  
What did he say to those who loved God?  
How did Jesus respond?  
When he was hungry, what did he do?  


  
 That's nice to learn, too.  
Some of you get hungry, you don't want to eat anything.  
But Jesus ate when he was hungry.  
Right?  
Oh, yeah, sure.  
And when he was tired, what did he do?  
He went to sleep.  


  
Even when you're tired, you don't want to go to sleep.  
 But when he was that, he went to sleep.  
He did all these things to let us know how to live.  
Praise God.  
So you follow him in the Word.  
You follow him through the Word and you follow him by the Word.  
You want to get the details of that teaching well when the tape is made available.  
But following him by the Word means to act on his Word.  
Do what he says.  
 Okay, that will take us to the scripture that I shared with them in that service, and we'll talk about that a little, and I hope we can move to another verse I'd like to bring to your understanding.  
In Psalm 119 and verse 130, Psalm 119,  


  
 verse 130, Psalm 119.  
Have you seen it?  
Read it for me.  


  
And in that service I was explaining to them how that in 1981 I was meditating on the scriptures and I came across this portion of the Bible  
 And it stood out to me really big.  
I thought it was the answer to life's challenges.  
That's the way I thought.  
I thought, wow, I have my future made.  
Because it was clear to me right there.  
 He said, the entrance, look at it.  
The entrance of thy words giveth lights.  
I knew I would never walk in confusion.  
I knew I would never walk in the dark anymore because the solution was right there.  
The guidance was right there.  
He said, the entrance of thy words giveth lights.  
And I knew that lights stood for direction.  
So I was going to have direction in life.  
 The lot of people, the problem they have is lack of direction.  
They don't know where to go.  
They don't know what to do.  
They're like in the desert, in life, no direction.  
But this one tells you the entrance of God's words.  
Notice the tenses.  
Go back in there and watch.  
It says, the entrance of thy words give it light.  


  
 Light, direction, guidance.  
Now imagine if you were living a life in which you knew exactly what to do.  
You knew where to go.  
There were no questions about you being out of God's will and trying to find your way.  
 No, imagine that.  
A lot of times I tell people, my life has been upwards and forward only.  
But this is the reason.  
This is the reason.  
I've never suffered in my life.  
If I did, I'll tell you.  
Once I suffered, suffered, and somehow, suffered, something else, everything changed.  
I'll tell you the story, but nothing like that.  
Because early in my life, these were the things that shaped my life.  
 Ellie enough so that I didn't have the luxury of suffering.  
Hallelujah.  
But you see, the Word of God is sure.  
The Word of God is sure.  
It is trustworthy.  
So there's no question of who needs something happens and nothing gonna happen.  
Why?  
Because this Word is trustworthy.  
Hallelujah.  
 Trust worthy.  
He said the entrance.  
Notice the entrance of thy words.  
God's words.  
The entrance of thy words.  
Give it light.  
It give it light.  
It give it understanding.  
That's the second part of it.  
It give it understanding to the simple.  
Who are the simple?  
The Bible says the simple are those who don't, they don't see a far off and so they always get into trouble.  
 They don't see a far off.  
The simple.  
They make the wrong choices.  
They go to the wrong places.  
All the time, if there's a problem, they are there.  
Always the ones in trouble.  
If 10 people were told to do something right and two people missed it, there'll be one of them.  
See, they just have something about their lives.  
 You see, you're in trouble again.  
It's always in trouble.  
Something just goes wrong.  
If everybody got the job, he'll be the one that wouldn't get it.  
 until he starts thinking that there's something, maybe there's some demon or some old woman in the village that's pushing some buttons against him.  
He thinks there's some witchcraft, you know?  
Then he starts going into his life, his father suffered this thing, his great grandfather suffered this thing.  
They said his great-grand-uncle had this problem too, and now it's come to him.  
He has all this interpretation.  


  
 But the Bible says, the entrance of thy words, give it what?  
Direction.  
Direction.  
In your spirit, you've got direction.  
And your direction is never in conflict with the Word of God.  
 You have some people who have what they call a direction, but it's always against the counsel of God's Spirit.  
Why should your life be that way?  


  
Why should your life be that way?  
 Always the thing that is in your heart to do is that thing that we were told not to do.  
We were all told not to do it, but only you now have, you know, it's always on your mind to do it.  
That's a rebellious spirit.  
Why aren't you at peace with the right direction?  
 And then you have wrong questions, welling up all the time in your heart.  
There are people who are always asking the wrong questions.  
Why most we give tithes?  
Even if you explain it to them from today to the end of the next year, after that year has ended, they'll come again with the same question.  
As a matter of fact, I know you told me in the other day, but I still really want to, because at the time you were explaining that years were blocked.  
 by the same thing that's been blocking the ears against the troops.  
So they come back again with the same question.  
Okay, okay, I understand that of tight now.  
Okay, then there's this first fruit, which one is first fruit again?  
So you explain first fruit.  
Then they ask you, is this a conclude?  
Who are because they are conditioned to asking questions?  
 What it pours about them, ever learning.  
And never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  
Ever learning.  
Ever learning.  
So, when... Don't look at anybody.  
Just say, when will your life change?  
Say, from today.  
 The entrance of thy words, give it light.  
It give it, they'll read the other part.  
I like that other part, look at it.  
What does it say?  
It give it understanding.  
That word means perception.  
Perception, understanding, discernment, discernment.  


  
 Discretion, prudence.  
That's what's all.  
I'm giving you the synonyms of the word that was translated understanding in that verse.  
So the in terms of thy words, give it light.  
It's give it, it's give it.  
Notice it is not the words of God that give light.  
He didn't say the words of God give light.  
 Did you notice?  
What did he say gives the light?  
The entrance.  
That's the focus of that verse.  
Because the Word of God doesn't give light.  
The Word of God is light.  
It doesn't give light.  
It is light.  
So he says, the entrance of thy words, give it light.  
It's give it understanding to the simple.  
 The entrance is as let God's word either into you.  
It will give light.  
It will give discernment.  
It will give discretion.  
It will give prudence.  
Perception.  
That is madness.  
 You'll have an excellent spirit.  
The way you think.  
The way you reason.  
You know, people have problems mostly from the way they think.  
They just think wrong.  
And you can have excellent thoughts.  
Your life is at a higher level.  
You don't think the law thought so.  
Negativism.  
 Your thoughts are high, the thoughts of love, the thoughts of glory, the thoughts of excellence, progress.  
That's all you think.  
That's the way not to be.  
That's the way not to be.  


  
 God's Word gives you light.  
God's sayings.  
That's what gives you in Plural, the sayings of God.  
He says, thy words, the entrance of thy words, the sayings of God.  
When we listen to the sayings of God, God's Word is in his sayings.  
Do you understand?  
God's Word is in his words.  
 the sayings of God, the speeches of God.  
When you listen to those things that he says, you get his word, his revelation.  
It comes to your spirit and you bear it in your spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
Why are some people sickness minded, failure minded, defeat minded,  
 thinking about a breakthrough, waiting for a breakthrough like that gentleman asked the question, why do some people suffer for a long time before their breakthrough?  
And the first thing I thought about was, what breakthrough?  
You know, a lot of people want to break through.  
I'm not critical of them, but this is mostly from the preachers too.  
Breakthrough 2007, breakthrough 2008, you know, breakthrough convention, breakthrough and so on and so forth.  
 And I'm always wondering, what are they breaking through?  
You broke through last year, you want another breakthrough this year, and then next year you're gonna be having another breakthrough, breaking through to where, for what?  
Through what, really?  
Oh God, I need a breakthrough, through what?  
I've never needed a breakthrough, and that's why I don't organize breakthrough seminars and breakthrough days and breakthroughs.  
 Now, I don't mean to say that those who organize those things, they got a problem.  
No, I'm just saying, we live in different streets, that's all.  


  
That's right.  
That's right.  


  
I believe you.  
 If nothing could keep him in the grave.  
And he broke through that grave.  
Nothing ever will keep me anywhere.  
He broke through when he was raised from the dead.  
And I was raised together with him.  
And where am I?  
According to the Bible, we'll see that together with him in the heavenly realms.  
What am I going to be breaking through?  
He broke through for me.  
Can you shout him in?  
 Hallelujah.  
So what the Word of God will give you lights.  
It'll bring illumination.  
Suddenly you know, oh my goodness, look where I am.  
Like the angel, you know, we talked about Peter the other day when he was in prison and he was chained between two soldiers and the angel the Lord came into that prison house and then just  
 They didn't even touch the chains.  
Set to Peter.  
Get up.  
The heat demons said, get up.  
Let's go.  
The Bible says the chains fell off.  
They fell.  
No opening of the chains.  
They just fell up the word.  
The angel didn't even talk to the chains.  
 He didn't say, James, I break you.  
He didn't say anything.  
They didn't talk to the chains.  
They didn't talk to the chains.  
They just touched the guy and said, let's go.  
And the chains fell off.  
What does that tell you?  
It's a manifestation of the kingdom to which we belong.  


  
 Somebody said, I slept and I dreamed that something has been chilling me.  
There was a chain of my name.  
And I was crying, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.  
What a dream.  
If I can't have such a dream, but if I had such a dream, how do I have to do devil?  
I'm telling you, wake up and say, how dare you devil in the name of Jesus.  
 I don't know what happened to me.  
I had a dream.  
There was a chin on my neck and something was pulling me, pulling me.  
You are a child of God!  
But you see, how you're going to know, how you're going to know, how you're going to know the entrance of thy words, give it light.  
It gives it understanding to the simple.  
 it give it understanding to the simple.  
The simple are taken captive at the devil's wheel.  
You see, but the Word of God will bring you knowledge.  
It'll bring you information.  
So it says, the entrance of thy words, give it light.  
It give it understanding, perception.  
You can perceive that this thing that they just told you is alive.  
You can perceive.  
 You can perceive that that thing that said is there is not there.  
And you can be discreet.  
You can be accurate.  
You can be prudent to the word that has been ministered into your spirit.  
You see, let me show you some.  
Would you turn to the book of Isaiah chapter 55?  
Isaiah chapter 55.  


  
 All right, let's read from verse.  
Can you read from verse 10?  
I know what you're saying.  
Again,  


  
 How do you like that?  


  
 That's not the end of what I want to read to you there.  
I'll show it to you.  
This is for us to rain, come it down, and the stove from heaven, and return it not neither.  
But what were at the earth and make it it bring forth?  
 in part that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater.  
So shall my word be that go it forth out of my mouth.  
It shall not return on to me void.  
But it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sentence.  
My goodness,  


  
 Which means if my heart is the ground to receive the Word of God, God is telling me that if that word gets into my spirit, gets into my heart, it will not return to him void, but it would produce in me what he talks about without fail.  
 So what my responsibility then is to get the word into me.  
Get the word into me.  
It'll produce result.  
Get the word into me.  
I refuse to be afraid.  
I'll get the word into me.  
I'll get the word into me.  
They can be a change.  
I'll get the word into me.  
Hallelujah.  
 It doesn't matter.  
Even if I found myself going through a crisis, I'm going to get the word into me.  
It'll bring me out.  
Hallelujah.  
Now, let's see.  
Did you notice the first word in verse 12 that shows us it is connected to verse 11 from where we're coming?  
Did you notice?  
What's the first word of verse 12?  
 Good.  
Good.  
That means it is conditioned on this.  
Look at it.  
For ye shall go out with joy.  
No, look at my life.  
This is my life.  
That's what he's showing me, my life.  
He's telling me about my life.  
 about my future.  
He says, for you shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace.  
The mountains and the hears shall break forth before you enter singing.  
And all the trees of the field shall cup their hands.  
Glory to God.  
Mountains and hears refer to authorities.  
 They refer to authorities, the trees of the field refer to people, people.  
He said, they shall clap their hands as you pass by.  
Glory to God.  
Wow.  
Instead of the thorn, shall come up the fir tree.  
And instead of the brian, shall come up the metal tree.  
Was it talking about?  
The brian is also a thorny tree, thorny plant.  
 Instead of the thorn and the briar, which are thorny, the problems.  
Instead of those kind of trees, the plants shall come up for you, the fir tree would beauty.  
And the martyred tree, an evergreen tree,  
 and it shall be to the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be caught off."  
What a life.  
He's saying, instead of towns growing up in your life, you'd flourish.  
That's what he's saying.  
You'd flourish.  
You'd never run dry.  
 Now, why does God tell us these things?  
Not just to make us feel like, ain't that nice?  
No!  
God gives us His Word to make us His Word.  
I don't know if you've got that.  
Can I say it again?  
God gives us His Word to make us His Word.  
 Because you see, we will burn his words.  


  
Do I lose you somewhere?  
Is there a disconnection you're wondering, oh, I don't know what he meant.  
Hello, you're still here.  
Wave your hand so I can see you.  
All right.  
 I see it.  
God gives us His Word for the preppers of making us His Word because we were born His words.  
When you were born again, you were born by the Word of God.  
 which means your destiny in the realm of the Spirit is to be the Word of God because you were born by the Word of God.  
It means your nature is the nature of the Word.  
Your character is the character of the Word.  
So He gives us His Word so we can meditate on it so that we can act His Word, live His Word, be His Word because we were born of His Word.  
 Jesus is the Word made flesh.  
You have the same life with you.  
So what are you?  
That's what you are.  
But you see, because you're growing, you're learning, so it doesn't look so.  
It doesn't look so.  
A lot of times you're thinking in conflict with the Word, you're acting in conflict with the Word, but that's the reason he gave the Word to guide us.  
 So we can function as he designed us to be.  


  
Hello.  
Say this with me.  
I found the material.  
To have an exceptionally great life.  
Yes.  
That's it.  


  
 You know, anybody can be waiting for a miracle, like just expecting a miracle.  
One day, one day, God will just, He will just catapult me from here to there.  
No, He wants to catapult you through the Word.  
Then it will stay.  
You get it?  
You say, I can see my life.  
 I can see my life making progress.  
I can see me moving forward.  
Nothing is powerful enough.  
Nothing is potent enough.  
To stop me.  
I'm coming baby.  


  
 You know, you're coming with power.  
Satan can sense it.  
The demons of hell can sense it.  
You're coming with power.  
You know, it's a lot of power.  
And the word is growing in you, growing in you, growing in you.  
Like it happened in Ephesus, so mightily greet the Word of God and revere.  
Hallelujah.  
 That's why I always think about it.  
Greater is he that is in me.  
Greater is he that is in me.  
Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.  
Greater is he that is in me than the confusion in the world, than the fear in the world, than the sickness in the world.  
Glory to God.  
Greater is he that is in me.  
Hallelujah.  
 You know, they're talking about economic problems all around the world, but if you've been studying your Bible, you don't have a care.  
You've been studying your Bible.  
The problems in the world are for our sake.  


  
So when you hear this terrible thing's happening, look at what Jesus said.  
He said, when you shall hear of these things, cheer up!  
 He's in your patience, possessing your souls.  
Hallelujah.  
You cheer up.  
He told us already he's a chair.  
I have overcome the world.  
Did you know that each one of us, oh, how can I put this for you?  
You got to get it.  
You got to get it.  
 Each one of us is more important than the planets.  
I'm sure you never thought about it.  
This whole world with all that zenith is not as important as a single one of you.  


  
 I'm not trying to tell you, I'm telling you what's real.  
This is real.  
This is the Word of God.  
This is real.  
The angels that have the most honorable jobs are the angels that are appointed over people.  
They are more honorable than the angels that are appointed over the galaxy.  


  
 There are angels that supervise planets.  
They are not as high as the ones that are appointed over individuals.  


  
You may not know.  
To be a cell leader, for example, with only three people, all right?  
As small as that number seems to be,  
 is more important to God than if you were given the whole of Africa to take care of the environment.  
I'm in charge of all the infrastructure.  
A cell leader has more value in God's book of honors,  
 than one that is called to be politically in charge of a nation.  
You didn't know that.  
Let me give you the words of Jesus.  
He said, what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?  
 Then he said, what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  
Meaning the whole world is not enough for the value of one soul.  
The whole world is not enough.  
Not enough.  
All of the cosmos is not enough.  
 For one soul, why you can tell by the price that was paid for salvation?  
The price that was paid for the salvation of souls.  
It took Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, who is co-equal with God to come and die for each one of us.  
 that we might be saved.  
That gives you your real value.  
It tells you what God thinks you are worth.  
You know your value by what is paid for you.  
The value of what you're wearing is what you paid for it.  


  
What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  


  
 God is not willing that any man should perish.  
If anybody goes to hell, it's not because God wanted him to go to hell.  
He's done everything to stop you from going to hell.  
And he will do everything to stop you from going to hell.  
The only thing is he can't make your decisions for you.  
Because he gave you one gift  
 the ability to make decisions for yourself.  
You are the one to make the decisions.  
He can make them for you.  
But he would teach.  
He would want.  
He would bless.  
He would do everything that's necessary.  
But you've got to make the choices.  
 You still there?  
It's like what we just read.  
It's open.  
He says, the entrance of thy words, give it light.  
It gives it understanding to the simple thing.  
It's up to me to stick with the word and get light and direction for my life.  
Or to say to myself, does it matter?  
Go to that Psalm 119.  
And let me show you a verse there.  


  
 Have you found it?  
All right, verse nine.  


  
For the young guys and the young girls, it's there.  
Read.  


  
Read again.  


  
 One more time.  
Is it how can a young man cleanse his way?  
How can a young man purify his way?  
How can he purify his thoughts?  
How can he cleanse his way of life?  
 How can he take away the wrong things from his spots?  
He gives the answer by taking heed.  
They are told, according to that word, given heed to the Word of God, who claims your way, purify your parts, your mental parts, men in your mind,  
 Your way of thinking, your financial path, your career path, everything.  
You can purify your way.  
You can make your life beautiful.  
It's a choice.  
See it there.  
This is how can a young man purify his way.  
 How can a young man cleanse his heart?  
How can a young man cleanse his mind?  
Then get rid of dirty thoughts, stupid thoughts.  
How can a young man cleanse his way?  
He says, God's word, give heed to it.  
Praise the Lord.  
 Give me that verse again, 130, Psalm 119.  
Again.  
Again.  
The entrance of thy words.  
The entrance, the entrance.  
The entrance of God's words.  


  
 It gives what?  
Light.  
It gives light.  
I'll never walk in the dark because the Word of God has entered into me and have received light.  
Remember, the same thing Jesus said, he that follows me.  
He says, I am the light of the world.  
He that follows me will not walk in darkness, but he shall have the light of life.  
 He will not walk in the dark.  
What does that mean there?  
The different kinds of darkness in life, darkness in your profession, darkness in your business, darkness in your health.  
That means a place of confusion, a place of ignorance, a place where you find that you don't know what to do.  
 That's the reason people go to the doctor to say, please, can you look into my body and find out what's happening to me?  
Because they're in the dark concerning their health.  
They don't know what's happening inside the body.  
They need somebody to look into their body and tell them what's happening because they're in the darkness concerning their health.  
 But if you're walking in a lot of God's word, Jesus said, He that follows me shall not walk in the darkness concerning His health, for He shall have what?  
The light of life.  
Some people get to a situation in their career, they're not sure what to do.  
They say, I'm in a straight betweeks to.  
I don't know what I should do.  
 I've got this opening in an oil company, and I've got this other opening in a bank.  
I'm not so sure what I should choose.  
I like this, but it pays less.  
I don't really like this, but it pays more.  
What shall I do?  
Oh, I've got a job in another city.  
I don't know whether or not I should go.  
The darkness in their career.  
 They're not sure.  
A place of uncertainty is a place of darkness.  
Things have become unclear.  
A human says, I don't know whether I want to become a lawyer or become a doctor.  
I don't know whether I should read politics or history.  
 And sometimes, you know, they're asking people what they're going to do.  
What do you think I should do?  
Oh, sometimes they come to a place of darkness, about who to get married to.  
Should I marry so-and-so?  
Or should I marry so-and-so?  
Two of them are my friends.  
A place of confusion.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
I said, Hallelujah.  
Jesus said, follow me.  
Follow me.  
What a command.  
How make your success.  
That's what he said.  
He said, I'll make your fisherman.  
How make your success?  
He says, follow me.  
I'll make you.  
He knows exactly what to do.  
He said, I am the light of the world.  
Jesus didn't say, I have lights.  
Follow me.  
I'm holding the light.  
 He said, I am the light.  
Glory to God.  
I am the light of the world.  
Follow me.  
He said, anyone who follows me shall not walk in darkness.  
There'll be no darkness in your life.  
Why?  
You shall have the light of life.  
The light of life.  
The light of life.  
 I never walk in confusion, but this was what got me in that direction, from God's Word.  
I realized if the Word of God will come into my spirit, the light of God will shine in my spirit.  
I can always look into my spirit and have direction and not walk against the Word of God.  
Some people always find themselves  
 across purposes with the Word of God.  
They're always in the wrong thing, always in the wrong place, always colliding with the wrong forces.  
Or rather, put it this way, better put this way, always wrongly colliding with the right forces.  
 If there's a rule or an instruction to follow, they'll always be among those who fail to keep the instruction.  
Always getting into trouble.  
You know, some folks always get into trouble.  
Always getting into trouble.  
Always in trouble.  
If there are five people that will not make it, they're going to be one of them.  
Why is it?  
 Then they come up with these ideas that somebody doesn't like them.  
The whole world is against them.  
But they just never do something right.  
And so they want to blame the society or they want to blame someone else for their wrongs.  
They just never comply.  
 It never goes into their minds to comply.  
When they do comply, it's out of fear, not out of confidence, knowing that that right instruction was for their benefit.  
If you notice such things in your life, the solution is meditating on the Word of God.  
Set a program for yourself.  
 in God's Word, a disciplined program for yourself.  
You declare, I'm going to meditate on God's Word, I'm gonna give it opportunity to transform my life.  
In the next three months, I'm gonna see myself completely transformed and stick to the program.  
Stick to it.  
Stick to it.  
You know, there are people who never, they never do something about their lives.  
They just let themselves go.  
You know, the way they went to school was,  
 Daddy carried them one day to a primary school and introduced them to a teacher and got them registered and they found themselves in that school.  
When they finished the primary school, Dad or Mom helped to fill the farm and got them enrolled for an entrance examination to the secondary school.  
Dad or Mom chose the schools and they found themselves in that school again.  


  
 Then they chose the cause for them.  
They never made an effort.  
They just came to class, listened with sleepy eyes to the lecturer, struggling all the time to keep awake, and wondered why they had a sea.  
 They don't even care.  
They haven't seen.  
They don't even care.  
It doesn't matter.  
They say, after all, I didn't fail.  
Always in their life, they are struggling not to fail.  
Struggling not to fail.  
You just see, it's a sea.  
Oh, thank God.  
Thank God.  
Always getting by by the skin of their teeth.  


  
 Never in pursuit of greatness but the long after it, the long after honor, the long after greatness, the long after success, the long for it, but they never do something to make it happen.  
Never.  
They always have to be picked up by some strange circumstances.  
 After all, brother so and so, he was just sleeping, and the voice just said to him, get up from here, walk to such and such company.  
I got a job for you, and he got there, and got it.  
Why can't it just happen to me?  
Uh-oh, let it just happen to you, sleep, and just happen to... Get up, mumble belongs to you, go and take it.  
You know, that's what they want in life.  
That's what they want.  
 They don't quite say so, but their actions show they expect something to just turn up.  
Why can't God just do it for me like he does it for other people?  
Why can't God just do it?  
Why can't God go and ask him?  
 The pastor, please, I have a question.  
Why can God just mean, what have I done?  
See, am I so bad?  
Yes, you are so bad!  
 Okay, I know I'm so bad.  
That's why God doesn't want to, yes.  
You know, one lady one time I heard the story.  
I don't know how true it is, but it sounded nice.  
There are lots of lessons to learn from it.  
But this girl, this lady was so, you know, she was so angry, so upset.  
She said, I'm going to die.  
I'm going to die.  
I'm going to kill myself.  
And then there was a town well, they said.  
 And so, they run after her.  
She said, no, I'm going to drown.  
I'm going to go into that well, and I'm going to drown.  
And they run after her, and run after her.  
And she was a no, I'm going.  
And then when she got to the well, she said, yes, I'm going to get inside.  
And a man, an elderly man said, stop, everybody stop.  
Stop.  
Go ahead.  
And she looked into the deep.  
And found.  
 They said, enter.  
She didn't.  
Sometimes we got to give some people the chance to just keep bowing.  
I have nobody likes me.  
He said, yes, nobody does.  
You know, nobody likes me.  
I know, I know.  
People like me always come last.  
Yes, people like you always come last.  
You see, they will stop.  
 Self-love is one of the preservatives that God put inside a human being.  
Self-love.  
That's why people haven't killed themselves for all the problems they're facing.  
You see, what about those ones that kill themselves?  
It's the same self-love.  
Their own suffering has gotten too much.  
They don't want to suffer more.  
Self-love.  
And then there are those who want to kill others  
 because they feel the killer doesn't take their own lives, too.  
Why are we bold enough to die for Christ?  
Not because we love Him so much and believe Him so much, but because He's real.  
He's real.  
He's more than a story.  
He's real.  
 Anybody can give himself to be burned for any course.  
Anybody can do that.  
And many have done that.  
But when you become a Christian, not just a religious man, when you become a Christian, understand the scriptures and believe in Jesus and know who Jesus is, your love for him is more than the love for religion.  
 is a love for a person who himself gave his life for you.  
That's what the Bible says.  
We love him because he first loved us.  
Didn't say we love him because he sounds nice.  
We love him because he's kind.  
No, because he first loved us and he so loved us that he give his life for us.  
And when we found out  
 that he was himself God would realize that dying for him was even too cheap.  
Hallelujah.  
Are you still there?  
Okay.  
What was the verse we read?  
One more time.  
 Psalm 119 and verse 130 quoted for me.  


  
The entrance of God's word, right?  
Says the entrance of thy words give it light.  
It give it understanding.  
 the entrance.  
And I pointed out to you that he didn't say God's word give it light.  
You know why?  
Because God's word doesn't give light.  
Are you surprised?  
God's word is light.  
Okay?  
 So he says, the entrance, the focus of that verse is not the word, not the words of God, but the entrance.  
That is the focus of that verse.  
I want you to study, go back to it.  
Let me show it to you.  
Notice something.  
Read slowly with me.  
 entrance, the entrance, what is there?  
A definite article, T-H-E, for entrance.  
The definite article is there, the entrance.  
Not just entrance, but the entrance of God's words.  
Now, words is in plural, did you notice?  
 Okay.  
The entrance of God's words gives light.  
Then what's the first word after the semicolon?  
Or conon?  
What's there?  
Eat.  
If he was referring to the words of God, he would say they.  
 Like when you have in Proverbs chapter 4, from verse 20 down to verse 22, where it says, they are life, talking about the words.  
They are life to those that find them.  
Words, the words of God.  
He says, they, he uses day for the words of God, the sayings of God.  
All right?  
Now he says, the entrance of God's words, God's sayings, the entrance of his words,  
 gives light, then it says, it gives us understanding.  
So that it is not for the words, but for the entrance.  
So the focus of that verse is the entrance.  
That's why I told you how important that verse is.  
It focuses on the entrance of God's words into your spirit.  
So if the words, the sayings of God don't enter into you  
 How can you have the light?  
How can he produce, understand?  
You have to welcome his words.  
You have to receive his words.  
You have to open up yourself to receive God's words.  
You know, there are people who always question the word again.  
They always have questions.  
I used to know God many years ago.  
He visited me almost every week.  
And I sat with him, God knows how many hours put together.  
 He had one question after the other.  
He would read a book and he would come with questions.  
He would read the Bible, he would come with questions.  
Questions and questions until I said I run away from him.  
There were not bad questions, but there were too many questions.  
Questions, questions.  
How can we explain?  
 How can we explain how Jesus was born of a virgin?  
How can we explain how the Holy Spirit enters into somebody?  
How can we explain?  
Okay, okay, for example, what is faith?  
So what is faith?  
It's in the Bible.  
Faith is the substance.  
No, no, no, no, no, no.  
Apart from this one, apart from how the Bible explains it.  
Okay, how?  
I say, how?  
Now you would think he has agreed for today.  
Okay, okay, I understand.  
Tomorrow he will come again.  
 There's a question and a half.  
This laying on of hands, when you put hands on somebody, what actually enters inside the person?  


  
Questions upon questions.  
You know what the Bible describes?  
It is ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.  
They are ever learning.  
 There's not a wrong in asking questions, but there are things you accept from God because He said they are so.  
Are you hearing me?  
Okay?  
This lot of gravity.  
Is it true?  
That's why they said it's a law.  
If you don't believe it, go upstairs there and come.  
You don't understand.  
 See, there are things you don't question.  
If God has said in his words, like Jesus said, I am the light of the world.  
Don't say how.  
It's a declaration, a sovereign declaration of God.  
There are things we can question and ask for explanation, but there are things that are so.  
For example, Jesus said, a certain man  
 talking about Lazarus, the story of Lazarus that was poor, and he was a beggar, you remember the story, and then this rich man.  
Don't say, was it a true story?  
Jesus said, a certain man, he said, he said it's a true story.  
You study his words, you find when he tells you that this thing happened,  
 And that is it.  
That's real.  
Hallelujah.  
Always be asking questions.  
I love asking questions.  
Okay, I hope you also love receiving answers.  
Because some people ask questions upon questions, but they never listen to the answers.  
 When you're giving the answers, there is a blog that I think of another question.  
Why you're talking?  
It's okay.  
So just finish, finish, finish.  
I have another question I want to ask.  
Sometimes before you have landed in the first answer, you see, can I just, can I just add another question?  
Because there's no other thing coming to my mind now.  
All the time, why are you like this?  
 It's a slow process of making progress.  
And you can't continually allow it in your life.  
Receive answers and let your answers stay.  
Because the answer, you know something about God, when He gives you the answer to one thing, that answer becomes the answer to many.  
He breeds this answer into your spirit.  
 That is his wisdom.  
And you just know, when the wisdom of God operates in your life, you find out that you have answers.  
Those questions that used to bombard your mind just fall, prostrate before you.  
You have answers.  
 What happened is that Babylonian and Solomon had many questions.  
No, the whole world came to ask Solomon questions.  
And he gave them answers.  
It wasn't Solomon that was asking questions.  
He was giving them answers.  
And who is Jesus?  
He is greater than Solomon.  
That's how he described himself.  
He is greater than Solomon.  
Who are you born after?  
Jesus.  
Who spirit do you have?  
Jesus.  
 He gritter than Solomon.  
Why is your life full of questions?  
Say, I have answers.  
Say again, I have answers.  
Because the wisdom of God works in me.  
The wisdom of God works in me.  
I have answers.  
Praise the Lord.  
Amen.
