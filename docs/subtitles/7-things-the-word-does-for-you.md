title: 7 Things the Word Does for You
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching of Gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Glory to God.  
I want to share with you in just a few minutes, seven  


  
 Seven things the word does for you.  
Are you ready?  
Seven things.  
Okay.  
You know, the word is working in your life, producing results, but let's go.  
Number one.  
See, the word created you and gave birth to you.  
Therefore, the word is your life.  
 So number one, the word is my life because the word created me and gave birth to me.  
The word is my life.  
John St.  
John's Gospel chapter 1 verse 3, read it for me, want to go.  
All things are made by him.  
 Without him was not anything made that was made.  
Second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 17.  
You all know that already.  
Go ahead.  
You know it.  
If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature.  
All things are passed away, behold, all things are becoming new.  
A new creature?  
Oh, come on.  
 Okay, so go back to St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 1, and read verse 12.  
What does it say?  
But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.  
Look at it again.  
As many as received Him, not everybody, not everybody, only those who received Him.  
 as many had received him, to them gave he power, the authority to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.  
Glory to God.  
1 Peter 1 and verse 23.  
1 Peter 1 verse 23.  
Being born again, none of corruptible seeds, but of incorruptible  
 by the word of God, which lived and abided forever.  
So you're born again by the word of God.  
So the word gave birth to you.  
All right, James, chapter 1 and verse 18.  
Of his own will, begot he us.  
What's it mean?  
You speak new English.  
This is King James English, okay?  
We don't use begot now, but what does begot mean?  
 It means to give birth to you, all right?  
Thank you, you got it.  
So, of his own will, begot he us, he gave birth to us with the word of truth.  
God's word, that we should be a kind, a species, a special kind of first fruits of his creatures.  
First fruits means the first and the best.  
Top class, that's first fruits.  
 He gave birth to us.  
And we should be a kind, a type of first fruits of his creatures.  
So among all of God's creatures, we are top class.  
Glory to God.  
All right, so we go number two, the word builds you.  
The word of God builds you.  
See, the word of God is not like any other thing.  
 The Word of God is not like some news that you read in newspaper.  
You know, people listen to the news all day long, read all kinds of junk all day long, and they wonder why their lives are not being built up.  
They wonder why they're not moving forward and making progress.  
How could you make progress when what you're reading, what's coming into your heart, coming to your spirit, can't build you up?  
But the Word of God builds you.  
 So you look at it.  
The word builds you.  
Acts chapter 20 and verse 32.  
Can you read it now?  
I want to go and now break it.  
I commend you to God.  
I am to the word of His grace.  
Which is what?  
Able to build you up.  
 It is able to what builds you up.  
Now that verse gives us that second part, that part of the verse, the A part.  
The B part gives us number three.  
Read again, read the full thing.  
And now brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance.  
 among all them who just sanctified, glory to God.  
The word gives you an inheritance.  
What does that mean?  
It doesn't mean that the word is a lot into you, your inheritance.  
What is dealing with here is like a lawyer who helps you get that which already belongs to you.  
Imagine that you have an inheritance and someone is trying to stop you from getting it.  
 or you require the necessary authorization, the necessary evidence, the necessary documents to provide the court to stick your claim.  
So a lawyer comes and says, all right,  
 I'm gonna help you get this.  
The lawyer eventually helps you get your inheritance.  
But the lawyer didn't allot to you the inheritance.  
Do you get it?  
Because Father God already gave us our inheritance in Christ Jesus.  
And the Bible says we are joint heirs with Christ.  
But through the word, you would discover your inheritance and take possession of it.  
That's what the word does for you.  
 So the word in that sense, deliver us to you, your inheritance.  
Oh, glory to God.  
You're still there.  
So we read the A part of it.  
The word is able to build you up.  
Then we got to the B part of it for number three.  
The word deliver us to you, your inheritance.  
The two separate things.  
You get it now?  
 So which means verse for number three is the same.  
Acts 20, 32.  
But you just write a little B there to let you know it's the second part of it.  
Number four, the word cleanses you.  
Oh boy, our world is full of dirt.  
Our world is full of unbelief and fear and all kinds of evil.  
 And every time we're in conversation with people, they rob some negativities on us.  
Every time you watch the television, there's something terrible on the screen, something negative, something with some fear, something with some unbelief, something terrible.  
Our world is full of dirt, uncleanness.  
Wrong thoughts gone to us.  
But we've got to cleanse us errors.  
 How are we going to do it?  
How do we purify our souls every day?  
How do we cleanse ourselves from the things that people deposit on us?  
For example, I remember when I was beginning in my pastoral work, I would cancel with people for a long time.  
 and several people who come, they got things to tell you.  
And then you sit down and then they talk to you and they tell you the problems.  
By the time they're leaving you, you're like, oh dear Lord, there's a lot of trouble in this world.  
They deposited a lot of negativities, okay?  
But I had to do something because I didn't want to carry their problems.  
Jesus already carried their problems.  
 could share with them, but listening to people makes that I'm listening to a whole lot of terrible things.  
And some of them tell me terrible evil things that they are done.  
And I'm like, oh, Lord.  
And now I have all these dirt in my mind.  
How do I cleanse myself?  
 A lot of times, as soon as they've gone out of my office, I slip straight to my knees, blessed Lord Jesus, I've got to cleanse myself.  
Then I start quoting scriptures, quoting scriptures, quoting scriptures, things from the Word of God that were given me authority and light against those things that they are shared with me.  
To give me the strengths, the courage, the fearlessness, the confidence in life.  
 So I cleansed myself from all the fear.  
I cleansed myself from all the uncleanness, from all the sin, from all the evil.  
And in that way, I maintain my composure.  
Are you still there?  
So the Word of God is your cleanser.  
St.  
John's Gospel chapter 15 and verse number three, you'd see it there.  
 Now ye are clean through the Word which I have spoken unto you."  
Isn't that wonderful?  
Listening to the Word of the Master cleanses your soul.  
It's like you're listening now.  
If you listen long enough, you'd find that in your heart there's a purification that's taking place.  
Suddenly you just  
 It's a spiritual feeling.  
It's not a feeling of the flesh.  
It's like a feeling like you're closer to God.  
Like God loves you.  
You don't want to go back to some terrible things you used to do.  
You just don't want to go back there.  
You want to live in Christ.  
You feel like, oh God loves me.  
Oh, I'm clean.  
Oh Lord, I'm sanctified.  
Yes, because that's what the Word of God does for you.  
It truly purifies your soul.  
 Jesus said it, now you are clean through the world which I've spoken unto you.  
It's one of those wonderful things that you've got to listen to the Word of God for.  
Every time you're listening to the Word, it purifies your spirits.  
It gets rid of a junk and makes you holy.  
Hallelujah.  
That's why you must always give yourself to the Word of God.  
All right, number five.  
Did you get number four?  
 Number five, the word is food for your spirit.  
And so it nourishes you.  
The word of God is food for your spirit and nourishes you.  
All right, so.  
 In verse number four, it was in that encounter Jesus had with Satan the devil, and Jesus was tempted of the devil.  
But Jesus replied, you know, the master was fasting, and after he's fast about tears, he was hungry.  
And now that he was hungry, Satan came and said, if you're the son of God, command the stones to be made bread.  
 But he, Jesus, answered and said, read it, come on.  
It is written, men shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that preceded out of the mouth of God.  
Why?  
Because man is a spirit.  
Man is a spirit.  
He's not a body.  
Man is a spirit that has a soul and lives in a body.  
 Your body is your domicile.  
Your body is your house.  
Where you live, your body is not you.  
Your spirit being.  
This body that you see is just your house.  
It's not you, your spirit.  
And so you don't live by bread alone, because your body has to be sustained with bread, with food, from dirt, from the ground.  
Because it came from the ground.  
 But your spirit must be sustained by the Word of God because it was born of the Word of God.  
It originated from the Word.  
Hallelujah.  
Okay, let's look at a few things.  
St.  
John's Gospel chapter 6 and verse number 35.  
St.  
John chapter 6 verse 35.  
Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life.  
He that cometh to me,  
 shall what?  
Never hunger.  
And he that believe it on me shall never first.  
Jesus said, I am the bread of life.  
Remember Jesus is the living word.  
He is the word.  
Okay?  
He is the living word.  
The word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
 All right?  
You remember that?  
Jesus is a living word.  
Now he says, I'm the bread of life.  
All right.  
Go to the same book, same chapter, verse 47.  
We're going to read from verse 47 to verse 51.  
Words of Jesus want to go.  


  
 Stop there for a second.  
Did you notice that?  
Did you notice that?  
Hidden sin when you get to heaven.  
You got it now.  
He that believe it on me hacked.  
You got it everlasting life.  
Wow.  
Say, I have everlasting life.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Amen.  
All right.  
Verse 48.  
I am that bread of life. 49.  


  
 Now, he's talking to the Jews.  
He reminds them, he says, you remember your father said, manna in the wilderness and they're dead.  
But manna came from where?  
From heaven.  
God dropped manna from heaven.  
They didn't even know what to call it.  
Manna means what is this?  
That's the meaning of the word manna.  
So it had no name.  
They couldn't name it because income from them  
 And you couldn't keep it.  
You couldn't keep it.  
You had to eat it.  
Because tomorrow another one will come.  
God said, don't story till tomorrow.  
Take as much as you want, but you gotta eat it now.  
Verse 50.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Do you love that?  
Verse 51.  


  
 hmm oh glory to god number six the words the word gives you light and direction oh wow nobody who studies the word of god who knows the word of god ever  
 gets confused.  
Never.  
You're never confused in life.  
Never.  
Never.  
The Word gives you light and direction.  
If you have the Word of God in you, you know where you're going.  
Your life has a meaning.  
Your journey is straight.  
 And it's forward and upwards.  
Hallelujah.  
Psalm 119 and verse 105.  
119 verse 105.  
Read for me.  
The Word of God is a lamp.  


  
 And it's a light, a lamp onto my feet and a light onto my heart.  
All right, read verse 130, same book, same chapter, 130.  
The entrance of thy words, give it light.  
It give it understanding onto the simple.  
Oh boy, that's wonderful.  
 That's really wonderful.  
The entrance of thy words gives light.  
See, if the Word of God doesn't enter into you, you don't have light.  
There's no light.  
You've got darkness.  
But let the Word enter into you.  
The entrance of God's Word gives light.  
David was saying this to God.  
In Psalm 119, David's talking to God, all right?  
He's talking to God.  
He says, the entrance of your words gives light.  
It gives understanding.  
 to the simple glory to God.  
Wonderful.  
The word of God is my light.  
Gives me light and direction.  
I have understanding, I'm not confused.  
Jesus said, he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but he shall have the light of life.  
Amen.  
Do you like this?  
Then number seven, I like it.  
The word prolongs your days.  
 The Word prolongs your days.  
See, you know, the Word of God gives you wisdom for life, lets you know the principles of the kingdom unveils God's mind to you.  
Like we said, it gives you light and direction, shows you what to do, how to live.  
 the word prolongs your days.  
Do you turn on me chapter 32?  
We're going to read from verse 45.  
All right.  
 read, and Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel.  
Verse 46, and he said unto them, set your hearts unto all the words which are testified among you this day, which shall command your children to observe, to do all the words of this law.  
Verse 47, for it is not a vain thing  
 Read it again, read it again.  
For it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life.  
And through this thing you shall prolong your days.  


  
Did you see that?  
He said, the word is not a vain thing.  
It's not empty.  
 It's not an ordinary thing.  
They're not idle words.  
It's it's your life.  
It's your life.  
And through this thing, you shall prolong your days.  
Glory to God.  
Wonderful.  
Worship Him.  
Thank Him.  
Thank Him now.  
Thank Him now.  
 These are marvelous blessings from the Word of God.
