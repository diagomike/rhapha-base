title: The Impact of the Holy Spirit on the Human Body Part 2
---
 Coming to you with words and teaching that will change your life forever.  
All things that you will ever need in your life.  
They're wrapped up in the world.  
Go for the world.  
You need to understand this thing.  
And when you get a hold of it, keep saying this.  
 Don't stop talking it.  
Keep saying it.  
Keep saying it.  
The Bible says in the city of Ephesus, so might he leave the Word of God and prevail.  
Can he shout amen?  
And the cost that I must follow.  
 I started sharing something with you on the impact of the  


  
 Holy Spirit on our physical bodies, the impact of the Holy Spirit on our physical bodies.  
And this is very important.  
It's good for us to know it and know how to apply God's word to our lives in that area.  
 the impact of the Holy Spirit on your body.  
We talked about our bodies being the temple of the Holy Spirit and being the members of Christ.  
If you would look at the book of visions in chapter 2, I want you to read verse 22.  


  
 Vision, chapter 2, verse 22.  


  
Great.  
In whom he also abeemed together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.  
In other words, God lives in us through the Holy Ghost.  
God Almighty lives in us through the Holy Ghost.  
 Somebody said, what's the difference between Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit?  
The same, the difference is King James.  
So, all right, the Holy Spirit lives in us individually.  
He lives in me, as though he doesn't know you.  
He lives in you, as though he doesn't know  
 The other one.  
In other words, He deals with us as though we're the only one in the world.  
Praise God.  
Say this to me, the Holy Ghost leaves in me.  
Now, if you haven't received the Holy Spirit, you better do that now.  
You receive the Holy Spirit by faith.  
Same way you receive Jesus into your heart.  
 But you know, yesterday we were asking a question, why is it that even though some people have received the Holy Spirit, a lot of people, they still get sick?  
Why?  
Apart from what we did with last week, primarily because they're ignorant of the work of the Spirit in their lives.  
And because of that ignorance, they don't know how to give God the opportunity to carry out His ministry in their lives.  
 We have to understand is the Holy Spirit has come to carry out His ministry in us.  
He has a ministry in us.  
Now, there's a ministry of the Holy Spirit through us, but He does have a ministry in us.  
He has a ministry in you.  
You can let Him carry out that ministry, and you can also hinder Him from fulfilling His ministry.  
 Some people say, you're not out again.  
Stop God from doing what he wants to do.  
It's not true.  
Oh, if God wants to do anything, he just does it.  
Not true.  
Didn't you read that in the Old Testament the Bible says they resisted the Holy Ghost?  
They did.  
The children of Israel resisted the Holy Ghost.  
 You can stop the Holy Spirit from doing what He wants to do in your life.  
You may not be able to stop Him from doing what He wants to do in my life.  
I may not be able to stop Him from doing what He wants to do in your life.  
But we can stop Him from doing what He wants to do in our lives.  
Hallelujah.  
Now we read yesterday, your body is the temple.  
 is the temple, the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit.  
Then we also read in 2 Corinthians 6 and verse 16 where he said, we walk in them.  
I would dwell in them and walk in them.  
And we explained the meaning of walk.  
You remember that?  
What did he say?  
What did he say it was?  
Yes.  
Yes.  
But now let's look at something.  
 In Romans 8, are you there?  
I love the word of God.  
Do you love the word?  
We aspire to it.  
I love the word.  
In Romans 8,  


  
 I'll read to you from verse.  
Hmm.  
Sometimes I was going to include everything because I want to read to you from verse 10, but verse nine is so beautiful.  
And then I'll say, Oh, verse eight is wonderful.  
And then verse seven is just wonderful, you know, until I get back to verse one.  
Okay, let me read it from verse 10 for you.  
As I say, and if Christ be  
 in you.  
Oh, thank you, Lord.  
If Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is left because of righteousness.  
Now, this is one of those complex verses of the Bible that lots of translators have had problems with.  
There are at least three words italicized into King James Version.  
 that shows you that as far as the King James translators are concerned, there were three missing words, missing connections in that verse, three missing connections in their original manuscripts.  
Now, I've looked at several other versions and I noticed they all had problems with that verse.  
 And I find no reason for the problem at all.  
Why?  
Because the context is clear.  
But we must understand that most of our translators have come from a background that believed that the days of miracles are over.  
Most of them, incidentally.  
 Most of them have a very, a very religious background that's not really motivated by the Holy Spirit.  
Some of them were good theologians, stauding about God, stauding God without knowing God.  
 You see, of course, many others were wonderful, beautiful.  
But it's important for us to understand why sometimes there are difficult areas.  
And so when they look at it, like in the King James, they look at, oh, we've got three missing connections here.  
And so they bring in some conjunctions and they say, well, this should help.  
And then it doesn't help.  
 Let me read it to you.  
Again, from the King James.  
And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin.  
Come on.  
But the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  
It doesn't make sense.  
It has no spiritual sense.  
It has no spiritual sense because the physical body is not called dead.  
 In the Bible, if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin.  
No.  
The body is not dead.  
You get it?  
So they say, if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin.  
That is not there.  
Why do they think that the missing connection should be in this place where the is was thrown in?  
How do you know where it ought to be?  
You see it?  
 Problem there.  
Alright, who's got the amplified?  
Anybody here got the amplified?  
Let me read to you from the amplified.  
And I want you to notice what it says here.  
He says, but if Christ leaves in you, then He gives us where He thinks.  
 The italics should be.  
Now, italicized words in the King James mean words that were not in the original manuscript.  
Now, in a version like the Amplified, they'll put it in parentheses.  
So you can tell.  
So here, they say, instead of putting is there, they say, then although.  
 So let me read it.  
They brought in two words, then although.  
So I'll read that with what they said here.  
But if Christ lives in you, then although your natural body is dead, aha, although.  
So they're saying, it's not, your body is dead, like King James says.  
 They're saying, it sounds more like even if your body were dead because of sin.  
All right?  
Now they're coming close.  
Now they go, King James says, the spirit is life because of righteousness.  
Now that's another trouble there because you can't tell, they're talking about the Holy Ghost, they're talking about the human spirit, the recreated human spirit, or what are they talking about?  
Because it's the same Greek word, numa,  
 that's used for spirit, whether it's of man or of God or of a devil.  
Now in the King James, they suggest a capital S when they refer to the spirit of God and a small letter S when they refer to the human spirit.  
They suggest that, but in many cases they are wrong.  
The context tells you, all right?  
Okay, now let's look  
 So he says here, I read the Amplified, but if Christ leaves in you, then although your natural body is dead by reason of sin and guilt, the Spirit is alive.  
And they use a small letter S here.  
The Spirit is alive because of the righteousness that He imputes to you.  
Trouble, trouble, trouble, you see.  
 Then you say, well, we studied the Bible.  
We can't be sure what they're saying.  
We can be sure what they're saying.  
Now, I've looked at several of these versions and let me give you what this word says.  
You ready?  
Okay.  
And if Christ be in you, though your body be dead because of sin,  
 The Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.  
You see that?  
Now, that tells us something because the next word shows us that that is right.  
Now, let's look at it again.  
And if Christ be in you, if Christ lives in you, though your body be dead because of sin, in other words, even at the worst-case scenario,  
 If your body be dead because of sin, if your body has been so messed up, so destroyed, sickness has attacked it, disease has attacked it, it is as if because of sin.  
Dead has attacked our physical bodies.  
He says, the Spirit gives it life because righteousness has come.  
 You see that?  
Righteousness has been granted us.  
The Spirit gives it life.  
So it is not the human spirit as suggested by the other fact.  
It's the Holy Ghost as suggested by verse 11.  
That's the next verse.  
Look at it.  
Now, if that's what the word and that word doesn't have to be and, the Greek word is day,  
 Minion, it could be now.  
The word instead of being and could be now.  
You see that?  
Now, if... What do you have?  
These butts.  
Did you notice?  
Butts, verse 11.  
Butts.  
It doesn't have to be butts.  
It's butts.  
It's and.  
It's now.  
The word now is better there.  
 because he connects it and introduces a new thought.  
Are you following me?  
So, but it's not so good there.  
Several versions don't put but anyway.  
But you got but in the King James here.  
So, now, leave the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead.  
You see that?  
He says, though your body were dead because of sin.  
 The Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.  
Now he says, look at it.  
Now, if the Spirit of him that raised the dead body of Jesus, can you see that now?  
The Spirit that raised the dead body of Jesus.  
When was the dead body of Jesus raised?  
When the demands of justice were satisfied.  
 And He was midrighteous in the spirits.  
When He was midrighteous in the spirits, the Holy Ghost raised His dead body back to life.  
That's what you have in that taint verse.  
That's why I said they shouldn't have had any problem translating that verse at all.  
Because the whole fact is in verse 11.  
But once you throw the word birds,  
 In there, you got a little problem.  
You start thinking, where I go from here?  
Hallelujah.  
If the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead lives in you.  
If he does, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also.  
You see that?  
Shall also  
 shall also, can James say, is quick, quick, in Nigerian English, that will make you faster.  
But that's wrong.  
It means to give life.  
He that raised the Christ from the dead shall also vitalise  


  
 your motto, parties.  
Hallelujah.  
By his, oh boy, do I like this?  
He says, by his parent, not coming from heaven, but that dweller in you.  
That means this work is in the now.  
You see that?  
He's not saying when we get to heaven, it's now.  
He's telling you what the Holy Ghost can do in your physical body now.  
 Give the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, lives in you.  
He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken, vitalize, make alive your mortal body by the Holy Ghost that dwells in you.  
The Spirit that lives in you.  
That's where the power is.  
 He says, He shall vitalize your mother body by the spirits of God that lives in you, that lives in you, not coming from somewhere else, that lives in you, the one inside you, Hallelujah.  
Now, that settles the matter of sickness forever.  
It means the healing power has come to reside within you.  


  
 You see that?  
Sickness is incipient death.  
And so, if death therefore has attacked your body through sickness or disease or infirmity, if the Holy Spirit is in you, you have nothing to fear.  
You have nothing to worry about.  
The healer has come home.  
You see that?  
 The one that made Jesus the Hila, who had enough power to raise the dead Jesus back to life, dwells in you.  
He has made his home in your body.  
How can I worry anymore?  
No, look at how can I worry anymore?  
War is over.  
The Hila lives in me.  
I'm his home address.  
 My troubles are over.  
No more fear.  
No more worry.  
The healer has come home.  
Hallelujah.  
He lives in me.  
This is now if the spirit of him that raised of Jesus from the dead dwells in you, that same spirit shall vitalize your melted body.  
 See that?  
It doesn't matter what I caught.  
Like they say, I caught the flu.  
You shouldn't have caught it.  
You should have killed it.  
But doesn't matter what you came up with.  
The power lives in you now.  
Oh, I wish ever Christian in the world will understand this.  
But most have never been taught.  
Most have never been taught.  
In fact, a lot of Christians have been taught that sickness is normal.  
 Or is it normal if you drink something?  
Do you mean to tell me if you drink dirty water it will not affect you?  
You know, I told you yesterday, you know, when natural men talk, they make sense.  
When spiritual men talk, they don't make sense.  
Do you understand?  
 They only make what we call spiritual sense.  
Do you mean to tell me?  
If you continue eating only rice, you wouldn't have berry berry.  


  
You know, our Christians now are starting trying to find out what to eat and what not to eat.  
They're consulting physicians and dieticians and so on and so forth and trying to find out what to eat and what not to eat.  
 It's all ignorance gone on rampage.  
It's a groppin' in the dark.  
They've gone a wandering, wandering away from the Scriptures.  
Do you know who the Christian is?  
Don't you notice that what is this man shall not leave by bellow, but by every word?  
That comes from the mouth of God.  
 In Old Testament, he told him what to eat and what not to eat.  
There's a lot of Christians, they're starting to go back to the Bible to find Bible food.  
I've never seen ignorance like this in the church.  
I mean, it looks like the more knowledge we get, the more ignorance we pack up.  
They say, back to the Bible food, there's Bible food.  
And what's this Bible food?  
All the foods recommended in Old Testament to God's people to eat.  
 So if we eat those ones, we're going to be all right.  
But they died.  
They died.  
Don't you understand?  
They ate that food and died.  
That's what Jesus said to them.  
He said, your father's egg man are in the wilderness?  
Or where are they?  
He said, they're dead.  
So I come to give you food that if a man will eat, he will not die.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Ma, ma, ma.  
This is Bible food.  
Bible food.  
If some people would give just a fraction of the time they give to the so-called Bible foods, they'll give it to learn in the scriptures.  
They'll be all right.  
Do you know the Christian is not an ordinary person?  
When Paul talked about eating,  
 in the New Testament, he didn't say, go back and find out what to eat and what nothing.  
No, no, no.  
He said, now that you are born again, doesn't matter what you eat.  
He said, there's nothing on clean of itself, nothing on clean anymore.  
You want to eat what you want to eat?  
All you need is give thanks.  
He said, if you give thanks, you can eat anything.  
That's all.  


  
 Eat what you want to, just give thanks.  


  
Let me tell you another thing you need to understand.  
Did you know, oh my goodness, I wish I had so... Let me tell you this, and it's important that you know it.  
For the Christian,  
 No food that you will eat will nourish your body.  


  
I'll say it again.  
No food in this world will nourish your body.  


  
 I wanted to think.  
Let it soak.  
Those who are looking for something to eat, this is very nourishment.  
Listen, the reason you eat physical food is not just nourishment.  
Otherwise, we'll get it in liquids alone.  
But if you take it in liquids alone, you'll not be strong.  
So it's not just nourishment.  
Food is not for only nourishment.  
Did you hear me?  
 Now listen to this.  
Let me read this verse out just read to you.  
Can I read to you again?  
If the spirit of him verse 11, if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead were in you, he that raised the Christ from the dead shall also vitalize your mortal bodies.  
 By the Spirit that dwellers in you.  


  
So it's done, but the Holy Ghost.  
Jesus said, Man shall not live by bread alone.  
He didn't say, Man shall not live by bread at all.  
 Is it men shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the Mount of God?  
So the Word of God can be used in converting anything you want to eat to something good.  
Can you see?  
Now that's why Paul said, he said anything you want to eat is sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.  
That's what he said.  
He said it's sanctified by the Word of God and prayer.  
 sanctified by the word and prayer.  
So when you say that word of prayer, you give a word that makes that food become real good.  
Then it gets into your body and produces nourishment in your body not because of what its constituents are but because of the word of faith which you have spoken.  
 Otherwise we are doomed to what they tell us.  
Everybody must be sick somehow.  
Are you still there?  
Yeah.  
Hey, your body.  
Oh, you know, the life of the physical body is in the blood.  
Is that right?  
And everybody knows that the life of the physical body is in the blood.  
Okay.  
Let's see what happened to you.  
 St.  
John's Gospel.  
Even though I've already read it to you here in Romans 811, but let's speak it from St.  
John's Gospel.  
Chapter number one.  
I love the word.  
I love the word.  
I love the word.  
Chapter one.  
 St.  
John's Gospel, I want you to read to me from verse 12, in to verse 13.  
12, want to go.  


  
 It is when you were born again, this new life is not a blood.  
Oh boy, I've got to explain this thing to you.  
I want you to understand this.  
You know a lot of people think that when you're a Christian, you got too natures.  
 Did you ever hear that two nature doctrine?  
They said, they got two natures.  
There's the human nature and then there's the God nature.  
So I got the eternal life and the human life.  
So flesh and spirit.  
The bow doesn't say the flesh got life.  
So we have the God life and the human life.  
 It's not true.  
The Bible doesn't suggest that at all.  
When you were born again, eternal life supplanted the human life with which you were previously born.  
This is vital.  
This is vital.  
You don't have two lives.  
You got one.  
You got one.  
 That's what he doesn't tell us.  
My people are destroyed because they have two lives.  
He said because they're ignorant of the one they have.  
The ordinary human beings, ordinary human beings are human beings that have not been born again.  
They are ordinary human beings.  
The life they have in their body is the blood life.  
 That's why Jesus told you that if you're born again, if you drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt you because the life of your body is not blood.  
You see that?  
Now remember, when Jesus died on the cross, a soldier wanted to find out whether he was dead or not.  
And he went to Jesus on the cross and thrust a spear through his side.  
And when he thrust that spear through his side,  
 The Bible tells us that blood and water gushed out, meaning that his heart had ruptured.  
The heart had broken.  
It had ruptured.  
So his blood all gushed out.  
So Jesus was buried without blood in his body.  
Are you hearing this?  
So that was a sacrifice.  
 His blood was shed for many for the remission of sins.  
His body was buried without blood.  
And so when the Holy Ghost, the Bible says he was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father.  
That's the Holy Ghost.  
The Bible says the Holy Ghost over shadowed the dead body of Jesus.  
Remember, there was no blood.  
And raised him back to life.  
 His body still no blood.  
From then on, Jesus worked without blood in His body, but living by the Spirit of God that raised Him back to life.  
Now, to be born again is to be born of that same Spirit.  
So the life that you have when you're born again is not the life that Jesus had before He died.  
 But the light that he had after he was raised from the dead is the light that works on the human body without the agency of the blood.  
That's why your body ought to be healed if there's any warmth.  
It doesn't require the blood to get healed.  
As far as he got the Holy Ghost in you, he makes alive your physical body.  
Come on, shout amen, somebody.  


  
 See how important this is?  
You are no ordinary person.  
Someone says, I don't know where I got this sickness from.  
You don't need to know where you got it from.  
You know how you can take it away.  
Hallelujah.  
That's all you need.  
You don't need the history of the sickness.  
You know it's future.  
Glory to God.  
 Man, oh my.  
Even spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead leaves in you that same spirit shall quicken your motto bodies.  
Oh boy, thank you Lord Jesus.  
What a life, what a life, what a life, what a life, what a life, what a life, what a life, oh glory.  
 You know why it's so important to listen to the Word of God like this?  
The Bible says, as we look.  


  
Okay, let me not take you too much ahead there.  
I take you a little backward so you can understand how we got to that verse I was about to give you.  
Okay, now it's so simple to understand this stuff.  
Let's look at the Bible.  
 There was a man named Elisha one time.  
Do you remember him?  
The young prophet that followed Elijah and became a prophet himself.  
Do you remember him?  
Good.  
Now, Elisha became sick.  
Elisha.  
Elisha the prophet.  
He was such a big, big prophet.  
But he got sick.  
So sick that he died sick.  
 So full of the Holy Ghost.  
But Elisha, Elisha died.  
I don't like the way Elisha died.  
He was so sick.  
And he died.  
Just somebody Elisha died.  


  
 You know, I'm trying to share something with you so you can understand that just because someone's life, when a particular direction, doesn't mean yours got to go that way.  
Find out what the truth that God has given to you is all about.  
Elijah was sick and died in his sickness.  
A great, great prophet.  
But God showed us something.  
And that's what I want to read to you.  
2 Kings.  
 Chapter number 13 you will like this verse 14 everybody read Again Okay You've seen that okay read verse 20  
 Again.  
First three words, one to go.  
Okay, read the whole verse now.  


  
Twenty-one.  


  
 Did you see that?  
They say the lights had died and they buried him in the sepulchre.  
And when they were invaded by the mobites, they said they were burying a man, some soldiers were burying a man and spotted some of the invaders.  
So they said, hey, hey, let's hurry away from here.  
 And then they cast this man that they were about to bury into the sepulchre, an open grave of Elisha.  
The man was dead, so they threw him into the sepulchre of Elisha.  
The Bible says, when the man's body, when the cops touched the bones of Elisha, he came back alive.  


  
 What woke him up?  
The Bible is clear.  
He says, when the man made contact with the bones of Elisha, the dead bones of Elisha, the man was not prayed for.  
Are you hearing me?  
The Bible didn't say that God wanted the man to come back to life.  
No!  
They mistakenly cast him in the grave of Elisha, the Sephocha of Elisha.  
 The Bible says, when the corpse touched the bones of Elisha, he revived.  
What was in the bones of Elisha?  
To know what was in the bones of Elisha, you'd have to study the life of that great man of God.  
Firstly, the one, my, my, my, the one that Elisha follows, okay?  
 who was Elijah, because Elijah described himself as the man who poured water on the hands of Elijah.  
Now Elijah himself saw up with God that one day he checked out of this world alive.  
He left this world alive.  
He didn't die.  
I'm talking about men that knew the spirits.  
Do you understand?  
 The Bible tells us that certain seasons Elijah will be sitting somewhere and the Holy Ghost will just carry him away and take him to another city.  
He would show up in a city without human transportation.  
Hallelujah!  
He so believed in the transportation of the Holy Spirit to the point that he was so sure he was going to heaven  
 With that same transportation, then he said to Elijah, I'm going today.  
Elijah said, I know what you want before I have been taken away.  
No, look, I mean the guy, but what of them are on earth?  
Listen to this type of discussion.  
What a spirit, if you heard two men talking like that, what do you think they were, Max?  
 You think they're insane?  
I want you to listen to the discussion of two human beings on earth.  
He says, you know I'm going to be taken away from the earth today.  
But what aircraft?  


  
I want you to listen.  
Listen to spiritual men talking.  
Elijah says, I know.  
Elijah says, all right, now what do you want before I'm taken away?  
 He says, let the double-pushing of your spirit rest upon me.  
Ah!  
He said, you've asked the hard thing.  
Anyway, if you see me when I'm taken away... Ah!  
Ah!  
Ah!  
Ah!  
Ah!  
He says, if you see me when I'm taken away, you got it.  
Alright!  
 And while they were together, still talking, the Baba says a chariot of fire came down with Elijah out of the earth, bum, and he was gone.  
And Elijah cried, my father, my father!  
The chariot of Israel and the husband are off!  
Yay!  
Yay!  
Elijah, his mantle,  
 He didn't need it in heaven.  
He dropped it.  
Elijah picked up the mantle of Elijah.  
The mantle is an overcoat.  
All right.  
So he picked it up.  
And then the baptizers, the sons of the prophets, they were all watching.  
 They all had an intuition that something was about to happen so they came out there.  
And why they were on the other side of Jordan watching?  
Suddenly they didn't find Elijah, but they were accustomed to the fact that from time to time he was carried away by the Spirit.  
So they thought, well, maybe the Spirit said to him, they didn't see the chariots.  
Only Elijah saw the chariots.  
So they said, hello Elijah, can we come and help you look for Elijah?  
He said, you don't need it.  
 No, no, we notice it suddenly disappeared.  
Can we come help you?  
Then Elijah knew, because they didn't see the chariot, he was now the senior prophet.  
He saw what other prophets couldn't see.  
Can you shout Hallelujah?  
Wow.  
 Now let me tell you, when he said, let a double portion of your spirit rest upon me, the meaning of double portion is found in the Book of Deuteronomy.  
It's based on a law of God.  
And God said, if a man has six songs, for example, and he divided his inheritance for the songs.  
He said, he must give, he must divide the inheritance into seven places.  
 He has six songs, the inheritance should be divided into seven places.  
Now the last song gets one, the next song gets one, the next song gets one, and so on until the sixth song gets one.  
So six passions gone.  
The fifth song gets one.  
Now the sixth song gets the sixth and the seventh portions, meaning that he has a double portion of what everybody else has.  
That's the proof that he's the senior of the rest of them.  
 So when Elijah said to Elijah, let a double portion of your spirit rest upon me, he wasn't asking for double announcing.  
He was asking for the place, the senior posts, the first posts.  
Now, what is the implication of that?  
The senior prophet was the one that had the revelation.  
The most important revelation for the kingdom was given to the senior prophet.  
And he was the one who had the message for the kingdom, and he ruled the kingdom.  
 with the Word of God.  
So when he said, I want a double portion of your spirit, that was the reason that I just said to him, you have asked the hard thing.  
Because you're asking to become the next senior prophet.  
How could you be?  
Now, I'm not talking about senior prophets that are senior supervisors.  
I'm not talking about in ministries.  
What do you say, chief of Asiya, senior of Asiya?  
No!  
I'm not talking about you of Asiya.  
I'm talking about this.  


  
 And you know, if God doesn't show you something, you can't see it.  
You may oversee, but you will not see.  
All right.  
Hey.  


  
Okay.  
 Now he noticed all of them didn't see the chariot of fire that took Elijah away.  
So he had the mantle.  
I want you to understand he was not always carrying the mantle of Elijah.  
He left it after a while.  
Didn't need the mantle no more because the power was not the mantle.  
The power was the spirits.  
Now he took that mantle and came  
 to the Jordan.  
And I want you to notice, we didn't follow how they got here in the first place.  
Elijah was such a man of God.  
When he got to the Jordan, he split it in two.  
That's what happened and walked through.  
I mean, he didn't need to carry the whole of Israel on his own for his convenience.  
 That's the kind of men Elijah was.  
Now Elijah is on this other side.  
He's got to go over.  
And the prophets are watching from that side.  
Can we come and help you?  
No.  
So what are you going to do?  
Don't worry.  
So they're watching him.  
Then he comes to the Jordan.  
He takes the mantle of Elijah.  
Where is the Lord God of Elijah?  
 The water of the Jordan speed in two.  
Wow, wow!  
When the Prophet saw it, they said the spirit of Elijah got rest on Elijah and they all bowed to him.  
I are still there, because what they couldn't do, they saw Elijah do, and now they see Elijah do.  
 And he said, where is the Lord God of Elijah?  
And it happened the same way as he did for Elijah.  
And he said, behold, the spirit of Elijah rests on Elijah, and they listened to him for his God.  
Now this is the Elijah that got sick.  
Are you there?  
This is a man that had known the spirit of God.  
 He has so known the Spirit.  
He has so contemplated the power of God that it robbed us on his bowls.  
They tell us about it since Francis of Assisi, who contemplated the cross of Jesus Christ so much until he saw priests above the cross.  
He said, when I die, open my body.  
He said, you will find a very imprint of the cross of Jesus Christ in my hearts.  
Now authorities say that when he died, his body was opened and his heart was found to be so with the mark of the cross right there.  
 He so contemplated it, he so meditated on it, until the very sign of the cross was stamped on his heart.  
He had come to know it to be so.  
We're talking about walking with the Holy Spirit.  
Are you still there?  
We're talking about the life of God that he has given to us.  
He says, when that corpse touched the bones of Elisha,  
 The man didn't need prayer.  
There was no meditation necessary by the family to say, hey, hey, hey.  
Nobody.  
It was the bones, the very bones of Elisha that made contact with the dead man.  
The dead man came back to life.  
My goodness.  
What does that tell us?  
Man, oh my.  
What does that tell us about us?  
Let me give you another story.  
 In the 34th chapter of the book of Exodus, when you read from the 28 verse, a man by the name of Moses had been in the presence of God for 40 days and 40 nights.  
He heard God.  
Now listen, he was being given the 10 commandments.  
 Only ten commandments.  
These were few sentences.  
That would not need a whole day.  
Why did he need to be there for forty days and forty nights?  
Just to receive the ten commandments.  
I'll tell you, it was more than ten commandments.  
He was there that he contemplated the commandments of God.  
He was there that he meditated on what we call the docks, the glory of God.  
On tier, the Bible says that the glory of God is so robbed of on Moses.  
 that he did not know that his face was shining, radiating with the power of God.  
There were such red yams of glory emanating from the face of Moses.  
The Bible says Moses didn't even know, but as he stepped down Mount Sinai, the people saw him and they began to run away.  
 He said, come back, come back.  
Why are you on it?  
Listen, your face, Moses, your face, your face, your face, Moses, your face is shining.  
We can't see because of the glory that's coming out of your face.  
Oh, Moses had to take a veil to cover his face.  
Are you still there?  
How did he get it from meditating on what you called the law of Moses?  
Now here's the point.  
 The children of Israel saw it as laws.  
What did Moses say about the law?  
He said it is your life.  
To Moses it was life.  
To the people it was a law.  
You see the difference?  
The word had come to mean something more to Moses.  
To the point it now had an impact on his physical body.  
 From then on, the Bible tells us, when Moses went to prayer, he took off the veil.  
But when he came out to the people, he covered his face.  
Now, the Bible tells us that that glory that was on the face of Moses is now inside us.  


  
Second Corinthians.  
Worrying from verse 7,  
 Are you there?  
But if the administration of death, written and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold a face of Moses for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away, how shall not the administration of the Spirit be rather glorious?  
For if the administration of condemnation be glory,  
 Much more that the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory, for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelled.  
Oh my goodness, I hope you understand what I'm reading to you.  
This is just wonderful.  
Verse 11, For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.  
 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech.  
And not as Moses, which would avail over his face, that the children of Israel could not set fast and look to the end of that which is abolished.  
But their minds are blinded, for until this day remain at the same veil and taken away in the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ.  
But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.  
 Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.  
Now, the Lord is that Spirit.  
And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.  
But we all, with open face, beholding, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.  
Somebody say hallelujah.  
 This is wonderful.  
Absolutely wonderful.  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Wonderful.  
Need I say more about that?  
This is the glory that we have now.  
Far exceeds the glory that Moses enjoyed.  
He says, we use plainness of speech.  
He says, we don't need a veil on our face.  
He says, but even with our open face,  
 As we behold the glory of God in the Word of God, He says, we are metamorphosed.  
We are transfigured into the same glory that we see in the Word of God.  
When you see, oh, no wonder He says they know not.  
Neither will they understand.  
They walk on in darkness.  
But I have said He are gods.  
And all of you are children of the Most High.  
This is but He shall die like men and fall like one of the princes.  
 Ignorance.  
This is their no-nots.  
Neither will they understand.  
This is their walk on in darkness.  
He says, but I have said ye are gods.  
And all of you are children of the most high.  
He says, but ye shall die like men.  
Why?  
Because they know not and will not understand.  
But if they know and understand, remember the words of Jesus?  
He said,  
 If they hear with their ears and see with their eyes and understand with their heart, he says, I should heal them.  
You see that?  
I should heal them.  
Which means the healing power of God is automatic.  
If you hear with your ears and see with your eyes and understand with your heart, healing cannot be held away from you.  
 He says, so they don't know and they don't understand.  
So they shall die like men, like men.  
Or he says, I have said, you are gods.  
So why will you suffer like men?  
He says, because you don't know and you don't understand.  
But if you know, if you understand, how do you know, by hearing and seeing, if you know and understand, then you will function as gods.  
 That's what it means.  
They which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life.  
You see that?  
In the 19th chapter of the Book of Acts, you read in verses 11 and 12 that hand catches an eopronce where taken from the body of Paul.  
Hand catches an eopronce where taken from the body of Paul.  
 In other words, close the door on Paul.  
When it took them back and put them on the sick and the demon possessed.  
The Bible says the demons, the demons, the demons, the demons for contacting a prince and handkerchiefs from Paul.  
The demons fled.  
They fled.  
Man, who am I?  
 No.  
Demons, demons fled.  
When hand-cuttives and aprons were brought from the body of Paul.  
They fled.  
Sickness is dispersed.  
Phew.  
They leaped out.  
Poir.  
Why?  
He just gave us this message.  
It was Paul who wrote what I just read to you.  
 that the glory that was on Moses' face has come to reside.  
That will tell you the understanding of the man Paul.  
You have to come to this understanding that because you are born again, no sickness in your body can remain.  
No disease can remain in your body.  
It should not stay.  
 After you have heard this word, not after you have heard this message, no sickness you remain in your body.  


  
You are to lay hands on the sick.  
You, you are to go and heal others.  
That is what you are supposed to be doing.  
Hallelujah.  
I said, Hallelujah.  
 Somebody will leave his crotches behind today.  
Are you hearing me?  
Somebody will leave his wheelchair behind today.  
Are you hearing me?  
You are coming out of that pain.  
You are coming out of that infirmity.  
Today there will be a separation between you and that sickness.  


  
 Today.  


  
The Holy Ghost in us.  
I said, the Holy Ghost in us.  
The Holy Ghost in us.  
Is he in you?  


  
 Do you have the Holy Ghost in you?  
He said, if the spirits that raised up Jesus from the dead lives in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also vitalize your much of body by his spirit that dwellers in you.  
That same spirits that raised Jesus from the dead  
 That same spirit!  


  
You know what you're supposed to do?  
How do you get that power to work?  
How do you get that power to... You've got to stay that power up.  
You've got to stare it up.  
The power of the Holy Ghost in you must be put to work, because it's there.  
 Notice it didn't work for Elisha.  
He died of sickness.  
But the power was in his bones.  
If it could make a dead man come to life, what could it have done for Elisha himself?  
God proved to us that even though Elisha died of sickness, the power did not fail.  
So it was not the power God that failed Elisha.  
 He did not apply it in His health.  
Somebody said, I don't understand.  
When I pray for people to get healed, but when I get sick, no, then I can't help myself.  
Yes!  
You are like Elisha.  
Because you're supposed to know what to do with the Word of God in your own life.  
That's what Paul said.  
That's what Paul was not sick.  
He says, we with open face.  
Behold in us in the mirror, the glory of God.  
We are changed.  
 changed as we look we are changed we become what we see in the Word of God the more glory we see in the words the more glorified we are you know sometimes some people say when you are sick  
 Jesus comes to you in my son so nice.  
Jesus, Jesus comes to you and shares your pain with you.  
Jesus comes to you and shares your sickness with you.  
Jesus comes with you.  
It doesn't matter how softly spoken it is, it's a lie.  
It's a lie from the pit of hell.  
 Jesus doesn't come to share your pain.  
Jesus, oh come on.  
Yes, somebody.  
Come on.  


  
Listen.  
Let me tell you what the word says.  
 In Saint Mary's Gospel chapter 8 and verse 17, the Bible says, himself, himself, not both of us, himself, took your infirmities and bore your sicknesses.  
He's not sharing it.  
He took them away.  
Himself, not both of you, himself, himself.  
That's King James Wilson.  
He alone.  
 took your infirmities, burned your sicknesses.  
He got rid of them, nailed them to the cross.  
You ought to walk free without sickness, hallelujah, bow in the door!  


  
He doesn't come to share your pain in the hospital.  
He doesn't come to share your sickness.  
 You know what it tells you, son, arise.  
Sickness is an old saying.  
It doesn't matter what you're going through right now.  
It doesn't matter what the pain is right now.  
It doesn't matter what the infirmity you're experiencing right now.  
You ought to say, I refuse to be sick.  
I refuse.  
I refuse.  


  
 Oh, glory to God.  
Amen, amen, amen, amen.  


  
Oh, thank you, Lord.  
I walk in health.  
I walk in victory in the name of Jesus.  
I refuse to be sick.  
 I walk in the glory of God.  
I refuse to be sick.  


  
I've come to my place of health.  
I've come to my place of strength.  
Oh, glory to God.  
I refuse to be sick.
