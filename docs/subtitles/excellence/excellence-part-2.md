title: Excellence Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 Life is a series of events which have the ability to form your personality.  
You say, I want to be excellent.  
Get instability out of your life.  
Get on reliability out of your life.  
Get in discipline out of your life.  
You can have so much ability and yet you're not chosen for something because your character will destroy it.  
 Discover how to chart your course in life through discipline, stability and reliability as Pastor Chris teaches on becoming the best of you in this message titled excellence.  
Becoming the best of you is very very important.  
 Working on the potentials within your spirit, your personality.  
What are those things that are inside you before God can carry you to another level you must cooperate?  
Introduce that into your character for your next level of excellence.  
Listen and be blessed.  
God bless you.  
 James chapter 4 in verse 17, what does it say?  
Therefore to him, that know it to do good, and do it not to him, it is sin.  
So if I know what I'm supposed to do, and I don't do it, the Word of God says, to me, it is sin.  
 What is it telling you?  
Sin is a personal thing.  
That thing may not be a sin to someone else.  
What is sin to you?  
Because you knew that this was the right thing to do and you didn't do it.  
The right thing to do  
 Wisdom is the ability to decide and deserve right from wrong.  
That's wisdom.  
Wisdom helps you distinguish right from wrong.  
If therefore you know what is right by Sophia,  
 And you don't do it, you lack furnaces.  
For furnaces is practical wisdom.  
Furnaces is that wisdom that makes you do what you're supposed to do.  
Furnaces is a propeller.  
The Bible says wisdom is the principal thing.  
Therefore, get wisdom.  
 Wisdom helps you see what you should see that others may not see.  
And the wisdom I'm talking about is the third level of wisdom, the third and highest kind of wisdom, furnaces.  
Furnaces is what puts you over in life.  
 How do you function every day?  
Because we're not trying to make big thinkers.  
No, walk with your spirit.  
Not just big thinkers.  
Have the information in your spirit and function from your spirit.  
 He that knows to do right, and do what it not, says to him that knows to do right, to him that knows to do right.  
And does it not to him?  
It is said.  
That means to that person, it is said.  
 That's why the Bible says that when we serve, we should serve us onto the Lord and not onto men.  
It doesn't matter that the guy didn't see you.  
It doesn't matter that you're busted in notice.  
It doesn't matter that someone who's looking at you.  
When I was a student, my first year in the university, we were in a queue in the calf, in the calf area.  
We were going to take our mirrors and we had the tickets.  
 So one by one, one by one, and then finally we got there.  
I have three friends with me.  
So we were four together.  
And they did something funny when they presented their tickets.  
We presented our ticket.  
We're all going together.  
So they did something funny there.  
And then we got back to the table.  
And we had an extra plate.  
Somebody had two.  
So I don't know who's is that?  
The last.  
 They were going to share it.  
I said, who is that?  
The guy said, no, they didn't see it.  
As they passed, they presented the tickets before the lady, you know, so this one collected it, and the other guy was waiting, and the woman talked, oh, sorry, I brought in another one, and two, took three plates, and the other one came up with his own, and I took mine, and that's how we got to the table, and we had an extra plate.  
So the one who shared, so we all have an extra plate to share.  
 So I said, why did you do that?  
He said, don't worry.  
Now the woman didn't see us.  
He said, nobody saw us.  
I leaned closer.  
I pointed upward as a God saw you.  
Take it back.  
He was embarrassed.  
I said, take it back.  
God saw you.  
So he took the plates and took it back to the county.  
 You see, his mentality was, nobody saw it.  
Nobody saw it.  
I thought, you crazy?  
God saw it.  
God saw it.  
God saw it.  
God saw it.  
Doesn't matter, nobody saw it.  
God saw it.  
What does God think?  
I'll take it back.  
 So he thought I should have been happy, so we'll share it.  
He took it back.  
Praise the Lord.  
Now, so he said, when you serve, serve as unto the Lord and not as unto men.  
So you can model things up for your boss.  
You can model things up for anybody, but  
 Can you really model things up for God?  
He says, do it as unto the Lord.  
If you know that this thing is not right and you present it as those right to you, it is same.  
You are blind.  
You have stolen a commendation because you were commanded when you should have been commanded.  
 See, think of all the sins that could be credited to your account from that simple, wrong step.  
You've got several sins there.  
How can you then make progress in your life?  
How can you have excellence then?  
 You see, it's living from your spirits.  
Living from your spirits.  
How many of you want to be excellent?  
You sure?  
We're looking for, as God is looking for, we're looking for  
 excellent characters.  
God wants to deliver the world into the hands of excellent characters.  
And if we show ourselves the worthy, with our appreciation and  


  
 apprehension of his word would see as errors where we ought to be.  
Did you hear me?  
Do excellent things as a personal policy.  
Have it in you as a personal policy.  
No half measures  
 No half measures.  
Say to yourself, no half measures.  
Again.  
No half measures.  
Come on.  
No half measures.  
One more time.  


  
I'm thinking of some things to show you.  
 in your journey of excellence.  
How many of you would like to get into an airplane after the pilot says, well, not the pilot, because by the time the pilot is talking, you're already inside the plane, you know, and you can come out.  
He doesn't talk until the door is short.  
 unlocked.  
So if it's the pilot has to tell you this, you're in for it.  
Imagine you want to go out a plane and the attendants at the desk and at the gate tell you, Madame O'Sarr, today's flight.  
 We are really hoping you'll get to the destination.  
One of the wings is just partially alright.  
It's a single-engine plane because the second engine is bad.  
But when it gets to the destination, they try to fix it.  
Then also, we notice that  
 The air conditioning system stops from time to time.  
What we trust God, it will arrive in time.  
Have a safe flight.  


  
 How many of you wouldn't mind you go?  
You still like to go?  
Or you ask for your things that you already checked in?  
So please, can they bring my things back?  
I'm sure you would like to go in.  
You ask, is there any other airline going there?  
Why?  
Because you think  
 They're gonna put your life in jeopardy.  
You think that's dangerous?  
Or it's a nice plane.  
Everything is okay.  
 And they say, well, we're having a great flight today.  
But we noticed that something was wrong with the engineer.  
And his report on the plane, on today's flight, isn't quite okay.  
We're looking for a better engineer because it looks like he was sick and couldn't go through all the routine checks.  
You say routine checks, he couldn't.  
At that point, you want to make up your mind.  
 All right, do you have an excellent mind?  
Where'd you get it from?  
Where'd you get it from?  
What's your thinking like?  
What's your thinking like?  
I can't think of someone who doesn't like me, because I don't care.  
It doesn't matter.  
I can think someone's responsible for my problem.  
Doesn't matter.  
 We hit some of you do.  
You think someone's responsible for your problem?  
And makes you sad?  
That's not an excellent mind.  
And I'm not a garbage dump.  
Where you tell bad stories about other people.  
Every such person is a garbage dump.  
Let me tell you something.  
I know lots and lots of stuff about people.  
 No, make no mistakes about it.  
I know lots and lots of stuff.  
But I have a spiritual sharing machine because if you keep hearing stuff about people and you look at them with the stuff that you hear, you become the character of what you hear.  
So I'm not a garbage duck.  
 See that?  
You want to be excellent?  
There are some things that you must distance yourself from.  
I mean, distance yourself.  
If you don't do that, excellence is not possible.  
It doesn't matter how you look.  
You may look handsome or beautiful.  
It doesn't matter how you dress.  
You may dress excellently well, but you don't have an excellent mind because you have a mind that's been poisoned.  
 You don't let someone else put the wrong stuff in you.  
One of the decisions I made many years ago for our student in school was this.  
I said, I'm going to think the right thoughts.  
Because I'm going to hear the right things.  
Because I'm going to listen to the right things.  
He didn't hear what I said.  
 I'm going to think the right thoughts because I'm going to hear the right things because I'm going to listen to the right things.  
You see, I'm going to think the right thoughts because I'm going to hear the right things because I'm going to listen to the right things.  
 So the only reason I can think the right thoughts is because I heard the right things.  
And the only reason I heard the right things was because I listened to the right things.  
You develop what you call field as.  
Listen, I'm not trying to talk to everybody.  
I'm trying to talk to those that are going to go into an excellent life, an excellent way of life.  
You see that?  
 This life is for the excellent mind.  
That's why I teach in a higher life.  
There's a higher life.  
There's a higher life.  
When I was a student, those who had negativism as a way of life faded over of me.  
They just faded away.  
 because I couldn't run in the same tracks with them.  
I didn't want to.  
I didn't think I should.  
Let me give you a little illustration.  
Let's say there are three of us in an office.  
The boss gives us a job to do.  
Three of us sit down and the guy says,  
 I don't even know what they want.  
But I'm thinking, what does he mean?  
I don't even know what they want.  
I thought they just told us what to do.  
That's what they want.  
No, they're just keeping us busy for nothing.  
That's a bad mouth.  
You know what I want to do?  
Pack my books.  
Excuse me.  
Thank you.  
I should leave there.  
 My relationship with Him cannot continue.  
We work together.  
We greet with friends, but we don't move together.  
We don't run together.  
Why?  
Because He has a spirit that's wrongly brought up.  
And He wants to bring that thing to me.  
Now, let's look at it.  
Do you really think?  
 He can go on for much longer?  
No, not for much longer.  
The boss may not know it.  
The boss may think that he's the real guy who's making this thing happen.  
And I may be learning from him.  
I may be learning from him.  
He's the best one among the three.  
So all the time, he's one chord and then he answers and does all the stuff and he comes back and gives us.  
So we're working with him.  
 Every now and day, and he says something, you know, makes a sly statement.  
And he's, well, get this thing done and go and give it to them before they start shouting again.  
Before they start shouting again, who is he talking about?  
 And he always puts it in plural, this, that shouting again.  
I thought we had just one boss here, this, that shouting again.  
Who's he talking about?  
So he calls me and I said, well, let's do it.  
You know what they're doing to stop?  
And all the time he says these kind of things.  
I'm going to ask my boss one day, please, can I use another office?  
Why?  
I don't like the kind of talk that goes on in my office.  
 Now, I'd really appreciate if I could have another place.  
What goes on in your office?  
Well, I just don't like the negative talking.  
I may not be able to say much, but I can't continue.  
I don't think it's good for me.  
Simple.  
Because if you don't deliver yourself, after a while, you will contribute.  
 And then from your simple contribution, because you want to be comfortable, because if you don't contribute, you think you're not in tune with the others, then they ostracize you.  
And you may not like the way they treat you.  
And so you want to conform.  
And by confirming, you're bringing down your spirits.  
 You know what the Bible says?  
A man that has no control over his spirit is like a city whose wars are broken down.  
It's an attack on your excellence.  
It's an attack on your honesty.  
It's an attack on your sincerity.  
And if you don't do something, you're going to lose that fight.  
It's a fight for your spirit.  
It's a fight for your spirit.  
 This is what has destroyed many corporations, many organizations.  
Doesn't matter what they do, doesn't matter what their product is.  
You have to be a man of an excellent spirit.  
A woman of an excellent spirit, who read in book of Proverbs the other day, right?  
This is a man of understanding, is of an excellent spirit.  
Understanding.  
Understanding.  
 One who's discreet, one with perception, discernment, ability to discern, how can you be so naive?  
If, if in the battle was naive, she was, she was  
 She was naive.  
Let me remind you, Satan doesn't need a stranger to destroy your spirit.  
It's never going to be a stranger.  
Did you hear me?  
But they will lose smart enough to know that.  
It's never going to be a stranger.  
Praise God.
