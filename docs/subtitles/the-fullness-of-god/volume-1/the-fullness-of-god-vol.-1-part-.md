title: The Fullness Of God Vol. 1 Part 3
---
 Coming to you with words and teaching to change your life forever.  
All things that you'll ever need in your life.  
They're wrapped up in the world.  
Go for the world.  


  
 You need to understand this thing.  
And when you get a hold of it, keep saying it.  
Don't stop talking it.  
Keep saying it.  
Keep saying it.  
The Bible says in the city of Ephesus, so mightily build the Word of God and prevail.  
Can you shout amen?  
And stand on the cross that I must follow.  
 In the name of Jesus, prosperity is mine.  
In the name of Jesus, the Lord is my shepherd.  
I shall not want.  
He makes me lie now.  
He brings us this.  
He leaves me beside the sea waters.  
He would sell us my soul.  
Fast to grace.  
Worth hearing.  
Hallelujah.  
 What kind of life would you like to live?  


  
There are people who cannot live a happy life because they are concerned about everything else.  
They're concerned about so many things.  
You know, Jesus had to, women one time,  
 host Him in their house, and both of them were sisters.  
They had the same parents.  
And as you know, one of them was called Mary, and the other one was called Mater.  
Mary sat listening to Jesus as He spoke.  
 And Mother went to the kitchen to try to fix something for Jesus, which was not bad at all.  
But the Bible says she got worried that her sister hadn't come to join her, to help her.  
 fix the food and make all the preparation for Jesus.  
So she went to Jesus and said, Master, why don't you tell my sister come help me in the kitchen?  
There's so much work to do.  
And Jesus said, matter, matter.  
You know, why didn't Jesus say that all the time?  
See, when she came to complain, it just gave Jesus the opportunity  
 to lecture her about her lifestyle.  
Jesus said, matter, matter, you worry about so many things.  
So it wasn't just that Mary didn't come to help her, that was a problem.  
It was one of her ways of complaining.  


  
She couldn't even, she couldn't even overlook that since there was a guest.  
 She didn't even think, let me not embarrass my sister at this point.  
She forgot if both of them had been in the kitchen, who would have been talking to Jesus?  
He'd have just been there waiting as though he came to eat.  


  
 Jesus said, Mat have matter.  
You worry about so many things.  
But one thing is needful.  
He said, only one thing is needful.  
And Mary has gotten it.  
And then he said, nobody is going to take it away from her.  
In other words, I'm not going to do it.  
I'm going to do what you're asking.  


  
 What about the food?  
I warned that if that food was sweet that day.  
Because she would have returned to the kitchen, grumbling, unhappy.  
Who knows?  
I'm not sure she appreciated Jesus' answer so well.  
Maybe that was why she complained when the brother died and said, if you had been here four days ago,  
 and convenes the sister to think the same.  
And the sister came and said, if you have been here four days ago, my brother wouldn't have died.  
In other words, you're the cause.  
See, don't be worried about anything.  
You know, some people are worried about the children's school fees.  
The bill is coming.  
 It hasn't come yet, they're already worried.  
Every time they see the landlord pass by, their hat jumps.  
They're owing him now.  
Maybe three months or three years.  
The people who are worried, they're so worried.  
So worried they look much older than they really are.  
 Now, somebody's hit.  
But if you have a lot of problems, isn't it right to worry about the problems?  
Well, you've been worrying so long.  
Has your worrying brought the money?  
No.  
Has the worrying made anybody to help you?  
No.  
So why do you worry?  
Why does God tell us not to worry?  
Ah!  
 I'm laughing at you.  
Why does God tell us not to worry?  


  
Can I tell you?  
Because of what worry does to us.  
If worry didn't affect us, he wouldn't bother about our worry.  
He would tell us worry, worry.  
 Somebody said, be worried, be very worried.  
Why?  
Because some things are going wrong.  
Maybe the economy.  
Maybe some policy of government.  


  
God doesn't want us to worry because of what it does to us.  


  
 worry sets up a magnetic force that attracts to us everything that's consistent with worry.  


  
 What do you call the eye of the stump?  
In other words, the central point of what you worry about has its fears.  


  
For example, let me take a very simple one.  
 worrying about the children's school fees.  
All right?  
You worry not that the money is available.  
You worry that the money may not be available when you need it.  
Or you worry that it may not come.  
Or you worry that it is not there.  
And so  
 that may be sent out of school.  
Which means worry has its fears.  
All right?  
Worry has its fears of its negative possibilities.  
We may be sent out of the house.  
We may lose the job.  
 You don't worry that money is coming.  
You worry that it may not come.  
You worry that the pain you have may be more complicated than you realize.  
What if this is an incurable problem?  
What if what if?  
 So worry has its fears of negative possibilities.  
And that's what God wants to stop us from, because worry sets up a magnetic force that attracts those negative possibilities to us and makes them possible.  
 The human soul, I want you to understand, that's very important.  
The human soul, the human spirit, all right?  
The inward man has an ability.  
Remember that man was made, created in the image of God.  
He's like God.  
In other words, he functions like God.  
He looks like God, he functions like God.  
 All right?  
The Bible says that God made man in his own image and in his own likeness.  
In other words, he looks like God and he functions like God.  
All right?  
Now, if God, if God wants something, he doesn't need to ask.  
His simple imagination of it creates it.  


  
 That's what we say, your imaginative power is your creative ability.  


  
Worry helps you imagine the worst-case scenario.  
Worry helps you imagine negative possibilities.  
And your imagination of those negative possibilities crystallizes them.  


  
 worry helps make your fears possible.  
So God says be anxious for nothing, be worried about nothing but in everything.  
 by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving lets your request be made none of the God and the peace of God that surpasses all understanding shall garrison your hearts and minds.  
Christ Jesus refused to be worried.  
Repel worried.  
Repel it.  


  
 You say, I refuse to worry.  
I refuse to worry.  
No, worry attacks you.  
Don't think it's going to go away just if you change your mind.  
Because worry is a spirit.  
It's not going to go away just because you say I change my mind.  


  
That's why the Bible tears us.  
 that we should take unto us heirs the shield of faith.  
He says, with which you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.  
And what do we have also?  
The sword of the spirit, which is the remar of God.  
In other words, you need to protect yourself  
 Protect yourself with the helmet of salvation.  
Protect yourself with the breastplate of righteousness.  
Protect yourself with your Lord's God about with truth.  
Protect yourself with your feet sharned by the preparation of the gospel.  
That's your boots, all right?  
Then defame yourself with your shield of faith.  
 You see, you've got to protect yourself with all of this and defend yourself with the shield of faith.  
Then go on the offensive with the sword of the Spirit, which is the ramer, the ramer of God, the water God for the now that's spoken to you, that belongs to you now concerning your situation.  
 What does God's Lord say now?  
I refuse to worry.  
Why?  
He said, he's nothing beyond just.  
But in everything, and this is one of them, praise God.  
 prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, I make my request known.  
What do I want?  
He says, don't worry about anything.  
Declare what you want.  
What do you want?  
Don't just sit there, worry and worry and worry.  
He says, what do you want?  
Worry about nothing.  
Declare what you want.  
And then give thanks to God because it is done.  
Hallelujah.  
 When you give things because it is done, it says the peace of God.  
That surpasses understanding.  
In other words, here you are.  
Circumstances don't look right.  
Everything looks like there's trouble.  
How can you be at peace in the midst of this trouble?  
This is that peace of God that surpasses understanding.  
Others can understand how you can be at rest with all of this trouble.  
 How you can be at rest with all of this trouble coming out against you, with all these challenges.  
How can you be at rest?  
He says, yes, it is possible and it is happening because he calls it the peace of God that surpasses understanding.  
He beg us understanding.  
It dwarfs understanding.  
This is that peace of God.  
Shall guard your hearts.  
 Guard your hearts.  
Hallelujah.  
I like that.  
Say it again, I refuse to worry.  
I refuse to worry about anything.  
I don't worry about anything.  
I refuse, I refuse to worry.  
So when warrior attacks you, if you catch yourself worrying,  
 If you catch yourself worrying, hey!  
You know, sometimes there are people, there are people who love to be seen worrying.  
They feel like if they're not found worrying, they will not be taken seriously.  
You get laugh around them because something serious is going on.  
 And what is that thing that is serious?  
So look at this letter.  
And then you look at it, it's all about somebody writing them about how much they owe or they're for feeding something or they're losing a job or something like that.  
None of those things should move you.  
Understand?  
 You say, there is not a factor in my life.  
Hey, come on here.  
Are you still there?  
He said, that is not a factor in my life.  
It's not a factor in my prosperity.  
It's not a factor in my joy.  
It's not a factor of my fulfillment in life.  
It's not a factor.  
Glory to God.  
It's not a factor.  
Amen.  
 Is there a factor?  
No, it's not.  
No, it's not.  
Jesus said, only one thing is needful.  
One thing.  
He didn't say there are some things that are needful.  
He said, only one thing.  
And we know what it is.  
It was what the Bible tells us.  
Mary was listening to the Word.  
 That's the only thing that's needful because with the word, you can make anything.  
When God had the word empty and in darkness, what did he do?  
The whole world was a chaotic mass.  
What did God do?  
He didn't fix anything.  
He didn't do anything with his hands.  
He just said, let there be light.  
He spoke.  
 And that word that he spoke resides in you now.  
You see that?  
It's there in you.  


  
Words are powerful, but the word is all powerful.  
I'm not sure you got that.  
You heard it, but whether or not you got it is something else.  
I want to say it again.  
 As it words are powerful, but the word is all powerful.  
Can we take it again?  
I know it's short enough for you to memorize.  
I wanted to get into your spirit so you understand what I'm saying?  
As it words are powerful, but the word is all powerful.  
 All right, that is to say anybody can say anything and have it produce us ours.  
Whether or not he's a Christian, anybody.  
After all, man was made in the image of God and in his likeness.  


  
That's the natural man.  
 He can see anything.  
He can have it affect his life, affect anybody else.  
So words are powerful.  
But when a man is born again, he is born of the Word.  
 verses being born again, not of corruptible, but of incorruptible by the Word of God that live it and abid it forever.  
So when the man is born again, he's born of the Word.  
He is the offspring of the Word.  
He's called to live by the Word.  
He's being built by the Word.  
He dwells in the Word.  
Are you hearing me?  
 Now God says, hey, let's what has brought you into being come out of your mouth.  
So what?  
When we say you speak words, you don't just speak words, you speak the word.  
Ah, ah, ah.  
 In the realm of the Spirit, the world is all that's necessary.  


  
 And yet the Spirit governs the Word.  
The Spirit governs all things.  
The Spirit, the Spirit, the Spirit and the realm thereof has the laws that control the universe.  


  
Receive the Word that my mouth said, Lord.  
Receive the Word.  
Have it in your Spirit.  
For there is the home of the Word.  
Write in your Spirit.  
 for listening to me, say, the Lord is actually thinking the thoughts of God and walking in this realm of life.  
And therefore, say, the Spirit of God, when you speak, it comes forth.  
It comes forth.  
Oh, glory to God, somebody say, hallelujah.  
Praise God forevermore.  
We are born into that realm.  
We belong there.  
 fashioned by the Word, created by the Word.  
You understand?  
Shippened by the Word.  
And then as we grow in the Word, all that comes into our thinking is in that direction, in that imagination.  
You see that?  
And then we find that we are manifesting the Word.  
 when we speak is the word speaking.  
Look at Jesus, that's what he was.  
He was the word of God, made flesh.  
He was the word working in the streets, hallelujah.  
Everything he said was the outbreathing of God.  
Marvellous, marvellous, everything he said.  
When he said, bring that fish, the word was said.  
 Do you want to say what I'm talking about?  
When he asked the question, it was the word.  
God Almighty asking.  
Think about it.  
Think about it.  
 when we are in sync with God and breathing out his thoughts.  
That's why he said it shall come to pass in the last day he said, God, thou part my spirit upon all flesh, your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.  
In other words, they will speak my words.  
In other words, you see, every time they prophesy, they are in sync with the Spirit, saying what the Spirit is saying at that moment.  
And that means having the power of the Spirit manifested in the Word.  
 So when they speak by the Spirit, it's as though God has spoken, you know, produced the same results.  


  
Are you still there?  
So when you face a situation, what do you do?  
Are you listening?  
In your Testament, back in your Testament, when they're faced,  
 predicament or they found themselves in the precarious situation.  
They looked out for the prophet of God and they said, prophet of God, please help.  
What do we do?  
And then the prophet spoke when the prophet said, go, they went knowing that they had it made because the prophet brought to them what thou saith the Lord.  
 God's Word.  
Now, the prophet brought it.  
Now Moses said, I want to God that all of God's people were prophets.  
He was prophesying God's thoughts.  
Hallelujah.  
Well, he said, when the Spirit comes, that'll be possible.  
And the Spirit came.  
And I made that possible.  
So when do you prophesy?  
Somebody said,  
 when the prophecy is given.  
What is prophecy?  
So, Christ owes a friend of the high.  
He says, come up and think like me.  
That's what God's saying at the hour.  
Come up and think like me.  
Oh, glory to God.  
I like that.  
God says, come up and think like me.  
I like that.  
That's what I said in other tongues.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
Praise God forevermore.  
Now, now think about it.  
God,  
 Hello?  
God is speaking every time.  
The human body is a limitation of divinity.  
Can I explain that very simply?  
Jesus was God.  
Jesus is God.  
 When Jesus was tabanacled in human flesh, there were things he could not do because he was in the human body.  
For example, he couldn't continue every day, every hour without getting tired.  
He had to sleep.  
 One time he was in the boat and fell asleep.  
Because he was tired.  
In another occasion, there was no journey.  
And when it got to the whale, Jesus said, hey, you guys, go on, I'm tired.  
And he sat down, and the disciples went on, and they tried to, they went out to get food for him.  
The Bible says he was worried with his journey.  
He was tired.  
It was a long journey.  
 because he was encased in a physical body, a human body.  
That body had not been glorified.  
He couldn't be in two places at the same time because it was a human body.  
How Jesus wanted to be free of that body.  
 through the Holy Ghost.  


  
Because that's what it got for us, letting the Spirit loose in us.  
He couldn't even minister beyond Israel as much as he loved the whole world.  
He couldn't.  
He was limited because he was a Jew.  
 Even the Samaritan woman wouldn't want to listen to him.  
Hence, then how can you ask me for water?  
You're a Jew, I'm a Samaritan.  
How can we have no dealings with each other?  
That was a Samaritan.  
What would have happened to the Romans?  
They wouldn't have accepted you.  
The limitation of the human body.  
 is the limitation of divinity in you.  
For example, I said, Jesus was the word.  
That's what the Bible says.  
The word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
That's Jesus.  
But then when he was sleeping, was the word sleeping.  
The only reason I had to go to sleep was what?  
Because the body was tired.  
The body needed rest.  
So what does that mean?  
That the essence of the human spirit  
 is not the physical body.  
Hey, come on here.  
The essence of the human spirit, the human personality is not the physical body.  
The body can be limited.  
There are things you can't do because of your physical body.  
But words, words, God designed divinity to be revered and released through words.  
 Words are unlimited.  
Words cannot be limited because words go into the realm of the spirits.  
You can speak from here and have something happen in Russia.  
That's the power of words.  
 You can speak from here and have something happen in heaven.  
You can speak from here and have something happen in America.  
You can speak from here and have something happen in Congo.  
You can speak from here, go read a God and have something happen all over the world.  
Can you shout Hallelujah?  
Words.  
Man, oh my.  
How important your words are.  
 And when your spirit is in sync with the Holy Ghost, it becomes the Word.  
That's the Word.  
So when you have a situation to deal with, you've got something to change.  
Stay your spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
Stay your spirit.  
Never be intimidated by anything.  
Never be intimidated by anything.  
 Train yourself to think God's thoughts.  
Because if you think God's thoughts, the necessary result is you will speak God's words.  
Because out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.  
Hallelujah.  
So if the abundance of your heart, the abundance of your meditation is the word, definitely when you open your mouth.  
You see, because the thoughts of God will be waiting for expression.  
 They'll be right there when you open your mouth.  
It'll be the word coming out.  
And so you always win.  
I can't talk fear.  
You see that?  
Because I don't have fear in my spirit.  
I can't talk fear.  
I can't talk negatively.  
Because it's not in my spirit.  
I've got the word in my spirit.  
Hallelujah.  
That's what you got to do.  
 That's what you got to do.  
Meditate on the Word, soak your spirit in the Word until only the Word comes out of your mouth.  
And so you find the Word making your Word.  
So you have a beautiful Word that you're living.  
 So when the darkness is there, it will only be because you're not there.  
Because when you show up, the light shows up.  
So you become what God planned for you all the time, the answer to human problems.  
You are the answer.  
Come on, come on.  
Are you getting it?  
 You are not the fellow looking for answers.  
You see, in many places, including many churches, you got a lot of people, they're looking for answers.  
Oh God, you know, they're looking for answers.  
But the truth is, that's not there in the wrong position.  
And they need somebody to teach them this stuff so they can change their position.  
They're in the wrong position.  
They're looking for answers.  
 What I'm going through, through, through what?  
You're going through what?  
You see what I'm going through?  
It's been for so long, you know, they got all of these complaints.  
When are you gonna stop?  
So when, I just pray that God will answer my, answer what?  
So what?  
The Bible says, casting all your cares upon Him.  
They haven't done that.  
They haven't done that.  
 He says, casting all your cares upon Him.  
Everything you care about, everything you care about.  
He says, cast, cast, cast.  
Throw them on Him.  
Say, Father, I don't worry no more.  


  
 How does it happen just by you right there where you're sitting?  
And if you have worries, if you have cares, you just say, at that moment, now, oh, you make up your mind.  
From now, no more worrying.  
Cast them on him.  
About as casting all your cares upon him for he, he care rats for you.  
Some of you are worried about your children, caring about your children.  
Listen!  
 If you ask if or as you are.  
If you ask we care as you are.  
If you miss you.  
If you can care about your children, you.  
You as you are.  
 Now think about it.  
If you can care about your children, this you, don't you know you?  
If nobody knows you, you know yourself.  
 If you can care about how they're going to grow up, you care about how they're going to be protected when they're out.  
You care about how they'll feed.  
You care about their shelter, about their clothing, about everything concerned.  
You don't care about their friends.  
You care about so many things about them.  
If you, you, you can care.  
How much more shall your heavenly father  
 And he's the one inviting you.  
Castin' all your cares.  
He says, give me your cares.  


  
Castin' all your cares upon him, fuck.  
 He didn't say casting all your cares upon him because you're not your bad guy.  
No, he says casting all your cares.  
Not because you don't know how to care well.  
He says casting all your cares upon him because he cares.  
He says, give me your cares.  
I'll take them.  
 I'll take them, I'll fix them.  
But we can be caring at the same time or at the same thing.  
If you are going to be caring, God can't come in because your worries will stop the power of God from flowing your way.  
Refuse to care and confess the Word.  
Father, I've given up to you.  
You are in charge and you care.  
 And the answers belong to me.  
Thank you Lord.  
Solution is mine.  
The answer is mine.  
Because you care.  
Hallelujah.  
Because you care.  
Glory to God.  
Because you care.  
 You have your son, look at that other way, somewhere.  
I need a whole God.  
Don't know what's happening.  
Oh God.  
Mm-hmm.  
Father, thank you because you care.  
Glory to God.  
He's protected because you care.  
Hallelujah.  
She's protected because you care.  
Glory to God because you care.  
Hallelujah.  
Confess that God cares.  
That's what the word says.  
So voice the word.  
It's the word that is voice that works.  
Oh, did you hear what I just said?  
 The Bible says, for with the heart, man believes on the righteousness, but with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  
So if you don't say it, it will not work, even though you think it.  
You see that?  
If you think it, God accepts you.  
He says, by your thinking, by your believing, you go right with God, but you not get the answer until you see your believing.  
Can you see that?  
 Glory to God.  
I'm a wonder.  
I'm a wonder.  
Say it again, I'm a wonder.  
Hallelujah.  
You know, the Bible says, that's the wind, glory, at least, that you can't tell or it's coming from where it's going to say, so is everyone that's born of the Spirit.  
The natural man can't understand him.  
Everything he does matters to whatsoever he do it.  
 What so ever he do it?  
What so ever?  
That's what anything I get involved in has to press because what so ever he do it?  
That's me.  
What so ever he do it?  
That's me.  
What so ever?  
Hey, hey, hey, go to the gut.  
What so?  
What so ever?  
What so ever he do it?  
If I get involved?  
 It'll work.  
Because I'm a blessed man.  
Come on, brother.  
I'm a blessed man.  
Let me hear your sister.  
I'm a blessed woman, say it.  
Alleluia.  
I'm blessed.  
You remember?  
The seed of Abraham.  
Hey, go around that guy.  
Whoo!  
 Hallelujah.  
Man, oh, man.  


  
I'm blessed.  
I'm blessed.  
In my spirit is scared, you see.  
My spirit is scared.  
I'm blessed.  
I only think blessed.  
 Bless.  
Bless.  
I refuse to fear.  
I refuse to worry.  
Bless.  
Bless.  
Bless.  


  
Bless.  
You say this.  
I'm so blessed.  
I've got good things coming from everyone.  
 I'm so blessed.  
I got favor coming from everywhere.  
I'm so blessed.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Thank you.  
Now, you see, we're in the house of God, right?  
Okay.  
At this time, you know what you're going to do?  
 You're gonna use what you have.  
You don't worry anymore.  
You say what you want.  
You hear that?  


  
And no matter what you do,  
 Whether you're a businessman or you're a professional or whatever your work, you bring that blessing into your work.  
All right?  
You bring that favor into your work, into what you do.  
You are that man or that woman with an excellent spirit.  
 You're going to function with an excellent spirit.  
Now say this with me, I have an excellent spirit.  
Of course, I'm the seed of Abraham.  
I am the blessed.  
You know, days are called Abraham, Abraham the blessed.  
 Abraham the blessed.  
Even up to now, even up to now, the lots of people, especially in Arab countries where they claim physical ties with Abraham, all right, they still recognize Abraham the blessed.  
 Listen, he's the blessed.  
And yet the Bible says that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith, and that has happened.  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
He has already happened.  
 It has already happened.  
So the blessing of Abraham has come on me.  
Glory to God.  
So now I am the blessed.  
Like they called him the blessed, Abraham the blessed.  
I am the blessed.  
You see that?  
You are so blessed.  
Do you recognize it now?  
 All right, so you're gonna speak as the blessed one.  
About anything you do, about anything you're involved with.  
Because you are the best.  
There's excellence in your life.  
They mean, as it is excellence in your life.  
Now pull it out, bring it out.  
Come on brother, come on sister, use your mouth now.  
 Speak words.  
Hallelujah.
