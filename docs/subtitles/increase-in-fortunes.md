title: Increase in Fortunes
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 We started talking about the sevenfold increase.  
And we have already shared along the lines and talked about the first one, which is what?  
Come on, have you forgotten?  
The first one is what?  
And then we talked about ability, the second one.  
And then the third one is what?  
And the fourth one is what?  
So we are in the fourth one now.  
 which is on fortunes.  
And God said that in 2009, we'll have an increase in fortunes.  
That means in material and financial wealth, we will have an increase in fortunes.  
Interestingly, this is a time around the world where people are tightening their bets.  
 They got economic problems, but this is not new.  
If you studied the Bible, you're gonna find at different times in life where they had economic downturns.  
Things went bad.  
And always those who were men and women of faith acted on the principles of God's supply system.  
God's financial system.  
 and they were madly blessed.  
So in a day in which we're living, this is the only way out.  
It's the only way out.  
God's children have to follow God's ways.  
It's the only way out.  
Let me show you something.  
Can you turn into the book of Job for a moment?  
Book of Job, J-O-B.  
 Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Increase in fortunes.  
Man, oh man, what a promise.  
Glory.  
Job chapter 22, how many of you know that Job was a good man?  
The Bible says he was a righteous man.  
And he had friends.  
 And from what we study about his friends, they were also men of God, as Job was.  
They were men who also heard from God.  
They walked with God and they knew the word of God.  
But on this particular occasion, they misjudged Job.  
They thought that Job was going through some problems because he had done something wrong.  
 Just because you're going through some trying times in your life doesn't mean you've done something wrong.  
Are you following this?  
What you have to watch is actually your mouth.  
 Because, you see, in a lot of times, people wonder why we talk about confession, speaking, using your mouth, why we talk about that so much.  
Because the Bible says, where your mouth goes, your life goes.  
It says, you measure a man's life with his tongue, his speech, his words.  
You cannot live a righteous life, why your mouth is talking on righteousness.  
It is not possible.  
You can only pretend, and that for a short time.  
 Are you still there?  
So your tongue is where your Christian maturity is measured.  
So that's important.  
And that's not our subject today, but your words can bring into your life things, what you call the unexpected.  
Good or bad?  
Bad unexpected.  
 include unexpected.  
That means beyond expectation.  
Hallelujah.  
Alright, so are you in a book of Job now?  
I want us to read carefully from verse 18 and down.  
Here the man, one of his friends, Eliphaz,  
 reminded Job of God's words.  
Even though he misjudged Job, his words were right.  
And I want to see some of those special things that he brought to Job that the whole Word of God shows us are accurate.  
Let's read verse 18 one to go.  


  
 What verse are you now?  
20, what?  
23.  
I want you to read verse 21 again and go down, yeah?  


  
 Praise God.  
Lots of beautiful verses there.  
Did you notice them?  
Hallelujah.  
He says, when men, verse 29, when men are cast down, when men are cast down, when men are cast down,  
 When men are cast down, as many of them are today, what did they say you should do?  
Thou shalt say there is lifting up.  
When men are cast down, did they say identify with them?  
Say it's happening everywhere.  
Everybody is experiencing the same thing.  
They say it's hammer time.  
 It's a financial Hamilton everywhere.  
Then you, because you want to be accepted in the clique, you know, you just want to join in the conversation, you act to eat and say, everywhere is everywhere.  
Then you give a story to, to, you know, to support what is, to let them know how you also identify with the system, what's going on.  
The Bible says, when men are cast down,  
 Thou shalt say, let's lift you down.  
They say it's everywhere, so that doesn't include me.  
Now when you say that, they're going to turn around and look at you and say, oh, what do you think you are?  
I'm a child of God.  
Child of God, I'm different.  
I'm different.  
He says, when men are cast down, thou shalt say,  
 You may not feel it, but it says, thou shalt say, because what you say is what you get.  
So he says, Fred, that is lifting up, because when you say it, you will be propelled upward.  
Thou shalt say that's lifting up.  
So, friend, how are you?  
I'm down, man.  
I'm down.  
Ah, say, well, I'm up.  
I'm up.  
Glory to God.  
I'm up.  
 I tell you, he wake up.  
He'll clean out his eyes and say, what do you mean by that?  
I said, I'm down and are you happy that I'm down and what?  
I said, no, I'm just letting you know that I can't be down.  
I'm up, I'm up.  
He says, I'm down, I'm down, say I'm up, I'm up.  
Hallelujah.  
There's another thing there.  
He says, now shall lay up gold as dust.  
 Thou shall lay up gold as dust.  
Meaning it will be so much quantity in financial blessing.  
And then also, it's very difficult to keep dust away.  
You know what I'm talking about?  
As you wipe it, come back tomorrow.  
It's there again.  
 Thou shall lay up gold as dust.  
When do you have the most dust in times of dryness?  


  
In times of dryness.  
That's when you have the most dust.  
And God is saying in times of dryness, you will lay up gold as dust.  
The dryer it is.  
 The easier it is for dust.  
It says that we shall lay up good as dust.  
Hallelujah.  
Now, you know, people wonder, are these things possible?  
Emphatically, yes.  
Emphatically, yes.  
See, you function in the water God.  
The Baba says, you will not know when heat comes.  
 You will not know.  
They have to tell you.  
They have to tell you.  
They have to tell you.  
You will not know.  
They have to tell you that things are bad outside.  
And you go, really?  
Why?  
Because, I mean, you carry a different atmosphere.  
 You belong in another world.  
Your reasoning is different.  
Your mentality is different.  
And therefore, the things that happen with you are different.  
This is out of your heart are the issues of life.  
Not from around you, but from your spirit.  
The things that happen in your life come from your spirit.  
 See, that's why I teach you the Word of God, because what you have is what you can give.  
If you don't have it inside you, you cannot saturate the atmosphere around you with the blessings of God.  
You can only saturate your life with the blessings of God that you have already received into your spirit.  
The life you live is not what men have set up for you.  
 The condition of your life is not what the nation says.  
It's not what the economic conditions of war dictates.  
The life you live, the conditions of your life, the circumstances of your life will be dictated by the condition of your spirit, the condition of your spirit, your human spirit.  
This is very important.  
 So you have to put the Word of God into your heart, into your spirit, your health.  
You know, people say, oh, I just thank God because he has given us health.  
You know, they act like, I mean, God didn't give us health.  
Where would we be?  
Because they don't know who God is.  
They think God comes from time to time.  
He looks around and says, I give you health.  
 Then he goes to the other one, you, I seize your health.  
You know, so when he sees someone's health, that one just goes.  
And then he chooses, I give you health.  
That's not the way God is.  
Not the kind of God that Jesus pictured for us.  
Not the kind of God that the Bible talks about.  
 He didn't, listen, you didn't come into this word as an accident to God.  
Like, you know, soon as you were born and God started scratching his head like, I don't know how they brought this boy.  
You know?  
Because your parents are worrying and uncles and aunties are worrying about you.  
You think that God is also worrying like I'm tired, I'm tired.  
God is not like that.  
The Bible says that he already has a pen for everybody.  
 But that plan for your life only begins when you're born again.  
Until you're born again, he cannot carry out his plan in your life.  
He can't.  
You don't plan for your neighbor's kids, do you?  
You plan for your own kids.  
No matter how you like your neighbor's kids.  
You don't plan their future.  
You plan the future of your own kids, not your neighbor's kids.  
 That's the way God is.  
He plans for His children.  
After you've given your heart to Christ, glory to God, He takes responsibility for your life.  
And in His, that's teaching, that's why He sent you the Holy Spirit.  
So your greatest asset, why you're here in this world, is the Holy Spirit.  
 He will teach you the Bible, teach you the Word of God.  
He will lead and guide you.  
He will strengthen you such that there's no weakness in your life.  
He will comfort you.  
Remind you of things that you have learned.  
Bring you the presence of the Father, the presence of Jesus.  
Guide you in prayer.  
Help you understand the Word of God.  
Show you the future.  
 Amazing, amazing.  
How can you lose?  
How can you fail when you have God inside you?  
The God in you is the Holy Spirit.  
Do you hear me?  
So he teaches you, if you listen to him, he'll guide you.  
But most people don't have time to listen to God.  
They just jump up.  
 God, I thank you.  
Plus God, man was devil, image.  
So, the way they're trousers and they're clothes and they're whoring off the work.  
You know, the way you see people whoring every day, you wonder where they're going.  
No, just go to the bridge and look.  
Masses of people are just going, choo, choo, choo.  
And why these are going?  
All of us are just going like that.  
Brushing themselves, you know.  
 They're in, they're out.  
They're in, they're out.  
They're in, they're out.  
Exodos to the north.  
Exodos to the south.  
Moving like that.  
Like ants.  
No.  
Just getting an airplane fly a little bit low and look down over Legos.  
And you say, yeah?  
Oh, why?  


  
 People are, listen, your life today is a result of the words you heard yesterday.  
In other words, you will not be different from the words that you are taught.  
Your life would take on the character of what you have heard.  
Are you listening?  
Every man is a picture of what he has been taught.  
 Your life is a revelation.  
It is not what your father said or your mother said when you were born.  
No, it's what you have heard and repeated in your life.  
The imagination that you have, based on all that you have been told, everything you listen to, everything you watch, these are your teachers.  
 And I've told you, don't spend too much time on CNN and BBC and CO.  
Because all you can do after listening to them is to tell the story.  
So you are every broadcaster.  
You just listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.  
Very good to your friends.  
Did you watch New York City?  
That's all.  
You can't change anything.  
Just be looking.  
You can't change anything.  
 Australia.  
Hey!  


  
That's all you can do.  
You just be looking at them.  
So you gotta do a game.  
What is all these?  
So Obama.  
That's all you can do.  
You can change anything just by watching.  
If you become a player, there'll be a difference.  
 What are you going to do?  
That'll make a difference.  
That's what matters.  
What are you going to do?  
That'll make a difference.  
What are you going to do?  
Whether you're a sportsman, a politician, a lawyer, a doctor, a trader, what are you going to do?  
That will be different.  
That's what counts.  
 That's what counts.  
Hallelujah.  
Let's assume you were 72 years old.  
80 years old.  
What are you going to do?  
That'll be different.  
I'm just going to sit down and say, well, you know, close up to where I'm going, that where I'm coming from.  
Is that all you're going to say?  
No!  
You see, the time you have,  
 Use it.  
Glory.  
Logos kosie la in esto credo.  
Huh?  
You see, what's that?  
Kiva under degasos.  
Shoframando lo gos que japara.  
La wrongos que ver acto stira.  
Okay, you want, write that down, can you?  
 Huh?  
Gazella Mondo?  
Rakto Carodiga?  
You want to write that down?  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
He said, what did you say?  
I'll tell you in a moment.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
He says, hearing is a gift.  
 Hearing is a gift that I've given you, for there are those that cannot hear.  
And when you hear my word, and I speak to you, receive it from your ear into your spirit.  
And from your spirit, put it to work, and act accordingly, for your hearing is different from the hearing of others.  
That's what the spirit said.  
Hallelujah.  
 He said, do you want to hear?  
Do you want to hear?  
Do you want to hear?  
That's what he said.  
He said, do you want to hear?  
And I think our answer is yes.  
Amen?  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Our answer is yes.  
I want to hear, glory to God.  
Hearing is a gift.  
That means hearing God is a gift.  
Everybody doesn't hear God.  
But every child of God  
 He's anointed to hear God.  
You can tell God is talking to your spirit.  
He said, my sheep know my voice.  
A stranger's voice, they will not follow.  
Hallelujah.  
You still there?  
Say this with me.  
I'm a blessing.  
Are you?  
Sit again.  
Say, I am a blessing.  
 Think of it for a moment.  
Let's say it again.  
I am a blessing.  
I'm not sure you got that.  
Do you know what it is to be a blessing?  
Say, I am an advantage to the world.  


  
 The thing about the guys is, I just want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I want to die, I  
 Glory to God.  
Turn to the book of Isaiah chapter number one.  
Isaiah chapter number one.  
You there?  
Okay.  
How many of you have a copy of the living Bible?  
TLB.  
You got living Bible?  
All right.  
I want somebody to read it for me.  
I have it up here, but I want to hear from yours.  
All right.  
Read for me verse 19.  
 Verse 19 he says, if you will only let me help you, if you will only obey, then I will make you rich.  


  
So somebody said, David prayed the prayer.  
Oh God, David, King David.  
Oh God.  
 Don't give me riches so that I will not become too proud.  
And please, don't give me poverty so I will not steal.  
Put me in the middle.  
Okay, okay, okay.  
Who said it?  
David!  
David!  
Was David average?  
I just want to be average.  
The David who prayed that prayer was the average?  
King David!  
Nobody said he should be too rich.  
 Just be rich.  


  
No, why should anybody be angry about what I said?  
The fellow is not yet rich.  
He's already angry.  
Why should anybody be angry about that?  
We read it from a Bible very far away.  
 Not from my own, they say, we don't know the kind of Bible verse of Christ uses.  
Somebody else brought the same Bible to church this morning.  
If you will only let me help you.  
If you will only obey, only help, ayah, ayah.  
Let me help you.  
Listen, listen, he said, if you will only let me help you.  
That means God wants to help, but some people don't let him.  
 He said, if you will only let me help you.  
No, you are struggling.  
Meanwhile, you're praying, but you're struggling by yourself.  
If you will only let me help you.  
He said, if you will only obey, just I will make you reach.  
God never makes a promise that he has not already fulfilled.  


  
 What will it take you to let him help you?  
What should it take you?  
Listen, don't look at yourself from where you are.  
Start by thinking of the things that God has done in your life before now.  
That you couldn't have done by your own wisdom or ability.  
Then give him glory.  
And then say to him, Lord, you who did that for me?  
 I know you can do this in my life.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Glory to God.  
Turn to some one, one, two.  
And I want you to read from verse one to verse three.  
One, two, go.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Listen to that, he said, blessed is the man that ferret the Lord, that delighted greatly in his commandments.  
The man that ferret the Lord and the lights greatly in his commandments.  
In his word, that is,  
 He says, blessed is the man that ferret the Lord, that delighted greatly, not just that delights, but greatly in his commandments.  


  
Read from verse two.  


  
 Thank you.  
His seed shall be mighty upon earth.  
The generation of the upright shall be blessed.  


  
Wealth and riches shall be in his house.  
And his righteousness endured forever.  
 So you see, wealth reaches and righteousness along together.  
You say, well, if you're rich, you may not be righteous.  
That's not true.  
Look at it here.  
Wealth and riches shall be in his house.  
And his righteousness endure it forever.  


  
 God, you gotta understand this.  
You see, a lot of Christians don't understand it because many of them have been taught wrong.  
God loves for his children to be rich.  
He loves it.  
Now, your observation  
 of the lives of many Christians may not say so.  
The lives of many Christians seem to show that God doesn't want many of them to be rich because the few of them that are rich.  
So there's a lot of them that are not rich.  
 It's because there are few of them that have accepted the word as it is.  
Now, there's a difference between a rich man becoming a Christian.  
That's not what I'm talking about.  
I'm talking about someone who has been a Christian growing in the Word of God to become rich.  
There are two different things.  
 They're two different things.  
One might have been rich and then in that condition of wealth given his life to Christ.  
That's great.  
That's beautiful.  
But I'm referring here to those who, through the principles of the Word of God, became rich.  
 God delights in that, because it's the proof of His Word in their lives.  
He loves to see it happen.  
He loves to see it happen.  
There are many Christians around the world, but too many of them have never been taught accurately  
 in the Word of God.  
And so many don't know how to apply it.  
Some are learning and stumbling with it, trying and trying and hoping will work out.  
Yet there are those who have discovered the reality of this and are walking in the light of it.  
God planned for all of us who know him  
 to be rich.  
And he also planned that anyone who wouldn't care about being rich should be able to make others rich, but should know that he is rich and have the ability to make others rich, even if he kept nothing for himself.  
In other words, even if you had no  
 financial accumulation, no material belonging.  
It should make no difference to the state of your spirit.  
You still should be able to help other people to be rich in spite of your condition.  
He doesn't want you to be in a sorry condition, in a beggarly condition.  
 But if you choose to be, which is all right, because there are many things that can make you go without, don't forget that, there are many things that can make you go without.  
And at certain times, have nothing.  
But that should not change the condition of your spirit.  
And the ability that he has put within you to work in such dominion over circumstances,  
 All right?  
So you would never really be like the other fellow who's got nothing.  
You get it?  
This is very important.  
It's very important.  
And it's got nothing to do with where you live.  
Nothing to do with where you live.  
With what nation you live in,  
 Hello.  
Now, in wonderful God said, this year, 2009, you will increase in fortunes.  
Now, turn to the book of Amos.  
The book of Amos in chapter number three.  
 Oh, glory to God.  
Read verse number seven for me.  


  
Read it again.  


  
 Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealed his secret unto his servants of prophets.  
If you read the new translations or some other translations, he would say, the Lord God will do nothing without revealing his secret to his servants of prophets.  
In other words, he reveals his plans to his servants.  
 He reveals his plans.  
And why is it that at the beginning of the year like that, the Lord tells us what he plans to do for us and with us and through us during the year?  
Why does he tell us?  
So that we  
 can walk in the light of it and have faith for it and then play our part so that his own part can be fulfilled in our lives.  
He always would like us to position ourselves in such a way that we can receive that which he has predetermined for us.  
Hallelujah.  
 So that's what he's saying.  
So if the Lord says in 2009, there will be increase in fortunes.  
Then you say glory to God.  
It means that God already has it planned out.  
So all I need is to locate myself in the plains and purposes of God so that I can have God's word fulfilled in my life.  
Amen.  
So God  
 Authors this.  
He's behind riches and wealth.  


  
Ecclesiastes.  
Have you seen it?  
Read verse 19.  
Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 5 and verse 19.  


  
 Every man also to whom God had given riches and wealth and had given him power to eat thereof and to take his passion and to rejoice in his labor.  
This is the gift of God.  
Every man also to whom God had given riches and wealth.  
So God gives riches and wealth.  
Glory to God.  
Second chronicle is in chapter number one.  
 Second chronicle is chapter number one.  
Have you seen it?  
Read verse 11.  
Want to go.  


  
 God said that Solomon didn't ask for riches and wealth.  
He didn't ask.  
 He asked for wisdom and knowledge.  
He didn't ask.  
The man didn't ask for riches and wealth.  
And yet God said, let's read, let's read verse 12 again.  
He said, wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee.  
 What the man asked?  
He said, I've given you that.  
Then he says, and I will give thee riches and wealth and honor like nobody ever had.  


  
God said, it's how I'll give it to you.  


  
So I'll give it to you.  
 I'll give it to you.  
I will give thee riches and wealth and honor such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall thee any after thee have the like.  


  
 Thank you Lord Jesus David had they've had the sins of this he understood this done to first chronicles job the number 29 first chronicles job number 29 Are you there?  
All right, let's read from verse 10  
 Read, want to go.  


  
Gone.  


  
 Twelve.  


  
Wow.  
See, David knew it.  
 So here in his presence, the verse 12, both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reignest over all, and in thine handest power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great unto gifts, trying unto all.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Ah, yeah, yeah.  


  
 Can you take this?  
Can you show you can take this?  
He said riches in honor come from God.  
And that it is in his power to make great.  
And it gives strength.  
Turn to Ecclesiastes chapter number six.  
I want you to show you something.  
 please yes it's chapter number six and we are reading from verse one read from verse one  


  
 Okay, listen to this.  
Now, did you read verse two?  
Or you read only verse one, verses one and two.  
It says, there is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men.  
 a man to whom God has given riches, wealth and honor, so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires.  
Yet God give it him not power to eat thereof.  
What a stranger it is.  
This is vanity and it is an evil disease.  


  
No, let me give you an example.  
 Here's a man that has a large company, employed thousands of workers.  
And he has a large estate.  
He's got a lot of money in the bank.  
So the bank is trading with his money and employing people and making a lot of bucks.  
So people are enjoying everywhere.  
He's got lots of workers.  
 And it's been thousands of people.  
But he is not well.  
You get it?  
He is not well.  
So he is unable to enjoy all these things.  
But he has them.  
And people are using them.  
People are employed and, you know, people are making money and having a nice life from.  
So, but he is known to own all these things.  
 Well, God said he doesn't have the health to enjoy them.  


  
But he has the big name that he owns all these companies.  


  
What did he say it is?  
Vanity and an evil disease.  
Then he said it is common among men.  
To different degrees.  
 to different degrees.  
It's common among men.  
This is true.  


  
It's common.  


  
Many people don't think.  
They just do things, what they don't think.  
 How many of you here have money in the bank?  
Let's see you.  
Raise your hand.  
I mean, you have some money in the bank.  
Raise your hand like this.  
Say, thank you, Jesus.  
I have money in the bank.  
OK, look around and see others who have money in the bank.  
Raise your hand again.  
Look around.  
See all the hands that have money in the bank.  
OK.  
I have a question.  
Does the bank have a firm where they pluck money?  
No, there must be a firm.  


  
 Oh, dear Lord Jesus.  
No, talk to me.  
All of you that have money in the bank.  
Does the bank have a farm where they pluck money?  
So every time you have, you come for your money, they quickly go and pluck money and give you.  
Is that what happens?  
Okay, where do these banks build all these tall buildings they build?  
Whose money from the farm, isn't it?  
 Is it from the farm?  
From all your money.  


  
All the money you put there.  
That's what they use in building all those big buildings and in employing all those people they put extraordinary salaries and so everybody wants to walk in the bank.  
 Why?  
Because your money is there.  
That's where you kept it.  
Now you put that money there.  
You don't care what you get out of it.  
Most people have their money in current accounts.  
Most people and the bank is smart enough to know that most people don't have any sense.  
Smart guys.  
 So, you have money in there, and they're glad.  
You don't care about what you get or whether you don't get anything.  
But those guys went to school to know what to do with your money when you bring it.  
 They went to school for that.  
To find out what to do with your money when you bring it.  
Not what to do with your money for you.  
No, you be kidding yourself.  
They went to school to make the money for you, you're joking.  
They went to school to know what to do with your money when you bring it.  
And try to reduce your interest as much as possible.  


  
 No, put the money there.  
I'm smiling.  
I have money in the bank.  
Keep it there.  
The smallest interest is the one that comes from your bank.  


  
That is the dumbest thing to do with your money.  
 if you want gains on the money.  
That's the dumbest thing to do.  
Keep it there.  
How many of you ever read documents of the various kinds of products that the bank offers?  
Not the flyer they give you, not the flyer.  
 the products of the bank.  
How many of you ever asked for a document from the bank to read all the options for the various kinds of products they have so you would know what to do with your money?  
How many of you?  
Look around so you can know how many.  
Can you see it?  
 No, this is just here.  
Imagine throughout the country.  
Millions of people who put their money in the bank.  
And I went in like this, and they said, they said, they said, they will give you 5%.  
They said, they said, they said, they said.  
No, they said, who said?  
And that's what they said.  
Okay, who said it?  
They said so.  
Who is they?  
You know, it's like what we do all the time.  
We enter a plane.  
 and say, they said they're going to London.  
We never ask, they said, get 63, everybody.  
And nicely detailed, welcome.  
You never ask the question.  
Fasten your seat belts.  
Did anybody ever ask you, what did they say they're going?  
Nobody, everybody assumes that somebody out there  
 gave them the right direction.  
Somebody was supposed to do it.  
He was someone's job.  
So we all entered and sat down and listened to all the instructions and followed all the instructions faithfully.  
Then we took off.  
Did you ever see the pilot's face?  
No.  
He just had his voice.  
He said he's the pilot.  
John Smith.  
And that in six hours' time, you would get to London.  
 You just said, OK.  
You never looked out the window and said, is this direction to London?  


  
You never checked.  
Did you look out the window when you were up there to know whether this was a true direction to London?  
No, look at the fate we have in systems and structures.  
When I look at the loss of money,  
 throughout the world, by many people and companies and governments, I don't feel sorry for them.  
Because people don't think.  
And they keep making the same mistakes, decade after decade, the same errors, asking no questions.  
And they come back and say, they don't know why.  


  
 Even if you heard now that the bank in which you lodged some money has shut down, there are many who wouldn't ask questions.  
Just say, why now?  
Why?  
They'll be asking in their house.  
Why?  
What's wrong with all these people now?  
Why is all this?  
They won't go to the bank.  
They say, why is all this?  
This is very bad.  
They have money there.  
They won't go.  
They don't want to ask any question.  
 They'll be looking at those who are there on television.  
Some 500 people in front of the bank, troubling the bankers.  
They'll say, have money there too.  
I can't understand.  
This is very bad.  
You'll be complaining at home.  
The money is gone.  


  
Do you want to multiply wealth?  
Do you want to increase riches?  
 Then you must be ready to listen to God.  
God is smart.  
He's smart.  
He knows what you should do.  
Don't forget the banking system started at a particular time in history.  
He was not always there.  
And before the banking system started, there were rich men and rich women.  
There were men and women of wealth.  
 You have to understand, many of you, including many of your bankers, you have never studied the history of the financial system of the world.  
I know you haven't, you just went to work in the bank.  
For many of you have never studied it.  
If you get to understand the history of the financial system of the world, you'd realize that really,  
 It is not needed for your wealth.  
Are you following me?  
So God is smarter than that.  
He's smarter than that.  
There are systems and structures in the world to help stabilize human societies.  
 to help organize human societies.  


  
And one of those structures is the banking system.  


  
It's like keeping your money, keeping money as though, you know, people like keep their money, okay?  
When  
 Cash crashes, which it will happen, it's a matter of time.  
In many countries today, you can't use cash to make any purchases.  
In many countries, you can't use cash.  
Where are you from?  
When you come with cash, it's like, where are you from?  
Something wrong with you?  
Use your card.  
 Okay, well, you now keep your cash.  
Since nobody's collecting cash from you.  
You go to the shop, nobody's taking your cash.  
You go to the bank, they say, how did you get it?  
So, keeping your cash will soon become stupid.  
Are you following this?  
You're looking at the system of the world.  
After a while,  
 they will complain of the card.  
Since it can be stolen, it can be broken.  
You see it?  
And many people can cheat you by getting your details.  
So they're going to graduate from there to another system where they will put the chip in your body  
 That's what the Bible says.  
And they're planning it.  
They've already demonstrated it.  
It's one of the signs of the last days.  
So instead of having that microchip in your card, it is going to be in your body.  
So as you enter the bank, you wouldn't have to give your name as you enter.  
 The waiter says, Mr. Fermion and Nuga, you're welcome.  
And this is in Australia.  
Fermion and Nuga, they know you.  


  
No, just imagine.  
You arrived here, put in Canada, Bimbo, Yaleke.  
Welcome.  
You say, how did you know me?  
Because the moment you got there,  
 The sign was red.  
Everywhere you go, because it's in your body.  
So you don't have to carry any card.  
They can tell you everywhere you've been.  
And everything you bought.  
Because now, no more card, you just show up.  
And it reads all your details.  
 And all the little things you bought here and there, you can tell you.  
You say, how are we making sure?  
How are you going to make sure?  
Make sure what?  
That doesn't happen?  
Then, in that case, you have to find some remote village where only you will be farming.  
Only you will be farming there.  
That is where you eat.  
 You do your boho each day.  
Live there.  
Then go to everywhere else.  
When you want lunch, go back there.  
To that village.  
That's the only place you will live if you want to hide from the system.  
So all of that is changing.  
How can you multiply your wealth?  
 If God says he's going to increase it, what does he do to make sure that happens?  
God is a spirit.  
He's not going to pour you out money from heaven like that.  
No, but there's something he will give you.  
Glory to God.  
Are you still there?  
How many of you, before you took money to the bank, you asked the Lord what to do with it?  
Not many.  
 Not many listen to their spirit.  
They just did things because this is a normal thing to do.  
But that is how most people live.  
They do things because that is the normal thing to do.  
So they live in a normal life.  
But the Christian is not a normal person.  
He's not that everyday guy.  
The Bible says about the man that's born again as the wind blew it, where it listed.  
 And thou canst not tell where it's coming from on where it goes.  
He says, so is everyone that's born of the Spirit.  
He's a mystery.  
The one that's born of the Spirit is a mystery.  
Like David said, the God had made him a wonder onto many.  
You become a wonder.  
 But how can you be a wonder when you live in the normal life of everybody else?  
You have the same problems.  
You have the same complaints.  
But learn to listen to your spirit.  
Listen inside you.  
Because God gives you guidance in your spirit.  
He gives you guidance in your spirit.  


  
 Solomon was smart.  
Smart.  
How did he know what to ask God for so that God will give him everything?  
How did he know?  
Turn the Proverbs up to four.  
Who wrote the book of Proverbs?  
Come on.  
Again.  
Solomon.  
All right.  
Turn the Proverbs chapter number four.  
 Are you there?  
From verse one, read.  
Again, hear what?  
Listen, listen, Solomon is telling you, hear the instruction of a father.  
How come?  
Listen, you're talking  
 talking about a man who was the wisest man that ever lived until Jesus showed up.  
This was the wisest man in the whole earth.  
Yeah, you should be wise to listen to him.  
The smartest man, the richest man that ever came to planet earth outside of Jesus.  
He writes a book, he pulled full to ignore it.  
 This is a guy that God gave wisdom like nobody hears ever before him or after him.  
Think about that.  
Okay, so let's listen to him now.  
Listen, you're listening to the wisest man that ever came to this world.  
Read verse one again.  
Uh-huh.  
Uh-huh.  
Unattent to what?  
 to know, understanding, going.  


  
I give you what?  
Oh, going.  


  
I was what?  
I was my father's son.  
Do you know what this man is saying?  
How can you say I was my father's son?  
 You can say I was my father's son.  
Except you mean something.  
Now the Hebrew construction is very easy for us to understand when it says I was my father's son.  
How can you say I was my father's son?  
If he was your father, you already did his son.  
But he says no, I was my father's son.  
He didn't say I was David's son.  
I was my father's son.  
What does it mean?  
 He means, I was the adopted son.  
Now, the adopted son here doesn't mean adoption like you take another present son to be your son.  
That's not what he's talking about.  
It meant the one that was raised to become the heir.  
You see that?  
He was the one chosen.  
He wasn't the first son.  
But he was the one that was chosen.  
 and trained to become king.  
So this was different from the others.  
Usually the princes would be given to 2000 governors to be raised, to be in the army, they would be raised like that.  
But this was the one that was raised to become king.  
 Read the story of that family, you get to understand a lot of stuff.  
Because from before he was born, God did say he would be king.  
I hear in this.  
So he was born to be king.  
And David said so too.  
So when his brother tried to cheat him,  
 Adonaija tried to cheat him and tried to proclaim himself king while David was still alive.  
The prophet went to David and said, remember, that's the guy that's supposed to be king, Solomon.  
Adonaija has proclaimed himself king and king David was angry and immediately went on an anointed Solomon king.  
 after his older brother had proclaimed himself king so Solomon knew what he was talking about when he says I was my father's son okay uh-huh read I was my father's son uh-huh he taught me your soul what no no no no no who's this father who's talking about David  
 He taught me also.  
Go on, he taught me also.  


  
Keep my commandments and what?  
Live.  
His older brothers died for not following instruction.  
He told him, keep my commandments and live.  
Go on.  
 David told him, now you can see where he got the understanding from.  
David, his father told him, get wisdom.  
He said, keep my commandments and leave.  
Then he told him, get wisdom.  
Get understanding.  
Uh-huh.  
Uh-huh.  
She shall preserve thee.  
Go on.  


  
 And those are the two things that he asked God for.  
Because his father taught him  
 These were the most important.  
He said, wisdom is the principal thing.  
You know, someone says, I need capital for business.  
The capital you need is wisdom.  
Not what you think it is in Naira or in Dolas.  
You're wrong.  
This was what David was telling Solomon.  
He said, your capital is wisdom.  
He said, wisdom is the principal thing.  
Therefore, get wisdom.  
With all that getting, get understanding.  


  
 So when God showed up in his room and said, Solomon, what do you want me to do for you?  
He said, I've been waiting for you.  
I have many things I wrote down.  
You know, imagine God talking to you tonight.  
He said, Father, I'm so happy that you are finally spoken to me.  
I have many things.  
I don't know where to start from.  
No, that's what you tell God.  
I have many things to ask.  
I don't know where to start from.  
And Father will say, continue.  
 You say, can you just give me a minute to bring my list?  
You say, go and bring it.  
You hurry, I'm going to bring your long list.  
You say, Father, please don't be hungry with me.  
There are many things.  
And you will start.  
Number one, you're telling my business.  
Number two, my house rent.  
Number three, my wife.  
 Number four, my uncle is not feeling very well.  
You will give him a long list.  
And for that we say, you have all of them.  
After having all that, you will still be suffering.  
Why?  
Because you didn't get the principal thing.  
Do you know how many people come to church every day with their list on Sunday?  
 A long list, wanting to see it.  


  
Every Sunday, list, the night before they were writing.  


  
What you need?  
Oh God.  
Oh God.  
 I wish you could understand this.  
I want to tell you.  
We read that God is the one who gives riches, wealth and honor.  
We read it.  
We read it.  
Then he gave it.  
Understand this.  
He gave it to Abraham and his seed.  
He gave it.  
He gave him riches.  
 wealth and honor he gave him to Abraham and his seed.  
Now, David said to Solomon, wisdom is the principle thing.  
Therefore, get wisdom.  
And with all your getting, get understanding.  
How smart.  
Then God said, I have given you.  
 wisdom, knowledge.  
The same Hebrew word is translated understanding.  
Okay.  
He gave it to him.  
Then God said, he didn't ask for riches and wealth, but I've given you.  
Why?  
Because not because God was trying to be magnanimous.  
 Listen to this.  
God was not trying to be nice when he said, though you didn't ask for riches and wealth, I've given you.  
He wasn't trying to be nice.  
It was because it was not possible to separate those things from wisdom.  
It was not possible.  
And God said it so that the men who have faith for them  
 You see that?  
Because if you don't tell him, he may not know.  
So he could have something with him and doesn't know how to use it.  
So God had to tell him.  
You find as you study the scriptures, as you get along in scriptures, you discover that this is all in wisdom.  
Riches and wealth cannot be separated from wisdom.  
Now here's the big thing.  
Finally, the seed of Abraham!  
 arrived on the sin.  
The Bible says he said not unto says as of many, but as of one, unto thy seed, which is Christ, meaning that the promises that were made to Abraham and his seed were actually made to Jesus.  
So he came as the seed of Abraham.  
 Then it was anointed of the Holy Spirit to be Jesus the Christ.  
Galatians chapter three, very quickly now.  
Very quickly now.  
Galatians chapter three, chapter three.  
Read from verse 19.  


  
 I don't know what you are reading.  
Verse 19, step by step, want to go.  
Because of transgressions.  


  
 Mm-hmm.  


  
Go on.  


  
Mm-hmm.  
Hey, the promise, uh-huh, redact.  
 Read it again.  
That the promise?  
The promise by fate of Jesus Christ might be what given to who?  
Then I believe, go on.  


  
Go on.  
Mm-hmm.  
Mm-hmm.  


  
 Uh-huh.  
Uh-huh.  
Yup.  
Uh-huh.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 If ye belong to Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed, and therefore, heirs, heirs of the promise.  
Christ inherited all the blessings of Abraham.  
And if you belong to Christ, you are Abraham's seed.  
 Christ is made.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
First Corinthians chapter one.  
Are you there?  
First Corinthians chapter one.  
Read verse 30.  
Christ is made unto us what?  
Wisdom!  
 Do you understand what this is all about?  
Here's the point that Christ who inherited all the blessing of Abraham has made it sure to all the seed of Abraham in that if you belong to Christ, you are Abraham's seed.  
So the promises that were made to Christ belong to you.  
 Now, God doesn't need to make you reach.  


  
He doesn't need to make you reach.  
He doesn't need to give you power to get well.  
He doesn't need to anymore.  
 You can't ask him for it now.  
You can't ask for God to make you rich now.  
It's useless.  
You know why?  
Because you were born the very heir of all the riches and wealth that he could give when you were born again.  
 to get well, He gave it to you.  
You were born with the right of it.  
You were born with that authority.  
You were born with well untold.  
Now, what you need is to know the Word of God to chart your course.  
It makes no difference whether your job is in the bank or at the gates.  
 You see that?  
You know, people are looking for a good job.  
They're looking for a well-paying job.  
No, it's not that way.  
Look for a job where you can put your best in to serve your generation.  
Where you can make a difference.  
That's what you need.  
The opportunity is to contribute to your world.  
That's what you need.  
Never, you don't need to put money first anymore.  
 Because if it's money, if you do the right thing, you will have money beyond measure.  
Put what I'm sharing with you to test.  
This is real.  
This is real.  
That's all you find when people lose their jobs, they're frustrated, because their hope wasn't their job.  
No, not when you're born again.  
When you're born again, it's different.  
 It's different whether you are cleaning the windows.  
The principle of prosperity is at work in you.  
And your prosperity is not limited.  
Listen, your prosperity is not limited to what, oh, I'll explain this to you.  
What you receive, what you receive from your business or as a salary or whatever it is, what you receive is not the blessing.  
If you live according to that, then you're not living in the blessing.  
 How can you be a man or woman who just eats his seed?  
You live according to seed.  
You eat your seed all the time.  
Only seed.  
You just go to your seed room and set it in your seed.  
Like the fellow who uses his salary, like some of you, you've done that.  
Use your salary to buy a car.  
It's wrong.  
Nobody ever told you.  
And the bank, people that market it to you.  
 We can give you a car, you can pay over 12 months.  
Hi!  
New idea, I can buy a new car and pay over 12 months.  
So, you use your salary to buy a new car, your salary.  
That's poverty.  
Going somewhere to happen.  
Because nobody ever taught you.  
You don't use your salary to buy a car on credit.  
That's poverty.  
 So now, you're on your car, you're on your house.  
No, no, because you think it's a new kind of prosperity.  
But every month, they are collecting money from you from this side, from this side, from this side.  
By the time you get anything, if you do, it's so small.  
You are still ready to use that small one to buy fridge on credits.  
So this one now, 500 every month is going out.  
 The other one, they take 2000 from you every month.  
Another one, they take 10,000 from you every month.  
They've collected your salary.  
You use, you spread your salary to buy something on credit.  
Because nobody ever taught you.  
You don't use your salary to buy things on credit.  
You see that?  
No, that's not what you do.  
 Well, somebody say hallelujah!  
Say upon my way!  
Glory to God!  
Don darabaga satalamadi.  
Worship the Lord, glorify His holy name.
