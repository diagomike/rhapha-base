title: An Understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 Your knowledge of God will determine the quality of your life.  
And there's no knowledge of God without His words.  
So your knowledge of God depends on your knowledge of His word.  
This insightful message by Pastor Chris was an eye-opener to all those who listened, as it brought about a greater understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
One of the things you've got to learn to do is to encourage the work of the spirit of God being in your life.  
 If you don't encourage it, you will not experience it.  
The man of God inspired, instructed, and most definitely enlightened everyone about the place of the Holy Spirit in our understanding of the gospel.  
 I want to get you conscious of the Holy Spirit until you are so conscious that you're so conscious, so conscious that you see less of your humanity and see more of your divinity.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
An understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ, you will be transformed as you listen.  


  
 Praise my soul, the King of heaven to His feet, I'm trained to pray.  
Rise and heal, restore, for He even would like  
 He sprays, you sing.  
I do, you warn.  
I sing your heart.  
Let me move, I warn a friend.  
Silly, healthy.  
 Lord, it will be we need to be dead Hallelujah, what a single hallelujah, what a threat  
 Singing every evening, darling We will be with me to begin Hallelujah, what a Savior, Hallelujah, what a friend!  
 Sammy, help me in the morning Will we wake me to the end?  
Hallelujah, what a sicker I've been who I want a friend  
 We'll be happy with the love We'll be happy to the end  


  
 Sing your hallelujah, what a friend.  
Singing, help me, be in love.  
And you'll be with me too.  
 One more time.  


  
 I do, I want to sing your part.  
I do, I want a friend.  
Sing, be fair.  
Sing, be fair.  
Sing, be fair.  
Sing, be fair.  
Sing, be fair.  


  
 What a save you.  
What a friend.  
What a friend.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Hello.  
I thought about something yesterday  
 Oh, what should I tell you so many things?  
Okay, let me take the first one.  
Just a little, you know, sometimes you have to work on your theology so that you have a clearer picture of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
 The quality of your life depends on your knowledge.  
Your knowledge of God will determine the quality of your life.  
And there's no knowledge of God without his word.  
So your knowledge of God depends on your knowledge of his word, because God and his word are one.  
His word is his revelation.  


  
 Let me pick just this simple stuff here.  
First Peter chapter, chapter 2.  


  
 You know, there are things we don't know are important because sometimes those who tell us they're not important, but that also tells us why the quality of their life is where it is.  
I hear me.  
Yeah.  
Depends on where you want to be.  
It's really, really up to you.  
 First Peter chapter 2, verse 24, can you all ready for me?  
Want to go.  
Again.  


  
 who his own self.  
But as sayings, and his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sayings, should live under righteousness by whose stripes.  
Say it again.  
Turn to chapter one.  
Chapter one, everyone.  


  
 Have you seen it?  
Read from verse 1.  


  
 Who is he writing to?  
Read again.  
No, you haven't found out.  
Look into your Bible.  
Look at it.  
Examine it.  
Tell me who is writing to.  
What?  
 Who?  
Have you forgotten that Peter was the apostle to the circumcision?  
That means to the Jews.  
And when the persecution broke out, they ran out of the place and were scattered all over the realm.  
So he particularly addressed  
 His message to Jewish Christians.  
Do you get that now?  
That's why we call them strangers scattered abroad because they went out.  
They're strangers in those lands.  
They've gone out of Israel, you see.  
He wasn't writing to every Christian.  
He was writing to Jewish Christians.  
He felt a responsibility toward them.  
 and he addressed this message to them.  
Now, when you hold that in your mind, when you hold that in your mind, you think of this scripture, let's go back to First Spirit Chapter 2, and we will take it from the  
 21st verse so that we can put it in perspective.  
For even here on to where he called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that he should follow his steps, who did no sin.  
Neither was God found in his mouth, who when he was revived, revived not again, when he suffered, he threatened not.  
But committed himself to him that judged it righteously.  
 who his own self.  
There are scenes in his own body on the tree that we being dead descends to live on the righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed.  
Then he goes, for ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned onto the shepherd and bishop of your souls.  
Wow.  
By whose stripes he says you were healed.  
 Great.  
Now, this is one of the scriptures that we use all around the world to claim our healing.  
In reality, it's wrong.  


  
But, you know, we can't tell too many people that  
 Because, I mean, they're going to wait till the rapture to change it.  
And I'm not asking anybody to change it, but I'm trying to let you know that the mentality, your knowledge or lack of knowledge will determine the quality of your life.  
Healing here.  
Healing here.  
He says, by whose stripes, ye were healed.  
 And the accurate teaching, the church has a beautiful teaching on it.  
I do.  
But there's more.  
There's more to it.  
And that teaching is about Isaiah, seeing it ahead and saying, by whose stripes he are here.  
And then it happens.  
And then Peter looks back at the cross and says, by whose stripes he will hear.  
But here's what I want to tell you.  
 He was talking to the Jews.  
He wasn't talking to every Christian.  
And at this moment in time, Peter hadn't come to completely grasp the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
You say, Peter, the Pope?  
Yes.  
 In his second epistle, for the first time, he uses the same term that Paul used in the knowledge of God.  
Throughout the first epistle, he never used the term epignosis.  
The accurate and full knowledge of Christ.  
He never used it.  
He used it first time in his second epistle.  
 And at the conclusion of his second episode, he mentions that there are things in the writings of Paul, he called the writings of Paul's scripture.  


  
And he said there are things in the writings of Paul, particularly referring to the end of time.  
 Who he says, Paul had written things that are difficult to understand.  
So many of the unlearned rest.  


  
Now, what am I trying to say about that?  
Just to tell you, revelation is progressive.  
And at this time, he was addressing the Jews.  
He hadn't brought the rest of them in.  
 and the church at this time hadn't come to completely understand the works of Christ and all that he came to do.  
If you want to understand this, you go into the Book of Acts and you find that the first 15 chapters of the Book of Acts, you're dealing with the baby church.  
So much that they know.  
So much that they don't understand.  
They even almost persecuted Peter  
 for going into the house of Cornelius, the Roman sent him.  
And even when Peter went to the Gentile Christians and ate with them.  
And James sent others, James to the pastor of the Jewish church in Jerusalem.  
When the came, when the messengers of James  
 Pastor of the Jewish church came and Peter saw them while he was eating with Gentile Christians.  
He quickly stopped and washed his hands.  
He didn't want them to find him eating with them because he remembered what happened after he went to the house of Cornelius.  
They almost suspended him.  
It is communicated here.  
 They said, you went into the house of your own circumcised.  
He had to plead his case.  
He said, the spirit bit me go.  
He had to explain his revelation, the vision that he had.  
And they gave him last money.  
So when he showed up in a gentile home and he was eating there and saw James' disciples immediately he stopped.  
But Paul was there.  
And Paul said,  
 He said to Peter, this is wrong.  
And he preached a message to him.  
You can read all of this in Galatians chapter 1 and into chapter 2.  
He reprimanded him.  
He said, what you've done is wrong.  
So you can understand the kind of revelation that the man had.  
But here's what I'm saying.  
Where did the church begin?  
 Where did the church begin?  
At the cross, before the cross, after the cross, where?  
You all don't look at me like that.  
Come on, tell me something.  
You know the answer.  
Where was it?  
Only those at the front answer me.  
Second rule, tell me something before I ask you all to stand up.  
 After the cross, yes.  
After the cross.  


  
By whose stripes you were healed, there was no church.  


  
So who were those that were healed by his stripes, the Jews?  
They were the ones under the covenant  
 The covenant of healing was for the Jewish church, the Old Testament church.  
Okay?  
They had the covenant of healing.  
And so at the cross, he saved them.  
At the cross, he redeemed them.  
At the cross.  
The stripes, the church, as Bible scholars will tell you, they're two thinkings they've got about this.  
 the interpretation of the straps because on the one hand  
 A school of thought says that the stripes refer to these beatings that he had from the Romans.  
And they even go on to tell us that the Romans gave 39 stripes, okay?  
And referring to what Paul says, 40 stripes received I, saved one.  
 And that is very controversial because did he mean that he received 40 stripes except one on one occasion where he was given more or less?  
Or did he mean that he received 39 stripes, meaning 40 stripes minus one?  
That is controversial.  
Different translations would say different things.  
Okay, so the church  
 A school of thought holds to that that has got to do with these stripes.  
And I remember years ago, they thought that there were 39 major diseases, but since then we found out more.  
Okay.  
So that's one school of thought.  
The other school of thought goes into the book of Isaiah and they say, well,  
 The stripe really is one debt-dealing blow.  
It doesn't really say stripes in the plural.  
It says stripe, which means one debt-dealing blow.  
And it doesn't mean the whip.  
It means of crushing blow on him, meaning that God condemned him and killed him.  
Again, that doesn't make a lot of spiritual sense.  
And because he says that God killed him.  
 See, before man could kill him, God had to kill him.  
So the Bible shows us, when you read in Isaiah chapter 53, read verses 8, 9, and 10, you'd find that he tells us that Jesus died to death.  
Which means, because he uses the word death in plural.  
 It definitely refers to a plurality of death.  
And according to the Bible, there are three deaths.  
And it couldn't have died the last one at that time.  
The first death is the spiritual death, which is separation from God.  
The second one is the physical death.  
The third one is the second death, which is in the lake of fire.  
 And Burm's.  
How are you getting this?  
Yes.  
OK.  
So we come back to this first video chapter 2, verse 24, because we've been quoting it a long time.  
It's all in all the Christian books.  
Even in some of our books, I'm very careful, because I try to ensure, don't go too far from when it's presentable and acceptable, I leave it.  
But when it can be misleading, I say no.  
 shouldn't be.  
Because the things in the church, we may never be able to change, okay?  
But you can know the truth for your own liberty.  
I hear it.  
For your own liberty.  
I mean, we haven't even said so much yet, and some are being persecuted that there's heresy in the, in the, in the rhapsody.  
What if I throw this inside?  
 They say, oh, but this is real.  
He says, but who straps?  
He wear heels.  
The church came at his resurrection.  
How are you following this?  
So when Jesus came out, the head of the church was the first one.  
His body came when the Holy Spirit came.  
So that's it.  
 So we are His body.  
He is the head.  
The head and the body are the same, called Christ.  
After His resurrection, He was the only one with that new life because we needed to have the Holy Spirit produce that life in human beings.  
And on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came  
 And what was the Holy Spirit came?  
The church came into being.  
The body came into being.  
So we were not there when this healing took place.  
This healing was for the Jews.  
Okay, you say, what about the church then?  
And I'll tell you.  
The church has a self-healing mechanism.  
 The church was not healed by God.  
The church has a self-healing mechanism.  


  
What the church received is eternal life.  
Eternal life does not need healing.  
 If you have eternal life, it doesn't matter what attacks you have in your body or in any system of your body.  
If you will stay up the gift of God, the life of God in your spirits, your whole body will be vitalized.  
He said, if the spirit of him that raised our Christ from the dead lives in you, he will vitalize your mother body.  


  
 It doesn't matter what happens.  


  
This spirit in you is life-generating.  
The first man Adam was what?  
A living soul.  
The second Adam.  
A life-giving spirit.  
And we are not born after the first Adam.  
We are born after the second Adam.  
 You have a life-giving spirit.  


  
So if anything ever happens to your body, generate it, produce the life.  
Doesn't matter that something was cut out, you can reproduce it.  
Are you hearing me?  
 So you were not healed at the cross before the cross.  
You were never healed.  
You were given a life that's greater than healing.  


  
As long as you're a baby in Christ, you will need healing.  
When you come to maturity, you will give up childish things.  
You won't be sick in healing.  
La Maca said,  


  
 I got the life of God in me.  
I'll never be sick.  
And if you used to get sick, you'd say, I'll never be sick again.  
Because I have the life of Christ in me.  
Hallelujah.  
Did you catch that word?  
Simple reality.  
 You know, it's an understanding of the gospel of Christ and understanding.  
And it's not something that you have in your head.  
It's something in your spirit, the knowledge of Christ.  
Did you notice what we read yesterday?  
He said, he prayed to God that he would grant you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.  
He wants you to know Christ.  
He wants you to know what Christ came to do.  
Hallelujah.  
 He says, of God, little children, didn't have overcome them.  
When he tells you, greater is either is in you.  
What comes to your mind?  
What do you think?  
He doesn't say, greater is either is with you, which is wonderful.  
But he says, that is in you.  
He's in you.  
He says, you are off guard.  
 So you're from him.  


  
And actually, actually, if you look down the word where he translates of God for you, it also reads from God.  
Glory to God.  
There's an anointing on you.  


  
 One of the things you've got to learn to do is to encourage the work of the Spirit of God in your life.  
If you don't encourage it, you will not experience it.  
Encourage the work of the Spirit of God in your life.  
I found out that what many, many Christians need the most is a simple word, direction.  
 Oh, how many don't know what decisions to make?  
How many find themselves in the Quagmire?  
On shore of what steps to take?  
And even when they pray, they're not sure when God is talking to them.  
Many times they're afraid of making mistakes.  
So they're concerned.  
 And so the brain, incidentally, the more they pray like that, the deeper they get into unbelief.  
If you want to know the voice of God more clearly, it's very simple.  
Study his word.  
Study his word.  
Don't use your own mind, you see, to create human wisdom.  
Study his word.  
 Have your focus on his word.  
The Bible says that the scriptures were given to make you wise unto salvation.  
That means you be made wise in the totality of the workings of God.  
That's what he calls salvation.  
See, which means your wisdom will not be the wisdom of this world, but the wisdom that is from God that saves men's lives.  
Hallelujah.  
And that brings God glory.  
 Wise unto salvation.  
So refers to the end of salvation.  
So the scriptures will make you wise.  
The more you study the word, the wiser you become.  
The smarter you become.  
And man cannot resist your wisdom.  
Because you speak from beyond this world.  
They can't understand you.  
 But the thing is, every time you speak, oh, they can't forget what you said.  
You become a problem solver.  
A solution bringer.  
That's it with you.  
That's your life.  
Say, I'm a problem solver.  
I'm a solution bringer.  
I'm an answer.  
 Hallelujah.  
Oh, Gloria, God, I like that.  
Think about it.  
You want an answer.  
You're an answer.  
Think about it.  
You know, you're coming.  
You're walking into a place.  
The answer is coming because you are coming.  
Say, I'm an answer from God.  
Everywhere I go, I'm an answer from God.  
 Always the need me.  
Because I'm an answer from God.  
I want you to think about this.  
You've got to catch this.  
Think about it.  
Think about it.  
Meditate on it for a second.  
Think about it.  
We're talking about you.  
We're not dealing with Peter, James, and John.  
Now we're talking about you.  
This is your day.  
We're talking about you.  
Think about it.  
I'm an answer.  
You know, years ago,  
 Several years ago, 1985, to be precise, I wrote in my diary, I'm an answer to the cry of millions.  
You see, I wrote a long time ago.  
Where were you in 1985?  
What were you doing?  
I realized that, you know, years ago, at that time that I was an answer.  
That was my consciousness.  
That was my sunesis.  
 My understanding of the Word of God, that I would write it down and say it again and again to myself, I'm an answer.  
I was born as an answer to the cry of millions.  
Yeah.  
You've got to let it get into your spirit.  
Let it get into your spirit.  
Jesus did not come for nothing.  
 Did you hear that?  
He didn't come for nothing.  
Let can I reach them into you from the Book of Galatians?  
Let's go there.  
Galatians chapter 2.  
You will like this one.  


  
 Oh, you know, there's some scriptures here.  
As I read, when I read these things, I cry.  
I said, oh, Sabaka I eat against all gradest dishes.  
Even now, I have to be patient and hold myself to be able to share with you.  
Because just to think these words, I get stared in my spirit.  
Let me read it to you.  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
From verse 19, for I, through the law, am dead to the law that I might live unto God.  
Oh, this man had several conflicts, several table encounters with Jewish preachers, Jewish believers,  
 that insisted on having bought the law and tries together.  
And here, do you know who he was telling this?  
Peter.  
He was preaching this message to Peter the Apostle.  
You can read it for yourself.  
Read it from the beginning.  
You'll be amazed.  
Then he says this.  
 He says, for I, through the law, am dead to the law that I might live unto God.  
I am crucified with Christ.  
He should have said, I was crucified with Christ.  
He knew.  
But the strength of the communication here is in the present tense, because his strength is his communication.  
 There's a reason for that.  
I wish I could take the time to show that to you.  
But let me go on, because that's not where I'm going.  
I want you to notice something.  
I am crucified with Christ.  
Nevertheless, I live, yet not I, oh God.  
But Christ liveeth in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh.  
Oh, dear Lord Jesus, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself for me.  
 Now, notice this is why I want you to see.  
I do not frustrate the grace of God.  
There are too many Christians that are frustrating the grace of God in their lives.  
That's what I'm trying to tell you.  
Don't frustrate the grace of God in your life.  
Let it work to its fullness, to its maximum capacity.  


  
 Then you come to find a fruition.  
Don't frustrate the grace of God in your life.  
Many have frustrated it, not allowing the grace of God to produce all that it could do in their lives.  
It says, I do not frustrate the grace of God.  
For if righteousness come by the Lord, then Christ is dead in vain.  
So what I've been telling you, I will let it be that Christ died in vain in my life.  
 No, I won't let it be.  
I'm going to be all that he died to save me for.  


  
I just shared with you something about the divine life that he brought.  
Quest sickness is not a part of your system.  
Question is, will you let it work?  
Or are you going to be sick and healing?  
 Healing is what we give to the world.  
And then it is the children's bread.  
When you grow out of that level and you have become a man, you put away childish things.  
You appropriate divine life.  
And you say, it runs through me every cell of my body.  
My body is the temple of the Holy Ghost.  
You say, devil, I refuse to be sick.  


  
 Anything happens in your body speaking tongues.  
Yabba!  
I told you, don't take it lightly.  
You see, you can be doing like this, you know, there's an injury.  
That may not work.  
That may not get the job done.  


  
 It's right in the mirror!  
Something happened in Koopasaya!  


  
You see, it's too much trouble.  
You know, instead of taking the cheers and sitting by the toilet, because every moment you're going there,  
 You wait every moment with your hand there, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  


  
 He said, resist the devil and he will flee from you.  
You said, what if the pen is so much and it's difficult for you to talk?  
Simple.  
Are you hearing me?  


  
 We are not victims, we are victims!  
When you're going for a meeting, maybe it's a business meeting.  
Maybe it's a political meeting.  
Whatever it is, take a little time and speak in other tongues.  
Charge!  


  
 Don't just, listen, don't stop at St.  
Father as I go.  
That's not enough.  
Before you say that, are you hearing me?  
He said, I will pray with the Spirit and I'll pray with you understanding also.  
Prayer with the Spirit first.  
You have the meeting in focus.  
 Then you say, Father, in this meeting I am the wisdom of God.  
Oh, I don't know if you got that.  


  
 The Bible says Christ has been made wisdom unto me.  
Don't you understand what that means?  


  
Sit down.  


  
I'm an audit.  
I'm an audit.  
I'm an audit.  
Are you an audit?  
I'm an audit.  


  
 Say this with me.  
I see by the Spirit.  
I hear by the Spirit.  
I hear by the Spirit.  
I hear by the Spirit.  
I know by the Spirit.  
Said again, I see by the Spirit.  
I hear by the Spirit.  
I know by the Spirit.  
I understand by the Spirit.  
Say I'm a Spirit-led man.  
 I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
See, I want to get you conscious of the Holy Spirit.  
I want to get you conscious of the Holy Spirit, until you are so conscious that you're so conscious, so conscious that you see less of your humanity and see more of your divinity.  
Can you shout amen, somebody?  


  
 becomes so conscious of the Holy Ghost, everywhere you are.  
So when you are alone, on your own, instead of feeling lonesome and thinking nasty thoughts, you go,  


  
 Sometimes you're not even singing it out.  
They're all that's around you.  
And you've got chima, marakise, ta kava, yaya, yaranda, kos, hendilo, gastera, yaya, and adagastera.  
They look at you, something is cooking.  
Some is cooking.  
By the time you lift your eyes, the fire coming out of your eye.  


  
 I want you to become a Holy Ghost Conscious.  
Everywhere you are, Holy Ghost Conscious.  


  
You notice the things that I communicate to you?  
First, I want you to be Christ Conscious.  
You see, that fits all the same.  
Life Conscious.  
Life.  
You know you're full of life.  
 You're conscious of your association with Christ.  
You so know that you and he are one.  
You so know that.  
You're conscious of what he brought to you.  
Life, eternal.  
Life, I'm full of life.  
Oh, that can never be taken away from me.  
I'm full of life.  
 I'm full of life.  


  
Oh, dear Lord Jesus, I'm full of life.  
Oh, thank you Lord, Solvermakizet.

 Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
There was a young lady that came up the platform and she had a testimony.  
In her testimony, she said something about how that she wanted to die, okay, because of her condition, right?  
She had an accident.  
She had an accident.  
She was in the corner.  
Yeah.  
 Okay.  
She wanted to die.  
She wanted to die because of you.  
Because she thought that she may never be normal again.  
But while she was thinking about that, God said to her, even if you wanted to die, you cannot die now.  
And she thought, what?  
Then the Spirit said to her, you have spoken so much about life that it is not possible for you to die now.

There's more.  
Listen.  
Here's what the Lord said.  
Listen to this.  
Listen to this.  
Here's what the Lord said.  
The Lord said, if you really want to die, it will take you some time to start talking debts again so you can change it.  
You've spoken too much life.  
 You can't die now.  
You're going to have to reverse, Deanna.
