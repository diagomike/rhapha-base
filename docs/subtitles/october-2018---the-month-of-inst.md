title: October 2018 - The Month of Instruction
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
This month, it's a nice one.  
Here's a month.  
Okay, here's what I'm going to do.  
I will read you some scriptures.  
Hello.  
 I'm going to read you a few scriptures.  
The first one is Proverbs chapter 4 and verse number 13.  
Proverbs chapter 4 verse 13.  


  
Have you seen it?  
He says what?  


  
 Take fast hold of instruction.  
Let her not go.  
Keep her for she is your life.  
She's your life.  
What's your life?  
His instruction is your life.  
That's a very strong statement.  
But let's move to the next one.  


  
 instruction, he says, is your life.  
Problems chapter 6 and verse 23.  
Read it for me.  


  
 for the commandment is a lamp.  
And the law is light and reproves of instruction are the way of life.  
Reproves of instruction are the way of life.  
Wow.  
 Here's another one.  
Proverbs chapter 10.  


  
In verse 17.  


  
Read for me.  


  
He's in the way of life that keep it instruction.  
 or He that refuses it, reproof, aerate.  
He is in the way of life that keeps it instruction.  
What is instruction?  
What does it mean instruction?  
What is instruction?  
I want to give you a nice definition and you've got to write it down because it's important.  
 Instruction is the direction of discipline that imparts knowledge and skill.  
I'll say it again.  
Instruction is the direction of discipline.  
 that in parts knowledge and skill.  
Why did I say direction of discipline?  
What I mean direction here?  
By direction here, I mean giving direction, to give direction.  
So it is the giving of direction of discipline.  
 So not just a direction to say, oh, where are you going?  
I say, OK, let me direct you like this and that.  
Or mere instruction, like you say, oh, this is how to use this thing, OK?  
Push three buttons here.  
No, no, it's more than that.  
Instruction is a direction of discipline.  
But it does something.  
It imparts knowledge and skill.  
What is skill?  
Skill is science.  


  
 See, the ability to produce solutions, solutions within any given environment or domain, that skill.  
The beautiful thing about this is the imputation of knowledge or skill.  
So instruction,  
 instruction ultimately imparts what knowledge and skill but look at he also lets us understand something about instructions because it the reproofs of instruction and this admittedly brings something to my mind  
 in 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse number 16, can we go there?  
Remember, we're talking the message of the month.  
What's God telling us?  
What does He want us to think?  
2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse number 16.  
He says, all Scripture  
 is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness.  
Actually, when you put all of these together, doctrine, reproof, correction,  
 and even this synonymously used word instruction here, which could just go for training if you want to.  
All of them put together are under instruction.  
When I say the direction or given direction of instruction, of discipline rather, of discipline.  
So, meaning that the scripture can give it to us  
 That's what he's saying.  
He says, our scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.  
So God's Word can give you this instruction that he says is a way of life.  


  
It's God's way of life, instruction.  
 instruction.  
This instruction includes what?  
Doctrine, correction, reproof, training in righteousness.  
That's what this instruction is about.  
So this month, imagine that you give yourself to instruction because it's the month of instruction.  
 In no big surprise, this morning when we were in the service and Pastor Benio was preaching, he did talk about certain things.  
And if you notice, he really gave some instructions, very important instructions.  
Giving time to the Lord.  
Giving time.  
And let me put it like this.  
 Because when he was trying to explain to you, I could perceive that in certain areas, some people would not be sure, how can they practice this?  
How can I give God so much time?  
God didn't really say, give me your time.  
You see it?  
He didn't really say, give me your time.  
 He said, give me your heart.  
That's what he said.  
He says, my son, give me your heart.  
Give me your heart.  
When I first started learning about how long should I pray?  
Years ago, how long should I pray?  
 And I even have to think, what is prayer?  
What is prayer?  
How long should I pray?  
What examples do I have in prayer?  
I look at the Bible and even in fasting, how many times do you fast?  
 How often should you do and why should you do?  
This questions come up again and again.  
Let's go to the Bible and see the answers.  
I mean, we talk about Moses.  
Moses fasted twice, right?  
40 days and 40 nights.  
But how long did Moses live?  
120 years.  
 So, for 80 years of ministry, he fasted only twice.  
40 days and 40 nights.  
Not good enough.  
I mean, 80 years of ministry.  
If you're given 80 years of ministry, how much is 40 days?  
40 days and 40 nights.  
One month plus.  
Huh?  
Isn't it?  
One month.  
One month?  
So he fasted two months and 20 days.  
 In 80 years of ministry, not good enough.  
I mean, look at it relatively.  
Suddenly it starts making sense that that's not good enough.  
So if God were asking for time, Moses didn't qualify.  
Not enough.  
Which means it's not about the 40 days.  
Jesus did it only once, not twice like Moses.  
He did it only once.  
 And he didn't have 80 years or 60 years.  
He had three.  
Three years of ministry.  


  
But think about what he needed to do.  
And how many other times we read about Jesus fasting even for one day?  
So again, it comes to purpose.  
 Why are you doing what you're doing?  
What does God really want?  
Is God asking for your food?  
Your time?  
No, he says, my son, give me your heart.  
And let your eyes observe my ways.  
Give me your heart.  
You'd be amazed that I usually tell people you need two kinds of prayer.  
One is  
 having a time of prayer that is dedicated to talking to him.  
At that point, you're not necessarily preparing to hear him because he might say something and he might not say anything.  
 He didn't talk to Moses for 40 days.  
It was at the end of the 40 days that he talked to him.  
He may not say anything to you.  
You still there?  
So he may not talk to you, but she must be prepared.  
It's about bearing your heart to God in that kind of prayer.  
So you need time for that.  
 You've got to have time for that.  
And all of us have that time.  
But not just talking and talking and talking.  
That's not what I mean.  
But he's a master communicator.  
And you can expect him to communicate at any time in real time too.  
He can talk to you at the same wavelength.  
So that's one where you  
 I call it like step aside.  
In other words, you step aside.  
Everything else, just so you can share your heart, bear your heart to the Lord, touching.  
Praise God.  
The second one is what I call living prayer.  


  
 Now this is very important because in living prayer you are in deep fellowship, constant fellowship and a lot of times you're not even talking but your heart does say  
 many things.  


  
And he answers your question because it sees your heart.  
I can tell you so much of what I experienced there.  
A lot of times I hardly would think of something before the answer comes to me.  
So I say to people, he communicates in real time.  
 real time.  
So that first one is like a religious life that is important.  
You see it?  
Like they used to say, let's go to Jerusalem to worship.  
Okay, let's go to Jerusalem to worship.  
So they get away from the home, they go to Jerusalem to worship.  
 Now, we're not going to anywhere to wash up, but in our hearts, and then we're praying, and we step aside everything else, and you're like you're going to Jerusalem.  
Okay?  
And some people say, well, I'm going to the mountain, or whatever it is, wherever you want to, you know, spend some time to pray.  
But that one  
 is not the one that gets the biggest things.  
That one is important because it instills what I call spiritual discipline.  
You need it.  
Without it, you be sulk.  
You need it.  
It's part of your life of godliness.  
It's part of your spiritual exercise.  
 See?  
You've got to do it.  
It's like fasting that we do from time to time.  
It's part of spiritual exercise.  
You've got to do it.  
It helps in building your spirit.  
See, if you neglect it, you lose a lot in your personal life.  
 So, but this second one is so important because it's your living experience with the Holy Spirit.  
And there is where most of your questions are answered.  


  
In constant fellowship with Him, I'm listening all the time.  
 I'm listening.  
I'm attuned all the time.  


  
And most of the time when I take a device with me, a phone, a tab, something, most of the time when I take with me, it's not because I want to make a call.  
I want to hear a call.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
Because I know the spirit of God is going to be saying something to me and I want to write it down so I don't miss it.  


  
 That's my major reason for taking the device.  
I just don't want to lose what God tells me because it tells me a whole lot of things.  
And it tells me some of the most beautiful things.  
Oh, wow.  
So I don't like to miss them.  
 I don't like it because I've had the experience before where I have to try to figure out what he told me.  
And now I'm trying to use my head to reconstruct what he said.  
And Lord Jesus, please, can you just give it back to me the way you did before?  
And I'm trying.  
And sometimes I've had to fast for it to come back.  
Wasn't easy for it.  
And it came so simply the first time.  
Wasn't even expecting it.  
Now I have to fast to try to get it back because I didn't write it down.  
 I like to miss it again, so I like to take something with me.  
Sometimes, I might even tell someone, please write this down for me.  
Write it down.  
Because see, God's talking to me.  
Hallelujah.  
The only reason I can be here talking to you is because God talks to me.  
Otherwise, I don't have anything to tell you.  
Nothing to tell me.  
 But here's an important key, by the way, I've got to tell you.  
Go back to that place where we were reading.  
Our scripture is given by inspiration of God, and it's profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction and righteousness.  
Did you notice it's not a full stop after the word righteousness?  
What's after it?  
A con.  
 So, it goes into verse 17.  
It says that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly finished on all good works.  
Now, what I want you to notice is very important.  
 You know, there are different words translated perfect in the New Testament.  
Alright?  
New Testament translated from the Greek.  
But this particular one is translated in an interesting way.  
It doesn't refer to what should really be called perfect here.  
Because in several other places, this is not the word used for perfect.  
 But there's an interesting thing about this word.  
Fresh.  
It actually means that the man of God may be updated.  
Constant update.  
I've shared this with you before, a long time ago.  
Constant update.  
 That man of God may be up to date.  
That's what that word means.  
Atios.  
The man of God may be up to date.  
We're equipped.  


  
A man of God that's not up to date doesn't know what God is doing, what is planning, the move of the Spirit,  
 What's the world of the Father?  
God wants each one of us to be up-to-date, up-to-date with the Spirit.  
And the Scripture has the capacity, the inspiration, to get you there.  
In that amazing world study, written a book that's about 2,000 years old, right?  
 and still is as fresh as tomorrow.  
Praise God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Okay, so we just gave you an update.  


  
Glory to God.  
 So this month is a month of instruction.  
Instruction is your life.  
Instruction.  
He is in the way of life who has instruction.  
Instruction.  
Instruction.  
God's telling me to do something.  
I'm going to do it.  
Instruction.  
God's guiding me to do something.  
I'm going to do it.  
Instruction.  
Instruction.  
 God's leading.  
Do you realize he can talk to you about something, maybe about yourself, maybe about your church, maybe about your family, maybe about your finances?  
Whatever it is.  
One little step that he tells you will lead to big things.  
Never ignore what God tells you to do, look small.  


  
 But isn't it just like Him?  
He does the biggest things with the smallest things.  
Praise God.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
We're going to pray at this time and just thank God for your life.  
Thank Him for this month of October and the beautiful things that God's going to do in your life.  
Thank Him for His grace.  
Thank Him for His love.  
Thank Him for His kindness.
