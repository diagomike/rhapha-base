 It's not about the inventions of mankind.  
It's not about the fame.  
It's not about the world system.  
It's about the truth.  
The word which is the truth.  
All things that you ever need in your life are wrapped up in the word.  
Go for the word.  
Pastor Chris.  
 worth hearing.  


  
From all around the world, many journey from far and near to attend meetings with the Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Always at these meetings, the Word of God is deeply taught.  
The presence of the Lord is greatly experienced and the atmosphere abuzz with the power of God.  
Many who attend are completely transformed and inspired, leaving with testimonies.  
Be blessed as you watch.  
What is ministry?  
What really is ministry?  
Is ministry the organizing of a church?  
 Is ministry the structuring of some form of congregation and the administration and the different groups of the congregation?  
Is that the, no?  
Is ministry preaching?  
No.  
What is ministry?  
Ministry is found in something Jesus said.  
 In St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 7, when you read from verse 37, let's read.  
St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 7, from verse 37.  
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thirsts, let him come on to me and drink, oh God.  
 He that believed on me, as the scripture had said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."  
That is minister.  
I'll explain it to you.  
That is where ministry is.  
In a King James translation and a few other translations, there is a little bit of a problem.  
 And that's why so many try to find where did Jesus, you know, he said, if you really like it is here, he that believed it on me as the scripture had said, out of his belly of low rivers of living water.  
So you think Jesus is caught in scripture.  
It's because there's something wrong with the punctuation.  
The Kumar, after he that believed it on me,  
 He's a problem.  
Take it away and you get exactly what that scripture is saying.  
Hear that, believe it, on me as the scripture has said.  
Get it?  
Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
So he's saying, if you believe as the scripture has said,  
 Rivers of living water will flow out of you.  
You get it?  
So this is ministry.  
It is the outflow of the rivers of living water in you.  
Rivers of living water.  
The next verse, you'll see what he's talking about.  
The next verse.  
 He says, but this speck ye of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified.  
So you see, the rivers of living waters talking about is the Holy Spirit.  
That's ministry.  
Where you're pouring out the life of the Spirit of God that's flowing from you, you can give what you don't have.  
 out of his belly, out of his inamous being shall flow, rivers of living water.  
When you understand this, it is higher than every structure you could ever build.  
It is higher than every kind of organization you could ever raise.  
The ministry of the Holy Spirit pouring out rivers of living water.  
Look at what he said, I love this.  
 It is the Spirit, that quickness.  
That means that gives life.  
It is the Spirit that gives life.  
I want to impress this upon you.  
It is the Spirit that gives life.  
 It is the spirit and quickness.  
The flesh profited nothing.  
The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.  
The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.  
So Jesus' words were not ordinary.  
That's what I wanted.  
 I wanted to speak words that were spirits and life.  
I didn't want to be an orator.  
I didn't want to be a nice talker.  
I didn't want to be a good preacher.  
No, I wanted to release words that were spirits and life.  
So I understood when Jesus said, out of his belly shall flow, rivers of living water.  
 Meaning that I could pour out spirit and life through words.  
Yes, I thought that means I can be different.  
I can be different.  
My words do not be ordinary.  
Spirit and life.  
Spirit and life.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
Spirit and life.  


  
 Glory to God.  
In a session is important.  
Prayer is important.  
Prayer, don't be too tired to pray.  
Okay?  
Don't think that prayer is for those who don't know what to do.  
No.  
Prayer is important.  
In the place of prayer, you receive  
 in partitions from the Holy Spirit.  
You receive ministrations from the Holy Spirit.  
You receive visions from the Holy Spirit.  
You receive guidance from the Holy Spirit.  
Prayer is important.  


  
Without that kind of prayer, I'll be like a blind man.  
 And because I don't want to be a blind man, I spend time to pray.  
Because when I close my eyes to pray to God I see.  
Prayer is too important.  
And sometimes, remember, you don't even know what to say in prayer.  
It is not important that you know what to say when you pray.  
Why?  
 when you pray in the Spirit, when you pray in tongues, you don't know what you're saying, do you?  
No.  
It's a fellowship.  


  
It's a fellowship.  
You're getting more and more acquainted with Him.  
There you be amazed at how the Holy Spirit teaches you.  
The Holy Spirit is the greatest teacher.  
 He would teach you things you never thought you would ever discover.  
Things that would take people years to find out.  
He can teach you in a few moments.  
So I share with you my personal experience of the Holy Spirit.  
That's what I'm sharing with you.  
 It is my personal experience of the Holy Spirit, what he did in my life.  
So he is not someone that I just read of.  
He is someone I've come to know.  
You're following this?  
Hallelujah.  
 I said, if you want to produce children, spiritual children, it is very different from combats.  
Galatians chapter 4, because I read to you yesterday from the Old Testament, but I want to  
 show it to you as well in the New Testament.  
So you see, because you saw as soon as Zion travilled, she brought forth her children.  
That's what you saw.  
Galatians chapter 4 verse 19.  
Let's see what the great apostle Paul tells us here.  
This is my little children of whom I travilled in birth again until Christ be found in you.  
 again of whom I travel in birth again, which means he traveled before.  
That's what brought them forth.  
So when Paul traveled, he brought for children in Galatia.  
 But now that some others were causing them to fall out of the way and become fleshly minded, he goes back to what?  
Traveling again.  
That Christ may be formed in them.  
Which means that when members of the church are not doing well and moving backward and getting carnal, we don't criticize them.  
We don't get mad at them.  
We go back to prayer.  
 We travel in birds again until Christ be formed in them.  
See how important that is.  
So I told you, Christian ministry is not, there are no shortcuts.  
There are no shortcuts.  


  
 Most days I pray with tears.  
I can't even hold them back.  
Most days, almost every day.  


  
You see why?  
Because of what I see in the world and in what I see outside,  


  
 You know, the words of Jesus come to my heart where He said that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.  
That was the desire of Jesus Christ.  
He said, I want the world to know that I love the Father.  
 He always wanted the word that he loved the father.

Every tree of forest.  
They are chapter number 61.  


  
And I'm going to be reading from  
 Verse 1 The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord had anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek.  
He had sent me to bind up the brokenhearted.  
 To proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that abound.  
Say God's stuck in the me.  


  
To proclaim the acceptable ye of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God.  
To come for all that mourn.  
Say God's stuck in the me.  
 to appoint unto them that mourning Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning."  
Say God's talking to me.  
The gamut of praise for the spirit of heaven is that they might be called trees of righteousness.  
 The planning of the Lord that he might be glorified.  
Say, God's stuck in the me.  
Did you notice that?  
When Jesus went into the synagogue in the Luke's gospel, the fourth chapter, the Bible terraces, that on that day he was caught up to read the Scriptures and he opened to this chapter and read to the people.  
 And he said to them, he said, today, this creature is fulfilled in your hearing.  


  
So the Lord has produced in us trees of righteousness.  
Say, I'm a tree of righteousness.  
 He calls us the planning of the Lord.  
We are the planning of the Lord.  
He planted us.  
Look at 2 Corinthians in chapter number six.  


  
Verse one.  
Have you seen it?  
 He says, we then, as work us together with Him, with God, the situars so that you receive not the grace of God in vain.  
In other words, make sure the grace of God works through you.  
Don't receive it in vain.  
Put it to work.  
Say, I put it to work.  
But he says that we are, we are work us together with God.  
Amen?  
Now, turn the first Corinthians in chapter number three.  
 And you would like this one.  
Read verse 9.  
For we are laborers together with God.  
Ye are God's husbandry.  
Ye are God's building.  
In other words, you are God's field.  
You are God's field.  
 You know, He's garden, that's what He's saying.  


  
And in the field, there are trees and there are grasses.  


  
And, you know, when you read in Vukozakaraya,  
 In that 10th chapter, 1st verses, ask of the Lord rain.  
In the time of the latter rain, the Lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field.  
But we are trees.  
God's fellow laborers.  
God's fellow workers.  


  
Say, I'm a worker together with God.  
 and I'm a tree of righteousness, producing other trees of righteousness.  
You see, you've gotten a new responsibility.  
Did you know that?  
That's what it's talking about in Isaiah chapter 61 because you see Jesus Christ quoted that chapter and He said,  
 that was fulfilled in his day.  
Now, Jesus is gone to heaven, and we are walking in his shoes, in his steps, and we are the ones that the Spirit of God is upon today.  
And like Jesus spoke back then, we say, the Spirit of God is upon me, for the Lord had not haunted me.  
So that's where we are today.  
We're right in Isaiah chapter 61, and we say,  
 Just the same things, the spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord had anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek.  
He had sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that have bound.  
That's my message to the world.  
That's your message to the world.  
He sent us  
 with the Holy Spirit, to go and preach His message and bring them out of bondage and out of darkness, bind up the brokenhearted.  
He can tell us to break their hearts more.  
And you say that?  
No, to bind up the brokenhearted.  
We don't break hearts.  
We bind them up.  
We heal them.  
They may end.  
So that's my ministry to heal.  
 Say, I'm a healer, not a breaker.  
Oh boy, how do you like that?  
That's wonderful.  
I'm a healer, not a breaker.  
Glory to God.  
To proclaim the acceptable, you're the Lord.  
That's the Sabbath.  
To announce the Sabbath.  
And to see everybody, hello everybody, it's the day of rest.  
 Rest has come.  
It's the acceptable he of the Lord.  
This is Sabbath.  
It has arrived.  
No more struggling, glory to God.  
Glory.  
Our debts are cancelled.  
Ma, ma, ma.  
That's what he said.  
That's the acceptable he of the Lord.  
Free.  
 So go and tell everybody you're free, you're free, you're free.  
Ooh, you're free glory to God.  
Then he goes in, look at that verse, verse three, to a point.  
Boy, I'm anointed to a point, to a point unto them that morning Zion to give unto them beauty for ashes.  
They've been mourning when I show up, it's joy time.  
 So, ain't that wonderful?  
As a tree of righteousness, he even says that he is the life that flows through me.  
He's the one that carries me.  
He's the stem.  
He's the stem of my life.  
No wonder I'm unshakable.  
It doesn't matter how strong the wind blows.  
This tree is going to be standing.  
Hallelujah!  
 This tree is going to be standing.  
If you were watching the other day when they had this tornado in America, in Oklahoma, then trees, tall trees were brought down.  
As though somebody just pulled him out of the ground and laid him on the ground.  
Look at trees just on the ground lying flat because of the force of that tornado and pulled him out of the ground.  
But this one cannot be pulled off.  
I'm a tree of righteousness.  
 Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  


  
I like it.  
Trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord.  
Isaiah chapter number 32.  
And I'm looking at verse 15.  


  
 Woo, glory to God.  
From that 15 verse, he says, until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be of fruitful feel, and the fruitful feel be counted for a forest.  


  
So,  
 When I, as a tree of righteousness, produce other trees of righteousness, and we become trees of righteousness, we have a fruitful field.  
In Mother Holy Ghost, as we all continue to multiply, we become a forest.  
 Every tree of forest.  
Every tree.  
Every tree.  
Sam, a tree of righteousness.  
To become a forest.  
Oh boy.  
This is the dream.  
This is the dream.  
And there's no stopping us.  
This is the dream.  
 Every tree of forest.  
Somebody heard it over there.  
He said, yes, Lord.  
Hallelujah.  
God's talking to you.  
He's talking to you.  
Every tree of forest.  
From on high.  


  
 He's been poured upon us from on high.  
It has already happened.  
Every tree of forest, kiba kaba, yendilege boza.  
So you're no longer going to have these two and three friends.  
You're going to say to your two and three friends, let's go win souls.  
Let's go bring in more trees of righteousness.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
Ha ha ha, hallelujah.  
Wow.  
 So it's not stopping here.  
Three of us are going to become 30.  
And then 30 of us become 300.  
And 300 of us, 3000.  
And we go for 30,000.  
This tree is becoming a forest.  
Showering in somebody.

Pastor Chris Digital Library TV, building lives through God's eternal Word.  
It's not about the inventions of mankind.  
It's not about the fame.  
It's not about the world system.  
 It's about the truth.  
The Word which is the truth.  
All things that you ever need in your life are wrapped up in the Word.  
Go for the Word.  
Pastor Chris, worth hearing.  
If you belong to Christ, you are Abraham's seed.  
 and heirs according to the promise.  
So we are the seed of Abraham.  


  
And each one of us has the potential of a multitude.  
 When you come to Christ, His seed is in you.  
Even though you are His seed, His seed is in you.  
Did you know that?  
The Bible says the seed of God is in you.  
How can you allow that seed die without reproducing?  
 The seed of God is in you.  
What are you going to do?  
If you think that you were born of your mother as a timid person, thank God.  
That's not a problem.  
You may say, I don't know how to speak to many people.  
Thank God.  
That's wonderful.  
 Why?  
Because this thing we're talking about is not by might.  
You see, God's not looking for those who know how to talk.  
He's not looking for those who have the natural ability to face an audience.  
No, he's not looking for that.  
He's looking for somebody who will say, Lord, here.  
 Feel me.  
Talk to me.  
Use me for your glory.  
And he says, open your mouth and I will feel it.  


  
That's what he says.  
I was not a very bold person.  
As a young lad, I was it.  
I was timid.  
 I always played on my own.  


  
Didn't have that outward boldness, like many of the young kids my age.  
Even my younger brother was bolder than I.  


  
 And then the words of all, full of fear, I feared everything.  
Because I heard too many stories, too many bad stories.  
Did you ever hear of what they call, bumble, bumble?  
If you never heard that, just forget it.  
I was told that, you know, those guys were out all the time.  
 So as a kid, I feared them.  
Then I even feared the little birds and the knights that made that sound.  
I was told it was a witch.  
Then I heard of one they called Lady Koi Koi.  


  
If you never heard of this, don't worry about this.  
 Then there was Sekou.  
Shot Mandevu.  


  
I heard all of those things as a little kid.  
And I feared them.  
Then I feared Tonda.  
And the lightning.  
They said sometimes it struck and killed somebody.  
 And I didn't know when judgment day was coming and I was going to die and go to hell, I was afraid, a life full of fear, even as a little boy.  
But when the day came, and I received the Holy Ghost, my fears vanished, my fears dissipated forever.  
 And since then, I haven't known fright.  
Not even fright.  
Nothing shakes me.  
All that is the spirit of God, the Holy Ghost.  
When I couldn't talk to other people now as bold, I could talk to anybody.  
 Because I knew the Holy Spirit would speak through me.  
I didn't have to premeditate to say what am I going to say?  
Because I saw it in the world.  
Jesus said, when they bring you before cancels and before governors and so on and so forth.  
He said, don't worry about what you're going to say.  
He said, because the spirit of your father will speak through you.  
At the hour that you need it, he will speak through you.  
And I trusted Jesus.  
And it's been so.  
Hallelujah.  
So I say to you,  
 Don't worry about how you were born.  
Don't worry about how you grew up.  
All of that doesn't count.  
What matters is to receive the Holy Spirit.  
When you receive the Holy Spirit, His words will come through you with power.  
You can trust Him.  
That's the way to rely on Him.  
Don't say, what am I going to say?  
Say, Lord, Your Word is in my mouth.  
 You will speak through me.  
That's all you need.  
And start.  
See how we like that?  
Don't worry.  
He said, open your mouth and I will fill it.  
He will fill your mouth with the right words.  
Don't worry about making a mistake.  
That doesn't mean anything.  
Why?  
Because he will use your imperfections.  
 and perfect them.  
The Bible says we have this treasure in ettin vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.  
So these are ettin vessels.  
But this treasure is there.  
And the excellency of the power is of God, not of our drinking, not of our bringing.  
 more of our nationality.  
No, no, no.  
You may not even lack the way you look.  
What you don't understand is the glory of God.  
Don't worry about how you look.  
Once you start and let the Holy Spirit take over, you will be the most beautiful thing in the world.  
First Corinthians chapter three and verse nine.  
Can you go there?  
 really want to go.  
For we are labor us together with God.  
Yea God's husbandry.  
Yea God's billion.  
Now let's stop for a moment.  
Or who's talking and who's talking about who and who's talking to who.  
Now Paul the Apostle is right into the Corinthian church.  
And he says, those of us, the leaders who came to minister to you.  
 We are, he's telling the church.  
He says, we are laborists together with God.  
Then he says to the church, to the congregation in Corinth.  
He says, you are God's husbandry.  
That means God's guardian.  
You're God's husbandry.  
You're God's building.  
 Now, we hear all of us are leaders.  
We are the ones ministering to others.  
We are workers together with God.  
This is not the congregation.  
This is the congregation of laborers.  
 Are you hearing me?  
We are the laborers.  
We are meeting here.  
This is our conference, okay?  
And we can say to the rest of the congregation, ye are God's farm, ye are God's garden, ye are God's husbandry, but we are workers together with God.  
Every cell leader is a core laborer with God.  
See, because God is about building lives.  
God is about saving souls.  
 For God's all of the world, that he gave his only begotten sound, that whosoever believes in him, shouldn't have perished, would have everlasting life.  
God sent his sound to save the world.  
And we are partners together with him in saving lost souls.  
So every cell leader is a worker together with God.  
Hallelujah.  
Say, I'm a worker together with God.  
A co-laborer with God.  
I know who I am.  
 I have responsibilities.  
Hallelujah.  
In chapter number six and verse number one.  
Second Corinthians chapter six and verse number one.  
Have you found it?  
All right.  
He says, we then ask workers together with Him, beseech you also, that she received not the grace of God in vain.  
It's like that cell leader telling the members of His cell  
 I don't want you to receive the grace of God in vain.  
See, He's telling them.  
Why?  
Because He's a worker together with God.  
He's come to talk to them about the grace of God.  
And He doesn't want them to receive that grace in vain.  
He says, He got to put it to work.  
See, we then, as workers together with Him,  
 Minister to the congregation, and we tell them not to receive the grace of God in vain.  
We're saying, let this grace produce results in your life.  
Now you've got to send Matthew's gospel, chapter number nine.  
We're reading from verse 37.  
So Matthew's gospel, chapter nine, from verse 37.  
Have you found it?  
All right, read.  
To who?  
 He's the cypus, yeah?  
Who's talking?  
Jesus is talking.  
Then said he and he's the cypus.  
The harvest truly is plentyous.  
But this is the problem.  
The problem is not the harvest.  
It's never been the problem.  
The harvest has never been the problem.  


  
 It's the number of laborers, verse 38.  
Pray ye therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.  
The Lord of the harvest.  
Who's the Lord of the harvest?  
The Holy Ghost.  
He's here.  
He's the Lord of the harvest.  
He says, Pray ye therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth laborers.  
 into his harvest, that he will send forth laborious into his harvest.  
Let's see.  
So they've been sent forth by the Holy Ghost.  
You see, the Holy Ghost is a lot of the harvest.  
So they've been sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Salucia, and from things they sail to Cyprus.  
 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God, Hallelujah.  
They preached the word of God.  
That's what they did.  
They preached the word of God.  
They were sent by the Holy Ghost.  
So labor has had been sent into the harvest by the Holy Ghost.  
It is praying there for the Lord of the harvest that he was sent.  
How did you pray the Lord of the harvest?  
How did you pray the Lord of the harvest?  
Hey.  
 You talk to Him like you talk to the Father.  
You see, you speak to the Holy Ghost like you speak to the Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Jesus said, we could pray to the Holy Ghost.  
That's what He said.  
He said, pray ye the Lord of the house.  
So you can talk to the Holy Ghost.  
Like you talk to the Father.  
Because the Holy Ghost is God.  
 There were fair with the Holy Ghost, and the result was they specked the Word of God with boldness.  
Hallelujah.  
That's it.  
When you feel the Holy Ghost, the result will be speaking the Word with boldness.  
With boldness.  
Say, I'm bold.  
I've got the Holy Ghost in me.  
And you know, if at any time you feel like, you're not object, okay?  
Because sometimes you might just think like, hey,  
 You know?  
And your heart may skip a little bit.  
And you think, how do I do this?  
Hey, relax.  
Just get drunk.  
You know?  
Get drunk.  
Not in the bottle.  
 Not wine out of a bottle?  
No, he says, be not drunk with wine or in his ex.  
He says, you don't need that.  
You don't need that.  
He says, but be free to the Holy Ghost.  
So get into your room.  
Shut the door.  
Speak in tongues.  
Speak in tongues.  
Speak in tongues.  
Speak in tongues.  
Am I get loud?  
 Don't worry, speak in tongues until you're that staggering and laughing.  
Speak in tongues.  
Don't stop until you are so full and you know that, you know that, you know that you are full.  
Unbelievable, fly out the window.  
Down to be gone.  
And when you're now full, you get dressed.  
You're all ready to go.  
 Ready to go.  
And just walk out like a gentleman.  
But I tell you when you begin speaking.  
There will be power.  
Power to effect change.  
Power that cannot be denied.  
Hallelujah.  
 The first and most important part of this harvest, we want to create the harvest, meaning you want to take charge and produce a cup anytime.  
First thing is prayer.  
That's the number one thing you need.  
Now prayer does not change God.  
 It is very important that you put that down.  
It doesn't change God because you see, you have to consider the benevolence of God and his providence.  
Okay?  
Already manifested in his word.  
 and manifested around us to let us know God is the supposed, predisposed to doing good, always wants to do good, always.  


  
And God is caring, God is kind.  
 And when we want to spread your harvest like this, we want to change lives.  
We want to bring good to bear upon a situation.  
We have to understand from the standpoint of God's benevolence.  
We have to understand it from God who is good.  
 and ready to help and bless because in the first place he was the one who wanted everything to go well with us.  
It was God who loved the world and sent his son to die to save us.  
It wasn't us who called on God and said, we need your salvation, can you send somebody?  
See, it wasn't us who called for salvation, it was God who wanted to save us.  
 So when we start praying for God to save the lost, for God to save that sin and for God, we're not changing anything.  
God always wanted that man saved.  
It's not us who tried to get God to save the man.  
He already did everything he needed to do before we came on the scene.  
See that?  
So we can't say we're trying to get God to save somebody.  
But our prayer, see, our prayer doesn't change God.  
 But our prayer makes it consistent for God to do whatever he would want to do, which it was inconsistent for him to do, had we not prayed.

As you study the scriptures,  
 See, a lot of times, the people who read the Bible, they don't understand the message of the Scripture.  
This book, we call the Bible, is the Word of God.  
And it is a testimony from God on what He said.  
What men said.  
What devils said.  
 what angels said, what Jesus said.  
You get it?  
Which means everything there is not to be lived by.  
It is to be understood as to who was talking and what was the context of his speech or writing.  
What did he mean?  
 So you don't just say, that is in the Bible, yes, something is in the Bible, but who said it?  
To whom was it said?  
And for what purpose?  
Hallelujah.  
And so what do we glean from it?  
What's for us?  
How should we perceive it?  


  
 And I'm looking at the early church, what we call the early church.  
The early church where they just got started.  
It is important for us to understand that the church had to go through a period of growth.  
They didn't know everything at once.  
In the first 15 chapters of the Book of Acts, the church did not believe  
 that the non-Jews were supposed to be in Christ.  
It was in the 15th chapter that they had a debate, a serious one.  
They had had a problem with Peter for even going to the house of a Gentile in chapter 10.  
And he had to explain himself, the God packs him to do it.  
 Five chapters later, they hadn't changed their minds.  


  
So when you stood in the Bible, you had to understand what was the thinking of the people that he talks about at that time, whether they were the apostles, for example, the teachings of Jesus in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  
Some of those teachings are not for Christians to live by.  


  
 You see it?  
Some of the things that he was teaching were for the Jewish man.  
And after you've received eternal life, you can't walk in that light.  
To get to understand the past, the present, the future.  


  
 For example, when he said to his disciples on one occasion, how come you don't have any faith?  
You cannot read that and think for yourself, maybe I don't have any faith.  
 Because when you're born again, the Bible says that God has dared to every man among you the measure of faith.  
No Christian without faith.  
It was possible for them in their day to have not had any faith.  
But no one who's born again has zero faith.  


  
 and your faith cannot be smaller than what was required to be born again.  
Hallelujah.  
 That's the amount of faith that's given to everybody to start with.  
Then you start growing your face.  
You know, some people think like, okay, the world is going through a change and maybe sometimes soon Christianity will be history.  
No, a thousand times no.  
No, this thing will outlive every system.  


  
 It's not about to fold up.  


  
It's getting greater by the day.  
Let's look at a few scriptures.  
We'll begin with understanding the early church, the way they thought.  
And why many Christians are still thinking that way today and why there is of necessity  
 a move in the spirits to cause those changes that we must have before the king comes back.  
Amen.  
All right.  
Let me begin with the Old Testament.  
Heger, Book of Heger, chapter two, and we will be looking at verse number nine.  


  
The glory.  
 of this latter house shall be greater than of the former Saint-Lord of hosts.  
And in this place will I give peace, Saint-Lord of hosts."  
Now notice this is the glory of this latter house.  
What is he dealing with?  
Heger was a contemporary of Ezra.  
 as your chapter three, verse 12.  
But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy.  
I want to read it again.  
 He says, but many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men, old men, all right, that had seen the first house, the first temple, the house of God.  
When the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wet with a loud voice, and many shouted aloud for joy,  
 so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people.  
For the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.  
What was going on?  
They had been given permission to reveal the temple.  
And you know, they had trouble that this had been gotten.  
They were thrown out.  
And now,  
 The remnant had some help, others came in, were allowed to come back and build a temple, a place for God, a place to worship God.  
And so the old man that knew the old temple remembered those days.  
As the foundation of the temple was being laid, they remembered.  


  
 same thing defined when the salmon stirs us by the rivers of Babylon.  
There we sat down and wet when we remembered Zion.  
So we hung the hops upon the windows, the mister of.  
Why did they do that?  
In fact, they said, they that wasted us required of us a song.  
 And we said, why should we sing the Lord's song in a strange way?  
Because they remembered, except we remembered Zion.  
And that's what happened to this man here at this time.  
They remembered the old temple and the webs.  
They remembered what they had gone through.  
Somehow they're happy, somehow they're saddened.  
 happy because it's happening again.  
Thank God.  
We're going to get a temple now, but then the past.  
So you couldn't tell where they're wishing for the past, where they're looking into the future.  
I just wanted you to see what was going on.  
And Hagia was the prophet.  
So he tells us in his own writing, what God said, why did all this whipping was going on?  
And the priest Ezra was writing,  
 what was happened, what He got the prophets also, how the word from God.  
So we go back to He got chapter two verse nine.  
As they would name the foundation, God spoke.  
First they told them to repent of their wrongs because a lot of them were doing their own stuff instead of doing the work of God.  
 instead of building the house of God.  
And once they were repented and ready to do God's work, he gave them the word.  
He said, the glory of this latter house, this latter house, not the latter house, but this latter house, the glory of this latter house, shall be greater than the glory of the former.  
 Say it, the Lord of hosts.  
And in this place, will I give peace?  
Say it, the Lord of hosts.  
If you liked that one, then that means you will like verse eight.  
So let's move back a little bit.  
Verse eight, the seller is mine.  
And the gold is mine.  
Say it, the Lord of hosts.  
I knew you would like that one.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Maybe if you like this one, that means you like verses 6 and 7.  
So let's go to 6 and read to 7.  
For those said, a lot of hosts, yet once it is a little wide.  
It says, in those short times, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.  
 This is I'm going to shake everywhere.  
You notice the economies of the world are being shaken today?  
People are wondering what's going on.  
They can't understand what's happening.  
How can human beings be managing their own money and suddenly they don't understand what has happened to their money?  
How can whole nations be complaining?  
 Who are those that came from outer space to steal the money?  
How can every country be complaining?  
Why can't they just sit down together and say, OK, let's just redistribute?  
It's not happening.  
Why?  
They're meeting everywhere.  
At the United Nations, they're coming everywhere.  
They're meeting everywhere and confused.  
What is happening?  
They have not been attacked by some hero.  


  
 What's going on?  
Because God said, I will shake every way.  
And what will follow?  
Look at him.  
And I will shake all nations.  
Have you seen it?  
I will shake all nations.  
And the desire of all nations was the desire of all nations, Sylvain Gold.  
Money.  
 That's all they're looking for.  
And then the Zavon Nation shall come and I will fill this house with glory!  


  
 Did you notice?  
He didn't say, at this time here, he's always said it.  
He's got a lot of that in the Bible.  
But notice, notice he says, I will fill this house with glory.  
He didn't say, I will fill this house with my glory.  
All right?  
He has said that already, different times.  
And as you keep reading the Bible, you find he will say it again.  
But there are places where he said, I will fill this house with glory.  
 This glory is talking about is abundance, magnificence, beauty, splendor, excellence.  
That's what it's talking about.  
Go to the book of James,  


  
 Chapter 5 and verse number 7 Be patient therefore, brethren, onto the coming of the Lord.  
Behold the husband man, wait it for the precious fruit of the earth.  
Who's the husband man?  
Huh?  
Jesus said, I am divine, ye are the branches.  
My father is the husband man.  
 The patient never breading on to the coming of the Lord.  
Behold, the husband man, waited for the precious fruit of the earth.  
Precious fruit of the earth.  
Precious, how precious are we?  
We are so precious to him.  
Every soul that we win to God is a precious fruit.  
He's waiting.  
 Behold, the husband men waited for the precious fruit of the earth and had long patience for it until he received the early Eladirai.  
That's why you hear about the early church and the latter church.  
Because the early rain, when that outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost,  
 initiated the church the early church early rain is the rain that falls to prepare the ground for suing the latter rain is the one that falls to prepare it for harvest hallelujah  
 The horsemen men waited for the precious fruit of the earth and had long patience for it until he received the early and latter reign.  
Next, be also patient.  
Establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord.  
Draw it now.  
So when the coming of the Lord draws knife, which church will be in existence?  
The latter church.  


  
 And this massive outpouring has been on for some time.  
After the dark ages, the move of the Holy Ghost, the new move of the Spirit God, began.  
And it's been getting  
 Greater in greater, greater in greater.  
They thought the church was over in the dark ages.  
That's what's called the dark ages.  
I thought it was over.  
What's good?  
Greater in greater, greater in greater as we approach the coming of the Lord.  
 Everything there is a season.  
For every time there is a purpose.  
The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former.  
Say it the Lord of Host.  
And in this place will I give peace.  
Say it the Lord of Host.  
It's important for us to understand the metamorphosis of the church.  
The changes that have taken place in the church.  
 from its early beginnings to our day in what is to follow.

God bless you.  
Glory to God.  
So we are with Him in His projects of regeneration, giving men a new life.  
 bringing men into a new birth of the spirits.  
It is our responsibility.  
And we are so glad to be chosen of God to be a part of this.  
Carrying out and carrying on the work with Jesus began both to do and teach.  
And then continued by his apostles that he chose.  
Glory to God.  
So we are part of this.  
This is amazing.  
 Daniel chapter 7.  
We're reading verse 27.  
And the kingdom and the million.  
See how it ends.  
I like it.  
And the kingdom and the million and the greatness of the kingdom.  
Oh, not the whole heaven.  
 Call it what you mean, whatever any nation or town or sediment.  
Look at it now.  
All under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high.  
Whose kingdom is the everlasting kingdom and all the millions shall serve and obey him.  
Shout him in somebody.  
This is how it's all going to end.  
 I told you yesterday, the other crisis is not going to take over the world like they're thinking.  
No, we will have to leave this world first before it comes to do his thing.  
And then when we come back, we arrest him and put him in the bottomless pit.  
Say that we'll be bound for a thousand years.  
 and he'll be cast into that bottomless pit.  
He will be there 1,000 years without Satan.  
Think about it.  
Just the discipline, you know God just wants discipline here.  
1,000 years.  
Keep him there.  
Can you imagine a bottomless pit?  
He'll be descending for 1,000 years.  
He's not going to get to the bottom.  
1,000 years is still falling.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
So it's all going to be given to the people of the saints of the Most High.  
That's us.  
Okay.  
Now before the next scripture, let me take a detour and show something that will lead to what we want to say.  
Proverbs 11, verse 30.  
 Read it, the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.  
I like that.  
And he, that winded source, is wild.  
That's the last part I want you to say.  
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.  
Okay?  
What comes out of you is a tree of life.  
So you see, the tree of life is now in your mouth, correct?  
 Uh-huh.  
So you're producing life.  
It's coming out of you.  
Thank God.  
But hear that winded souls, you see, is wise.  
Hear that winded souls is wise.  
See, I'm wise.  
So, no matter what you see in the world, remember, this is the most important.  
Do you know what it is to be recognized for so many?  
Dear Lord Jesus,  
 something the Bible says when one sinner repents this joy in heaven for one person.  
The Bible says the angels rejoice.  
How much does a soul cost?  
What is the value of one soul?  
I can tell you.  
 Can I tell you?  
Because I've calculated it.  
I've calculated it.  
I calculated the cost of a soul, and I found out the answer.  
You want to write it down?  
OK.  
OK.  
You're ready?  
You want to formula with you that I calculated it?  
I'll give it to you.  
Right team.  
 Add it down.  
T. B. O. J. That was the formula I used in calculating it and I found it to be the blood of Jesus.  


  
 Once so, I found out if I've been only one person in the world, Jesus would have still come to die.  
He didn't come because we were many.  
He came because we were valuable to God.  
That's a cost.  
That's a cost.  
So it's an exciting moment for us to be able to sit down like this and think that we've changed lives and think that we have done something meaningful in the kingdom of God.  
 It's wonderful.  
Praise the Lord.  
Say hallelujah.  
So, heed that winner's source is what?  
One more time.  
Okay.  
Daniel chapter 12.  
Book of Daniel chapter 12.  
We are reading from verse 1.  


  
Read from verse 1.  


  
 Verse two.  
Hey!  
And many have been asleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life.  


  
 and song to shame and everlasting content.  
That's beef.  
Ring verse three.  
And they let go of the stars, as the brag is put forth.  
And they let John Minney do like just this, as his stars pour upon them.  
Somebody say hallelujah.

 says, for there is one God and one mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
I love it.  
Verse six, who gave himself a ransom for all everybody, everyone is included there.  
So he gave himself.  
Say it again, he gave himself a ransom.  
 for me.  
Make it personal, a ransom for me.  
That's wonderful.  
So this is talking about Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time.  
A message that should be preached at the proper time, in due time, in that time came.  
 when the Holy Spirit came to the church to enable, create the church and enable the church to do it.  
He gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in Utah, to be preached.  
So we could be a tester money of that ransom.  
 That's what he's saying.  
Now, look at the next verse.  
So that's his message.  
This is, we're on to, I am ordained.  
Look at that now, here's the mandate.  
We're on to, I am ordained, a preacher, a preacher, someone who announces to others, who errors the message to others.  
We're on to, I am ordained, a preacher.  
 And on a puzzle, I speak the truth in Christ and I lie not a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.  
Come on.  
Now, that's Paul, you may say, but I'm glad he started with the word preacher.  
Okay?  
So, you may say, I don't know how to preach, but well, can you tell it?  
Then tell it.  
 Can you sing it?  
Then sing it.  
Where until I am ordained a singer?  
Wow.  
You say, well, I'm just a cell leader.  
Well, where until I'm ordained a cell leader?  
He says, where until?  
That means it is onto the gospel, onto that message of his ransom that we read in verse six.  
 It's about that message, and the man behind the message.  


  
So here is my mandate.  
The mandate is the command, the authoritative command, to go and tell it.  
He authorized me to tell it.  
 He authorized me to tell it.  
He commanded me to preach it.  
Now, you know, years ago, I was driven by the command because he commanded me to do it.  
But the more I love Jesus and understood  
 His person and His message, the more I loved Him, the more I was sunk into Him.  
And I found out something beautiful.  
Let's read from St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 14, from verse 15.  
Let's begin with 15.  
 But yeah, if you love me, he says, keep my commandments.  
How simple?  
He didn't say, if you love me sing it.  
Did he say that?  
If you love me, tell me.  
Is that what he said?  
If you love me, explain it.  
If you love me, hug me.  
Embrace me.  
If you love me, give me an offering.  
 That's not what he said.  
He said, if you love me, keep my commandments to what I tell you to do.  
So I found the love of Jesus became a driving force, a driving force.  
I can't keep his message to myself.  
I gotta tell somebody else why I love Jesus.  
He told me to tell you.  
 of his liquid luck.  
He told me to tell the whole world of his saving message, of his gospel, to let them know he came to save them, to let them know he died in their place, that he was crucified.  
He died for them, and was buried, and God raised them up.  
 He said, tell them, because only if they know will they be saved.  
That's the message of salvation.  
There's no other way.  
And we read that the other day where he said, for there's not other name on that heaven given amongst men whereby he must be saved.  
How could you be quiet?  
 How could you love Jesus and be quiet about his gospel?  
Is it possible?  
No.  
If you can be quiet, you don't know him.  
You don't know him.  
You don't love him.  
You don't know him.  
And I say, to know him is to love him.  
And that's the truth.  
To know Jesus is to love Jesus.  
 Because the more you know him, the more you are absorbed into his person.  
How could you ever say no?  
How could you?  
Is it possible?  
Is it possible to turn away from Jesus, not when you look at his eyes?  
Not when you truly see him.  
No, not when you encounter Jesus.
