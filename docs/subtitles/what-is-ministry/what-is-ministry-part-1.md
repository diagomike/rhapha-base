title: What is Ministry Part 1
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and He left us with a message to tell the on-tones.  
A message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and His unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
From all around the world, many journey from far and near to attend meetings with the man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Always at these meetings, the Word of God is deeply taught.  
The presence of the Lord is greatly experienced and the atmosphere abuzz with the power of God.  
Many who attend are completely transformed and inspired, leaving with testimonies.  
Teaching and training people on different platforms, Pastor Chris has taught men and women the Word of God, which has helped improve their lives.  
 One of such meetings is the International School of Ministry Ministries Network Conference with the Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
Over 5,000 ministers and leaders of the gospel from different ministries from around the world came for this three-day annual conference.  
They came to be seasoned by the word of grace and truth and to receive words that will set them on course and prepare them for a glorious and higher level of work in ministry.  
 The International School of Ministry Minister's Network Conference 2015 was superlative.  
It was a time of worship, divine positioning, and a higher realm of revelation of God's Word.  
This fourth edition embraced ministers from over 105 nations of the world.  
 And when the man of God, Pastor Chris, mounted the stage, many shouted for joy as it was their set time to receive all that God has prepared for them in this conference.  
The ministers enjoyed the tutelage of the man of God as he enlightened them on the importance of prayer in the life of a believer.  
In the place of prayer where you receive impartations, ministrations, visions, and guidance from the Holy Spirit and so much more,  
 The man of God began by enlightening the ministers on the importance of walking with the Spirit of God to achieve his purpose for their lives.  
He taught on the importance and benefits of prayer, explaining from the scriptures he spoke extensively on vital truths about ministry.  
Be blessed as you watch.  
Last night, I started sharing some thoughts with you, which is my hope to  
 Complete that little part so I can get into another part because we have, for the first day, there's an area of emphasis.  
And that particular area has to do with prayer.  
And we have some parts to finish up.  
So we can get into today's emphasis.  
 And then tomorrow we have a very different kind of meeting.  


  
So last night, I got somewhere in discussing with you the intercessory part of ministry so that you can, as a minister of God,  
 Work with the Spirit of God to achieve His purpose.  
It's His purpose.  


  
You know, Jesus said the harvest is plenty.  
It's ready.  
 It's ripe.  
He said, but the labor is a few.  
Then he said, pray ye the Lord of the harvest that he would sing forth labor as into his harvest.  
It is not our harvest.  
It is his harvest.  
He owns the harvest.  
So he access to praying.  
 that the Lord would send laborers into His harvest.  
The harvest belongs to Him.  
It doesn't belong to us.  
It's His harvest.  
Secondly, Jesus said, I will build my church.  
It's not our church.  
It is His church.  
 So there are certain things that we need to understand.  
He's called us into his harvest.  
It matters how we perform in his harvest.  
He's called us into his church.  
It matters how we perform in his church.  
We have to do everything according to his instruction, not our desires.  
 As we grow, we line up our desires with His.  
You see that?  
We don't try to line up His desires with ours.  
We are the ones to follow Him.  
He is not the one to follow us.  
You know, when you are a babe in Christ, you tell God what you want.  
You say, Lord, I want this job.  
 Lord, I want this house.  
Lord, I want this and I want that and I want the other.  
You tell him what you want because you are in babe.  
When you grow up, things change.  
You discover he doesn't take instructions from you.  
You know, when you're a kid, your dad is going out and saying, Daddy, buy me a toy.  
 Get me new shoes when you're coming back.  
What does daddy say?  
That's fine.  
That's okay.  
Why?  
Because you're a kid.  
When you grow up, when dad's going out, he gives you the instructions.  
He says, do this and fix that and do that and deal with it.  
Things have changed.  
He gives you instructions.  
So as a minister, as you mature, you discover a heavenly Father doesn't take instructions from you.  
 You take instructions from him.  
So when you hear people say, I told God, I don't want this.  
When I listen, I say, wow, you told God.  
He must be really great.  
I can dare that.  
I told God, I don't want this.  
I told God, I want another job.  
I told God, they're testifying.  
They told God.  
Do you know who he is?  
You told him.  
 That what?  
You're not afraid?  
You told him, because you're a baby.  


  
How about, thank God, say we can ask what we will, yes, for children?  


  
Children, ask what they will.  
 And the father does it for them because they are children.  
When you grow up, you discover you don't dare ask what you will, what you will you.  
When you grow up, you submit your will to his will as a sign of groups.  
I can't tell where I want to go.  
 I tell God I want to go to where?  
I want to do what?  
Am I crazy?  


  
You see, but when you haven't grown up, you tell him things.  
I want this and I want that.  
You told us if we ask, you will do it.  
Go ahead and ask.  
The only things you ask, that in intercession,  
 when you're interested in for a sinner, for a transgressor, for someone who has missed the way.  
That's when you ask.  


  
Otherwise, you receive instructions what the Holy Spirit tells you to do.  
You know, even though someone can be a pastor or an evangelist  
 a prophet, any minister.  
You still have to grow.  
You are not mature just because you are college.  
The calling doesn't mature you.  
So as we grow, we learn that the grace is increased and then we can accomplish those things that he has called us to do.  
Hallelujah.  
 I was telling you yesterday that in a session it's important.  
Prayer is important.  
Prayer.  
Don't be too tired to pray.  
Don't think that prayer is for those who don't know what to do.  
No.  
Prayer is important.  
In the place of prayer, you receive  
 Impatations from the Holy Spirit.  
You receive ministrations from the Holy Spirit.  
You receive visions from the Holy Spirit.  
You receive guidance from the Holy Spirit.  
Prayer is important.  


  
Without that kind of prayer, I'll be like a blind man.  
 And because I don't want to be a blind man, I spend time to pray.  
Because when I close my eyes to pray to God I see.  
Prayer is too important.  
And sometimes, remember, you don't even know what to say in prayer.  
It is not important that you know what to say when you pray.  
Why?  
 when you pray in the Spirit, when you pray in tongues, you don't know what you're saying, do you?  
No.  
It's a fellowship.  


  
It's a fellowship.  
You're getting more and more acquainted with Him.  
There you be amazed at how the Holy Spirit teaches you.  
The Holy Spirit is the greatest teacher.  
 He would teach you things you never thought you would ever discover.  
Things that would take people years to find out.  
He can teach you in a few moments.  
So I share with you my personal experience of the Holy Spirit.  
That's what I'm sharing with you.  
 It is my personal experience of the Holy Spirit, what he did in my life.  
So he's not someone that I just read of.  
He's someone I've come to know.  
You're following this?  
Hallelujah.  
 I said, if you want to produce children, spiritual children, it is very different from combats.  
Galatians chapter 4, because I read to you yesterday from the Old Testament, but I want to  
 show it to you as well in the New Testament.  
So you see, because you saw as soon as Zion travilled, she brought forth her children.  
That's what you saw.  
Galatians chapter 4 verse 19.  
Let's see what the great apostle Paul tells us here.  
This is my little children of whom I travilled in birth again until Christ be found in you.  
 again of whom I travel in birth again, which means he traveled before.  
That's what brought them forth.  
So when Paul traveled, he brought for children in Galatia.  
 But now that some others were causing them to fall out of the way and become fleshly minded, he goes back to what?  
Traveling again.  
That Christ may be formed in them.  
Which means that when members of the church are not doing well and moving backward and getting carnal, we don't criticize them.  
We don't get mad at them.  
We go back to prayer.  
 We travel in birds again until Christ be formed in them.  
See how important that is.  
So I told you, Christian ministry is not, there are no shortcuts.  
There are no shortcuts.  


  
 Most days I pray with tears.  
I can't even hold them back.  
Most days, almost every day.  


  
You say, why?  
Because of what I see in the Word and in what I see outside.  


  
 The words of Jesus come to my heart where he said that they may know you, the only true God.  
And Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.  
That was the desire of Jesus Christ.  
He said, I want the world to know that I love the Father.  
How powerful.  
He always wanted the world to know that he loved the Father.  
He demonstrated his love for the Father.  
That's what Jesus was.  
 He was bold to express his love for the Father.  
The Father's words were the most important things in the mouth of Jesus.  
Oh, he talked about his Father.  
That's what was supposed to be.  
But you know, you can only talk about one that you are going to do.  
 And that's why I tell you about prayer because prayer is that fellowship with the Father and Son Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit.  


  
 As a minister of God, you can work with the Spirit of God to achieve His purpose.  
In this segment of the International School of Ministry Minister's Network Conference with the Man of God, Pastor Chris, learn more about the importance of prayer and how we can fellowship with the Father through His Son, Jesus Christ.  
Be blessed as you watch.  
You are watching the International School of Ministry Minister's Network Conference with Pastor Chris.  
 This conference had in attendance over 5,000 ministers representing over 105 nations.  
Watch and be blessed.  
What is ministry?  
What release ministry?  
Is ministry the organizing of a church?  
No?  
Is ministry?  
 the structuring of some form of congregation and the administration and the different groups of the congregation.  
Is that the, no?  
Is ministry preaching?  
No.  
What is ministry?  
Ministry is found in something Jesus said.  
 In St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 7, when you read from verse 37, let's read, St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 7, from verse 37.  
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, if any man thirsts, let him come on to me and drink, oh God.  
 He that believed on me, as the scripture had said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."  
That is ministry.  
I'll explain it to you.  
That is where ministry is.  
In the King James translation and a few other translations, there is a little bit of a problem.  
 And that's why so many try to find where did Jesus, you know, he said, if you really like it is here, he that believed it on me as the scripture had said, out of his belly of low rivers of living water.  
So you think Jesus is caught in scripture.  
It's because there's something wrong with the punctuation.  
The Kumar, after he that believed it on me,  
 He's a problem.  
Take it away and you get exactly what that scripture is saying.  
Hear that, believe it, on me as the scripture has said.  
You get it?  
Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
So he's saying, if you believe as the scripture has said,  
 Rivers of living water will flow out of you.  
You get it?  
So this is ministry.  
It is the outflow of the rivers of living water in you.  
Rivers of living water.  
The next verse, you'll see what he's talking about.  
The next verse.  
 He says, but this speck ye of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive, for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified.  
So you see, the rivers of living waters talking about is the Holy Spirit.  
That's ministry.  
Where you're pouring out the life of the Spirit of God that's flowing from you, you can't give what you don't have.  
 out of his belly, out of his enormous being shall flow, rivers of living water.  
When you understand this, it is higher than every structure you could ever build.  
It is higher than every kind of organization you could ever raise.  
The ministry of the Holy Spirit pouring out rivers of living water.  
 Rivers of live in water.  
Rivers of live in water.  


  
I think I'll explain that a little farther.  
Let's look at something here so you can get it.  
Jesus, in his discussion in St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 6,  
 It's an extraordinary portion of the Bible where Jesus reveals so much.  
In fact, you'll find somebody in chapter six, chapter seven and chapter eight in Jones Gospel.  
But let's look at something here.  
In the 63rd, let's begin from verse 60.  
I'll take it all the way.  
You'd see a lot of things.  
I hope that would make me digress.  
Okay.  
 Many, therefore, of His disciples, when they had heard this, said, this is an odd saying.  
Who can hear it?  
Because it's talking about, you know, some things about Himself.  
They didn't like what He said.  
So, next verse, verse 61, when Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured at Him, He said unto them, that this offend you.  
Even Jesus' disciples murmured against Him.  
They didn't like some things He said.  


  
 You know, as a man of God, it's not everything you say that people are going to like.  
Even your closest disciples.  
Look at that.  
He's disciples didn't like what he said.  
So when Jesus knew in himself that he's disciples, murmured at it, he said on to them, the disoffanged you, 62.  
Who would I need if he shall see the Son of Man?  
I sent up who he was before.  
Did he care about that?  
No.  
Look at what he said, I love this.  
 It is the Spirit that quickens it.  
That means that gives life.  
It is the Spirit that gives life.  
I want to impress this upon you.  
It is the Spirit that gives life.  
 It is the spirit and quickness.  
The flesh profited nothing.  
The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.  
The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.  
So Jesus' words were not ordinary.  
That's what I wanted.  
 I wanted to speak words that were spirits and life.  
I didn't want to be an orator.  
I didn't want to be a nice talker.  
I didn't want to be a good preacher.  
No, I wanted to release words that were spirits and life.  
So I understood when Jesus said, out of his belly shall flow, rivers of living water.  
 Meaning that I could pour out spirit and life through words.  
Yes, I thought that means I can be different.  
I can be different.  
My words do not be ordinary.  
Spirit and life.  
Spirit and life.  
Yes.  
Yes.  
Spirit and life.  


  
 Glory to God.  
You're still there?  
Yeah, this is very important.  
Very important.  
Very important.  
Pouring out spirit and life.  
Every time you stand in front of the congregation as you speak, things happen.  
You know?  
You heard the testimony on Sunday, those of you who were here.  
 when the young guy who had lost his mind and couldn't coordinate himself.  
He was in the meeting.  
He said, as Pasakris walked by, the devil went out of him.  
There have been so many such testimonies.  
They're listening, and as they listen, the demons just come out.  
 A young girl told a story.  
She was brought into the church.  
While she was sitting and listening, she said she didn't even know what I said.  
But she was just listening.  
And suddenly, the evil spirits that had bound her for so long, many years, went out of her and was looking at her and threatening her, but couldn't stay.  
She knew why the devil was afraid.  
She said the devil was afraid of what Pastor Chris was saying.  
And then he ran out of the church.  


  
 And many have come in and when they get up to leave the service, they've been healed.  
They can understand it.  
They've been healed.  
The sadness that came with left them.  
There was no prayer.  
They were just listening.  
 Somebody said, I've been sick for so long, but I noticed that every time I came to church, I got better.  
Every time I came, I got better.  
So I decided I'll just keep coming and keep getting better.  
Because the words are spirits, and they are what?  
Life.  
Let me show you something.  
Ezekiel chapter 47, in we will start reading from verse 1.  


  
 He brought me again onto the door of the house.  
And behold, what has issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward?  
For the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, and the south side of the altar.  
Next verse.  
Then brought he meet out of the way of the gate notward.  
 led me about the way without onto the Auto Gate, by the way that look at Eastward, and behold, there run out waters on the right side.  
And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth Eastward, he measured the thousand qubits and brought me through the waters, the waters where to the ankles.  
Again, he measured the thousand and brought me through the waters, the waters where to the knees.  
 Again, imagine the thousand and brought me through the water's way to the lines.  
What's happening?  
The deeper we went into the water, the more you see, the water was rising.  
It was more and more water, okay?  
Watch.  
Afterward, he measured the thousand and it was a river that I could not pass over.  
For the waters were reason, waters to swim in.  
Where was the water coming from?  
From the temple.  
 All right?  
For the waters were reason.  
Water's so swimming.  
A river that could not be passed over.  
The water's coming from the house of God.  
Who's the house of God today?  
You.  
Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
Now watch what the water does.  
Watch what the water does.  
Next verse.  
And he said unto me, son of man has thou seen this?  
Then he brought me and cast me to return to the brink of the water, of the river.  
 Now, when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river, were very many trees on the one side and on the other, then said he unto me, these waters issue out toward the east country and go down into the desert, hallelujah, and go into the sea, which being brought forth into the sea as the waters, coming from God's house, get into the sea.  
He says, the waters shall be healed.  
 When the Bible talks about sea, it's talking about multitudes of people.  
And the water's coming from God's house.  
He says, so much water at the initial stage.  
It was so low.  
It was to the ankle.  
Then there's more water to the knees.  
Then there's more water to the loins.  
Then it became so much enough water to swim in.  
 See, when that power of the Spirit of God flows from your life, it's a gosha.  
It's a gosha.  
I told you yesterday, praying in tongues.  
When you start like that, that's to the uncle.  


  
 It's just to the ankle.  
It's not that it's moving you.  
The more you speak, then, to the knees.  
By now, you're beginning to do like this.  


  
At that time, you know what you do?  
You're able to kneel down.  
 But when you do law, it gets here.  
At that time, when you're praying, you find your hand going like this, cop, I have all know the Messiah.  
Have you noticed when you prayed?  
Your hand just automatically goes here.  
You didn't try to do it.  
It just goes here.  
And if you do law, oh God.  


  
 Then you don't want to stop.  
Then you're stubborn like a drunk man.  
The next thing you might even be rolling on the floor.  
Now you don't care where you are.  
Ha ha!  
Oh, my God.  
Yes.  
Then you're full of the Holy Ghost.  
Then you are ready to pour farts from within you out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
 At such a time, it doesn't matter how you're going to preach or teach, don't worry.  
Don't worry.  
Even if the spirit is leading you to just read a scripture, read it, something will happen.  
And you don't need to be looking around for something to happen.  
Because it may not happen during the service.  


  
Sometimes as people are going home.  
 That's when you're not in the headstand.  
And they will remember he was in the service.  
That the power of God came on.  
You know, I've had such meetings that I tell the people as the known incomes on them.  
And I say, whatever you're wearing now, because the anointing is on it.  
When you get back home, put it on someone who's sick.  
Or you can go to the hospital.  
Maybe get a sick one.  
 Put it on that wand and, oh God, what testimonies we have received.  
It's amazing.  
What testimonies we have received.  
Still to come, learn how your words can become spirit and life through the power of the Holy Ghost.  
Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
Be blessed as you watch.  
Awesome, awesome.  
 I was sharing one of those beautiful testimonies.  
We had a meeting in December, just this past December.  
And it was in Benin.  
How many thousands of people were there?  
You remember?  
You were the chief host.  
How many?  
A hundred thousand.  
This last one.  
 Okay, now, it was actually over 100,000.  
He's trying to be conservative.  
Yeah, well over 100,000 people.  
Now, think about this.  
Think about this.  
When I was ministering to them, there was a group, the Spirit of God was leading me about a group of young people who had been involved in violent crime.  
And so,  
 They came forward.  
These guys were not born again.  
Do you understand?  
They were invited.  
The criminals.  
And so they're standing there, and they're not in those on me.  
And at least they're not in on them.  
And they all went under the power.  
These criminals.  
 You know, the power bar came on them, and they went on their backs to the floor, and they were taken away into the counseling area.  
Then one of them spotted a pastor, one of the ones who came to minister to them.  
He started crying.  
And they wondered, why was crying?  
 He said, I knew you.  
I've been to your house twice to try to kill you.  
But I couldn't.  


  
He had come there twice to kill him.  
And now that's a prostitute to counsel him.  


  
 Those are the things that not in God does for you.  
They don't even do things that you cannot calculate with your mind.  
Things you can't make ready by yourself, but you trust in Him.  
Hallelujah.  
How much faith do you need?  
All the faith the Word of God will give you.  
Faith comes by hearing.  
 hearing by the Word of God.  
Don't have a fight with your faith.  
Don't be struggling with your faith.  
Not too many Christians who struggle with their faith.  
Until they almost think that this message of faith  
 Maybe it's not real, maybe it's confusing, maybe they have a lot of maybes because they try and they try and they try.  
But faith is very simple.  
It is the response of the human spirit to the Word of God.  
It is not the response of your mind.  
It is the response of your spirit.  
The Bible says, with the heart, man, believe it.  
You don't believe with your mind.  
You believe with your heart.  
 Not with your mind.  
You can understand something.  
You can reason with your mind.  
But faith is not in the realm of reason.  
You see it?  
For example, if you've been educated in biology or medicine, you know that it is absolutely impossible for a woman to conceive a child.  
 Without a male or human sperm, you know it is impossible.  
How can you explain the birth of Jesus?  
What reasoning will you give it?  
It'll mess up your mind.  
If you try to reason it out, it'll mess up your mind.  
It's not in the realm of reason.  
You've got to accept what God said in his word.  
 How can you explain that a man who died in the way that Jesus was crucified?  
Let me remind you that a Roman soldier thrust a spear through his side and all the blood of Jesus Christ drained out.  
I want to remind you, there was no more blood in his body.  
 Jesus died.  
He was buried.  
For 30, this Jesus was raised from the dead, without any human agency.  
The Bible records that the Spirit of God came upon his body, and he was raised.  
 alive, how can you explain that with your biology and your medicine?  
You see it?  
It's not in the realm of reason.  
You see, how do you explain when we're minister to someone who was born without an eardrum?  
And suddenly that's hearing.  
How can you explain it?  
How can you explain it?  
 With what science?  
A moment ago he could not hear because he was diagnosed or had no eardrop.  
Then suddenly he starts hearing, how can you explain that?  


  
How can you explain someone having several tests from several labs?  
 comes positive with HIV.  
It is into this meeting.  
Has Haynes laid?  
Only that.  
And his words, only that, walks out of that place, goes to the same laboratories and tests negative.  
How can you explain?  


  
 There's no way.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
But Jesus already gave us the key.  
He said, the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.  
Remember, not everybody's words are spirit and life.  
 But your words can be spirit and life through the power of the Holy Spirit.  
Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.  
Hallelujah.  
That's ministry.  
Your ministering spirit and life.  
 That's ministry.  
Until you minister spirit and life, you are not from Jesus Christ.  
You're not a minister from Jesus Christ.  
No, Jesus, minister spirit and life.  
Spirit and life.  
Hallelujah.  
Let me show you something Jesus said, very important.  
In Saint Mark's Gospel chapter 12,  
 Who's that reading from verse 24?  
Oh God, so come on, De La Guebra, this is this.  
Oh.  


  
And Jesus answering said unto them, do you not therefore air because you know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God,  
 Oh, two things.  
They were asking Jesus questions.  
They thought they were smarts.  
And they said there were seven brothers and each one died.  
I haven't married the same woman.  
You know, this one died and the other man took over and died without an issue.  
The other one took over and then finally all seven of them had out there and then they all died.  
And so he varies life after death.  
 Whose wife will she be at the resurrection?  
They thought they were so smart.  
They thought they got Jesus.  
And he just looked at them.  
He said, see, you're airing because you don't know the Scriptures.  
You don't know the power of God.  
And when he said you don't know the Scriptures, in the Greek language with which it was presented,  
 He's referring to idol, idol knowledge and awareness.  
Not a scientific knowledge, nozzis.  
You see, not someone just studying the scriptures, an awareness.  
You become aware of something after you have received it.  
You're not trying to find out you are now aware.  
 John uses that term mostly in his epistles, an awareness.  
You have become aware.  
He says, you don't know the scriptures, on the power of God.  
He says, that's why you act.  
 Don't try to reason out the Scriptures.  
The Scriptures will interpret Scriptures.  
The Scriptures are God's word.  
It's given to us in spiritual construction.  
That's why you have to study the Scriptures when it's given you information in past days or in present days or in future tense.  
For the Bible says, our Scripture is given by inspiration of God.  
 inspiration of God.  
So you find out, is he talking about something in the future?  
Is he talking about a present hour statement of fact, a reality for the moment?  
Is he making a promise?  
They have differences.  
They have differences.  
 And this is so important as a minister of God that you're able to give to God's children the right food.  
Then there'll be the right growth.  
Where people feed on the wrong things, they grow wrongly too.  
Some people are not starving, they're just eating the wrong things.  


  
 Where is God?  
You're still there?  
Let's just finish reading it.  
24th verse, as in Mark's Gospel, chapter 12.  
And Jesus answered and said unto them, do you not?  
Therefore, because you know not the Scriptures, neither the power of God.  
Next verse.  
For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels which are in heaven.  
That's wonderful.  
And as touching the dead,  
 Oh God!  
Say, Brodon, go skate, or a hat, this.  
Did you notice what he did?  
Go back to verse 25.  
For when they shall rise from the dead, they need them married, not given in marriage, but as the angels, which are in heaven.  
See, he's explaining Scripture to them.  
Then he goes to the next thing.  
 And I was touching the dead that the rise, have you not read in the book of Moses?  
How in the bush God speak unto him saying in the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?  
Simple.  
He shows them the power of God and he shows them proof from Scripture.  
He said, didn't you read in Scripture?  
They were ignorant of the Scripture.  
Didn't you read in Scripture?  
 That God said I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  
 Is he the God of the dead?  
How can God say, I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?  
He didn't say, I was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  
If he had said, I was the God, meaning they are dead.  
But he says, I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  
That means it's not the God of the dead.  
Meaning Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive.  
That's what Jesus is teaching.  
 How to understand Scripture?  


  
Did you remember when it challenged Jesus?  
And he referred to Abraham and he said, he's talking about Abraham.  
 You are not yet 50 years old.  
They looked at him as a young man.  
33, come on.  
You are not yet 50 years old, and have you seen Abraham?  
Because he said, Abraham rejoice to see my day.  
They said, we said you were crazy all the time.  
You are not yet 50 years old, and have you seen Abraham?  
Then he said, before Abraham was,  
 Notice, I want you to notice again the construction of Scripture.  
He didn't say to them, before Abraham was, I was.  
That would be accurate.  
That would mean I existed before Abraham.  
Before Abraham was, I was.  
But he didn't say that.  
 He said, before Abraham was, I am.  
Now, that should have been bad language, but the Jews immediately knew what he was talking about.  
Because he used the same term, which God used when he spoke to Moses.  
When Moses said, what is your name?  
He said, I am!  
So they picked up stones.  
They understood he was not just giving them a grammatical construction.  
 They wanted to kill him.  
So he said, why do you understand me?  
They said, because of you being a man, you're making yourself equal with God.  
Hallelujah.  
So you have to understand Scripture.  
It will make you fall in love with your Bible when you study.  
 It'll make you fall in love with your mind.  
When you study, be excited at what you find.  
You would dance, you would rejoice, you'd be so glad when you learned to take a scriptural as God's word.  
And that this is not a mistake.  
It is God's communication.  
Spirits, bearing witness with spirits.  
Hallelujah.
