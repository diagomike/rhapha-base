title: September 2023 â€“ The Month of Harvest
---
 St.  
Luke's Gospel, chapter 10, from verse 1.  


  
After these things, the Lord appointed others 70 also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself would come.  
 Therefore said he unto them, the harvest truly is great.  
For the laborers are few.  
Three there for the Lord of the harvest that he will send forth laborers into his harvest.  
He said the harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few.  
Three there for the Lord of the harvest that he will send for laborers into his harvest.  
Now that's not to say,  
 that the laborers will always be few.  
No, he said pray that the Lord of the harvest will send for laborers into his harvest.  
So when he does, the laborers will no longer be few.  


  
Let's read another.  
St.  
John's Gospel chapter four.  
 from verse 34.  
Jesus said unto them, my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.  
Now you remember here in this chapter, Jesus was at the well in the city of Samaria and a woman met him there.  
 who came there to fetch water.  
And Jesus talked to the lady, and she believed he was the Christ, and went into the city to tell others about him.  
And by the time the crowd came, the master's disciples also returned from where they had gone.  
 So they said to a master, he got to eat something because they all hadn't eaten.  
And so they went to buy food.  
And the master said, I have food to eat that you don't know anything about.  
So they were wondering, did anybody give him something to eat?  
And then he responded with this answer.  
 Jesus said unto them, my meat is to do the will of him that sent me unto finish his work.  
That's really from the new King James translation.  
Jesus said to them, my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.  
Wonderful.  
Now let's keep reading with the King James translation.  
Let's move to the next verse.  
 Say not he, there are yet four months, and then commit harvest.  
Behold, I say, only you lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are quite already to harvest.  
Next verse.  
And he, that repeat, receive it wages, and gather it full on to life eternal, but he that soeth and he, that repeat, may rejoice together.  
 And Aaron is that saying, true, one saw it and another, read it.  
I sent you to read that we're on your bestowed, no labor.  
Other men labored.  
And he entered into their labors.  
Wonderful.  


  
He said, don't you say it's four months before harvest time?  
 He says, look.  
So lift up your eyes and look on the fields.  
They're white already for harvest.  
It's harvest.  
It's harvest time now.  
You don't have to wait for another four months.  
The field is right for harvest.  


  
And then he says, do you look at the next verse?  
 He that ripeth received wages and gathered fruit onto life eternal.  
So he's not talking about wheat and corn, talking about life eternal, talking about winning souls.  
He had just preached salvation to a lady who believed in him and went to the city to bring others  
 And when they came, they believed.  
They said to the woman, we now, we believe because we've heard him for ourselves, not just because of what you told us, but even now we've heard for ourselves, they believed.  
Wonderful.  
So in connection with soul winning, he talked about this,  
 Harvest, gathering fruit onto life eternal.  
This month of September is a month of harvest.  


  
So this month as a month of harvest,  
 Number one, win souls everywhere.  
You gotta win souls everywhere.  
Be decisive.  
You're gonna win souls everywhere.  
Talk about Jesus like never before.  
Number two, set up sares everywhere.  
Set up sares.  
 Set upstairs everywhere.  
As your winning souls, set upstairs.  
You lead people to Christ, tell those ones to lead others to Christ and to meet somewhere.  
Set upstairs everywhere.  
And number three, give into God's work.  
Now,  
 two things that helps you about in giving into God's work.  
Because you see, there's a move to impoverished nations.  
Understand what I'm telling you.  
There's a move to impoverished nations.  
And this is the devil's idea.  
 So more and more nations are going to find themselves in financial streets.  


  
It's well orchestrated.  
But God's people have a way out.  


  
Giving is the way.  
 given is the way, given into God's work.  
So I said two things happened for you on that.  
Number one, in giving into God's work, you are furthering God's work.  
So that is in furtherance of God's work.  
Number two, it turns out for your prosperity.  
 And so the systems of this world can't hold you back.  
Can't hold you back.  
It's just God's way.  
It's God's plan.  
That's the way it works.  
You give into God's work.  
The more you give into God's work, the more you, you ensure.  
 your own financial freedom and prosperity.  
Because then it's God's responsibility to give you a harvest on your giving.  
And that goes beyond the system of this world.  
 And watch what happens to you in this next few, this is the last quarter of the year.  
For example, you got just these next four months, September, October, November, and December.  
See what God will do in your life.  
But you got to start now.  
You start now, start early, start now.  
I said, two things happen in your giving into God's work and be specific.  
Number one, it furthers the work.  
 And number two, it turns out for your prosperity.  
So is that in spite of what's happening, God's blessings turn back to you in abundance.  
It promotes you.  
That's the way to do it.  
There's no other way.  
There's no other way.  
If there was another way, it would be in the scripture.  
When you look at  
 From the Old Testament into the new, the teaching of God's world is consistent.  
Whenever people were in financial straits, when they were in financial difficulties, economic hardships, he prospered them through their giving.  
He cost them to give,  
 Now that's interesting because how can you explain it?  
Here is someone who is in need and then God tells the person that is in need to give.  
Well, because those are spiritual principles.  
What is doing for you is  
 is taking you from the mentality and consciousness of lack and want into the consciousness of grace.  
The consciousness of grace.  
So he turns you from one who is in need to one who is gracious, rather than looking towards God's grace, you become a gracious person.  
 Because if we can change your state of mind, if we can change your consciousness to thinking like him, then you find your prosperity starts flowing like him.  
Maybe I should read something to you.  
Second Corinthians chapter eight, let's read from verse 16 to verse seven, NIV.  
Make it simpler for you.  
 So we had started since he had earlier made a beginning to bring also to completion this act of grace, act of grace on your part.  
Interesting.  
Read this.  
But just as you excel in everything, in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us, see that you also excel in this grace of giving.  
 Did you see that?  
It tells you to excel in the grace of giving.  
Giving is a grace.  
It brings you into a level of thinking that's different.  
Suddenly you find that a man with very little suddenly by giving has the consciousness of a giver rather than one who is the needy.  
 And the moment God can create that consciousness in your spirits, suddenly things have come into you.  
That's why Jesus taught his disciples that it is more blessed to give than to receive.  
Can you see it?  
Because you see, the giver has a promise.  
 He has a promise of blessings coming to him.  
He has a promise of abundance coming to him.  
The receiver has no promise.  
So you become a giver and the next thing you know, more is coming to you.  
And then you give again and more comes.  
That's the way you keep lifting yourself.  
You will come out of whatever class you've been.  
This is the way.  
 This is the way.  
You start doing it and you start doing it early.  
Learn it and start doing it.  
You will find that month after month things are changing in your personal life.  
Until you come to the point in your life, it doesn't matter what the economic situation is.  
It can't hold you down.  
You know the secret now.  
You've passed that level.  
 So learn what I just told you is the way, is the secret.  
So you follow God's work and you get into this consciousness of prosperity.  
It only happens to you through this grace of giving.  
I love what he called it.  
It's a grace, grace of giving, glory to God.  
See the needy,  
 requires someone to be gracious toward him.  
But the giver demonstrates grace.  
See, he demonstrates grace, which is in the nature of God.  
That's what leaves him from being a needy to a prosperous man or woman.  
Practice what I told you.  
You will have testimonies.  
 You will have amazing testimonies.  
Many already do anyway.  
A whole lot of people do.  
They've been practicing what I just shared with you.  
And they have amazing testimonies.  
You can join.  
Become, make up your mind.  
You're going to be that way.  
And increase in your capacity.  
Increase in your capacity.  
Never stop, because if you stop, then the economic situation will grow more than you.  
 And if it grows more than you suddenly become needy, things are looking difficult, things become challenging.  
And then you say, oh, I don't know, something's happening to my business.  
It's going down.  
Now you're looking at the wrong thing.  
You're beginning to think that your prosperity is from your business.  
It's no.  
That's not the way your business will prosper through your giving.  
As you give your business prosperous,  
 That's the way.  
It says, promotion doesn't come from the east or west or south.  
It comes from God.  
It comes from God.  
Alleluia.  
So this is your month of harvest and you are part of God's harvest.  
You're winning source and you're giving into God's work.  
This is your month.  
You're going to demonstrate it.  
 You will demonstrate that you will win souls and you will give it to God's work.  
Because God's work is about winning others.  
It's about winning others.  
Changing our world with salvation and righteousness.  
Blessed be God.  
Hallelujah.
