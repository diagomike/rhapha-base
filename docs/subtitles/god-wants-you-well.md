title: God Wants You Well
---
 The purpose of God for all mankind from the beginning of the world had been clearly set out in the Bible.  
Jeremiah 29, 11.  
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, sayeth the Lord.  
Thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end.  
It's God's desire for everyone to live a good life.  
A life of success and vitality  
 He wants every man, woman, or child to live in peace and well-being.  
But so many are not able to live and enjoy life this way due to ill health and torment in their souls and bodies.  


  
Cancers, asthma, arthritis, and other such conditions prevent many from carrying out their normal function and makes their everyday existence a worrisome agony.  


  
 God sent His Son Jesus to suffer and die for all mankind.  
And because of His death, we can now live a life free of any pain or suffering.  
This truth is so evident in this day and age in the ministry of God's servant, Pastor Chris.  
Through the ministry of Pastor Chris, so many who were afflicted and oppressed are liberated as they come in contact with the Word of God and the power of God in these meetings.  


  
 For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.  
In the name of Jesus, Son of the living God, Pastor Chris cast out devils and all kinds of diseases.  
He pronounces health and the people are made whole again.  
Indeed, the love God has for all is abundantly manifested in His care and interest in each and everyone.  
 He came that we might live life to the full, free from every limitation, free to live to our full potentials.  
Laura Bryce, a medical doctor who became a preacher, lived with great strain and limitations for most of her life.  
 She had several debilitating diseases and conditions that prevented her from really living.  
She had asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, hiatus hernia, hypertension, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, joint pains, and gallstones in her gallbladder.  
 I was very very ill with asthma and bronchial asthma and develop into bronchiaectasis.  
Also there's a leakage in my heart valve and there is some obstructions in my lungs.  
 And of course, I develop all different types of sicknesses.  
I was in intensive care.  
 I was in coronary care.  
I came out.  
I was resuscitated three times.  
The doctors gave me up and they told me nothing they could do.  
These problems as really and truly as taken over my life.  
 In the aspect of medication, I cannot go out without a nebulizer.  
I'm on oxygen, as you can see.  
My saturated level is, my oxygen level is very low.  
 Her condition was so bad that she could not do anything for herself.  
She had to be wheeled everywhere due to severe pains in her hips and joints.  
She suffered these conditions for 35 years.  
Here we see her husband trying to assist her to stand.  
All pains are in my shoulders and in my knees and in my hip.  
 But she can't because of the excruciating pains in her joints.  
She had to be on an oxygen machine 24 hours a day.  
She was constantly on medication and using the nebulizer.  
The doctors could no longer treat her condition which deteriorated every day.  
 It gets worse.  
Nothing for me gets any easier.  
It gets worse.  
She believed that God could heal her through the man of God, Pastor Chris, and she attended this special healing meeting with Pastor Chris.  
Isn't it wonderful we have hope in Christ?  


  
Wonderful.  
 When the wall says there's no way out, we have the name of Jesus.  
We can trust in that all powerful name.  
Hallelujah.  
At the meeting, Pastor Chris came to Laura, moved with compassion.  
He began to minister to her, the man of God, Pastor Chris encouraged her, letting her know there's hope in Christ.  
 And you can see the hands of compassion as the man of God touches her, already transferring the power of God into it.  
She's responding to it and wanting.  


  
Already the power of God is surging through Laura's body as the man of God transfers the power of God into her chest.  


  
 She's had fluid in her lungs.  
She's not being able to take deep breaths, but right now she's doing that.  
This is her car with that.  
 Wow, the man I've got has taken away.  
The tubes that are fed her with oxygen, this is a miracle and she's still breathing.  
Right now she's breathing in the healing power of God.  
As deep as you can.  
And you can see there's calm on her face, this is a miracle.  


  
 I'm getting rid of this.  
Now the man I've got has instructed him to take away the petals of the wheelchair.  
So now the man of God is, this is a miracle.  
She's actually out of the wheelchair.  
We watched her before.  
Her husband helped her and she couldn't even stand.  
But now she's standing on her own.  
This is the power of God.  


  
 Speaking strength into her body and perfection.  


  
 and this is a miracle just look at the way she's walking strength has obviously come back to this woman the man I've got declared strength declared perfection  


  
 I'm going to preach  


  
 He dwells in me.  
He dwells in me.  
But you never sell.  
You never sell.  
You never sell.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  
I'm full of the Holy Ghost.  


  
 Lord Bruss, a previous invalid is completely healed and free to enjoy life again.  
Strand has been restored to her and she is walking freely completely healed of all her previous ailments.  
 is a new woman with a new lease on life all because of God's love.  
Goodness and mercy.  
Hallelujah.  
 God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him.  
Likewise, the man of God, Pastor Chris, is specially anointed to heal the sick and work mighty miracles by God's awesome power.  
 All over the venues of Master Chris' meetings you hear chunks of joy as those who came in bound and set free by God's mighty power.  
As a result of this, so many phenomenal miracles occur and it's clear to all without any doubt God is interested in their well-being.  
He just gives the word of knowledge or calls out specific cases.  
Suddenly the miracle occurs and the individual gets up.  
 Many who were carried in the meeting suddenly get up walking or those who came with stretchers suddenly get up and start walking.  
A blind person begins to see.  


  
A lame person begins to walk with nobody touching them but the Holy Spirit.  
It's amazing and cannot be explained humanly.  
 Many times, as Jesus did, Pastor Chris touches some and lays his hands on others, and they are made whole again.  
This is the compassion of Jesus for the sick and helpless in action.  
God's love for all is abundantly evident in these meetings.  


  
 This lady had rheumatoid arthritis as a result of which she has been confined to the wheelchair unable to help herself.  


  
Are you ready?  


  
 Peek her up.  
Both sides.  
Father is the name of Jesus.  
Can you see that?  
Look at these hands.  
Look this way.  
Can you see this?  
Can you see that?  
Watch.  
That's the brother.  
What is this?  
Peek her up again.  


  
 Take it in Jesus' name!  
By Allah, mon sautah!  
Pick her up!  
In the name of Jesus, thou devil of darkness!  
Go from that!  
She's free!  
Pick her up!  
Pick her up!  
Let God go!  


  
Look at me!  
You are free!  


  
 Pastor Chris cast out the double responsible for her condition and she has been set totally free.  


  
 This is a mighty miracle.  
She had been confined to the wheelchair, unable to stand.  
But now she is walking all by herself, healed by God's power.  


  
Indeed, God wants everyone well.  
He says, Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.  
 but many suffer from various debilitating conditions, like Kate, whose life grinded to a halt due to heart failure.  
My name is Kate Maruleca.  
In 1999, I started having the problem of the heart, but it became so severe during 2003.  
 where I was in and out of horsebackers and it proceeded and proceeded and I went to many doctors until an operation was done where a machine was put inside me and this machine that helped me to breathe  
 It has cables that comes from it and goes through to the heart.  
So in my heart feels it takes over.  
And my life depends on that machine for me to live.  
So it affected my liver.  
That's the reason my stomach is so big.  
I am not pregnant.  
My liver is swollen.  
 and it affected my kidney.  
I feel like crying sometimes.  
Like I can die in that moment because I'm used to do things for myself.  
I used to depend on myself.  
I'm an independent woman.  
But since the situation is like this in my life, it's very sad.  
 to be in this condition.  
I was planning to have so many things and to achieve so many things.  
I was having goals.  
I was having dreams.  
I was having so many things that I wanted to do.  
But because of this condition, I couldn't.  
I would like God to heal me.  
 and to restore everything that the devil is stolen away from me.  
I want my life back to normal the way it was.  
I want it back.  
Seeking real solutions, Kate came to the healing school.  
We see the man of God approaches Kate with so much anointing.  
He takes a look at her case card and Kate looks at the man of God in anticipation.  
 The man of God stretches for his hand as he begins to minister to her.  
This is a great day for Kate.  
She can feel the power of God moved through her body.  
She's responding to the anointing.  
Kate begins to vibrate.  
The man of God continues to minister to her.  


  
 The man of God moves his hand back and forth over her.  
These are transformation taking place in her body right now, as the anointing begins to destroy the root cause of her sickness.  


  
The man of God commands the sickness out of her.  


  
 He lays his hands on her shoulders, looking intently at her.  


  
Again, he lays his hands over her chest.  
The power of sickness is broken over her life.  
It's a great day for Kate.  
It's a tremendous miracle.  


  
 The yoke of sickness is broken as he declares her free.  
And look at that, she's running completely energized by the power of God.  


  
 Ladies and gentlemen, Kate Manolica is in the house.  


  
Excuse me, where you just hit the thing we watched.  


  
 It was me.  
It was me.  
Yes.  
At that time when the men of God pastor Chris laid his hand over me, I felt like inside my stomach there was some kind of electricity that was moving inside me.  
 Yes, he was praying over me.  
Then I couldn't control myself anymore.  
It was like, I could just, I could just stand out out of that straight line, just run away.  
The Anu Hinti was so heavy.  
Pasta, after I left the healing school on Monday,  
 The third day, everything went down.  
In three days.  
In three days.  
Now I can drink as much as I want.  
I can eat as much as I want to.  
And I have gone back to work again.  
I don't have any problem.  
I'm working every single spot.  


  
This was Kate, so sick and suffering from a heart condition, kidney, and liver complication.  
 at the healing school, the man of God ministered to her.  


  
Glory to God.  
We see a transformed cake.  
Absolutely feel the every trace of informal elements.  
Her stomach is back to normal size.  
Kate has been miraculously healed.  
She has been strengthened and can enjoy life again.  
 signs, wonders, and diverse miracles attest to the presence of a living Jesus in the ministry of the man of God, Pastor Chris, and are a demonstration of God's willingness to heal today as he did in the Bible days.  
God sent His Word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions.  
God is responsible for most sicknesses.  
Most afflictions of the body are caused by demons.  
 And Jesus said in His name, we shall cast our devils.  
Are you ready?  
At the word of healing pronounced by the man of God, Pastor Chris, so many are liberated from all oppressions of the enemy.  
Through faith in these words and prayers by the man of God, so many are made whole again.  
 The Spirit of God moves through the arena healing and uplifting so many as He is not willing that any should suffer or perish.  
Indeed, Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever.  
No matter the case, the power of God is able to bring them healing again.  


  
 There are miracles everywhere, as they receive healing by the love of God.  
They leave the meeting different from the way they came in.  


  
Like the biblical pool Bethesda, these meetings are engagements with the miraculous, and so very many get healed.  
They receive all kinds of amazing miracles.  
 Some come into the meetings, terminally ill, and leave restored to life again.  
One of such people is the lady at Da Nari Gondoli, who was diagnosed with stomach cancer.  
Sitting in the crowd, the love of God singled her out for her miracle.  
Is this a man or a woman?  
Is this a man or a woman?  
 She's a woman.  
Also present in this meeting is Etinari Condwa, a 40-year-old Malayan resident in London who had suffered from stomach cancer for two years.  


  
 No.  
Ring out, she's here.  
She's here.  
Put her up.  
That's what she's doing.  
Oh, it's him.  
Come on, what a miracle.  
A life will never be the same again.  


  
 That's a miracle!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  
He got up!  


  
 This lady who had been confined to the wheelchair now gets up completely healed of cancer, pushing the chair that previously carried her.  


  
 That same day when I stood up, I went home, then I started eating.  
I couldn't eat for months.  
I couldn't eat.  
And then my friends, they cooked the food.  
I ate like somebody who has never seen food in your life.  
I was so hungry.  
So I just pressed a lot what it did for my life.  
Several years after receiving her miracle, a cancer free at tonight came back to testify.  
She is living in health, miraculously healed by God's special grace.  
 Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick.  
 In these meetings with Pastor Chris, there are so many mighty demonstrations of God's love and power as people with diverse diseases and infirmities receive their miracles and healings.  
The deaf hear, the blind see, the lame walk, glory to Jesus.  


  
 In the past five years, this lady has suffered from stroke twice, and as a result of this was totally paralyzed.  
And she's walking tonight.  
Totally paralyzed.  
Precious Lord Jesus.  
Thanks for your amazing love.  
 No matter how great or small the problem may be, God's love is able to reach all no matter where they are for everyone is valuable to Him.  
She was blind for eight years.  
Which one was blind?  
The one on the front.  
You were blind.  
This is her sister.  
Her sister has had epilepsy for 25 years.  
She too has been healed.  
Who is this?  
 This lady was blind for 8 years.  
As a result of her blindness, she had never seen her 7-year-old daughter.  
If she was blind for 8 years, and the daughter is 7 years old,  


  
 That means when she was born on December, when she was born on December, that is not to see on December.  
So you couldn't see her?  
Yes.  
Look at her.  
The Lord intervened in her case and healed her.  
She can see her daughter for the first time.  
Thank you for coming to South Africa.  
Oh, did you hear her?  
She said, thank you for coming to South Africa.  
Oh, that would have come for just you.  


  
 This young man had meningitis, and it caused him to be deaf in both ears, and he became numb as well.  


  
That healing anointing is the cure for every situation.  
The man of God, Pastor Chris, ministered to him, and he fell under the power.  
 He's healed, completely healed.  
Pick him up.  
That healing anointing that never fails has totally restored hearing in his ears.  
Hey!  
Wake up now!  
Hey!  
Hey!  
Hey!  
Hey!  


  
 His tongue has been loosed as well.  


  
 In Jeremiah 32, 27, he declares, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh.  
Nothing is too hard for me.  
And in Matthew 19, 26, Jesus said, with men, this is impossible.  
But with God, all things are possible.  
Indeed, situations and circumstances which are beyond the control of men are possible with God.  
And he performs these wonders as expressions of his great love for us.  
 Mr. Sunday Iyer had heart failure for over five years and his condition deteriorated to the stage where he could barely move himself.  
Like the man in the Bible who was let down on a stretcher into the presence of the Lord Jesus by his four friends, Mr. Iyer was carried in on a stretcher straight from an ambulance into the presence of Pastor Chris.  
 moved with compassion toward Mr. Iyer, Pastor Chris ministered to him as led by the Spirit of God.  


  
The man of God continues to listen to me so you can hear him.  
He's a little bit gosh spirit, transferring the miracle power of God into his body.  


  
 The man of God is now moving his legs in an up and down movement, ministering in a special way as he is led by God's Spirit, still performing the miracle of God in Missiyari's body.  


  
 The knight and I've got his definitely in this game.  
Wow, this game is getting a lot higher.  
God, his mind's not blowing too fast.  
He's not playing with his feet again.  
This is a miracle.  
God to me.  


  
 Glory to God.  
The man of God embraced him, strengthening him, and comforting him with the love of God.  
This man was born in the US, but he couldn't stand.  
He couldn't get off, but now it's healed.  
Glory to God.  
It's all over.  
Somebody shout it out.  


  
 He's now embraced by his son who had been taken care of.  


  
 He couldn't stand!  
He couldn't stand off!  
But now, he's here!  
Somebody shout out!  
Somebody shout out!  


  
 Hallelujah!  
Mr. Hallelujah is completely healed by God's awesome power.  
Only God could have done this, and He did it because of His great love for us.  
Jesus, I am Your Jesus, do you know You will see me?  
I am Your healing, so I want You where?  
 He is well, there is healing in the name.  
He is well, restoration in the name.  
He is well, she there is power in the name.  
 We say, tonight your miracle is here.  
It is well there is healing in the name.  
It is well restoration in the day of  
 What a mighty God we serve.  
He delights to heal and bless because He loves each and every one.  
He is not the author of Cygnus.  
He is the Lord, our healer, and He wants to heal you too.  
Your miracle is not hollow.  
I want you to know that God really wants you well.  
That's what I want you to see.  
Jeremiah chapter 30.  
 in verse 17.  
For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord.  
That's powerful.  
That's wonderful.  
For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord.  
 I will restore health, don't you?  
What a promise from God.  
This is what it was to do.  
And what he wasn't responsible for the problem in the first place.  
Say, he didn't take the health away.  
If God says I'll restore health to you, it doesn't mean that he took it away the first time.  
It doesn't mean God was responsible for the sickness.  
But he's the one that heals you.  
He says, I am the Lord that healeth thee.  
 In the Book of Acts chapter 10, verse 38, the Bible says, how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power.  
What about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with you?  
See, all those who Jesus healed were oppressed of the devil, and it was God who anointed Jesus and sent him to heal them.  
 God wanted them healed.  
He wanted them well.  
The devil oppressed them.  
Jesus healed them.  
So here God says, I will restore health unto thee.  
And I will heal thee of thy wounds.  
Can you trust God?  
He wants to do it.  
He can do it.  
I will restore health unto him.  
And I will heal thee of thy wounds.  
When does he want to do it?  
He says, I will.  
He said, God, yes, you will, but please.  
 What about now?  
Yes.  
He wants to do it now.  
That's what we're sharing the word with you today.  
We're bringing you healing and health today.  
And you can receive it today.  
It's God's will for you to be well.  
I want to pray for you.  
 And you can receive healing into your body as I pray.  
You say, I receive healing into my body.  
In the name of Jesus, the power of God will be released as I pray.  
And you will have to receive that as an act of your faith.  
And in the name of Jesus, I pray for you to be well.  
I command sickness to leave your body.  
I command the disease to go, the infirmity to seize, the pain to stop.  
 And all those symptoms of sickness and disease in your body to pass out of your body now, be cleansed in your blood.  
Yes, be healed.  
I break the power of the devil of your body in the name of Jesus.  
And if there's in part of your body, that's missing.  
If there's a part that's not there, for which reason you're sick, I pray that that part will be recreated in your body now, in the name of Jesus.  
Be healed, be restored,  
 in the name of Jesus.  
Amen.  
I thank God for healing you.  
I thank Him for touching your life.  
If you haven't received salvation, salvation of Christ, it doesn't matter that you've been healed.  
It doesn't matter that you're well.  
Until you have salvation in Jesus Christ,  
 Life has no meaning.  
I want you to do this now, receive salvation.  
Say, I receive eternal life in the name of Jesus, because I believe in Jesus Christ.  
And I declare Jesus Christ as Lord of my life.  
I have salvation now.  
Amen.  
Yes, you have salvation now.  
I thank God for saving your soul.  
 Write us and let us know what the Lord has done for you so we can share the joys of God's miracles and our lives.  
Praise God.  
I thank God for touching your life and giving you a new life and giving you strength to live for you.  
God bless you.  
 If you just said that prayer along with Pastor Chris, congratulations.  
Welcome to the family of God.
