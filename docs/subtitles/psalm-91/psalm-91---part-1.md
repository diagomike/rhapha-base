title: Psalm 91 - Part 1
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 Hello, welcome to today's program.  
I want to share something important with you today, especially in a day and an hour where there's so much trouble around the world, so many crises and many are thinking.  
Is there hope?  
Does God protect?  
Does it take care of us?  
I want to read this to you from Psalm 91 beginning with verse 1.  
 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  
Our say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in Him will I trust.  
Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Father, and from the noise and pestilence.  
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shall thou trust.  
His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.  
 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that fly it by day, nor for the pestilence that walk it in darkness, nor for the destruction that waste it at midday.  
A thousand shall fall at thy side in ten thousand at thy right hand, for it shall not come neither.  
Only with an eye shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.  
 Because Tao has made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most high thy habitation, they shall no evil before thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.  
Cohe shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways.  
They shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against the stone.  
Tao shall tread upon the lion and other,  
 The young lion and the dragon shall now trample on the feet because he had set his love upon me.  
Therefore, will I deliver him?  
I will set him on high because he had known my name.  
He shall call upon me and I will answer him.  
I will be with him in trouble.  
I will deliver him and honor him.  
Would long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation?  
An extraordinary peace.  
 And here you have, in a woven, they are noted words of the Psalmist and prophetic orderans from the Spirit of God.  
And all this put together like this.  
I want us to take a look at this.  
I'll just read a few for you today.  
He says, He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide on the shadow of your money.  
He's talking about where you are in the Spirit.  
 Do you dwell in the secret place of the Most High?  
The secret place of the Most High?  
He says, anyone who dwells there shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  
That means under the cover of the Almighty, under the protection of the Almighty.  
If you dwell in the secret place of the Most High,  
 Now, you get to understand a little more about dwelling in the secret place of the world.  
Where is the secret place of the Most High?  
I would say of the Lord, He is my refuge.  
The Lord is my refuge and my fortress.  
That means He Himself is that secret place.  
He is that secret place.  
 Because He says, I will see all the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress.  
My God in Him will I trust.  
So dwelling in the sacred place of the Most High means dwelling in God.  
Dwelling in Him.  
You see that in the moment.  
Dwelling in the sacred place of the Most High is dwelling in Him.  
All under New Testament Paul puts it this way, even in man be in Christ.  
 is a new creation.  
To be in Christ.  
Christ is that secret place.  
Christ is that dwelling place.  
To be in Christ is to be in God's secret place.  
So he says that the Lord is your refuge and he is your fortress.  
That's wonderful.  
 I'll oppose you right now and I want you to expect a miracle.  
And remember, anyone who dwells in the sacred place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  
He is your refuge and your fortress.  
And in the name of Jesus, I pray for you to be well.  
 I pray for you to become normal again.  
At your health, we will start to you again.  
In the name of Jesus, be healed in your body, be healed in your bones, be sensed in your blood.  
From the crown of your head to the soles of your feet, be made every hall right now.  
I bring the power, the devil of your body, of your mind, in the name of Jesus.  
 Yes, be healed right now.  
Let the power of the Spirit of God sarge to your being right now.  
Be healed in Jesus' mighty name.  
Amen.
