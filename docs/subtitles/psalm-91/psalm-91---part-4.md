title: Psalm 91 - Part 4
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Mabel is yours.  


  
 Hello, welcome to today's program.  
We've been talking about does God protect us in the day in which we are living with so many problems all around the world?  
Does He take care of us?  
Can we trust Him?  
Is He close enough?  
Is He fast enough?  
Can He be quick to come to the rescue?  
 Oh, yes.  
Now, we started studying from Psalm 91, and we looked through one verse after another, a verse by verse discussion in Psalm 91.  
And now we are continuing with verse 14 today.  
 from verse 14, because he had said his love upon me, I told you that we had this inner weaving of God's prophetic utterance, and the sound is inspired words.  
 And he tells us from his perspective, his own testimony of God.  
And then the Spirit of God takes over and brings this prophetic utterance from the lips of the Father.  
And this is remarkable because we find that there's a change here, a transition into the prophetic utterance from the 14th verse.  
 He goes to say, because he had said his love upon you.  
You see, now it's not the Samus talking anymore.  
It's God talking.  
It's God talking.  
We've been listening to the Samus.  
He's been saying, he's been speaking to us from his own inspired communication.  
He's inspired personal testimony of God.  
 And suddenly, God begins to speak through him.  
And he says, because he had set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him.  
I will set him on high because he had known my name.  
That is parry.  
He's talking about God's protection.  
He says, because he had set his love upon me, have you set your love upon God?  
 He says, if you've set your love upon God, this is the result.  
He says, because He had set His love upon you, therefore will I believe Him.  
You see, all you have to do is set your love upon God.  
If you set your love upon God, there's a result for that.  
He says, therefore will I believe Him.  
I will set Him on high.  
Glory to God.  
I will set Him on high.  
 This is something you've got to claim for yourself knowing that you have set your love on God.  
You say, because I have set my love upon him, therefore will he deliver me?  
And he will set me on high, praise God, because I have known his name.  
You see, that becomes your confession.  
If you study this sound properly, you'll find that the Psalmist, David, is letting us understand what our confessions in the Lord should be.  
 This is your statement of faith as it were.  
Now, he says, in the 15 verse, he shall call upon me in our answer.  
And God's still talking.  
He shall call upon me in our answer.  
I will be with him in trouble.  
Wow.  
That's wonderful.  
I told you.  
I said, what are you talking about?  
Does God protect?  
Does it take care of us?  
If we're in trouble, will he be there?  
Will he be close enough?  
 Look at it.  
He says, I will be with him in trouble.  
So I said, well, I don't want him to just be with me in trouble.  
I don't want him to take me out of trouble.  
Well, that's his purpose for him with you in trouble.  
That's what he's talking about.  
I'll read further.  
See, don't just stop there.  
Let's take it again.  
He shall call upon me God.  
He shall answer him.  
I will be with him in trouble.  
And it's not a full stop.  
It's a summit column.  
He says, I will deliver him.  
 Now you get it.  
And honor him.  
God doesn't only deliver you, he honors you.  
See, he delivers you from trouble and then he honors you.  
So you don't just come out of trouble and say, well, thank God, I'm out of trouble.  
Thank God.  
He rescues you, but he honors you.  
I like that.  
I like that.  
I like that.  
 He shall call upon me and I'll answer him.  
That's the other one.  
You'll answer him prayer.  
You call on him, he'll answer you.  
I'll be with him in trouble.  
I'll deliver him and honor him.  
These are the words of God.  
And you can trust this.  
And then, in the 16th verse, he says, with long life, praise God, with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation.  
 with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation.  
That's what God said.  
 That's what God said.  
So that becomes your testimony.  
That becomes your solid front.  
With long life, will I satisfy him and show him my salvation?  
God's talking.  
He says, he will satisfy you with long life and show you his salvation.  
But first, you've got to accept this.  
You've got to make this your declaration.  
You've got to accept that he's close enough.  
And at his word, he's dependable.  
I don't know.  
 pray for you.  
Now in the name of Jesus, be healed in your body, be healed in your bones, be cleansed in your blood.  
I bring the power of the devil of your body in the name of Jesus.  
No, of your mind, be loosed in Jesus' mighty name.  
Yes, be healed.  
Right now, be healed, be healed in the name of Jesus.  
 Thank you, Lord.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Thank you, Lord.  
The bone condition is being healed.  
Right now you are receiving a miracle.  
It's a bone condition.  
 And I find another bone condition, this time a child is being healed of a bone condition.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Oh, yeah, yeah.  
The child was born, yeah, yeah.  
It's a congenital bone, bone deformity.  
But a healing is taking place right now.  
Thank you, Lord.  
A healing, a miracle is taking place right now in that child's body.  
 Thank you Lord.  
Thank you Lord.  
Amen.  
That child is healed by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
In Jesus' mighty name.  
I see an elderly man who's been healed from a back problem.  
The hand of God is right on your back right now.  
And the pains are leaving you.  
The infirmity leaves you right now in the name of Jesus.  
And you feel well right now.  
You feel like God's healed you.  
 Get up and be strong.  
Get up and be normal.  
And that infirmity will never come back in the name of Jesus.  
Praise God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Oh, yes, yes.  
My green headaches are being healed in the name of Jesus.  
Receive that healing right now.  
A power of the Holy Spirit.  
In Jesus' name.  
Amen.  
God bless you.
