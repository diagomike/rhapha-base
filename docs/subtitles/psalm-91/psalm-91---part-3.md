title: Psalm 91 - Part 3
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 Hello, welcome to today's program.  
We've been talking about does God protect us in the day and hour in which we're living?  
Does it take care of us?  
Can we trust Him to take care of us, especially knowing the kind of things that are happening around the world today?  
So many troubles, so many problems all over the world.  
And the governments of the day have difficulty taking care of the people.  
Can we trust God?  
Is He close enough?  
 can he be speedy to take care of us, to rescuers in the case of crisis?  
Can he do something?  
Emphatically, yes.  
We've been dealing with this, and this is the very third session from Psalm 91.  
We're talking about he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall I baron at the shadow of the Almighty.  
And I said, where is that secret place?  
The secret place is in Christ.  
 the secret place is in Christ.  
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  
He takes care of you.  
You abide under His shadow.  
He takes care of you.  
Wow.  
Verse 9, because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge.  
I like this.  
You remember,  
 In the second verse, we said, I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge in my fortress.  
I want you to listen to the language here as David speaks.  
He says, I will say of the Lord.  
I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress.  
Is that your confession?  
That's what David is saying.  
David says, I will confess that the Lord is my refuge.  
I will confess that the Lord is my fortress.  
Do you do the same?  
 He says, I will say of the Lord.  
I will say concerning the Lord.  
I will declare that the Lord is my refuge and my fortress.  
That's what he said.  
And you ought to say the same thing.  
You ought to say, David was supernaturally protected in his day.  
The Lord took care of him.  
He was protected from all his enemies, from all evil.  
Remember the twin thought sound that he wrote?  
 and inspiring some indeed.  
And even the 27th Psalm.  
Extraordinary Psalms.  
And he was given his testimony of God.  
And now he says, I will sail the Lord.  
This tells you his secret.  
I will sail the Lord.  
His confession was positive.  
He said, I will confess that the Lord is my refuge.  
 Glory to God.  
And He's my fortress.  
That's what I will say of the Lord.  
Now, don't forget that.  
I will say, Lord, would you say of the Lord that He's your refuge and He's your fortress?  
Or are you going to say of the Lord?  
I don't know why you're not taking care of me.  
I don't know why you're not doing something about this.  
I don't know why you're not intervening.  
Oh, I hope you'll do something.  
Oh, God, I hope you'll do something.  
I hope you're seeing all of this.  
He said, what are you going to say?  
Or are you going to declare He is my refuge?  
 When you face crisis, when you say, he is my refuge and my purpose, or you're going to be a farmer, this is thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the hour that flies by thee.  
So, in verse nine, it says, because thou has made the Lord, which is my refuge, to return God, because thou has made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most high, thy habitation.  
I told you, I told you, the Lord is that habitation.  
 See, is He that dwelt in the secret place of the most high?  
And I said, where is that secret place?  
And we can see that He Himself is that secret place.  
Look at it again from verse 9, because thou hast made the Lord which is my refuge, even the most high, thy habitation, the Lord, the most high, is your habitation, is your dwelling place.  
 And if you have made him your dwelling place, listen to this, the 10 verse says, there shall no evil befall me.  
If he is your dwelling place, if you dwell in him, that is, there shall no evil befall me, that shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.  
Praise God.  
Oh, glory to God.  
I like this.  
Look at the level verse.  
For he shall give his angels charge over thee.  
 to keep thee in all thy ways.  
He shall give his angels charge, their honour instruction to attain to you."  
And it says, he shall give his angels charge ever thee to keep thee in all thy ways.  
And then the traverse, they shall be the open their heads.  
You may not feel that they're doing that, but it's letting you know how close they are.  
 how they take care of you.  
Let thou dash thy foot against a stone.  
It's that detailed.  
It's that detailed.  
They're so close and they are attaining to the details.  
 He says, let's read the game from the level brush.  
For he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways, they shall bear thee up in thy hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.  
Praise God.  
Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone?  
Let take care of you.  
See, you say what?  
I've not been experiencing it like this.  
Maybe not, maybe not, because you see, you haven't made this your confession.  
You haven't made this your confession.  
 He says, because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most high thy habitation.  
He says, this will be the result.  
There shall no evil befall me.  
Neither shall any plague come, thy lad, or any.  
For he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways.  
They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against stone.  
Thou shall tread upon the lion and other.  
The young lion and the dragon shall now trample on the feet.  
Dangerous thing to say is you walk over there.  
 You walk over dangerous things.  
You walk over danger and have no fear of them.  
That's what he said.  
Wow.  
The 14th verse downwards is so inspired and inspiring.  
This is so powerful.  
I want to pray for you right now.  
Expect a miracle right now.  
Someone's death ear just popped open.  
 You've had difficulty hearing for a while.  
And yeah, I see someone else you just received hearing in your left ear.  
You were deafened by a gone shot.  
 But you're healed now.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
In fact, you also had trouble with your eye.  
And now you can see clearly with that eye.  
Where is God?  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
I see that someone who's had a growth somewhere inside your neck.  
 And that growth is gone.  
In Jesus' name, it's gone.  
You were told that only through surgery would the doctors be able to do something about it.  
And you were also concerned about the danger of that surgery.  
And the operation was going to be a difficult one.  
 But you are healed now, and it's gone.  
And the doctors are going to be surprised that it's gone already.  
And thank God for that miracle.  
I see that someone else has been healed in the spine.  
The power of God is going through your spine right now.  
In order of God's Spirit, it's going through your body.  
Receive healing in Jesus' mighty name.  
Praise God.  
A little child is being healed.  
 Thank you Lord, we are now the Lord of God is going through that child's body.  
I command that devil to come out in Jesus' name and the spined beef restored to number.  
In Jesus' mighty name, praise God.  
Yes, you are healed.  
You are healed.  
What a miracle of God.  
God bless you.
