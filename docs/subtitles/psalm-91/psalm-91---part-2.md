title: Psalm 91 - Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 Hello, welcome to today's program.  
Now, in a day with so much destruction, devastation and death, does God protect?  
Can we trust Him to take care of us?  
We began studying from Psalm 91.  
 We talked about how the Lord takes care of us and where we ought to be.  
From the first verse, he says, He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Amari.  
And we began talking about this.  
And we said that He is the dwelling place really.  
He is that secret place.  
Christ is that secret place.  
And to be in the secret place of the Most High means to be in Christ.  
 Paul says, if any man being Christ, he is a new creation.  
And so he himself is that dwelling place.  
And we weren't talking about this up to verse two.  
Now, going to verse three today, and here is sovereign declaration.  
From verse three, surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the Father and from the noisim pestilence.  
He shall deliver thee.  
I like that.  
 He shall deliver thee.  
He shall deliver thee.  
He rescues you from every trap and protects you from the fatal plague.  
That's what he's talking about.  
He rescues you from every trap and protects you from the fatal plague.  
And then he says, in the Fort verse, he shall commonly with his feathers,  
 That's like talking about his wings.  
It doesn't mean that God's God fatters.  
See?  
It's still a ephemerism for his protection.  
The world shall to heal.  
His faithful promises are your armor.  
I like that.  
Listen again, that's the fourth verse.  
He shall cover thee with his feathers, and only his wings shall now trust.  
His truth shall be thy shield and bakla.  
His truth shall be thy shield and bakla.  
 Wow.  
You like was five.  
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that fly it by day.  
Whether in the nighttime or in the daytime, he takes care of you.  
I want you to notice something here, the language.  
The word in here is very significant.  
 Let me read the game.  
In verse 3, he talks about God.  
He says, surely he shall deliver thee.  
In verse 4, he shall cover thee.  
He tells you what God will do.  
Then, in verse 5, he says, thou shalt not be afraid for the terrible night.  
He didn't say, don't let yourself become afraid.  
That's not what he says, thou shalt not be afraid.  
What a word.  
 He said, Fear will not come to you.  
How do you respond to that?  
You say, Yes, I shall not be afraid.  
It's a declaration of the Spirit.  
It says, Thou shall not be afraid for the terrible night.  
So I say, Yes, I shall not be afraid for the terrible night.  
You see?  
And then he says, Nor for the arrow that fly it by day.  
Wow, the terrible night is tearing the night time.  
 There's a lot of wickedness that's carried out in the nighttime.  
But then it says, Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night.  
So, I shall not be afraid for the terror by night.  
Nor for the hour that fly by day, as soon as destruction also in the daytime.  
Listen, look at verse 6, Nor for the pestilence that walk it in darkness.  
Nor for the destruction that wasted at noon day.  
Here in that tin, a new aversion.  
 The sixth verse really says, Noah dread the plagues of darkness, nor disasters in the morning.  
Disaster in a day time.  
In that fifth verse, he says, you will need to be afraid of the dark anymore, nor fear the dangers of the day.  
 He didn't fear the dangers of the day.  
He didn't say there are no dangers in the daytime, or he says, you don't fear the dangers of the day.  
You shall not fear the dangers of the day.  
Why?  
Because he already told you.  
He takes care of you.  
You dwell in the secret place of the Most High.  
You abide another shadow of your money.  
You honor his cover.  
He says he spreads his fellows, his wings over you to cover you.  
Remarkable.  
Remarkable.  
 Remarkable.  
Then, he says here, a thousand shall fall out by his side.  
In ten thousand I write him, but he shall not come neither.  
Though a thousand fall out your side and ten thousand are dying around me, says the evil will not touch me.  
You see that?  
I read that again from the King James.  
A thousand shall fall out by his side, ten thousand I write him, but he shall not come neither.  
 Wow.  
He didn't say nothing will happen.  
On your right hand or on your left, he says, there's so much evil, there's so much trouble, there's so many, so many crisis around you.  
A thousand shall fall at thy side.  
Ten thousand not die right here.  
But what's important is it shall not come nigh thee.  
It shall not come nigh thee.  
 It's like what he says, do I walk in the valley of the shadow of death?  
Do I walk in the valley of the shadow of death?  
Do I feel no evil?  
Think about that.  
That's in the 23rd sound.  
Do I walk in the valley?  
 It's a valley of the shadow of death.  
It's a valley.  
It's a deep place.  
It's in the shadow of death.  
Or it says, I feel no evil for thou art with me.  
Thy rod and thy stuff comfort me.  
Wow.  
 So a thousand shall fall aside in ten thousand that I write again, but it shall not come neither.  
Only with an eye shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.  
His youth see the reward of the wicked.  
You see with your eyes.  
Then the language changes here in the night verse.  
 Now I'm sure you're ready for us to pray.  
Expect a miracle right now.  
In the name of Jesus, I pray for you to be well.  
I pray that the pains will leave your body, that the infirmity will cease, that disease will go from you, that the sickness will pass away, and that a feeling of health will come back to you right now.  
In the name of Jesus, behealing your body from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet that made whole,  
 Arab people have cancer.  
In the name of Jesus, Arab people have stomach pains.  
In the name of Jesus, the heart trouble, be healed.  
The blood condition, be healed.  
Now be healed.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
I see a medical doctor.  
 with an infirmity that came from an infectious disease.  
And right now, you've thought there's no hope for you.  
But I command that sickness to leave your body.  
I command that disease to go from you, the symptoms to leave, and that you be healed.  
Be healed.  
Be healed now.  
 In the name of Jesus, receive this healing into your body right now.  
Let me restore the whole again.  
In Jesus' mighty name.  
Amen, you are healed by the power of the Holy Spirit.  
In the name of Jesus.  
Amen.  
I recommend that tumor to go.  
In Jesus' name, a lady with a tumor.  
You just got healed.  
That tumor is gone from you.  
In the name of Jesus, you are healed.  
 praise the Lord, and many others who have been healed, including those whose cases I didn't call the Lord has healed you.  
Thank Him for healing you.  
God bless you.
