title: Psalm 91 - Part 5
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Mabel is yours.  


  
 Hello, welcome to today's program.  
We've been talking about God's protection in our lives.  
And we began our study in Psalm 91 and went through the whole chapter.  
And it's been very, very exciting.  
We concluded that in our last program.  
But today I want to summarize it and go through it with you.  
And we'll read from the amplified version.  
And I want you to listen to this.  
This is really beautiful.  
 I believe it will inspire you to let you know the Lord is with you and you've got to become bold about your life.  
Bold about your life in Christ because He is our solid rock.  
 Now remember, we started out talking about He that dwells in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  
And we said, where is that secret place?  
The secret place is in Christ.  
If any man be in Christ, He is a new creation.  
 All right.  
Now, I'm reading to you from the Untied Version, Psalm 91, beginning with verse 1.  
He who dwellers in the secret place of the Most High shall remain stable and fixed, only the shadow of your mighty, not markable, whose power no foe can withstand.  
See, you are only the shadow of your mighty, and he says in the power of this almighty, no foe can withstand.  
 Hallelujah.  
No enemy can I say.  
Verse 2, I will say of the Lord.  
I told you that's His confession.  
It's got to become your confession.  
You should say, I will say of the Lord.  
And then you say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God.  
On Him I lean and rely, and in Him I comfortably trust  
 For then he will deliver you from the slayer of the fowl and from the deadly pestilence.  
 This is wonderful.  
See, let this be your confession.  
You're going to read it in the first person and realize that God's working out His purpose in your life.  
You know, a lot of times we think about things that have happened to other people, other very good people.  
And then we say, well, if that happened to so and so, what about me?  
Our fellow was better than myself.  
This got nothing to do with who's better than who.  
It's got to do with our walk in God.  
Our faith in His Word.  
 See, our faith in His word, in our confession.  
You know, you can have a lot of faith.  
But if your confession is wrong, then things go wrong.  
Our confessions rule us.  
Remember that.  
Our confessions are our words, the words that we speak for our matters.  
And that is our snare with the words of our lives.  
They are taken captive with the words of our lives.  
 He didn't say you're SNED by your name.  
He didn't say you're SNED by the wickedness outside.  
He said you're SNED by the words of your name.  
 So remember that, verse 3, for then he will deliver you from the snail of the fala and from the deadly pestilence, then he will cover you with his pinnings, and under his wings shall you trust and find refuge.  
Praise God.  
His truth in his faithfulness at the shield and above.  
Praise God.  
 Look at verse 5.  
You shall not be afraid of the terror of the night, nor the arrow, the evil parts and slandas of the wicked.  
See, that's why we don't care about the parts and the slandas of the wicked.  
See, we triumph over that.  
This thou shalt not be afraid.  
He didn't say, do not be there.  
Don't be there.  
All right.  
He says, but you shall not be afraid of them.  
 because they got no power with you.  
Then it says, nor of the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor of the destruction and sudden death, that surprise and lay waste at noon.  
See, death springs surprises at many people.  
Oh, that fellow was going to work and something happened, he was killed.  
Oh, so and so was in his home and something happened, he was killed.  
 These are things that we hear all the time.  
But then it says, it says, nor verse 6 again, nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction and sudden death, that surprise and lay waste at me and death, that lay waste of my destruction, death, that lay waste at me and death.  
This terrible thing, this havoc that will end up.  
 But many have been victims too.  
Verse 7, 1,000 may fall at your side in 10,000 at your right hand, but it shall not come near you.  
Only hell like this.  
Verse 8, only a spectator shall you be.  
Yourself being what inaccessible?  
 in the secret place of the Most High, as witness the word of the wicked.  
See, you'll be a spectator of these things.  
You'll just be a witness of these things.  
 But you, yourself, will be inaccessible.  
Praise God.  
I like that.  
That's wonderful.  
Verse 9, because you have made the Lord your refuge and the most high, your dwelling place, there shall no evil before you, nor any plague or calamity come near your tent.  
Praise God.  
That's a dwelling place.  
Verse 11, for he will give his angels a special  
 Charge over you to accompany and defend and preserve you in all your ways of obedience and service.  
See, in all your ways of obedience and service.  
In other words, as we live for God, He takes care of you.  
He takes care of you.  
They shall bear you up on their hands lest you dash your foot against a stone.  
You shall tread upon the lion and other, the young lion, and the serpent shall you trample on the foot.  
 Now verse 14, and I told you about verse 14 upwards, I said, rather downwards to the end, this is really prophetic now.  
God's speaking himself.  
It is because he has said his love upon me, he's talking about you.  
Therefore, will I deliver him?  
I will set him on high because he knows and understands my name.  
 And that's wonderful.  
He knows and understands my name.  
He's introduced something new to knowing his name.  
It doesn't mean knowing how his name sounds.  
It doesn't mean knowing how to spell his name.  
He says to know and understand his name.  
He's talking about what his name represents.  
What's behind that name?  
Praise God.  
 What's encapsulated in that name?  
What does this name really mean?  
Do you know the Lord's name?  
Wow.  
And that's why we gave a full teaching on the name of Jesus and a wonderful name of Jesus.  
Two beautiful teachings.  
You're going to place your order for them.  
And it says here,  
 I read that verse 14 again so you can catch it in context.  
Because he has said his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him.  
I will set him on high because he knows and understands my name.  
It has a personal knowledge of my mercy, love and kindness.  
Trust and relies on me knowing I will never forsake him, no never.  
 That's wonderful.  
That's wonderful.  
And this in parent is here.  
This is beautiful.  
Verse 15, he shall call upon me and I'll answer him.  
I'll be with him in trouble and I will deliver him.  
 In honor here, Moses with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
In a day that many think it's not possible to live long because there's too much trouble all around.  
He says with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation.  
He's talking about you.  
He's talking about you.  
Praise the Lord.  
Right now you can be healed.  
 And you will be here.  
Receive that healing into your body right now.  
The anointing of God is reaching out to you.  
And those aches on your forehead are leaving you now in the name of Jesus.  
I will do that devil of information.  
Come out in the name of Jesus.  
And are you receiving healing?  
 receive healing.  
The aches are gone, the pains are gone, and you are healed in the name of Jesus.  
Yes, I pray for you to be well right now.  
And you who has a breathing problem, you've had difficulty breathing normally.  
In the name of Jesus, I pray that your lungs will be healed.  
In the name of Jesus, let your heart be healed right now.  
Be healed.  
Let those pains go from you.  
In the name of Jesus, be healed.  
 as a miracle for your heart right now.  
In Jesus' mighty name, amen.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Thank you, Lord.  
That devil of being front is gone out of your body in the name of Jesus.  
In fact, that evil spirit leaves your home now.  
In Jesus' mighty name, you are free.  
I see a young girl, about 15, 16 years old, and that evil spirit has been troubling you.  
 and the infirmities of your body are passing away right now.  
And that devil leaves you now.  
In the name of Jesus, I pray that you be restored completely.  
Be restored to health.  
In the name of Jesus, be healed.  
As is someone else who's had a blood condition, you've been so sick in your life.  
In and out of hospitals, and visits, and doctors, and nurses, and that's all you've known all your life.  
In the name of Jesus, I pray that you be well.  
 Right now be healed.  
Be healed from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet.  
That devil will not stay.  
He's out of your body in the name of Jesus.  
Be healed.  
Praise God.  
God bless you.
