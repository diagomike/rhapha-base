title: Priesthood and Sacrifices Part 1
---
 One thing is sudden, if you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Debo is yours.  


  
 First Peter chapter two, I will read to you from verse five, King James Version.  
He also has lively stones, that means living stones, a built up of spiritual house, an only priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  
 He says, we are beards by God as a spiritual house.  
He's not talking about the bearding like the auditorium.  
He's not about our life as God's people who are born again.  
The Bible says that we have been beards  
 by the ministries of the prophets and apostles of Christ, and set on the foundation, which is Christ Jesus, and that we are a spiritual house, and that our responsibility as a spiritual house is to offer up to God spiritual sacrifices.  
 In Christianity, we are not in our social fraternity.  


  
It is a spiritual family of God.  
And we do have a ministry in the earth.  
We have a responsibility in the earth.  
We got a job to do in the earth.  
 God didn't put us here so we can just have a nice life.  
God didn't put us here so that we can, by His name, get nice things by faith and live a life that is satisfying to us.  
There's more to life.  
 He says, we have been built a spiritual house to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  
Which means each one of us is in office.  
We've got to understand this is God's dream.  
God had a dream.  
God had a dream.  
He had a dream.  
In other words, a desire.  
 something that he wanted.  
In Exodus chapter 19, we'll be turning there quickly.  
Exodus chapter 19, I'll read to you from verse 5,  


  
 into verse 6 verse 5 now therefore God talking to the children of Israel by Moses now therefore if he will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then he shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for the earth is mine  
 God said this to the children of Israel.  
He said, if you will obey my covenant, then you shall be to meet a peculiar treasure above all people.  
He says, for the earth is mine.  
In other words, everything belongs to me.  
It's up to me to choose what I prefer.  
It's up to me to choose who I want to honor.  
If I choose to make you a peculiar treasure above other people, that's my business because all the earth is mine.  
 Did you see that there?  
All right.  
Now in verse six, now you know people say we are all the same.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we are all the same, but we are not favored the same.  
Hallelujah.  
Verse six, and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests.  
This is remarkable.  
A kingdom of priests.  
 That's what is meant by royal priesthood, which means a fraternity or order of priests that are royalty.  
This is wonderful.  
King priests in the order of Melchizedek.  
 All right, look at it, verse six.  
And he shall be on a me, a kingdom of priests and holy nation.  
These are the words which thou shall speak unto the children of Israel, a kingdom of priests, a peculiar treasure above all people.  
What an honor.  
He said, if you will obey my covenant, they didn't.  
They broke it.  
They breached it.  
They couldn't make it.  
 so they didn't become a kingdom of priests.  
Because they failed to keep God's covenant.  
And so God abolished the covenant.  
He said, I'm going to make a new one.  
And he did.  
Hallelujah.  
And he did.  
And brought us into it as beneficiaries.  
 Now, he doesn't make a promise to us.  
He has fulfilled his dream.  
We have come into the place.  
Oh God.  
I wish you would understand this.  
So you can grasp my sunesis.  
You see, this is the reason a lot of people can understand how, why we are the way we are and why we do what we do.  
Christianity is no religion.  
 to many Christians, and including many preachers, Christianity is a great religion.  
To me, it's not a religion.  
It's life.  
And I think that that's why some of them can understand our thinking of the gospel, our mentality, our way of life.  
Why are we like this?  
And so we look like we are not real to them.  
 We'll look like we are speaking from outer space because they can't understand this stuff.  
They got a problem with this.  
Like they had a problem with Jesus.  
Because Jesus spoke differently.  
He said, I am from above.  
See, we are not on a journey into Christ.  
We have arrived in Christ.  
 He didn't say you're marching to Zion like they were marching many years ago.  
I don't know, I know that some people who are still marching today, they're still on their way in the wilderness of life.  
And I didn't find myself in the wilderness of life.  
Never been there.  
I wasn't on my journey from Egypt to Canaan.  
I was born into the promised land.  
 Born right into it.  
Never on a journey towards it.  
Born right into it.  
And if you're of the religious kind, you may not like this.  
You know, it sounds like I'm being bragadocious, so you may not like it.  
But listen, if you don't talk like this, you'll never inherit it.  
Christianity is for the tough-minded.  
It's for the tough-minded.  
 You can't come into this arena without staring the nests of your adversaries.  
They wanna kill you for it.  
But they never can.  
They just hate you without a course.  
But you don't care.  
Woo hoo.  
Yeah, see, in first Peter chapter two, now we're in a new Testament, first Peter chapter two,  
 We started out in chapter 2 and verse 5, but now what are 3 verse 9?  
Bocchia!  
I like it when the Bible says, yeah, that you're going to be.  
 He, ah, he, ah, he, ah.  
If he, ah, then he is, he, ah.  
If he, ah, ah.  
He says, yeah, but she, ah, ah.  
Chosen generation.  
And God's choice.  
Chosen generation.  
He is talking about a breed.  
A special breed.  
A class.  
 You're born into that class with a peculiar nature.  


  
But he is a chosen generation, a royal priesthood.  
He is a royal priesthood.  
This is what was promised to the children of Israel on the condition of obedience to the covenant.  
 And they didn't make it.  
Now God doesn't give us any condition.  
He just says, hey, you're born that way.  
Because you're born again.  
You're born in Christ.  
You are a Christian.  
You're in Christ now.  
So he says, you are a chosen generation.  
That means you got peculiar genes.  
 Generation, genes, genealogy.  
Do you understand?  
We've got a family tree.  
We're coming from Christ.  


  
Oh, man.  
A chosen generation.  
A royal priesthood.  
A holy nation.  
A peculiar people.  
That you should show thoughts.  
 show forth, display, show forth the praises of him, who had called you out of darkness into his marvelous, awe-inspiring lights, display the virtues and perfections.  
Dear Lord Jesus, who am I?  
 You know, the greatest crisis in the world is the identity crisis.  
The question, who am I?  
Why am I here?  
Why was I born?  
Where am I going?  
What's the meaning of my life?  
 when you come to understand this stuff about Christ and His church.  
The problem of identity is solved because you come home.  
You know who you are.  
Your future is clear before you.  
No more question about your future.  
No more questions.  
 I get letters and messages all the time before I came up here tonight.  
A gentleman sent me a text on the occasion of his birthday.  
He said, I met you 18 years ago, and my life has been different ever since.  
I've had a fulfilling life because what I learned from you  
 All these years, 18 years.  
And now he testifies of a tremendous fulfilling life.  
Same story.  
There's nobody yet that I have been in contact with through the Word of God who turned out a failure.  
Praise God.  
 Not possible.  
Not possible.  
No, not possible.  
The only kind of folks you can find who say, well, I used to be there, and something went wrong.  
He wasn't listening.  
No, he wasn't listening.  
This Bible wasn't written by Pastor Chris.  
He wasn't listening.  
This thing hasn't failed anybody yet.  
 But you know, like many people are, they're always looking for what's your formula?  
What's the short quote?  
As a student, I was very bad in mathematics so many years.  
Couldn't get past 44% or something like that.  
I was bad in it.  
Because, see, I didn't know why until I found out  
 When I got to my class four, which was, I guess, I don't know what they call that today, SS2 or something like that, something like that, yeah.  
When I got there, I made up my mind.  
First team, I made up my mind.  
I'm fed up of failing mathematics.  
I've failed it almost all my life.  
Now I was in class four, and guess what?  
Something new had happened to me.  
 The Spirit of God has had a ministry in my life.  
Things have changed.  
And so I said, I don't want to fail this thing anymore.  
I want to know what's there.  
Now, I was taught to solve and practice the questions, just be practicing and trying to answer the questions.  
And I tried and tried and tried and never worked.  
And to cram the formula, I had crammed the formula and forgot them in the exam hall.  
 So something was wrong with what I was taught.  
Because it failed.  
Until I decided I was not going to fail mathematics anymore.  
It was time for me to know it.  
I wanted to know it.  
I prayed to God that I want to know it.  
You said the Holy Spirit would teach us all things.  
Mathematics is one of them I want to know.  
 So I took out Matt's textbook, I began to read it like I read other subjects.  
Instead of going to questions and solving and trying to crack my brain and trying to remember formula, I started reading the theory behind the maths.  
That's the key.  
 I began to study the theory behind the maths, the theory behind the formula.  
Why was this formula so?  
What was the theory on which it was based?  
I don't want to cram it.  
I want to derive it.  
And when I understood the theory behind it, I began to learn to derive the formula myself.  
So when I read a question,  
 and understood the question and derived the formula.  
I found out why the examples they gave, why the answers were so.  
Then I began to love mathematics.  
I couldn't but solve mathematical problems every day.  
I just love maths.  
It became my first subject from the worst to the best.  
I just love maths.  
I found the secret.  
 You know what?  
I never finished my maths questions.  
I never finished in any exam.  
I never finished.  
I had lots because I didn't know them, just looking at them.  
And for the objective, you just go, ton, ton, ton.  
You know?  
Now that was where I was really bad.  
Doesn't mean I was bad in other subjects.  
I was bad in maths, I tell you.  
But you know what?  
When I learned this thing,  
 Things changed for me.  
When I did my work exam for my maths, 30 minutes before the end, I was through.  
I was waiting for them to finish up.  
Not because I didn't know anymore.  
I finished everything.  
The only thing I couldn't recognize was number 7B.  
You see it?  
 It was question number seven, B. I had no clue.  
And I left it alone.  
But for everything else, I saw some of them and I knew I was done with them and I came out with an A1 for it.  
Now, here's my point.  
Here's my point.  
There was theory behind the match.  
It's the same thing with life.  
 People want the shortcuts.  
And so when they're trying to shortcut and it doesn't work, they'll say, you know, that thing is fake.  
I tried it too.  
They're lying to you.  
No, you're the one lying.  
You just didn't know it.  
Find out about the theory.  
What did Jesus come to do?  
 See, I found out about that.  
Who is the Holy Spirit?  
What is he doing in me?  
What is administering my life today?  
What's the reason for the Bible?  
This book, what is it for?  
Why is it here?  
The theory of the cross, understand it.  
Understand the tenets of the gospel of Christ.  
Understand who we are.  
And this life will no longer be a mystery to you.  
 You getting it?  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Man, oh, man.  
Let me take you just a little further.  
There's so much to share along this Nanga.  
Now, let me take you a little further.  
Psalm 80, 87.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  


  
 From verse 1, his foundation is in the holy mountain.  
His foundation is in the holy mountains.  
The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.  
He loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.  
 Glorious things are spoken of the Old City of God.  


  
The Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.  
Zion he cars the city of God.  
This is talking about the church.  
 This is us.  
This is God's place.  
This is God's city.  
And it says glorious things are spoken of the whole city of God.  
It says He's Foundations.  
You can find God's.  
Look at it.  
Read that verse one again.  
His foundation is in the holy mountains.  
Where is this?  
 Now you're quiet, you're thinking, what was he talking about?  
You'd know in a moment.  
Turn the book of Hebrews for a moment.  
Hebrews chapter 11, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, h  


  
 when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for an inheritance, obey it, and he went out not knowing whether he went.  
By faith is a john in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heir's idiom of the same promise, for he looked for a city.  
Oh God.  
 He looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is God.  
He looked for a city which had foundations whose builder and maker is God.  
Are you still there?  
He looked for a city that had foundations whose builder and maker  
 is God.  


  
Foundations refers to principles.  
He's talking about principles, principles, institution of truths,  
 says Abraham was looking for a city that had principles of truth, a system of truth, whose build on Mecca is God.  
He didn't want to, you see, when he said, he was looking for a city.  
He wasn't looking for a city in the world because the world is cities were made by men with the laws of men.  
 but he was looking for a city.  
That's why the Bible says he went out not knowing where he was going.  
He acted on God's Word when God said, go, I will show you a place.  
I will show you a place.  
Did Abraham ever find the place?  
The Bible says in all of Abraham's journey, God never gave him a place that was large enough to set his foot on.  
Which means that what the city that Abraham was looking for was not in the earth.  
 until God said, look toward the knot and the side and the east and the west, as far as your eyes can see, that I've given unto you.  
And Abraham looked everywhere.  
And what Abraham saw included the world and beyond.  
The Bible says, God wheeled the world to Abraham.  
And that was not enough.  
Because Abraham was looking for a city that had principles of life whose builder and maker is God.  


  
 Abraham's city.  
No wonder the Bible says he's a father of faiths.  
Abraham was looking for a city whose foundations were made by God.  
And the Bible says God's foundations.  
His foundation is in where?  
The holy mountains.  
 And where the city Abraham was looking for was the city of Zion.  
He's a glorious thing that's spoken of the city of God.  
This is the city that Abraham was looking for.  
And he saw it by faith.  
In Hebrews chapter 12.  
Sover Amagisa.  
Hebrews chapter 12.  
 Verse 22, the Bible says, but ye, ye, brothers and sisters, but ye, ye are clung ye have arrived unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and church of the first bond which are registered in heaven.  
 and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel.  
Somebody say hallelujah.  
 He succumbed to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the city that Abraham was looking for, the city of which he says glorious things are spoken of thee, all city of God.  
Do you belong in that city?  
If you belong in that city, live like one.  
Think like one.  
Talk like one.  
Go back in there, Psalm 87.  
 Ooh-hoo!  
Manoma!  
Psalm 87, verse 3, is as glorious things are spoken of the host city of God.  
If you're a member of that city, glorious things are spoken of you.  
Glorious things are spoken of you.  
Glorious things are... Why don't you find that about what these glorious things are?  
 You know, some people like to reproach us, but we're irreproachable.  


  
Hallelujah.  
So magida, yeah.  
Glorious things, mystery.  
Glorious things that's spoken of the city of God.  
I will... I will show you understand this.  
I will make mention of Rahab.  
That's a symbolic name for Egypt.  
 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me.  
Behold, Felicia and Tyre with Ethiopia.  
This man was born there.  
This man was born there.  
This is how make mention of great cities.  
Great nations.  
Egypt, Babylon, Felicia, Tyre.  
This man was born there.  
 Like somebody says, yeah, I was born in Britain.  
I was born in America.  
I was born in Switzerland.  
You know, people, they like to talk about their ethnic nationality.  
This man was born there.  
How boast of these ones?  
Yeah, he was born there.  
He's British.  
He's American.  
 He's Lebanese.  
This man was born there.  
Come with me.  
Verse 5, And of Zion, it shall be said, This and that man was born in heart.  


  
 And highest himself shall establish the Lord shall count when he write it up the people.  
That means when he records, when he accounts, when he numbers the people that this man was born there.  


  
Oh God.  
You know what he's talking about?  


  
 Oh, glory to God.  
You know, I think through the words of the Father, I was born in Zion.  
This is a Lord shall count when he numbers the people.  
At this man was born there.  
The day you were born,  
 Your mother wrote in your certificates the city in which you were born.  
When you were born again, God wrote the dates that you were born in Zion.  
In His record, you were born in Zion.  
This thing we're talking about is real.  
 You know, some of us have functioned so much in the Word that we don't recognize spiritual truths.  
We take the worldly things as though that's what's real and fail to open our spirits to what God says.  
It says, the Lord shall count when He rided up the people that this man was born there.  
 born in Zion.  
You are come.  
You have arrived.  
You belong in Zion.  
You belong in the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.  
And in that place, there are foundations, principles of life, a system of truths.  
God's spirit is upon you.  
 And His mighty presence is working in your life.  
His grace is multiplied in your life.  
Be successful everywhere you go.  
Be prosperous everywhere you go.  
The wisdom of God is functioning for you.  
Working for you.  
You will speak as the Oracle of God.  
In the name of Jesus.  
 Because greater we see that is in you than he that is in the world.  
No power can overcome you.  
Because the Spirit of God is working in your life.  
Promotion is yours.  
Increases yours.  
Progress is yours.  
Health is yours.  
In the mighty name of Jesus Christ.  
 Every hindrance on your way is removed in the name of Jesus.  
Every obstacle is removed in the name of Jesus.  
You are making progress.  
You are moving forward in the name of Jesus.  
No weapon fashioned against you shall prosper.  
 Speaking out of tongues right now.  
Praying the Holy Ghost.  
Speaking out of tongues.  
Thank you Lord.
