title: Priesthood and Sacrifices Part 3
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Devo is yours.  


  
 When you give your heart to Christ to be born again, your life starts out as a spiritual babe in much the same way anybody began his life as a babe in the natural world.  
 There's nobody here who was born an adult.  
You know anybody like that?  
Who came into this world as an adult?  
Nobody like that.  
As a Christian, your life also stats out as a babe.  
The Bible shows us that there is a clear relationship between  
 how you grow in the natural world and how you grow spiritually.  
You don't know everything at once when you start out.  
And you have to be built up.  
And that's why we can have a man who's 25 years old and is acting like a child because it's not been brought up.  
 That's why you can have a 35-year-old guy still following Mommy.  
That's why it's that way.  
Mommy sees the 17-year-old boy.  
Live him.  
He's just a child.  
He's doing something stupid.  
Live him.  
He's just a child. 17.  


  
 So when he's 34, what's it gonna be like?  


  
So spiritually, we also have the same thing.  
Somebody's been a Christian, been in church for 10 years, and he's upset that the group leader has never come to visit him.  
You know what I'm talking about.  


  
 Sometimes there are people who don't go to church, and they say, why?  
They say, well, I was a member of that church for 15 long years.  
And when something happened to me, nobody came to see me.  
I wasn't in church for a whole month, and nobody remembered.  
15 years in church, and you still need that visitation?  
Think about it.  
Think about a mother carrying a 15-year-old boy and holding a feeding bottle.  
 That's tragedy.  
But that's the way some people want us to treat them.  
Been in church five years, needing follow-up.  


  
Let me show you something.  
Can you tell us what to first Peter?  
First Peter, chapter two.  


  
 Have you found it?  
First Spirit, chapter two.  


  
From verse two.  
Read it for me, want to go.  


  
Read verse three.  
 Yeah, if you really think that the Lord is gracious, you found that He's been gracious to you, then desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby.  
The milk of the Word of God refers to the fundamentals.  
 the fundamental principles of the Word of God, the elementary teachings of the Word of God.  
He says, if you even desire after that, you would grow.  
You would grow.  
I know there have been people in churches for many, many years, they don't know more.  
 Then, you know, God bless me.  
God help me.  
God thank you.  
God do this for me.  
Do that for me.  
They think God is there to answer their prayer.  
God is there to do something for them.  
God is alive for them.  
That's what they think.  
God doesn't live for you.  
You live for God.  
 He doesn't exist because of you.  
Get it straight.  
God doesn't exist.  
Somebody says, oh, God answers our prayers.  
That's what is there for.  
Oh, no.  
How can I?  
That's not what is there for.  
You're here for Him.  
He pre-existed you.  
He made you.  
He has a purpose for you.  
You don't have a purpose for God.  
You couldn't have one.  
 Hey, come on.  
Could you have a purpose for God?  
That's unthinkable.  
He has a purpose for your life.  
He made you.  
The trouble with most people is that they have never found out the reason for which they were born.  
They think Mom and Dad loved each other and gave birth to me.  
So that's why I'm here.  
No.  
 There's a reason.  
There's a reason.  
There's a reason God brought you in He to this world.  
There's a reason for your life.  
Well, you may say, I was an accident.  
Mom and Dad weren't even expecting me.  
They even told me.  
They told me.  
They told me.  
We had three children already or we had five children already and you just came.  
We weren't expecting you just came.  
And we were thinking of what to do about you.  
 You hear your escape.  
They may have even told you.  
Maybe somebody told you your uncle picked you from some way and raised you.  
You were an abandoned child.  
Never tell you about that 52 year old lady who was crying.  
She was crying and crying and said, why are you crying?  
She said,  
 They told me that my mother wanted to abort me.  
I said, what?  
When was that?  
Before I was born.  
I said, how old are you?  
She said 52.  
And she was married.  
She had kids.  
 But she had lived a sad life, fifth to two long years, just because she was told her mother didn't want to keep her.  
But you've been here for 52 years.  
You can't blame your mother now.  
But that's the way many people are.  
They've grown up angry at society.  
 They've grown up angry with the government, angry with their nation, angry about something.  
And because of that, they are preconditioned to live in a terrible life and on a happy and sad life, just because somebody else did something stupid.  
You can live your life like that.  
You can live your life like that.  
You gotta grow up.  
 get a grow up refuse to be dominated by circumstances no matter what kind hallelujah praise the Lord  
 And you know, there are people who love prayer.  
They always pray for me, they are prayer collectors, you know.  
They pray for me, pray for me.  
Some even have written to ministers all over the world asking for prayers.  
Pray for me, pray for me.  
They think that if they have a multiplicity of prayers, then something good will happen.  
They say, well, you know, there are lots of people praying over this business.  
Lots of people, God doesn't hear because so many are praying.  


  
 They say, if so many people are praying, there's no way that God will not hear.  
Did you read?  
He destroyed the whole world before with water and saved only eight people?  
He destroyed everything.  
Come on, understand it.  
He destroyed everything and left only eight people alive.  
Their cries didn't stop him.  
As the waters rose, they cried.  
They shouted.  
God said it's too late.  
 Then listen to them.  
Like the fellow who said, I don't believe in hell.  
Why don't you believe in hell?  
He said, there's too many of us going to hell.  
So because of that, you don't believe in hell.  
He said, I don't think a merciful God who lets so many go to hell.  
I thought, you've never read the Bible then.  
I said, God is too merciful to let so many people go to hell.  


  
 All right.  
I hope you don't think so.  
Why are you here?  
God doesn't think like that.  
I just told you.  
He destroyed a lot of people before.  
One at a time, he destroyed two cities and led only one family escape.  
Sodom and Gomorrah.  
He brought our fire from heaven.  
 And destroy them.  
Somebody says that God must be very terrible.  
No, He's not terrible.  
He's only terrible to those who have been terrible and refused to repent.  
Because God said, I'll be to you what you see me to be.  
You still there?  
Barris is to the pio.  
He shows Himself pio.  
To the fraud.  
He shows Himself fraud.  
Hallelujah.  
 So he says, as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that he may grow there by God wants us to grow.  
You can't keep praying the same baby's prayers.  
You were praying last year.  
Come on.  
When a child is one year old, there's some things the child should be doing.  
Come on.  
Am I right?  
You want to see a child beginning to learn to walk, right?  
 By the time the child is five years old, you don't want him creeping.  


  
Oh, father.  
Oh, father.  
Thank you.  
For my mother, my father, my brother, my sisters, thank you.  
For my country, head of state to the lowest.  
Thank you.  
Plus God, my most devil.  
You have prayed.  
 Or you sit at the dining table and say, bless this food, O Lord, for Christ's sake.  
Foolish prayer.  
God doesn't answer that kind of stupid prayer, except what he's been answering.  
No, no, no.  
He doesn't answer that kind of prayer.  
Bless this food, O Lord, for Christ's sake.  
For Christ's sake, who's going to eat it?  
You.  
He doesn't bless it for Christ's sake.  
He blesses it for your sake.  
 No, you know, we've prayed some things so long, we can't think anything's wrong, because a lie has been in office for 20 years, doesn't make it true.  
Plus God minus devil, that's prayer.  
So let's pray, let's pray, let's pray, let's pray.  
Plus God minus devil, amen.  


  
That's not prayer.  
 When Jesus prayed, the Bible said, he said, he said, not he thought.  


  
Moment of silence.  
You know, lots of stupid things that are done in the churches and people just don't know why they are babish.  
 even praise.  


  
So many funny things.  
Then you wonder why there's so much fighting in the churches, why there's so much criticism between the pastors and the pastors.  
You know, these pastors don't like those pastors and those pastors don't like these pastors.  
And so they raise the Christians that don't like those Christians and those Christians don't like these Christians and everybody's trying to destroy the other one because of  
 because people are not growing in the things of God.  
When you grow in the things of God, the first thing, the first evidence of your spiritual growth is the increase of the love nature of God in you.  
You walk in love.  
You can hold people because of something that did against yourself against you.  
You can walk in bitterness.  
You learn to overlook those things.  
 You don't number your enemies.  
What he did to me in 1935.  
They can't forget even husbands and wives.  
They got diaries.  
They've been married 56 years.  
And then they say, actually, what I'm not happy about is this happened in 1940.  
He said something in 1940.  
Oh, God.  


  
 1940, and you have never forgotten.  
It's only wrong with you.  
It shouldn't be that way.  
See, we are to grow.  
Second Peter chapter 3, and I'm reading to you from verse 17 into verse 18.  
 He therefore beloved, seeing you know these things before, be well-laced.  
He also been led away with the error of the weekend fall from your own steadfastness.  
Read verse 18 together, one to go.  


  
But grow!  
He tells us to what?  
Grow!  
In grace!  
 Grace, what is grace?  
Grace is that favor of God that brings that beauty of God into your life.  
It's the promoting power of God.  
That's what grace is.  
It is the excellence of God radiating from your spirit to the outer man.  
 Is that beauty of divinity at work in you?  
That's grace.  
Some people call it on merited favor.  
It's more than that.  
What is the favor about?  
 Yes, you didn't qualify for it by your own acts of righteousness.  


  
But he gave it to you.  
Now God says for us to grow in it so we can increase.  
 You ought to work in a greater grace today than you did last week.  


  
I believe in ever increasing glory.  
I believe in that.  
I've told you, I've never had a down life.  
Up, forward and upwards, continually.  
 And along that part, you will meet adversaries, crush them.  
Oh yeah?  
No, don't you think?  
If God's blessing you, Satan is going to come and say, congratulations.  
He'll never do that.  
He'll fight you all the way.  
But he's not a factor.  
Amen?  
He's not a factor.  
So it says, growing grace ain't in the knowledge.  
 of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in the knowledge.  
This is spiritual knowledge.  
He's talking about the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  
There's so much more to know about Him.  
Hallelujah.  
Tell somebody growing grace and in knowledge.  
The knowledge of God.  
Hallelujah.  
Alright, so that's the introduction.  
You get it?  
 That's the introduction.  
That's what we're talking about, priesthood and sacrifices.  
Letting you understand you can't keep living in the way you've been living as a spiritual babe.  
You can't keep praying the same prayer or worshiping and praising the same way you used to do.  
There's got to be some growths.  
You gotta understand there's got to be some growths.  
Your life cannot be full of prayers for what you want, what you need,  
 You can't continue to be self-centered.  
Every time you want to pray, you remember all your needs?  


  
In the Bible, where we quote all the time, my God shall supply.  
 We say, my God shall supply all my needs according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.  
That was said by Paul.  
But he never said, my God shall supply all my needs.  
He said, my God shall supply all your needs.  
He wasn't talking about himself.  
About himself, he said, I have learned in whatsoever state I am to be independent of circumstances.  
He had grown.  
Hallelujah.  
He had grown.  
 I never pray for things.  
I never pray for money.  
Well, since I grew up, you understand what I'm talking about?  
Of course, as a spiritual child, babe, you ask for everything.  
Like that little child, daddy, daddy is going to buy me a car.  
 How old is he, four years old?  
Daddy, I want new television.  
Daddy, computer.  
Daddy, bread.  
Daddy, sweet.  
You know?  
When it gets to be 12, Daddy says, come and clean this place.  
He thinks it's a joke for now.  
He cleans it and leaves.  
 Whatever he used in cleaning, there.  
Then mommy comes to pick it up.  
When he gets to me 15, that is his gone mode alone.  
And don't you leave the house till I come back.  
New instructions.  
Who want to go and play football?  
No, he's not going.  
Now he's under instructions.  
Some of you didn't even partake of that.  
You jumped everywhere you wanted to go.  
 So that's why it's difficult to get some spiritual instruction.  
You sit down, somebody says, sit down later.  
I'm going.  
Because you're not used to discipline.  
Or in the house of God, you've got to be disciplined.  
Discipline.  
Learn to stay where you are to be.  
Not where you want to be.  
 Do what you ought to do, not what you want to do.  
Say there's something about life.  
The people who want to say, I want to be this.  
This is what I want to be.  
This is where I want to go.  
This is what I want to do.  
Life can't be that way.  
You can't have what you want.  
You shouldn't have what you want.  
It's dangerous.  
Find out what kind of life should you live.  


  
 Even parents, many of you here, parents, your children are growing up and you're beginning to learn to say the wrong saying, well, you know, we let our children choose whatever they want to be.  
We don't force anything on our children, whatever they want to be, you're wrong.  
You're wrong.  
That's for the canal parents.  
That's for the worldly parents.  
That's the one who doesn't know God.  
Your responsibility as a parent is to find out from God that life your son or daughter should live.  
 You should know from God the men and women in the Bible that were praised for walking in God in righteousness.  
The Bible shows us they got the plan from God about their sons and daughters.  
God told them.  


  
 They say, well, you know, they're growing up.  
We just let them choose what they want to be.  
We don't want to tell them what they're going to, whatever they're interested in.  
You're going to soon find a child who says, I love sleeping.  
That's what I love.  
I want to be, I love sleeping.  
Then you come back and say, well, out of my 10 children, they want Judas' carrot.  
Who gave you Judas' carrot among your children?  
Nobody.  
You did.  
Because you said they could choose whatever they wanted.  
No, they can't choose what they want.  
 You gotta know from God what they ought to do.  
Of course they have their own mind.  
 But the Bible says, train up a child in the way he should go, not in the way he wants him to go, not in the way he wants to go.  
In the way he should go, how can you tell the way he should go?  
Only God.  
That's why you need to know from God.  
But if you're not living in Christ, if you're not following the Word of God, if you're not living in the Word of God, how can you know the will of God for yourself or for someone else?  
You can't know.  
 So father, mother, children are walking in darkness.  
See that?  
Says, train up a child in the way he should go.  
When he's old, he will not depart from it.  
If he has departed from it, chances are you didn't train him right.  
Because the Word of God says, if you train up a child in the way he should go.  
When he's old, he will not depart from it.  
He'll be in that part.  
 He can't think another way, but the way that you raised him up.  
Praise God.  
All right.  
So, growing grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to Him be glory, but now and forever, amen.  
Okay.  
Turn to 1 Peter chapter 2.  
Read verse 5.  


  
 Did you see that?  
He also has lively stones, now that's translated living stones, a built up of spiritual house and only priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
 You're built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood.  
And your responsibility, he says, is to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  
Look at verse nine, same book, same chapter.  
Read it out for me.  


  
 He are a chosen generation.  
A what?  
A royal priesthood.  


  
 Now he goes on to let us know we got a responsibility that he should show forth the praises of him who was called the other darkness into his marvelous light.  
Now you read that verse in the amplified version.  
Oh boy, you'd love it.  
We'll come to that some other time.  
But here he says that we are a kingdom of priests, royal priests.  
That's what we are.  
 That's what we are.  
Priesthood.  
A born-again child of God has been called into priesthood.  


  
Now, here is responsibility.  


  
Look at the book of Revelation.  
 Revelation.  


  
You can see in chapter 5 verse 10.  
Read it one to go.  
He's made us what?  
Kings and what?  
Priests.  
 So we're kings and priests.  
That's the meaning of royal priesthood.  
It means a kingdom of priests that we are royalty.  
But we do have responsibilities.  
 And we noticed where he said in verse five, first Peter chapter two, we're ready earlier, it says, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  
Okay, turn to the book of Hebrews, chapter five.  


  
 Have you seen it?  
All right, read verse one.  


  
So they've got a responsibility.  
Is that right?  
All right, look at Hebrews chapter eight.  


  
Read verse three.  


  
 Okay.  
Now, every high priest is ordained to offer what gives and sacrifices.  
Then, well, if you study from chapter 5 to chapter 8 and read it in context, you'd see he's making the case for Jesus Christ.  
 He's making the case for Jesus Christ.  
He's trying to establish to his audience the fact that Jesus Christ has become the high priest.  
And that he came in the order of Melchizedek and not in the order of Levi or Aaron.  
 Okay?  
And so he lets us know that since Jesus Christ is a high priest, he's already concluded his case.  
So he comes in to say, now, every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices.  
And if Jesus Christ is also a high priest, then he's got something to offer also.  
Praise God.  
Okay.  
And we have been raised in his order, in his order of priesthood.  
 Hallelujah.  
Now, in the Old Testament, Paul was making this comparison.  
In the Old Testament, the High Priest went into the most holy place once every year on behalf of the nation.  
And he offered blood sacrifices for himself and for the nation once every year.  
But then Paul explained in these chapters that Jesus Christ didn't need to do it once every year.  
He did it once.  
 for everybody and not to the blood of bulls or goats, but with his own blood.  
He went into the heavenly holy place and offered that blood for us and doesn't need to do it again.  
Hallelujah.  
But then when the high priest went into the most holy place to offer sacrifices, the priests functioned daily  
 in the holy place and in the autocort.  
They function daily.  
They offer gifts and sacrifices daily.  
The high priest ministered along with them daily.  
And if we are priests, then we have responsibilities every day.  
And we are told that our sacrifice is our spiritual.  
 they are spiritual.  
There's a reason they are spiritual.  
Now the priests of the Old Testament offered animals and other gifts.  
People brought all kinds of things and they offered these things to God as sacrifices every day.  
Can you imagine the number of animals that had to die continually?  
Where is God?  
But you see, that had to be done regularly.  
 But this was in the order, the Aaronic order, and it was powered by the law.  
And we come in from the order of Melchizedek.  
You see, who's Melchizedek?  
 Okay.  
Yeah.  
Someone asking, who's Melchizedek?  
Because I mentioned Melchizedek three times now.  
And if you're a young Christian, you haven't heard of Melchizedek, you say, who is that?  
Well, Melchizedek was a man who, one time in the book of Genesis, suddenly showed up.  
He just showed up.  
 And the great patriarch Abraham, when he saw Melchizedek while he was coming from the slaughter of the king, he had gone to war.  
Abraham had gone to war and he warned the battle.  
He had slain five kings.  
And now on his way back, this man, Melchizedek, suddenly appeared to Abraham with bread and wine.  
 And Abraham recognized something about this Melchizedek.  
And the Bible says he was the priest of the Most High God.  
And the great Abraham powed before him and gave him a tithe of all the spores that he had taken from war.  
He paid the tithes to Melchizedek.  
 In Melchizedek blessed Abraham and said blessed be Abraham of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth.  
And blessed be God who delivered you from your enemies.  
You know, he blessed Abraham and disappeared.  
And nothing anymore was said about Melchizedek.  
Nothing about his father or mother or children  
 Nothing except that he was the king of silent, king of righteousness.  
He was interpreted king of righteousness and king of peace.  
So who was he?  
We talk about Theophanese and Christophanese.  
All right.  
 Those are references to appearances, divine appearances of God, or when this is Christophany, they're talking about the appearance of Jesus Christ, an Old Testament, these things that revealed God and this divine personality before the incarnation.  
Praise the Lord.  
 Okay, so Paul was the only one who really talked again about this great Melchizedek, apart from the Psalmist who ordered God's word, God's prophetic word, about Jesus Christ being made a priest after the order of Melchizedek.  
Okay, but then Melchizedek was therefore said to have an endless life, an endless priesthood.  
 So, Bible scholars would say that this was the appearance of the pre-incarnate Christ.  
All right, they would say so.  
But there's more to that.  
Hallelujah.  
 And I don't want to go too deep into that, but you understand what I'm talking about?  
Who was Melchizedek?  
I'm trying to let you know who he was.  
But this great Melchizedek, who was a type of Christ, and that's the simplest way to put it for you, was a type of Christ.  
The priest of the Most High God was the one that was said to have the same priesthood after, because he was established by the power of an endless life.  
 Praise the Lord.  
So we are called in the order of Christ.  
Now let me show you something else which will help you get this a little more clearly.  
Would you turn to 1 Corinthians chapter number 15?  
Hallelujah.  
1 Corinthians chapter number 15.  
Go straight to verse 47, want to go.  


  
 Remarkable.  
Remarkable.  
Remarkable portion of the Bible.  
Read that 47th verse one more time.  


  
 Now listen, he is making a distinction between the first man Adam and the second man whom he calls the last Adam.  
He calls him the second man, or he calls him the last Adam.  
 Now, that's the letters, no, there's not gonna be another Adam, okay?  
So he says, the first Adam, and then the second and last Adam.  
Oh, he's good with that.  
All right, now he talks about the first Adam, and he says it's of the earth's ethic.  
He was made from the dust.  
He was the man who was put here to be terrestrial.  
 And then it says, the second man is the Lord from heaven.  
Jesus Christ.  
Now, you know, we talk about the new creation.  
 There's the first creation headed by Adam, and then there's the second creation, the new creation, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation.  
Now this new creation is headed by Jesus Christ.  
He was the first to be born again.  
He was born again the day that he was raised from the dead.  
That's what the Bible says.  
It says, Thou at My Son, this day have I begotten thee.  
 See that?  
You know, when I was a spiritual child, people would go to preach to people and they would say, you want us to be born again.  
Even Jesus himself was not born again.  
Then I would say, well, he didn't need to be born again.  
That's why he was not born again.  
I was wrong.  
I didn't know it because I didn't know the Scriptures.  
But I thought it was a nice answer.  
I thought Jesus was so righteous, never needed to be born again.  
But I was wrong.  
No matter how nice it sounded.  
 The truth was Jesus needed to be born again.  
You say, why?  
He never committed anything.  
Yes, he never did.  
The reason he needed to be born again was because he was put on the cross in our place.  
Our sins were laid on him.  
The barber says, he who knew no sin was made to be sin for us.  
Our sins were laid on Jesus.  
So when he died, he died as sin as death.  
He died the death of a condemned man.  
 He was condemned in my place.  
And so he went to hell.  
When he died, he went to hell.  
He didn't go to heaven.  
He went to hell.  
So much as I bought, he said, this day shall not be with me in paradise.  
No.  
 He went first to hell.  
And not ranging of this day should I be with me in paradise.  
The King James rendering is particularly misleading because he said, I say to you, today shall I be with me in paradise.  
The punctuations were wrongly placed.  
What he said was, I say to you today, thou shalt be with me in paradise.  
You get it?  
 All right, so what we're saying here is Jesus Christ really needed to be born again because he became sin for us and he was buried in our place.  
So he went to hell in our place.  
And he had to fight the devil and the cohorts of hell in our place.  
And the Bible records that he threw them off of him in our place and became victorious over Satan in our place.  
 And when he was done with them, the Bible says he led captivity captive.  
So he came out of hell and out of the grave.  
And the Bible says when he arose, he came up with a new, a newness of life.  
And not life is what he makes available to us today.  
Praise God forevermore.  
So that's why he had to be born again.  
Glory to God.  
 All right, so the first man Adam was of the earth.  
Earthy.  
He was of the earth.  
Earthy.  
Then he says, the second man, the Lord from heaven, Jesus Christ, is the second man.  
Now, you know people make statements like, I don't know that man from Adam.  
Question, which Adam are you talking about?  


  
Which one?  
Which one are you from?  
 If you're born again, you are not from the first Adam, you are from the second and last Adam.  
That's what the Bible says.  
God doesn't trace your lineage to the first Adam.  
He traces it to the second Adam, Jesus Christ.  
We talked about this.  
You remember?  
You sure?  
When it's a glorious thing that's spoken of the Old City of God.  
 talking about Zion.  
He says, when God numbers the people, you know, for those of the world, he'll say, this man was born in Egypt.  
This man was born, called the country, Togo, Nigeria, United States,  
 All right, wherever.  
Canada.  
This man says, but when God, when God, righted up the people, when he recorded his people, he shall said, this man was born there.  
Where?  
Inside.  
In other words, me and all glory to God.  
He doesn't trace you.  
He doesn't trace your lineage to Nigeria.  
 He doesn't trace it to England.  
He doesn't trace it to anywhere in Europe or Asia.  
He traces you desire.  


  
Marvellous, marvellous.  
Say this, I'm born after the second Adam.  
I hail from Christ Jesus.  
He's my origin.  
 Glory to God.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Now, did you notice in the 48 verse, read that 48 verse.  
First Corinthians chapter 15.  


  
Oh God, this is a most terrifying scripture.  
Did you hear what he said?  
Ask East, now I want you to notice the tenses.  
 You know, when you study the Bible, you've got to notice the tenses.  
Notice when he uses past tense, present tense, and future tense.  
Very, very important.  
Now he says, as is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy.  
Oh God.  
And as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.  
 He got two groups in the earth, the ethnic guys and the heavenly guys.  
Hey, where are you from?  
Heavenly.  
Then there are just some things you can't do.  
You can live like the athlete or what we call the atlings.  
You can live like them, can you?  
No, when you do your business, you don't do your business like the atlings.  
 Are you hearing me?  
Mm-mm.  
Mm-mm.  
You do your business differently.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Say, I'm heavenly.  
See, the Bible says, as is the earthy, such are they, or so that are earthy.  
And as is the heavenly, such are they, or so that are heavenly.  


  
 Say, oh, if you're a Nigerian, we're not gonna do business with Sam and Nigeria with a difference.  
Am I right?  
Say, oh, you lawyers, huh?  
I'm a lawyer with a difference.  
I'm a politician with a difference.  
Because I'm heavenly.  
I play by heavenly rules.  
Hey, man?  
This is real.  
 I play by heavenly rules.  
I've got a different kind of life.  
As is the ethnic, such are they also, that I eat thee.  
And as is the heavenly, such are they.  
He didn't say such shall they be.  
He said such are they also, that are heavenly.  
Now the third verse, which is the 49 verse,  
 The King James translation is a little misleading and non-contextual from where we're reading, but I'll tell you what it says, and then maybe you can look up the originals or maybe a few other translations you get the point.  
Okay, the 49 verse, read it for me.  


  
 Yeah, it is as we have borne the image of the Earth, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.  
Now that's what I said was misleading because he takes it off the context, off the present context, and gives us the idea that he is referring to something in future.  
Nobody's not.  
The original doesn't say so.  
Doesn't even suggest that.  


  
 If you read in the amplified, the amplified gives it to you.  
Read the amplified version.  
Or you read the way-mouthed translation.  
Anybody's got the amplified here?  
All right.  
 we have born the image of the man of dust.  
So shall we.  
And so, let us also bear the image of the man of heaven.  
Let us bear.  
In other words, see, he's telling us to do it.  
And the word image there is the Greek icon from where we get our English word icon.  
 In other words, we bear his representation.  
We are like him.  
We are his icon.  
Oh, man.  
Ah, ah!  
Glory to God.  
Say, I'm his icon.  
I'm his icon.  
You get to me, you get to him.  
Hey, that's a reality.  
You get to me, you get to him.  
 I'm his icon.  
You get to me.  
You get to him.  
And that settles it.  
Glory to God.  
 All right, you know, a lot of us because we were still growing, we're concerned about many things.  
We say, we won't pray for this and pray for that.  
We're asking God for this and asking God for that, you know.  
So because of that, our real responsibilities as children of God, our ministry as children of God gets clouded by these seeming needs of ours.  
 And these funny expectations of, you know, I need a miracle.  
I just gotta have a miracle in this and in that and in the other.  
There is a miracle life you can have.  
Are you listening to me?  
There is an unending, miraculous life where you don't ask for anything.  
 I want you to Johnny in that direction.  
Will you no longer concern with these ethnic things and asking for this and asking for that?  
Where, whatever you require at any time, we call it the call of a soul.  
Know what I mean by the call of a soul?  
There's something within your system that pulls towards you.  
Men, materials, under circumstances.  
 that are consistent with God's calling on your life and with the call of your soul.  
All you have to do is set that up in your spirit through the Word of God and you will never walk in luck in your life.  
There will be no consciousness of luck or failure, no such consciousness.  
I can't think luck.  
It's not within my system.  
 I'm unable to think that way.  
Why?  
Because there's the mentality of the righteous according to the Bible.  
And you know, you train yourself through the Word of God and beard into maturity.  
And your life just functions like that.  
You don't need to ask for this because your life is in that level where anything you require comes to you in abundance.  
They always have.  
 Never in need.  
Never in luck.  
Now, you think if God wanted us to be asking for everything we ever require, what kind of praying we will be doing?  
Every day you're going to be asking for stupid things.  
Oh God, I need money for my exam.  
Oh God, I need money for my house.  
Oh God, I need, oh God.  
But the Bible says the Lord perfects that which consonates you.  
Why don't you work in that revelation?  
Is this all things are yours?  
If all things are yours, what are you asking for?  
 See what I mean?  
It's the understanding.  
See, the difference between some of us and some of the folks is the knowledge, revelation knowledge.  
And that's why they think that what we're doing is magical, or there's some cheating, or there's some, you know, who are drinking certain people so they don't know what we're doing.  
Absolute nonsense.  
You rise in your spirit and gain the dominion and walk the sounds of God.  
Can you say amen?  
 work as sounds of God.  
The Bible says the earnest expectation of the creation waited for the manifestation of the hues of God.  
That's what the creation is waiting for.  
When we come in, there's a blessing.  
 You know, they used to sing that song, everything I touch.  
Shelley must be blessed.  
And Christians were, they kind of lies it and made mockery of it.  
They'll go, everything I touch.  
Shelley must be blessed.  
What is more than that?  
It's supposed to be a consciousness.  
Not you going on touching like this, everything I touch.  
You got to learn some things.  
I learned something from T.L.S., but let me tell you what it was.  
 T.L.  
Osmond said, very important.  
He said, when he started out in crusades, it was good that I learned it.  
He said, when he started out in crusades, and his feet touched the tarmac of a nation, he said, devil, you're in trouble.  
You got to run, because T.L.  
has come to town.  
Then he said, I learned better than that.  
I don't say it anymore.  
He said, when I show up, they go.  
 You see, I thought that was beautiful.  
And I'd been doing about the same thing.  
When I went for these crusades, you know, I went to many towns and villages.  
And when I would get there, me and the folks with me, you know what's in the name of Jesus, our feet have touched this land and the devil has the power.  
When I heard what tears said, I said, I don't need to say that when I show up, they know.  
 See that?  
But it turned out to be that way.  
It turned out to be that way because you see this thing is spiritual.  
Listen, this is true knowledge, shall the just be delivered.  
I added the last part to it into their inheritance because I'm not deliverance from devil conscious.  
Hallelujah.  
 Say aye.  
I'm a king, and a priest, and I've got responsibilities.  
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.  
Legal, cara, un skosha, platinum, de higa.  
Faro esto, salam aye.  
Varadiga, sashto de hate.  
For it is written the weapons of our warfare, not gano.  
But mighty through guard to the pulling down of strongholds.  
Rise up.  
 and take the challenge of your time and walk in the victory of your Lord.  
For the victory belongs to you, but it was right long ago, but it belongs to you.  
Walk this word with the shout of a king in your midst, said the Lord, for thou art mine, and the world belongs to you.  
 So set the spirit of God unto you.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Worship him and thank him.  
Verify his holy name.
