title: Priesthood and Sacrifices Part 4
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Devo is yours.  


  
 First Peter chapter number two, and verse five.  
He also was living stones, King James is lively, a built up of spiritual house, an only priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  
He says that we are living stones.  
 Well, God's building, it's a spiritual house, it says.  
And each one of us is a vital member of that building, stones, rocks.  
So you see, it wasn't only Peter who was to be a stone, a rock.  
Each one of us is a living stone.  
 Hallelujah.  
He also has lived in stones that built up a spiritual house, an only priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  
We have a responsibility.  
We have a responsibility in ministry, a responsibility in Christ,  
 And we should wake up to that responsibility.  
We are the ones expected to win the world for Jesus Christ.  
You know that?  
We are the ones to win the world.  
And we have to do everything that's necessary to reach the world.  
Our concerns must be His concerns.  
That is to say,  
 What he's concerned about is what we should be concerned about.  
What he cares about is what we should care about.  
Otherwise, what is life?  
But emptiness.  
Life is nothing without God's purpose.  
Think about it.  
You're here today.  
Your great-great-great grandfather was here.  
 Where is he?  
He's gone.  
Then the next one came, gone.  
Then the next one came, gone.  
Then the next one, until finally got to you.  
So question is, hey, what are we doing here?  
That's why Jesus said, what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?  
What shall a man give in exchange for his soul?  
So your purpose for life is very important.  
 You should be definite as to your purpose for life.  
Why are you here?  
Have you found a reason for your being?  
Do you know most people live their lives without ever discovering why they were born?  
They just walk through life.  
Live an empty life and all they think about is themselves.  
But all they think about.  
I don't think of  
 a worse life than the life of a selfish man who thinks about himself only.  
All his prayers are about himself.  
You, your family, your job, everything's you, you, you.  
All your needs have to do with you, you, you, you, you.  
That's an empty life.  
Live for a reason.  
 Left for a reason.  
Sometimes I get concerned about the fact that in our nation particularly, there's almost no such thing as patriotism.  
We don't care about our country.  
Terrible.  
 Because we weren't raised to care.  
We weren't raised that way.  
So we don't care.  
So everyone who gets into politics or into government gets in for what he can get for himself.  
As a result of that, we bring that also into Christianity.  
What all we do is  
 We think that, like I told you the other day, many people think God exists for them.  
They think God lives for them.  
They don't think of the fact that they exist for God.  
They think that God is there for them.  
So when someone gets into a political office,  
 We think, okay, now that you're there, remember us.  
And not remember us.  
You're talking about cousins and relatives.  
They all come around.  
And if he doesn't steal from the government to give to them, they think it's crazy.  
If you get into a political office and you don't  
 make enough money to get out with a lot.  
You look like your fool.  
So people don't really get into politics or into government to do something for our nation to get in there, to get something for themselves.  
 So it's become a culture.  
It's a way of life.  
It's a terrible way of life.  
See, the problem we did is not the country in itself.  
The problem we did is what you become, the character of your personality when you live that way.  
You become less than you were raised to be, less than you were born to be.  
 So, when we bring it into Christ, we find ourselves doing the same thing.  
If we could use God to get what we wanted, we would use Him.  
 I've said several times before that, if anybody in this country knew where to get the certificate of ownership for all of the land of Nigeria, he would have sold it a long time ago.  
If one person had it, it's a terrible feeling.  
I'm serious, terrible feeling.  
 Terrible feeling.  
The reason we are that way is because we were brought up to be that way.  
That's what I mean.  
We're consciously and unconsciously brought up to be that way.  
And so that's the reason for the thugry.  
We have thugs to help us get elected to make sure nobody votes.  
You understand?  
I mean, it's terrible.  
In many countries, they're trying to make sure that people vote.  
We have people here to make sure you don't vote.  


  
 But you see, they don't know what they are doing to themselves.  
So let's come to this subject.  
And I said, what do we do for God?  
We want to get God to do something for us.  
All the time, oh, God, answer my prayer.  
God, do this for me.  
Do this for me.  
Oh, God, I need this and I need that and I need that.  
What do you do for God?  
 What is your own responsibility?  
Oh, somebody says, well, my responsibility is to have faith to get something.  
Again, you want to use God.  
You're just having faith so that you can get God to do something for you.  
No.  
No.  
Turn again to 2nd Corinthians chapter number five.  
I read something to you the other day.  
2nd Corinthians chapter five.  
 Verse 14, for the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge that if one died for all, then we are dead.  
And that he died for all, that they which live should not hence for live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again.  
You see that?  
He died for all.  
So that, now he says he died for all, and if he died for all, then we all died.  
 But then he died first so that we who live shall no longer live unto ourselves, but live unto him.  
Live unto him.  
You cannot just be a Christian to get God's blessings.  
You cannot just be a Christian.  
 to have your prayers answered, to have a nice, nice life for yourself.  
No.  
You're gonna have to stick out your neck for the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
 Paul said certain things about his life, why he was persecuted so much.  
He said he was persecuted more than the other apostles.  
He says, and some of the others were afraid to be persecuted.  
They were afraid to stick out their necks for the gospel of Christ among the Jews.  
So when he went to Jerusalem to visit, they called him.  
 The other apostles called him, they called Paul.  
They said, you know, there are many Jews who believe and they are zealous of the law.  
And Paul was wondering, why are the zealous of the law?  
They're not supposed to be keeping the law now.  
The gospel has come.  
Christ has died.  
Christ has arisen.  
Christ has ascended.  
 Why are they keeping the law?  
All they said, you know, we don't want to stay at the waters.  
Now, what we want you to do is to shave your head and join those that have a vow.  
And so when you go to the temple, the crowd will see you there.  
And once they see that you are shaven, they will know that you also keep the law, and there will be peace.  
He said, it's OK.  
So he shaved his head and went  
 with the others to the temple.  
When somebody recognized him, he screamed and said, this is Paul, he's the one that's been troubling all the Jews, saying that we should not keep the law.  
He raised his voice against Paul and the crowd came and he took Paul.  
They wanted to kill him because of his message.  
They were zealous to keep the law.  
But the law had been abolished.  
 and they wanted to keep it.  
Why did the others not tell the truth about it?  
They knew the truth about it, but they were afraid to stand up for the gospel.  
See what I mean?  
Being afraid to stand up for the gospel.  
Being afraid to stick out your neck for Christ.  
Sometimes it happens even where you work.  
 There are some other Christians that they're always talking about and talking against.  
But nobody ever talks against you.  
They know you're a Christian, a nice Christian.  
Who doesn't trouble anybody?  
But these are the ones who are always preaching.  
They don't like them because they're trying to combat them.  
But they like you because you're nice.  
You don't talk about Jesus too much.  
 terrible life to live, terrible life to live.  
No matter how we strategize for preaching the gospel, we should do strategize to the point where we lose our confidence in Christ or where we are no longer bold enough to publicly proclaim His launcher.  
What do you do?  
 for Him.  
What do you do for Him?  
What's your own responsibility for Christ?  
Are your soldier for the Lord?  
Are your soldier?  
Are your soldier?  
Or are you a civilian?  


  
 How many of you are civilians here?  
Spiritual civilians.  
How many of you are spiritual soldiers?  
Are you a soldier?  
You should be a soldier.  
You should be tough.  
Okay, we want to pray.  
So we all stand up to pray.  
 We're all joining our hands and standing up to pray.  
Then only you, you shift, shift, shift, shift, shift.  
Ah!  
They're still holding your hands, only you are tired.  
Sit down.  
You know?  
Always taking the weak option.  
Always taking the weak option.  
Okay, we want to fast and pray.  
Your own is to be broken by twelve.  
 You've been watching the time.  
As soon as it crosses to a, okay.  
But in Jesus' name, thank you.  
You've eaten.  
Only prayer and fast until 4 p.m.  
You're already asking questions.  
What if somebody can take only meat pie?  
Is biscuit okay?  
What of meat without food?  
 You're asking all kinds of questions.  
Just one day is fast till 4 p.m.  
You want to know, are there no different types of fasting in the Bible?  
Can I drink milk?  
You won't die.  
4 p.m.  
You won't die.  
There have been days you didn't eat till 7 till 8 till 9 p.m.  
Nothing happened.  
Now just till 4.  


  
 Or you have doctors permit to not fast.  
Doctors say, I should always eat.  
You're calling your leader.  
Please, I just wanted to let you know.  
I know today is fasting and prayer, but doctors say, make sure I eat.  
I've been taking some drugs for three weeks now.  
I must eat before the drugs.  
That's why you're still on drugs.  
What a life with drugs.  
 When will you come off the drugs?  
Say, I'm a soldier.  
Say, again, I'm a soldier.  
Did you know that in the Old Testament, it was the priests that were at the forefront of the war?  
Richard Bible.  
So when you say a priest, you don't mean the one that is hiding in the temple.  
When it was time for war, the priest was in front.  
It was the priest.  
 It was a time for war.  
It wasn't a soldier that went in front.  
It was a priest.  
They carried the apple guard and stood in front.  
So your priestly ministry comes first.  
If you're going to be very successful in life, your priestly ministry comes first.  
If you've not carried out your personal priestly ministry, you cannot reign as a king.  
 He's made of kings and priests.  
But the priestly ministry comes ahead of your kingly authority.  
You know people keep asking questions, why is it that this person in prison, it doesn't work the other person in prison the same way and it works?  
Sometimes, you talk about faith.  
But faith is not empty.  
Faith is based on the word.  
Faith is based on the word.  
 And when we said the word, not just the faith to receive something based on a promise, the Word of God, the Word of God is a revelation.  
And put it this way, something that you need to understand.  
If you study in 1 Corinthians in chapter number 12, reading from verse seven,  
 He begins by saying, the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit with all, meaning for the common good.  
And then to one is given and he tells us these various gifts of the Spirit, the word of wisdom to another, the word of knowledge and so on and so forth.  
He lists nine different gifts in that chapter.  
 And these nine can be classified into three different groups.  
The one group is what we call the revelation gifts.  
And these are the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, and then  
 the discerning of spirits.  
Incidentally, that one is listed toward the end, discerning of spirits.  
These are the revelation gifts.  
Then comes what we call the power gifts.  
And these are the gift of faith, the gift  
 of the working of miracles and the gifts of healing.  
Now the gifts of healing are given to us in plural.  
The others are gift, gift, gift, but in healing he uses a plurality and that does mean something.  
We don't have the time to discuss all that in detail today but try to explain something to you.  
These are the power gifts, faith,  
 the work in the miracles, the gifts of healing.  
Some even go gifts of healings, but whatever, it's in plural.  
Then you have what we call the utterance gifts, utterance to order something, the utterance gifts.  
Now the utterance gifts are one, the gift of prophecy, two,  
 the gift of diverse kinds of tongues.  
Then three, the gift of the interpretation of tongues.  
Three groups of gifts and dominance of the spirits for believers.  
Revelation, power, tolerance.  
 Now, this is important.  
If you would study in St.  
Matthew's gospel, the third chapter into the fourth chapter, and also in St.  
Mark's gospel chapter number one, we're talking about here the baptism of Jesus Christ by John, and that beautiful experience there at the Jordan in what happened with Christ.  
 First was the revelation.  
Second was the empowerment.  
After that the utterance began.  
What do you mean by that?  
First was the revelation we, the heavens opened and the Spirit of God descended.  
He saw the Spirit of God descending on him.  
John saw the Spirit of God descending on him.  
 And he heard that voice of God speak.  
This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.  
Revelation.  
Revelation.  
Then he was filled with the Spirit.  
Empowerment.  
So there was divine revelation.  
Then there was divine enablement.  
Divine empowerment by the Spirit.  
 The Bible tells us that he was driven of a spirit led into the wilderness to be tempted of a devil.  
So he was there 40 days and 40 nights.  
And then you remember he was hungry and then there was a temptation.  
All right, you remember?  
Then he came back to do what?  
Preach, utterance.  
And preaching is divine utterance.  
He didn't say he came to talk.  
See, he preached.  
Preach what?  
The gospel.  
 Each one of us must also experience it that way, revelation, empowerment, and then utterance.  
Divine revelation, meaning the Spirit of God, revealing the Word of God to your spirit.  
Revealing the gospel to your spirit, giving you an understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ, in your spirit.  
You receive that revelation of the gospel.  
 who Jesus is, what he came to do, and how that he accomplished it, and who you are today.  
Revelation, and then be filled with the spirits, divine empowerment, divine empowerment.  
Then you say, I can do all things through Christ's, that strengthens me.  
And without divine empowerment,  
 You can now have divine artworks.  
You can speak for the Lord.  
You utter words.  
That's what's in the last days, apart, my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.  
That means they shall speak words of power.  
But you see, this will not work except you have  
 the ministry of the Spirit in priesthood.  
See that?  
The priest ministers to God in things concerning men.  
And ministers to men in things concerning God, because the Bible says the priest lives, you keep knowledge.  
So the knowledge of God to be found in his mouth.  
 which means he teaches the word of God.  
He brings out revelations of God's kingdom to people.  
You see that?  
But he can't get it until he means that's first to God.  
He must mean he's the first to God.  
A lot of times, our songs are songs that entertain us.  
 beautiful songs, and there's a place where we entertain ourselves, when we sing about ourselves and about one another and about the church.  
That's beautiful.  
But then we must also learn more importantly to minister, to the Lord.  
You see, you can sing about Him, but it's different when you sing to Him.  
 How great is our God?  
How great is His name?  
He rolled back the waters.  
Beautiful song.  
But in that song, we are singing about Him.  
You see that?  
We are singing about Him.  
See, there are songs that we sing about as theirs.  
Greater is He that is in me, greater is He that is in me, greater is He that is in me, greater is He that is in me than He that is in the Word.  
That's about us.  
Beautiful song.  
 So we sing those songs.  
So we sing about ourselves, we sing about God.  
But neither of these two is a ministry to Him.  
Are you listening to me?  
So we must know the difference and learn to minister to God because that is more important.  
 Now, it doesn't take the place of these other two.  
Are you listening?  
It doesn't take the place of these other two.  
It has its place, that's the point.  
But that it should have number one place.  
See, one of the problems with many, many Christians is that they don't have what you call the spiritual order.  
They don't understand spiritual order.  
And in many churches, they don't understand spiritual order.  
 Most don't.  
They don't understand spiritual order.  
There's order in the Church of Christ.  
Whether or not we recognize the order.  
It's there.  
God recognizes it.  
Praise God.  
Are you still in this place?  
The spiritual order.  
So our ministry to the Lord  
 is number one in our responsibility in life.  
Look how Jesus taught his disciples to pray.  
He said, when you pray.  
He says, after this manner, therefore pray.  
He said, when you do say this, our Father, which art in heaven, how Lord be thy name,  
 thy kingdom come, thy will be done and hurt as it is in heaven before the give me."  
You see, he was teaching the order.  
He didn't say, we should pray that prayer.  
He gave us the order.  
The first thing he said you do is, our Father, you are dressing directly.  
How Lord be thy name.  
 glory to God.  
Oh, Hallelujah.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
He says, you begin your prayer life with that.  
You praise Him.  
You worship Him.  
Did you notice in the 13th chapter of the book of Acts?  
 when you read from verse 1 and verse 2, the Bible tells us about certain teachers and prophets, ministers of God, who were in that church at Antioch.  
And Paul was one of them.  
While they were there, on this occasion, the Bible says, they prayed to the Lord and fasted.  
 It tells us, as they minister to the Lord, the Holy Ghost said, the Holy Spirit spoke, as they minister to the Lord.  
 They didn't have to be saying, oh, speak to us.  
We want to hear your voice.  
Speak.  
No, they just missed that to him.  
And he spoke.  
Praise God.  
You know, many times we want to know, what's the will of God concerning something?  
Maybe about our job.  
Maybe about something that you're interested in.  
And you want to know what the spirit of God has to say about this thing to you.  
And you want to hear him clearly.  
Am I right?  
You don't want to assume nothing.  
You want to hear him clearly.  
 Well, if you want that, minister to Him.  
As they minister to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, He spoke and they understood Him clearly.  
Let me tell you, did you know it's God's will and purpose and desire?  
 to talk to you personally and to have you understand him clearly.  
He wants that more than you do.  
He wants to do that for you more than you want it.  
The truth is, he's been doing it.  
But when your spirit is clouded,  
 with other things, other matters.  
You can't hear Him.  
And I tell people, they ask, why do we fast when we do?  
Why should we fast at all?  
We don't fast to get God to hear us.  
We don't fast so God can hear our prayer.  
And so we can be more serious about the prayer for God to hear us and convince Him to do something for us.  
No.  
 It's when you're fast, it's not God who's not eating, it's you.  
And he doesn't eat the food that you didn't eat.  
He doesn't eat it.  
So you're fast and it doesn't change God.  
Your fasting changes you.  
It helps you position yourself where God's word can come to you.  
 And sometimes where God even sees feet to talk to you.  
I'm not sure you got that.  
Should I say it again?  
I said, your fasting can put you in a position where God sees fit to talk to you.  
In other words,  
 Even though he's been talking, he's been leading, he's been speaking to you and you've not been picking it.  
Fasting and praying can reposition you where the Spirit of God finds it necessary because of your spiritual reorientation.  
 He finds it necessary to minister to you in another way, other than how he's been doing it.  
So there are things we do.  
There are things we must do, our own responsibility.  
When you pray on your own,  
 Take time, not just to remember the things that you need.  
There are times you don't need to ask for anything.  
I hear me.  
You don't ask for anything.  
If there's anything you're going to be asking about, be filled with the Spirit.  
 Oh, did you know God's spirit is God's answer?  
And that when we pray, imagine all the needs that we've got every day.  
I mean, if God expected us to pray about the things that we are concerned about, oh boy, that's just too much.  
 I got to pray about an uncle in an in-law, and then about a friend, and about a neighbor, and about some members of the church, and then some leaders.  
And I got to pray about some non-Christian friend and some non-Christian relative.  
And I got to pray about something that they said the other day, that that other person said, and that the other one said that he heard the other one say, that that other person said that he heard.  
You know what I'm talking about.  
 And so, I've got to pray about, oh, the government and what the government is trying to do and what they have done and what they're... You know, if I've got to pray about all of these things, then it's better to just die.  
Because there are too many and we just can't make it.  
You've got to expect it us to do this.  


  
Now, imagine what you would have to pray about.  
 If he's holding you responsible for all your uncles, especially some of you that come from very large families, imagine if you are responsible, uncle Nat, uncle Tom, uncle Green and all of them, you're going to pray for all of them and then their families and their large families.  
You're going to pray for that?  
You feel guilty every day.  
And when something happens to one of them, you feel guilty.  
 I wish I had prayed.  
If I prayed, this would have not happened.  
You go how many times you would cry and wish you had prayed.  
You've been feeling guilty all the time.  
When something has happened to someone who's close, I wish I prayed.  
Oh God, I'm sorry.  
You'll repent today.  
Tomorrow something else has happened.  
Maybe this time to a friend.  
Oh, I wish I prayed.  
The secret to all these things.  
 is being filled with the Holy Ghost, being filled with the Spirit.  
He says, Thou would perfect that which can't turn at me.  
When you're filled with the Spirit, one word from the Spirit can affect so many things, so many things,  
 one anointed word of the Holy Ghost.  
No, you have to pray about your job.  
Why you're praying about your job, you're praying about your boss, you're praying about your employee, you're praying about the financial situation, you're praying about the customer, then you're praying about all these things.  
No, he didn't plan to confuse us like that.  
 He planned to give us a life with absolute mastery all the time.  
That's why praying in the Holy Ghost is a great, sacred weapon.  
Praying in the Holy Ghost.  
If you don't know how to pray in the Holy Ghost, I don't know what you're waiting for.  
 Praying the spirits.  
You just, you know, take a chair, something or kneel or lie down and you're speaking other terms.  
And when you, you don't have to shout.  
Keep praying until your whole body is saturated with power.  
You know, you're just a kid.  


  
 It's happening.  
Something is happening.  
You know what I'm talking about.  
Something is happening.  
You're staring up something.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
 Thank God for power from on high.  
Let's come to our spirits.  
Now we can minister to God.  
When we lift our hands and father, we worship thee.  
And the next thing we go in are the tongues.  


  
 Speak in, speak in, speak in.  
And while we're doing that, something is happening in the realm of the Spirit.  
Our root in life is being corrected.  
Certain people who would have come into my life in five years that have been removed from there.  
Do you want us to know what I'm talking about?  
 As I pray, God looks into my next year and my other year and he fixes things there when I'm praying in the Holy Ghost.  


  
Are you still there?  
So when troubles strikes, you say they're bread.  
You say, I'm already done with all this.  
I've passed this level.  
Say, I've passed this level.  
 Say it again, I've passed this level.  
I've passed this level.  


  
So they are greater things.  
I've passed this level.  
They are greater things.  
Say it again, I've passed this level.  
Yeah.  
Yeah.  
Maybe you ought to work.  
 You know, with the economic problems around the world, many companies are folded up, and many are not making progress, and so they're laying off their staff and, you know, cutting down.  
And such a thing can affect just a child of God.  
And so, maybe you're among those that have already been taxed, and you're out of work.  
I wonder what's going through your mind.  
I wonder what you're thinking.  
 If your job was your sauce, you are sunk.  
You're in trouble.  
But your job was not supposed to be your sauce.  
Change your thinking.  
Your job is not your sauce.  
 Listen, you are a child of the kingdom.  
You belong from another word.  
Don't you understand?  
Not this word.  
You belong in Zion.  
You belong in Christ.  
And because you belong in Christ, your prosperity is not based on your labor.  
 Your labor is required because it's your opportunity and your, it's your, your window to the world.  
It's your opportunity to reach the world, to communicate, to reach out to them.  
Are you listening?  
It's another way for you to bless the world in which you live.  
But it's not your sauce.  
It's not your sauce.  
It's not your sauce.  
Listen, your confession should always be.  
This is not my sauce.  
 Christ is my source.  
Hallelujah.  
Christ is my source.  
I don't have to have a job to be alive.  
I don't have to have a job to be me.  
No.  
But I do a job because of who I am.  
 Come on now, are you getting the idea?  
So if they lay you off one job, it doesn't make a difference.  
You just get a better one.  
They say it's difficult.  
No, no, no, not for you.  
If nobody hires you, start one.  
Start one.  
Because you know who you are.  
If nobody hires you, get into something and start.  
Say, Father, nobody has hired me.  
 But I know what I can do.  
Then start out with what idea God gives to you.  
Don't stop saying, I don't have capital.  
I don't have money.  
I don't have somebody to help me.  
Phew, that's wrong.  
That's wrong.  
That's wrong.  
God said, Moses, what do you have in your hand?  
What do you have in your hand?  
He said, I wrote.  
 All right, that didn't look like anything.  
God said, put it down.  
He put it down.  
They turned into a shepherd.  
Moses fled from it.  
God said, pick it up by the tail.  
You see, God was strategic because it was a real serpent.  
He said, pick it up by the tail.  
And Moses went and picked it up by the tail.  
He turned into a rod again.  
He said, my goodness.  


  
Then God said,  
 Put your hand into your bosom.  
He dipped his hand in there.  
God said, bring it out.  
He brought it out.  
He turned left for us.  
He didn't know what to do with his hand.  
And God said, put it back in there.  
He put it in there.  
Came back.  
Oh, wow.  
That means you got a miracle hand.  
Then God said, now, you go and perform miracles with that rod.  
With that rod, he ruled over Pharaoh.  
 The question is, what do you have in your hand?  
What can you do?  
That's what it's saying.  
What can you do?  
Okay, maybe you don't have much ability in one area.  
Learn another one.  
Learn another one.  
Train in another thing.  
Get trained in something.  
Have something you can do.  
 If you have something you can do, this word will always need you.  
How are you listening to me?  
If they phase out your kind of business, learn another one.  
And the Holy Spirit will give you the inspiration you need to know what to do.  
He'll give you.  
He'll give you.  
Can you trust him?  
 Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Can you trust him?  
Even now, he wants to give supernatural ability.  


  
There are certain things that some of you tonight are going to discover that you are able to do.  
The ability will be given to you supernaturally tonight.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Can I read something to you?  
Let me read this to you while I'm on this.  
In second Corinthians chapter number six.  
Second Corinthians chapter number six.  
I'm reading from verse three.  
 What I want to read to you is further down, so you can get the context.  
 All right, from verse three, giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed.  
But in all things are proven as errors as the ministers of God in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tomorrows, in labors, in watchings, in fastings, by pureness, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfainted.  
 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the amoratousness on the right hand and on the left, by honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report, as deceives and yet true.  
Are you following this?  
 He's talking about us ministers.  
He says, we approve ourselves as God's ministers in spite of all these things.  
Then in verse 9, as unknown yet well known, as dying and behold will live as just and not killed, as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor, yet making many rich  
 as having nothing in yet possessing all things.  
Did you notice that place there?  
He said to regard us as poor, he said, yet making many rich.  
It saves something there.  
Do you mean that we do have the power, it's power saying that he and the other apostles have the ability to make others rich?  
Oh yes, oh yes, that's exactly what he said.  
 There were some things supernatural.  
People go to native doctors to do something for them and give them good luck.  
And it does work.  
It works from the devil's way.  
Just that, you know, for Satan, nothing goes for nothing.  
You know what I'm talking about?  
In Christ, we do have that ability.  
Otherwise, ask Jesus, where did the fish come from?  
 because there was no fish.  
And yet Jesus had cast the net on this side, and we shall find.  
The guy said, Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing.  
That couldn't be any fish here, but because you said it, I will do it.  
They cast the net into the water, and now they couldn't pull it up.  
It was too much.  
 When Peter saw that, after they dragged the net out and saw the multitude of fishes he fell down on his face, he said, please depart from me.  
I'm a sinful man.  
Hallelujah.  
Ask Jesus where the fish came from.  
That same Christ.  
That brought fish.  
Where?  
They didn't have no fish.  
 It's the one that gives you supernatural ability today.  
Father, in the name of Jesus, thank you for your grace, thank you for your love, thank you for your kindness.  
In the name of Jesus, I pray for you now, that you're not another Holy Ghost who rests upon you.  
And you receive divine ability.  
 giftings of God at this moment in the name of Jesus, that ability will cost you to prosper.  
In your job, in your business, supernatural ability, in the name of Jesus, speaking of the tongues, be filled with the spirits,  
 Be filled with the spirits.  


  
Be filled with the spirits.
