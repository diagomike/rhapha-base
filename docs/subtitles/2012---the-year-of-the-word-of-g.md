title: 2012 - The Year of the Word of God
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 The Love War Convocation Arena in Lagos, Nigeria, the venue of the Epoch Making December 31st Night Service with Pastor Chris.  
It was indeed a time of accurate knowledge on God's direction for the year 2012.  
As you listen, you will receive that life-transforming word from God that will put you over and cause you to excel throughout the New Year.  
God bless you.  
What is she as something with you?  
 So you can begin to understand our direction for 2012.

Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
You know, in 2011, He gave us a message.  


  
 to be a burning and a shining light.  
And we did.  
We're moving into another year and something that the Spirit of God has for us so important.  
I want to begin reading to you  
 from Acts, the book of Acts, chapter 20.  
He says, and now brethren, I commend you to God and to the world of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you on any inheritance among all them which are sanctified.  
Wow.  
 He says, now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able, the word of His grace is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.  
This is, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able.  
 able to build you up.  
You know, in St.  
John's Gospel in chapter number six, were you turning there?  
St.  
John's Gospel, chapter six, if you would read in the 48 verse, Jesus said, I am that bread of life, remarkable.  
In verse 50,  
 He said, this is the bread, which comment down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die.  
He said, I am that bread of life, the bread that came down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die.  
You know when you eat food, like bread, he says, it goes into your body.  
It strengthens your body.  
 It builds your body.  
And the most important of all of that is that that food becomes part of your body.  
Because it gets into your body.  
It becomes one with your body.  
And Jesus said, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out of the mouths of God.  
 And you know, the Word of God, the description given to ours is extraordinary.  
If you would go to St.  
John's Gospel chapter 1 from verse 1, it's a scripture that's come on to many of you.  
 From verse 1 it says, in the beginning was the Word.  
And the Word was with God and the Word was God.  
The same was in the beginning with God.  
All things were made by Him.  
He gives a personal pronoun to the Word of God.  
It doesn't say, it, this is Him.  
 All things were made by Him, the Word of God.  
And without Him was not anything made that was made.  
In Him, still talking about the Word of God, He doesn't call the Word of God it, because the Word of God, Him,  
 He says, in him was life, and the life was the light of men, and the light shining in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not.  
In other words, the light of the Word of God shines into the darkness, and the darkness cannot withstand the Word of God.  
These are all things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made.  
Hallelujah.  
 Then he goes on to tell us in the 10th verse.  
He says, he was in the world, and the world was met by him, and the world knew him not.  
He came onto his own and his own received him not.  
 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that bleed on his name.  
Oh, glory to God.  
He says he was in the Word.  
The Word was made by him and the Word didn't know him.  
He came onto his own and his own didn't receive him.  
He says, but as many as received him, to them he gave the power.  
 to become the sounds of God.  
He gave them power to become, power to become.  
They couldn't become on their own.  
He had to give them power to become.  
He gave them the rights to become, the ability to become, the authority to become.  
He gave them power to become the sounds of God.  
Hallelujah.  
And then he goes on to tell us in  
 Verse 13, which were born, not of blood.  
Oh, I could preach for whole months on this.  
Not the will of the flesh, not the will of man, but of God.  
And the word, glory to God.  
The word became flesh.  
O King James translation, use the word was made flesh.  
The word became flesh, and dwelt among us.  
And we beheld his glory.  
 Oh, the Word has glory.  
Tell somebody the Word has glory.  
Look at it right there.  
And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.  
And we beheld His glory.  
The Word of God has glory.  
The Word of God has glory.  
Wow.  
 The glorious of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, reality.  
It says the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
We beheld His glory.  
Glory.  
We beheld His glory, the glory of the Word.  
 The glory is spindle.  
Glory is brightness.  
Glory is beauty.  
Glory is purity.  
Glory is holiness.  
Hallelujah.  
It means that the word is unblamable.  
It means the word is unapprovalable.  
 The Word of God is absolute reality.  
The Word of God is righteousness revealed.  
The Word of God is love personified.  
He says, we behave as glory.  


  
 Oh, that God's people would see with the eyes of their spirits and see the glory of my words here at the Lord.  
And they were walking my victory.  
That's what I said in other times.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  
Can we perceive this glory?  
Can we see this glory?  
If only you would look into your own heart where the word is.  
 and see the glory of the Word of God.  
No wonder he said, for which cause we faint not.  
Though our outward men perish, that means bruised, battered, wounded.  
This is the end what man is renewed day by day, for our light affliction which is but for a moment.  
 walking for us a far more eternal weight of glory.  
Why we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.  
Can you shout him in somebody?  
The word of God.  
 The word, the word, the word.  
He gave us the word and he commended us to the word.  
In other words, he delivered us into the hands of the word.  
He says, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able.  
It means the word is dependable.  
It is dependable.  
 He says, chair up the word is dependable.  
Chair up, it doesn't matter where you're being.  
Chair up the word of God is dependable.  
It doesn't matter what's happening to you.  
Chair up the word of God is dependable.  
He says, I commend you to God.  
Oh, oh, to be in this world and not know the word of God is tragedy.  
 How can a man live and not know the Word of God?  
I don't know what great a darkness that could be.  
Oh, not to know the Word.  
He says, they know not.  
 Neither will they understand.  
They're all called in darkness.  
But I have said he are gods and all of you are children of the Most High.  
But out of ignorance, he says they shall die like men and fall like one of the princes.  
This is the word which God sends to the children of Israel.  
Preaching peace by Jesus Christ, he is Lord of all.  
 It is that word I say, you know, which was published throughout all today, began in Galilee.  
After the baptism which John preached, that word, which was sent to the children of Israel, that word, that word, that word, hallelujah.  
That's the word he says that became flesh and dwelt among us.  


  
 That word, that was the voice in the garden.  
That spoke to Adam.  
He says, the voice of God came walking in the garden.  
The voice of God came walking.  


  
 Thank God for the Holy Spirit that brings us revelation of the Word.  
You know, without the Holy Spirit, you cannot understand the Word of God.  
But the Holy Spirit is promised to every man who will believe.  
It says, for the promise is on to you and to your children and to as many as are far off.  
Those are far off.  
Not just those initial.  
It says, as many as the Lord our God shall call.  
 The promise is on to you.  
The promise of the Holy Spirit is on to you.  
All that we accept and receive Him.  
You come in and live in you and unveil the Word of God to you.  
Unveil the Word of God to you.  
And when the Word is unveiled to you,  
 And the word, oh, Kroski, is a ashura mongradis, for s, legarose gosho paradle kos de paradigis, goshos zet.  
Longo raman digas agestan digar Andesos det, korasarish, fellow mongos, kirudadastes, paranongos liro ongio parad, tillo gosh queisho paranongos paridamo cepla anj eso paradig.  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  
 Glory to His name forever.  
Glory to His name forever.  
You see, it's the heart of man.  
It's my place, my dwelling place that I created for myself.  
I made you to live in you, to reveal myself to you that you may know me.  
And by your knowledge of my reality and personality, I'll live and dwell in you.  
 And you will become one with my spirits.  
And by becoming one with my spirits, you will enjoy all of the glory that I have for my glory is for you, said the Lord.  
I brought you into my kingdom that you may walk and stop with me, said the Lord.  
And learn of me that we may walk the path of righteousness, so said the Spirit of God unto you.  
Hallelujah.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to His name forever.  
 Amen.  
Amen.  
You know what John Ian, John Ian, and getting closer to the coming of the Lord.  
And as we get closer and closer to the coming of the Lord, so much is being revealed in this day and in this hour.  
So much is being brought to the knowledge of the church because the Bible says he gave them.  
 Apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, for the perfection of the saints of the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, to all common the knowledge of the faith, the unity of the faith, the knowledge of the Son of God, and become what a perfect man.  
And that is the perfection in Christ Jesus that he brings us into.  
And that perfection means that we're coming to that oneness with the Lord.  
 where we no longer walk in the flesh.  
That means in the senses.  
We're no longer conditioned and retarded by the things of this world.  
But walk in the glory of God, walk in the light of his victory, walk in the understanding of spiritual realities where the world is only our footstool as it is unto him.  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
 Glory to His name forever.  
Oh, this is wonderful.  
Oh, let me share some truths of the word here.  
This is glory.  
You know the Psalm is in Psalm 119 and verse 105.  
He said, the word is a lamp unto my feet.  


  
 a light to my path.  
So the Word of God gives light.  
The Word of God gives direction.  
If you have the Word of God in you, you will never lose your way in life.  
Those who have the Word of God in them never walk in confusion.  
You have the Word of God in you.  
You'll never lose your way.  
Hallelujah.  
 Now you're thinking.  
Maybe I should read one more to you.  


  
 Cajole, Mangirala, Arissette, Quizo, Parnago, Sejes, Plaronto, Guido, Patelera, Stu, Tapahas.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Oh, oh, oh, oh.  


  
 Let me explain this to you first before telling you what the Spirit of God is saying to you.  
Can you turn to 7 Corinthians in chapter number 3?  
In verse 18, can you read verse 18?  
Want to go.  


  
 But we all, we're open face, beholding us in the glass, that means as in the mirror, the glory of the Lord.  
Oh, isn't that wonderful?  
I have met Tamaphost.  
We have changed.  
He says, we all, we're open face.  
That means our faces are uncovered, looking as in the mirror.  
 the glory of the Lord.  
We are behold in the glory of the Lord.  
He says, as we behold the glory of the Lord in this mirror of God, which is the Word of God, he says, we are changed.  
As we look at the glory of God in the mirror, we are changed into the glory that we see in the mirror.  
 The more we look, the more we are changed.  
The more we look, the more we are changed.  
The more we look by meditation.  
We look with the eyes of our spirit.  
And as we look, we are changed.  
As we look, we are changed.  
And that's what I was talking about in other talks.  
Have you not read it?  
Have you not understood it?  
That the more you meditate in the Word of God, you are transformed?  
 Have you not heard it?  
That's what I was saying in other talks, that haven't you understood it?  
The more you see the glory of God in the Word of God, the more you are transformed into that image, into that glory,  
 Don't you understand that it behooves you therefore to meditate on the Word and to look into the mirror of God and see the glory of God that you might always be that glory that you see.  
That's what I was telling you in other times.  
Hallelujah.  
Praise God.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
You know.  


  
 I'm trying to make sure I'm able to share this thing with you.  
You're still there?  
 I'm just going to share briefly what I'm going to do in the next few weeks.  
I'm going to still be sharing with you along these lines so you can catch so much more.  
We'll share a little tonight, but I'll follow it up so you can catch a lot more in the next few weeks.  
Would that be fine?  
You know how I'm going to do it?  
I'll send you video posts to your phone.  
 So that on your own, you play, you put on, that's your telephone and get the link and I'll be sharing this word with you, briefly, you know, just little questions so that it doesn't disturb all the other things you want to do during the day.  
You get it?  
Would that be fine?  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
 And it's so important because 2012 is the year of the Word of God.  
Can I tell you more?  
Can I tell you more?  
It is, you see, 2012  
 This is a special here where you experience the dominion of the Word of God, the lordship of the Word of God in your life like never before.  
You're born literally in 2012, find that you are relating with the Word of God as a person.  
And the Word of God will be manifested onto you and in you and through you.  
 Shout him in somebody.  
You know what's happening?  
If you recall, several years ago, we had a year of the Spirit.  
There's something that's going on in the realm of the Spirit.  
The Word of God is taking center stage.  
 You're going to find yourself operating and manifest in the Word of God like never before.  
You're going to have the Word of God in your heart and in your mouths.  
When you go to the office, when you're at home, when you're in school, the Word of God is going to come out of you.  


  
 And it's something that you're going to experience this year, 2002.  
There's something you're going to experience.  
You're going to find that as you make proclamations of the word, things will begin to happen like you never expected.  


  
You know, why is this going to happen differently?  
I want to tell you.  
 You know, there's a time of building.  
There's a time.  
You see, you have come to a position.  
Now, you have been winged, say it to the Lord.  
You've been removed from the breast, as it were.  
Do you understand it?  
Which means you cannot eat on your own.  
The Word of God is in you now.  
Maradigas, praise Ka'sharabanda.  
 And that means the Church of Jesus Christ is gradually coming to a place of maturity, because the coming of the Lord is nearer than before.  
The church is coming gradually to a place of maturity.  
You're going to experience the manifestation of the Word of God.  
My goodness, you're going to see the Word work.  
Hallelujah.  
Marabande will save us.  
Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
 the dominion of the words, the lordship of the words.  
Oh, glory to His name forever.  
You put the word in you by meditation as you study digest the words.  
You know what?  
The more of that word that comes into you, the more you are united with the words.  
The more your life becomes an expression of the word of God.  
That's what you want to see.  
The Bible calls us living epistles.  
 And that's what we are.  
And that's what we're going to see.  
Oh, glory to God.  
And others around you are going to begin to say, hey, who are you?  
Who are you?  
Where are you from?  


  
Because the Word of God is in us.  
And we become invincible.  
 victorious at every count.  
Hallelujah.  
Wow.  
Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.  
Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.  
 I'm lifted by the Spirit.  
I'm moved by the Holy Ghost.  
The Word of God has revealed a Spirit to me.  
And the Spirit of God has unveiled the Word to me.  
And because I have the Spirit, I have the Word in me.  
I'm more than a conqueror.  
 Open your mouth and speak in tongues.  
Speak in other tongues.  
Speak in other tongues.  


  
 Coramantecabradilis, shepra babayalaburamasataya, qradarabarabarabarabaramandalegebassayi.  


  
 Let me explain something to you.  
The Word of God has visible and invisible glory.  


  
 I hear in this, the Word has visible and invisible glory.  
This power in the Word is something that, see, you need to take this seriously because the Word of God on your lips is God talking.  
Are you hearing me?  
 The Word of God on your lips, the Word of God on the lips of faith is God-talking.  
You are going to give vent to the Word of God.  
You are going to give expression to the Word of God.  
And remember, all things were made by Him.  
And without Him was not anything made, that was made.  
And when the Word made all things,  
 is voicing himself through you.  


  
How can you be defeated?  
You become indestructible.  
You become impregnable.  
Can you show him and somebody?  


  
 by the power of the Holy Spirit's babersays in the city of Ephesus.  


  
So I'm going to make the Word of God grow in me.  
Make the Word of God grow in you.  


  
 If the Word of God grows in you, as it says in Acts 19 verse 20, so mightily agree you, the Word of God, and prevails.  
You will prevail over every situation.  
Through the Word.  
Through the Word.  
It doesn't matter what circumstances you find yourself.  
No matter the situation.  
 You know what you do?  
Just meditate on the words.  
Keep talking the words.  
Keep talking the words.  
As you talk the word, keep rejoicing.  
Rejoice in the words.  
Keep talking the words.  
Hallelujah!  


  
Say the word I've got on my lips.  
The word I've got on my lips is God talking.  
 The Word of God on my lips.  
You got it.  
You got it.  
You got it.  
You got it.  
You got it.

You got it.  
 Put the word in your mouth, turn to that situation and speak fuck the word."  
He said, in the last day he said, God, I will pour out my spirit upon our flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.  


  
 Hey!  
Yeah, y'all!  
Hey!  
Hey, yeah, yeah!  
Can I tell you one more thing?  
Is there something you want to cut out of your life?  
 He's there something you want to cut out of your body.  
He's there something you want to cut out of your business.  
The Word of God is the sword of the spirits.  


  
You're going to use the word.

Tell somebody that's 2012 is my year with the Word of God!

 in my work, in my finances, in my family, in my city, in my country, the Word of God.
