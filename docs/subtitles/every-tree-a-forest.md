title: Every Tree A Forest
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 The Lord gave the word.  
Great was the company of those that published it, Psalm 6811.  
They are men and women on a mission on a divine mandate by our Lord Jesus Christ, hand in hand, working with God, building lives and changing nations.  
You know, what I've got to share with you is what the Spirit of God said to me.  
 And that's his message to you.  
You want to hear what it is?  
He said, tell them every tree of forest.  


  
That's what he said.  
Every tree of forest.  
 And that is something that the Holy Spirit will inspire you from tonight.  
Tell somebody you haven't seen anything yet.  
There's a greater glory.  
So there's much more in God.  
 No, you ain't seen nothing yet, I tell you.  
See, you may be thinking, look what God has done in your life.  
Look where He's brought you.  
Look what has happened, but there's so much more in God.  
There's so much more that others haven't seen yet, that God can birth through you.  
Something new.  
 in God's looking for somebody who will listen.  
If you will listen and hear him talk to you and receive his word into your spirit, there's no telling what could become of your life in the glory that follows.  
Hallelujah.  
And so with that, I want us to open the scripture and begin to see what the spirit of God is telling us  
 at this time.  
Isaiah chapter 61.  
Isaiah chapter number 61.  


  
And I'm going to be reading from verse one.  


  
 The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord had anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek.  
He had sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, say God's stuck in the me.  


  
 to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to come for all that mourn, say God's stuck in the me.  
To appoint unto them that mourning Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, say God's stuck in the me.  
 the gamut of praise for the spirit of heaven, yes, that they might be called trees of righteousness.  
The planning of the Lord that he might be glorified.  
Say, God's stuck in the me.  
Did you notice that?  
When Jesus went into the synagogue in the Luke's gospel, the fourth chapter, the Bible terraces, that on that day,  
 He was called up to read the scriptures and he opened to this chapter and read to the people.  
And he said to them, he said, today, this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.  


  
So the Lord has produced in us trees of righteousness.  
 See, I'm a tree of righteousness.  
He calls us the planning of the Lord.  
We are the planning of the Lord.  
He planted us.  
Hallelujah.  
See, I'm a tree of righteousness.  
I'm a tree of righteousness.  
And you know what?  
He sent us in His garden.  


  
 Oh, glory to God forevermore.  
You're still in this place.  
Tell somebody I'm still here.  
And I'm listening.  
Say, I'm here.  
I'm listening.  
Glory to God.  
I just wanted to read something else to you here.  
It should be a great blessing to you.  
 You know, when you study in a new Testament, several beautiful things that you find.  
Look at 2 Corinthians in chapter number 6.  


  
Verse 1.  


  
 Have you seen it?  
He says, we then, as workers, together with Him, with God, the situation so that you receive not the grace of God in vain.  
In other words, make sure the grace of God works through you.  
Don't receive it in vain.  
Put it to work.  
Say, I put it to work.  
But he says that we are workers together with God.  
Amen?  
Now, turn the first Corinthians in chapter number three.  
 And you would like this one.  
Read verse nine.  
For we are laborers together with God.  
Yea God's husbandry.  
Yea God's building.  
In other words, your God's feared.  
Your God's feared.  
 You know, He's garden, that's what He's saying.  


  
And in the field, there are trees and there are grasses.  


  
And you know, when you read in the book of Zechariah,  
 In that 10th chapter, 1st verses, ask of the Lord rain.  
In the time of the latter rain, the Lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field.  


  
But we are trees.  
Amen.  
He pour out the rain on every one grass in the field.  
But we are trees.  
 Glory to God.  
He says, you are God's farm.  
You are God's field.  
You are God's garden.  
So here we'll work as God's fellow laborers.  
God's fellow workers.  


  
Say, I'm a worker together with God.  
And I'm a tree of righteousness.  
 producing other trees of righteousness.  
You see, you've gotten a new responsibility.  
Did you know that?  
And that's what it's talking about in Isaiah chapter 61 because you see Jesus Christ quoted that chapter and He said,  
 that was fulfilled in his day.  
Now, Jesus is gone to heaven, and we are walking in his shoes, in his steps, and we are the ones that the Spirit of God is upon today.  
And like Jesus spoke back then, we say, the Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, for the Lord hath anointed me.  
So that's where we are today.  
We're right in Isaiah chapter 61.  
 We're there today.  
Go back there.  
Look at it again.  
We're riding Isaiah 61, and we say,  
 Just the same things, the spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord had anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek.  
He had sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that have bound.  
That's my message to the world.  
That's your message to the world.  
He sent us.  
 with the Holy Spirit, to go and preach His message and bring them out of bondage and out of darkness, bind up the brokenhearted.  
He can tell us to break their hearts more.  
And you say that?  
No, to bind up the brokenhearted.  
We don't break hearts.  
We bind them up.  
We heal them.  
Amen.  
So that's my ministry to heal.  
 Say, I'm a healer, not a breaker.  
Oh boy, how do you like that?  
That's wonderful.  
I'm a healer, not a breaker.  
Glory to God.  
To proclaim the acceptable, you're the Lord.  
That's the Sabbath.  
To announce the Sabbath.  
And to see everybody, hello everybody, it's the day of rest.  
 Rest has come.  
It's the acceptable here of the Lord.  
This is Sabbath.  
It has arrived.  
No more struggling, glory to God.  
Glory.  
Our debts are consumed.  
Ma, ma, ma.  
That's what he said.  
That's the acceptable here of the Lord.  
Free.  
 So go and tell everybody you're free, you're free, you're free.  
Who you're free, glory to God.  
Then he goes in, look at that verse, verse three, to a point.  
Boy, I'm anointed to a point, to a point unto them that morning Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes.  
They've been mourning when I show up, it's joy time.  
 Glory to God.  
So I carry an air of joy.  
When I come in that home, when I come to that one who's been mourning, it doesn't matter what the condition has been, I come with an air of joy.  
I bring in joy on speakable and full of glory.  
 to our point unto them, that morning Zion, to give unto them, beautiful ashes, the oil of joy, the oil of joy for mourning, the gamut of praise.  
He says, change their clothes, let them put on something to dance, glory to God, the gamut of praise for the Spirit of Heavenness.  
You know, there are a lot of people who've got the Spirit of Heavenness.  
They're so depressed.  
 They're so pained.  
They're thinking about something that's gone wrong in their lives.  
Or maybe something somebody else did against them and they just can't forget it.  
They can't get out of it.  
And all they think about is what they did then.  
And God says to me, I point on to them, the gamut of praise for the spirit of happiness.  
Hallelujah.  
 that they might be called, just like us, trees of righteousness.  
Trees of righteousness.  
Oh, I'm a tree of righteousness.  
I bear fruits of righteousness.  
 Because I'm a tree of righteousness.  
You know, when you start in the book of Philippians, talks about our fruits of righteousness.  
We produce fruits of righteousness.  
I produce fruits of righteousness.  
Jesus said, I am the vine here, the branches.  


  
We bear fruits.  
 So isn't that wonderful?  
As a tree of righteousness, he even says that he is the life that flows through me.  
He's the one that carries me.  
He's the stem.  
He's the stem of my life.  
No wonder I'm unshakable.  
It doesn't matter how strong the wind blows.  
This tree is going to be standing.  
Hallelujah.  
 This tree is going to be standing.  
If you're watching the other day when they have this tornado in America, in Oklahoma, then trees, tall trees are brought down.  
As though somebody just pulled him out of the ground and laid him on the ground.  
Look at trees just on the ground lying flat because of the force of that tornado and pulled him out of the ground.  
But this one cannot be pulled off.  
I'm a tree of righteousness.  
 Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
I like it.  
Trees of righteousness.  
The planting of the Lord.  
I'm planted by the Lord.  
So my life is unshakeable.  
I cannot be discouraged.  
I cannot become despondent.  
 I cannot be confused.  
No matter how strongly the wings blow, I am unmovable because I am the planning of the Lord.  
I am planted by the Lord.  
I walk constantly and continuously in victory.  
I am victorious in all circumstances.  
Hallelujah.  
 Hallelujah.  
And I'll bring God glory.  
Look at it's right there.  
He says the planning of the Lord that He might be glorified.  
You see, I'm bringing God glory.  
In this situation, I'll bring God glory.  
Hallelujah.  
My, my, my.  


  
You know,  
 I got something inside.  
Let's posse you a little bit and go over to Isaiah the 32nd chapter.  
Isaiah chapter number 32.  
And I'm looking at verse 15.  


  
 Woo, glory to God.  
From that 15 verse, he says, until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful feel, and the fruitful feel be counted for a forest.  


  
So,  
 When I, as a tree of righteousness, produce other trees of righteousness and we become trees of righteousness, we have a fruitful field.  
In Mother Holy Ghost, as we all continue to multiply, we become a forest.  
 Every tree of forest.  
Every tree.  
Every tree.  
Say, I'm a tree of righteousness.  
To become a forest.  
Oh boy.  
This is the dream.  
This is the dream.  
And there's no stopping us.  
This is the dream.  
 Every tree of forest.  
Somebody heard it over there.  
He said, yes, Lord.  
Hallelujah.  
God is talking to you.  
He's talking to you.  
Every tree of forest.  
 Liba Cara Badongo Sante Cara Bahaia.  
A forest, a forest, a forest.  
That's what I see.  
Every tree, a forest, a forest, by the Para de Holy Ghost.  
For the spirit has been poured upon us from on high.  


  
 He's been poured upon us from on high.  
It has already happened.  
Every tree of forest.  
So you're no longer going to have these two and three friends.  
You're going to say to your two and three friends, let's go win source.  
Let's go bring in more trees of righteousness.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
Haha.  
Hallelujah.  
Wow.  
 So it's not stopping here.  
Mm-mm.  
Three of us are going to become 30.  
And then 30 of us become 300.  
And 300 of us, 3,000.  
And we go for 30,000.  
This tree is becoming a forest.  
Showering man somebody.  
Haha.  
Hallelujah.  
 Are you seeing the forest?  
Are you seeing the forest?  
Are you seeing the forest?  
That's what I see.  
Every tree of forest, dear Lord, dear Lord, every tree, leave a candle above and above a higher.  
Every tree of forest, by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
 Indeed, every tree of forest, trees of righteousness, we are planting of the Lord.  
Still ahead, Pastor Chris shares that God's dream for you is better than all the dreams you could ever have.  
No limits to what we could be.  
The potential is there in you to become a forest.  


  
He says the planting of the Lord that he might be glorified.  
 Listen, reject those earthly, personal, unnecessary dreams of yours to be something.  
Be what he wants.  
Are you hearing me?  
Yeah.  
Be what he wants.  


  
 Take his dream and follow it.  
Don't struggle.  
Don't struggle.  
Be comfortable in who you are.  
The uniqueness of your personality.  
Because the anointing is on you.  
 And you know when you stand before you say, Father, what will you do with someone like me?  
Do it.  


  
He knows what to do with someone like you.  


  
You hear me?  
Follow the vision that he gives.  
Don't create yours.  
 It's not necessary.  
His dream for you is better than all the dreams you could ever have.  
Hallelujah.  
God is raising you.  
And you know, He's lifted you to who you are right now.  
He's lifted you.  
But don't stop here.  
 It's not over yet.  
Don't make a detour now.  
There's so much more.  
So much more.  
So much more.  
We're not Johnny.  
There's so much more.  


  
 And that's why the house of God is so important.  
You know, as God strengthens you and prospers you and uses you, one thing that you must not lose sight of is the house of God where he began to teach you.  
Never let that out of your eyes.  
Never.  


  
 We say return to first principles.  
That's what we call it.  


  
The house of God must find you.  


  
Never become promoted away from the house of God.  
 Some people get promoted away from the house of God.  
As God blesses them, maybe in their business or in their family, they become so promoted in what they do that they don't have time for the house of God anymore.  
They've been promoted away from God.  


  
After a few years,  
 They stack declining without even knowing it.  
You know how God does it?  
I tell you how he does it.  
He doesn't take away from them anything that he gave them.  
No?  
He just gives other people more.  
So what you have, you have.  
But God brings new things and new doors for others and they just keep going and you stay where you are.  
 Before you realize what's happening to you, relative to others, you are now down while they're up.  
You know, there's something God said to me a few years ago.  
And I thought that that was one of the biggest things that he ever taught me.  
But it sounds so simple, you know?  
And at the time, I was teaching on the aeons, you know, of God.  
 and how that we cooled through faith, recreate, remake, frame our eons.  
But you know, I anglicized that word.  
It's a Greek word, but I anglicized it and put an S there.  
Okay?  
 So it sounds like, oh, what is that?  
Well, a lot of words in English were anglicized from Latin or French or, you know, so on.  
So that's not new.  
So when I was on that, the Lord said to me, I create a yarn.  
And I thought, what's that?  
What's it saying?  
 And he made it very plain to me.  
He said, a man may have a destiny that I gave.  
He said, but I'm not limited by the destiny that I've determined for a man.  
He said, even though I've created that destiny for that man,  
 He said, I reserve the right and the ability to create another destiny for that same man.  
This is amazing.  
And I thought, Lord, this is so big.  
This is extraordinary.  
And he said, I am God.  
 Hallelujah.  
You understand what that means?  
It may take you a while to, you know, to get a hold of that in the significance.  
But it's so big, meaning there's no limit to what we could be.  
 Our God and Heavenly Father has the capacity, the ability, the authority, the right to change our destiny, create a new destiny and say, this is your new future.  
I made this future for you.  
 You were going to be like this and it was going to be wonderful.  
You were going to be like this, it was going to be great.  
What I have chosen to even change that and give you another destiny.  
And all this  


  
 is based on His grace.  


  
That's why I say to you, remember the house of God.  
Remember the house of God.  
Being in the right place is important.  
Being in the right place is important.  
 Not every house of God.  
The house of God.  
God deals with families.  
Spiritual families are important to God.  
This is a family.  
It deals with nations.  
The families become nations.  
It deals with nations.  
 by raising families to become nations.  
That's His purpose.  
And so these nations are different.  
They have different assignments that God gives to them.  
And as a nation, we are a spiritual nation.  
The church is a nation of nations.  
 Okay?  
The church is a nation of nations.  
We are a nation.  
And even in the context of our nation, we've got nations in our nation.  
And as a nation, God's God responsibilities for us, assignments for us.  


  
 And it's important that we remain in that connection to produce the results that God has determined for us to.  
We are trees of righteousness in every tree of forest.  
 So the potential is there in you to become a forest.  
And you will be by the power of the Holy Spirit.  
All you're going to do is say what God told you to say and do what God told you to do.  
Amen.  
Hallelujah.  
 All right, now, as you get another part, Isaiah chapter number 55.  
I'm gonna be reading from verse number 10.  


  
For as the rain coming down under snow from heaven,  
 and return it not Caesar, but what are the earth, and make it bring forth in blood that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater.  
So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth."  
 It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing which I send it.  
That's why I just told you that word has come into your spirit every tree of forest.  
Then you shall be so.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Yeah.  


  
I'm a forest in the making.  
I'm a forest in the making.  
Come on.  
I'm not tree for nothing.  
I'm a forest in the making.  


  
 You go back to your cell members and you say, look, this is a forest in the making.  
This cell will become a forest.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory.  
 I'm thinking now.  
You know the implication of this?  
I'm thinking now.  
How many, how many cells that are 12 members right now, 15 members right now, seven members right?  
How many of these cells are going to become churches?  


  
That's where it's going!  
Shout-Amen somebody!  


  
 There's no telling where this thing is going.  
Are you hearing me?  
What program for success?  
Program for greatness.  
 It's in me, it's in me.  
I'm the seed of Abraham.  
This thing is in me.  
Are you hearing me?  
I'm programmed for greatness.  
God said to Abraham, I will make you great.  
He put that thing in his spirit and it's in my spirit for I'm the seed of Abraham.  
Shout out to Hallelujah.  
 That programming is in me.  
Do you understand what I'm talking about?  
I'm the seed of Abraham.  
Passion for greatness.  


  
You know, when we show up, you're not looking at an ordinary person.  
I'm the seed of Abraham.  
Greatness is in me.  
 You get it?  
You know what I'm talking about.  
This thing is in us.  
Go read our God.  
It's in us.  
In our spirits.  
The world can understand us.  
They think we are trying to be bold.  
No, we are not trying to be bold.  


  
 You know, sometimes they think we are trying to be something.  
We are not trying to be something.  
We are bold.  
We are something.  
Do you understand this?  
We are the seed of Abraham.  
Shaddhallelujah!  
Oh, glory to God.  
I know who I am.  
I know who I am.  


  
 You know, it doesn't matter where I am.  
I don't forget who I am.  
It doesn't matter where I find myself.  
I don't forget who I am.  
I know who I am.  
I'm a seed of Abraham.  
Whether you find yourself in the street, in the shopping mall, in the office, it doesn't matter where.  
You are the seed of Abraham.  


  
 Let's say, you know, he's just a tax and driver.  
I'm a tax and driver with a difference.  
I know who I am.  
So I know that guy.  
He's an engineer.  
I'm an engineer with a difference.  
I'm a lawyer with a difference.  
Oh, with a job.  
Mama.  
 Let's read some more.  
There's some more in there.  
Look at verse 12, for ye shall go out with joy.  
Brother, this is with joy.  
You shall go out with joy.  


  
You know, you're working out of your house with a smile.  
 Because the day is yours.  
You know it.  
The day is yours.  


  
You're going to the office as you step out of your house with joy.  


  
For each of you go out with joy and be led thoughts with prosperity.  
 That's what that piece is.  
It's a piece of prosperity.  
Left thought with prosperity.  
You know, prosperity is not something around you.  
It's something inside you.  
Then it goes the mountains.  
You know what mountains and hills are?  
The mean nations and cities.  
 In prophetic language, mountains and hearers refer to the nations and cities in the Bible.  
And look what is telling you.  
The nations and cities shall break forth before you into singing when you show up.  
And the trees of the field.  
Now Jesus said the field is the word.  
 Did you get it?  
The trees of the field.  
These are other trees.  
We are trees of righteousness.  
The trees of the world.  
The trees of the field shall clap their heads as you pass by.  
Oh glory to God.  


  
 They shall clap their hands as you pass by.  
The mountains, the nations, and the city shall break forth before you in your singing.  
May chairs you pass by, because the Lord has glorified you.  


  
Oh, my, my, my speaking tongues, speaking tongues, speaking tongues, speaking tongues.  
God is talking to you.  
 God is talking to you.  
He's talking to you.  


  
 abilities have been distributed.  
More grace has been poured out of a truth, as the Bible says, and of His fullness have all we received, and grace for grace, John 1 16.  


  
 you
