title: How To Take Possession Of What Belongs To You (Vol. 2 Part 2)
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
So we dealt with several things on Wednesday.  
We mentioned a few things.  
And one of the last things we talked about was the fact that when God gave the Chinavicio the promised land, He gave it to them with giants in it.  
He didn't give them a land that was free of trouble.  
 He gave them a land flowing with milk and honey, all right, full of prosperity, but with giants inside.  
And it was up to them to trust his word and overcome and drive out the giants.  
And we talked about Caleb,  
 who was full of faith, and like the Bible says, who had a different spirit.  
And at the age of 85, he said to Joshua, remember that God made a promise through Moses to give me Hebrew, and Hebrew was full of giants.  
 And he said, if the Lord be with me, I will drive out the giants.  
And he was given a Hebrew.  
And the Bible tells us that 15th chapter, Book of Joshua, that he drove out the giants.  
Where is God?  
He drove out the giants.  
He said, if the Lord be with me, and that was all he needed, but God would be with him.  
 He said, I will be able to drive out the giants.  
He didn't even ask for help.  
He said, I will be able to drive out the giants.  
Then he said, now therefore give me this mountain, a mountain full of giants.  
Praise God.  
Now that's the mentality that we ought to have.  
 That's the way we are.  
We're born in that family.  
A family of fates.  
That's where we belong.  
Did you know if a child grew up among apes, he would believe he's an ape?  
If he grew up among monkeys,  
 Even without a tail, he'll believe he's a monkey.  
If you grow up among negative thinkers, negative talkers, he'll be that way.  
Negative is him, he's a quiet.  
And we acquire it from our environment.  
 from those with whom we deal on daily basis.  
So it matters where your spiritual environment is.  
You know, we talked about Wednesday night, how that Moses did send out twelve spies, and ten of them said, we cannot take the place, we cannot take the land.  
It's full of giants, we can't.  
 He said, the giants are so big and we were before them as grasshoppers.  
And even when we looked at ourselves, we were as grasshoppers before them.  
So he said, so let's get out of here.  
We can't take it.  
But only two of them stood out and said, look, we can't.  
The giants will be bred for us.  
They said, let's go up at once.  
 Oh, I like the communication.  
Let's go up at once.  
Let's go now.  
In most families, children have brought up with the mentality of failure.  
They're told all the time they can't.  
They're told all the time how bad they are, how foolish they are, how stupid they are.  
 Because you know, it's easier to learn the curses than the blessings.  
And I was a little boy.  
I traveled around with my dad to several cities, because he was transferred almost every year.  
For my primary school, I attended nine primary schools.  
Nine.  
Before I finished primary six, nine primary schools.  
 moving around with him all the time.  
And in many of those places who went to, I learned they abuses first in school.  
They abusive words in their language.  
They're the words I learned first, because they were the things I heard first in school.  
It's just the way people are.  
They learn the negative life first.  
 So we respond to fear first, before we ever hear anything about fate, because most of us didn't grow up in an environment of fate.  
So even sometimes some of the things I share are even hard for many pastors, ministers, hard, because they grew up in an environment of unbelief.  
 and fear and doubt and poverty and negativism such that even those who grew up in well-to-do families were so negative and fearful in their lives that eventually lost everything they had.  


  
Well, well, well.  
Glory to God.  
Are you still here?  
 Thank you, Lord Jesus, glory, hallelujah.  
In Hebrews, Book of Hebrews, the 11th chapter and the first verse.  
He says, now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  
 Say it with me.  
Faith is what?  


  
Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.  
Faith is given substance to things hoped for.  
It is the evidence of the unseen.  
 Now, the amplified version gives it this way.  
Well, what we just quoted together was mostly from the King James Version.  
I know most of you have the King James Version.  
All right.  
From the amplified it says, now faith is the assurance, the confirmation, the title deed of the things we hope for being the proof of things we do not see and the conviction of their reality.  
 faith perceiving as real fact, what is not revealed to the senses.  
A conviction of their reality.  
Hallelujah.  
That's remarkable.  
Remarkable.  
Another version.  
 Now fate is a well-grounded assurance of that for which we hope and a conviction of the reality of things we do not see.  
It is the confident assurance that what we hope for is there the confident assurance  
 But what we hope for is there and the conviction that what we do not see is real.  
You know, it's easy for people to believe in the past and believe in the future and have problems with today.  
All right?  
Jesus died for me.  
Praise the Lord.  
They believe that.  
I mean, there are people who are ready to die for that.  
 No, stick their lives on that.  
I believe.  
I know.  
I'm confident Jesus died for me.  
When?  
Almost 2,000 years ago.  
Yes, he does.  
Yes, he does.  
He does believe that.  
He's confident of that.  
He's assured of that knowledge.  
And then they go to the next one.  
He's coming again.  
I know he's coming again.  
That's the future.  
 They'll stick their lives on that.  
Jesus will surely come back.  
All right.  
Between the past and the future is the present.  
So what is he doing now?  
What about today?  
What does Jesus mean to me today?  
Glory to God.  
 See, our communication locates us.  
Praise the Lord.  
Our communication locates us.  
You know what was in the past and in the future, and we leave out today.  
Now, here's another thought.  
That may not be so much problem for many of you here, really.  
But here's another thought.  


  
 How simply we can be affected by semantics.  
A lot of times you say the glory of God is upon us.  
The glory of the Lord is upon me.  
The glory of the Lord is upon you.  
And so we are carried away by that thought  
 where we try to imagine that the glory of God surrounds us.  
And with the hope that there's some light that somebody sees or something sees, maybe Spirit sees or whatever it is.  
So we are surrounded by this glory upon us.  
Okay?  
And because we do not see that glory, we attempted to think  
 might not be real after all.  
Are you still there?  
Okay, the glory of God is upon me.  
What does that mean?  
These are spiritual terminologies.  
When you say the glory of God is upon you, what do you mean?  
What are you saying?  
We might all mean different things when we say that.  
And what we mean is actually all we get.  
 That's all you get.  
You can't get more than what you mean.  
You can't get more than what you know.  
So when you say, the glory of God is upon me.  
What do you mean?  
The glory of God is upon you.  
It is upon.  
Do you mean on your head?  
Don't look at me like that now.  
 When you say, how many of you ever said the glory of God was upon you?  
We even have a song with a sing like that.  
So the glory of God you say is upon you.  
What do you mean that the glory of God is upon you?  
Where is it?  
And we even do like this.  
So he's upon my head.  
He's the glory of God on your head?  
Talk to me.  


  
 The glory of God is only upon you as to say he's bestowed his grace upon your life.  
But if you're talking about the excellencies  
 the perfections, the virtues of God.  
They are not on your head.  
They are in your spirit.  
So the glory of God is actually in your spirit.  
 The glory of God is in your spirit.  


  
The glory of God refers to his beauties, his excellencies, his perfections, his virtues.  
These are in your spirit.  
 Can you believe this?  
Can you accept this?  
If you can accept this, you'll be amazed how it'll work for you.  
It's working for many already.  
Say this, I don't believe in failure.  
Somebody here, you believe in failure?  
If you believe in failure, you're in the wrong place because we will make you succeed and that may be against what you believe.  
 Are you hearing me?  
If you don't want to be a success in life, you better not come here.  
Don't stay here for too long because we will make you succeed and that may be trouble for you.  
Sure.  
Yeah.  
You can't listen to this for long enough without it transforming and transfiguring your life.  
It's not possible.  
No, no, no.  
It's not possible.  
 No, it's not possible.  
It's not possible.  
It'll rub off on you.  
Hallelujah.  
Sure.  
You'd be a success even if you shot your eyes.  


  
Sure, just keep listening.  
Sooner or later it'll change your talk.  
 and something about the life of faith.  
Did you notice that definition of faith?  
The confident assurance that what we hope for is there.  
Did you hear that?  
It says, giving substance to what we hope for.  
So, faith is calling real what you haven't seen as of yet.  
You give it substance, you act as though it is there.  
And that's why others think you're stupid.  
 Because you're acting as though something that they can't see is there.  
But that's what faith is all about.  
That's what faith is.  
Faith is not believing.  
Faith and believing are two different things.  
The Bible says demons believe and they so believe that they tremble.  
Are you hearing me?  
So you can believe.  
 It's like, look at this.  
Faith, you gotta give substance to your faith.  
In other words, you've got to voice your faith, that's where it begins, and you gotta act your faith.  
You see, your voice, your faith, you act your faith.  
Because if you can't voice your faith, you cannot act your faith.  
Your life will go in the way of your mouth.  
 All right, turn to the book of Romans chapter number 10 for a moment.  
You there?  
Romans chapter 10.  
Have you seen it?  
Glory to God.  
You see, faith is a law.  
Faith is a law.  
The Bible says that the law of Moses was given  
 as the school master.  
And that's all King James translation.  
It actually means school guide.  
It doesn't mean the school teacher.  
It means a school guide, meaning one who took the children to school, not one who actually taught the children.  
Okay?  
It was a school guide.  
So the law was our school master to bring us to Christ.  
 All right, talking about those who are under the law.  
Then it says, now that faith has come, we are no longer under a school master.  
Now that faith has come.  
Now the kind of faith that is given to us, communicated to us in a New Testament is different from the kind of faith that was back in the Old Testament.  
Now you say, what's the difference?  
Oh, very simple.  
 The faith in the Old Testament was more of what you call trust.  
It was trust.  
And that's why trust is synonymous with faith.  
Trust, they trusted God.  
They trusted his character.  
They trusted what he said.  
 and followed what he said, trust.  
So Abraham's called a father of faith because he trusted God.  
He trusted God's character.  
He trusted God's declarations, God's word.  
He trusted.  
 Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.  
He trusted.  
Over in the New Testament, the difference is faith is not the version of trust that you have in our Testament,  
 It is a law.  
It is a law of what we call the mirror principle.  
There's a beautiful term in the living Bible.  
That's another version, okay?  
The living Bible that's used in expressing the thought when you study in the Book of James chapter number one in verse 25.  
 The expression is so beautiful.  
He says, he calls the Word of God, the Word of God which in the King James is called God's perfect law of liberty.  
The living Bible puts it this way, God's law for free men.  
God's law for free men.  
Some of that say God's law that makes men free, they're wrong.  
You see it?  
They're looking at it from two different sides.  
 God's law that makes men free.  
You see that?  
And that helps you understand the mentality of the communicators.  
God's law of liberty, some view it as God's law that makes men free.  
That is the thinking from the Old Testament idea of faith.  
God's law that makes men free.  
 So they are freedom conscious.  
They need deliverance for one thing or the other.  
Their business needs deliverance.  
You see it?  
Their finances requires deliverance.  
They need deliverance.  
Their family needs deliverance.  
And this deliverance has to go on from time to time.  
So always having demons cast out.  
 of them periodically.  
You see that?  
So the Word of God is for their deliverance, okay?  
But then you have this other group that sees it differently, like the declaration you have in the living Bible.  
God's love for free men.  
That is  
 the real one that is correct.  
You see, how do we know when we study the Bible, how do we know what is right?  
Oh, very simple, very simple, very simple.  
What you need is the knowledge of the gospel, the understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
Let's put it simply.  
You still here?  
You sure?  
Good.  
Jesus came to save the lost.  
 He came to give life to the dead, spiritually dead.  
He came to bring us to God.  
He came to make the sinners righteous.  
Question, did he accomplish his aim?  
Did he accomplish, that is the question, did he accomplish it?  
 Or is he still doing it?  
That's the question.  
Did he accomplish it?  
Is he still art it?  
What does the Bible tell us?  
Where is Jesus?  
What is he doing?  
That's what will tell you whether or not he thinks he's still at work  
 trying to complete what he started, or he thinks he's finished.  
Now, we all know what the Bible says is that he ascended into heaven, right?  
Okay, there is this seated at the right hand of God.  
The Bible says he is seated.  
How could he be seated if he's not through?  
He is seated.  
 He has downed his tools.  
He's seated.  
That means he thinks he has finished.  
Jesus thinks he has finished.  
He thinks so.  
Then, remember, before he ascended after the resurrection, when he appeared to his disciples, he didn't say... Please God, please God.  
 I'm happy for what we have done so far.  
Was he trying to finish up?  
What did he say?  
All hail.  
He asked them to hail.  
How do you hear someone?  
That's what they did to Jesus.  
When he showed up, he had done it.  
 He didn't say quite, quite, quite, quite, quite.  
Things are still very hard.  
Don't let the devil hear us.  
That's not what he said.  
He's a chair.  
I have overcome the world.  
I have overcome.  
He never had a problem with Satan.  
 until he came for us.  
We were the ones that had a problem with Satan.  
We were the ones that needed the victory of a Satan.  
So his victory of a Satan was for us.  
He didn't do it for himself.  
So if you are trying to overcome Satan in your life, you are wrong.  
 So this idea of, I know I'm going to overcome, I'm going to overcome.  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  
The only life of overcoming that the Bible refers to when it says, he that overcoming is what we call in the fight of fate.  
The fight of fate.  
Put in your fate to work.  
 holding that which belongs to you.  
Don't give it up.  
Don't let Satan rob you of your joy, of your victory, of your success, of your prosperity.  
Don't let the devil rob you of your potentialities.  
I made up my mind.  
I will be all that God chose me to be.  
Nothing will stop it.  
 You know, some people are afraid.  
They can't believe what they ought to believe, because they're afraid, like somebody bought a new car.  
And when he bought the new car, this is a real story.  
He bought a new car.  
And then he brought out some large metals, like an ox and some other things, and instead of denting the car.  
He said, if my neighbors see that, it is a new one.  
He actually did this, and dented the car.  


  
 No, that's how terrible people get.  
Don't let them know you are successful because if they know you're successful, they'll come after you.  
Some are afraid of remote control from the village.  
And it works.  
It really works against them.  
Of course it does.  
 No, there are people who went, they just, all they did was to go home for a marriage ceremony or someone's funeral.  
And since that time, they have been on a funeral procession.  
Since then, they've been sick.  
A fellow's been in America for 20 years.  
 And then a close colleague had a problem in Nigeria.  
And so he decided to fly down briefly.  
He's not been in Nigeria for 14 years.  
So he flies down briefly.  
So he could pay his last respects.  
He has been on that last respect for the last five years now.  


  
 Because they caught him.  


  
Tied him down.  
I'll never forget my first experience casting out devils in this young guy when I cast the devils out of him.  
 I expected him to now get up since he is not supposed to be fine.  
And he cried out.  
He couldn't get up.  
He said, they've tied my legs.  
Nobody saw the strings or the ropes which tied him.  
But he cried, they've tied my legs.  
He couldn't get up.  
How did he know they tied his legs?  
He didn't see the ropes, but he felt it.  
 He could move.  
I said, stand up.  
You're free now.  
I tied my legs.  
Imagine if we didn't know better than he would be lame all his life.  
 Now I put my hands on his limbs, and I said, in the name of Jesus, I command the bones to break.  
Loose him and let him go.  
And he sprung up.  
Free.  
That's the power and the name of Jesus.  
Now imagine if they tied your legs.  
Hey, they tied your legs.  
Hey.  


  
 Nothing would happen.  
No, you have people that keep doing like this.  
The entire new office.  


  
That would not work.  
She says, he's the sign of the cross.  
He's the sign of the cross.  
 that Jesus is with the sign of the cross, d'Auscha cast out them.  
So where did you come up with the sign of the cross?  
He came off of that cross.  
He's not on the cross.  


  
Brothers and sisters, do you know who we really are?  
I said, the glory of God is in you.  
 The glory of God is in you.  
Second Corinthians chapter four.  


  
Have you seen it?  
Second Corinthians chapter number four.  
Okay, read verse six.  
Verse six.  


  
 No, no, no, I'm not hearing you.  
Take it again.  
I didn't hear you though.  
Verse 7.  


  
 God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness will shine in our lives.  
Check it.  
What does it say?  
No, is that a promise?  
So why are you still waiting?  
You see, faith is what?  
 Calling real what we do not see.  
It's a conviction of their reality.  
It is a conviction.  
Many people are the way they are because they have no convictions.  
When you meet a man or a woman of conviction, you know.  
When you have no convictions, your life is vacillative.  
 You can't be trusted.  
You are reactionary in different ways.  
Fear dominates.  
You think some people are against you.  
You think someone is working out something that will destroy what you have planned.  
That's not the way.  
 A man of conviction is different.  
He says, God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, the light to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God.  
 He has shined our hearts.  
He's not going to shine.  
He has done it.  
He says, the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness.  
Don't you understand what that is?  
Now this is mind-blowing.  
He commanded light to shine out of darkness, to come from darkness.  
Light, God commanded light to come out of darkness.  


  
 He didn't say that God lit up the dark.  
He said he brought light from darkness.  
Only God can do such a thing.  
To bring out light, the darkness became the source of that light.  
He commanded and lights came out of darkness.  
He says that God has shined  


  
 That God has shined in our hearts to give the light.  


  
That term is for Tismos.  
It means to overflow with light.  
Overflards a place with light.  
 to give the light, the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.  
Then he says in that seventh verse, but we have, we have, we are not going to have, just we have, we have.  
This is a present tense reality.  
We have this treasure.  
 No, when you think your life is empty, how can you relate it with this?  
We have this treasure.  
See, I've got treasure in me.  
The question is, the question is whether or not I know what that treasure is.  
It says we have this treasure in ethnic vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.  
In other words, so mean enough to look at us and wonder, is that what the power is?  
No, he says the excellency of the power is of God.  
 So we have this treasure in ethin vessels.  
Ethin vessels, vessels of clay.  
You look at us, we look ordinary, but inside us is this treasure.  
Listen, if you fail in life, you have yourself to blame.  
If you had an F in class,  
 You could still be a success.  
I don't recommend it.  
Because every little success you get encourages you for more.  
So don't allow those things in your life that make you fight and fight and fight.  
The little success is you get.  
Give you confidence all the time that you can do more.  
But every little failure is a challenge.  
When you fail,  
 Now you have to fight harder for something that should have been easier for you.  
Now you're fighting for something you should have known.  
You still there?  
So, if you have a problem in an area that work and finance anything, if you already failed in anything,  
 No problem, because there's hope.  
The problem is if you fail in things about life, if you have a D in life, you are sunk.  
How can you have a D in life?  
Well, I'm not very sure of how people get this in life.  
I know how you can have an A in life.  
 So I can teach you how to be an absolute success.  
I may not be able to help you know how to fail.  
You see, but I do know that if you ignore those things that make you succeed, you are sure to be among those who are down and out.  
See that?  
Listen, listen, success in life is a requirement  
 Don't settle for anything behind.  
Be number one, first class all the way.  
Number one, in your field, be the best.  
Are you listening?  
Doesn't matter what it is.  
Because you all got our duty to bring out that which is inside you.  
 You owe him a duty.  
He says, we have this treasure in ethnic vessels.  
We have this treasure.  
We are not praying for it.  
We have it.  
I carry a treasure in me.  
This is the treasure of the glory of God.  
 He said, the reason God's shined in my heart is to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God as it reveals Jesus Christ.  
So he says in the face of Jesus Christ, he's shined in me to reveal him.  
It is a responsibility.  
I cannot be but excellent.  
So that's my life.  
Oh boy.  
 That's your life.  
This week, for example, you make up your mind.  
You're going to be tops in everything.  
In everything.  
In whatever you do.  
In whatever you do.  
Do you drive a car for someone?  
Keep it excellent.  
Let it be clean inside and outside.  
 Be excellent, be number one.  
Are you a cleaner in the office?  
Make way you clean, different from everybody else.  
Don't be the one complaining.  
If we had the things to clean it, why wouldn't I clean it?  
If we had the, don't be that kind of a man.  
Get the things you need by yourself, because what you're doing there represents you.  
 Are you hearing me?  
Yes!  
If you're a nurse, don't be the one that I was waiting for.  
Where is me, so and so?  
You're always late.  
No!  
Know your job more than everybody else.  
Know your work more than everybody else.  
Are your schoolteacher?  
Be number one.  
Don't come to class forgetting the things you wanted to teach.  
Then you say, okay, now, now there's tests.  
 Because you don't remember and it's now they test, they test today, they test.  
Every day they test.  
Because you didn't read.  
The students must not be punished.  
Spend you a week, everywhere else.  
Walk up late on Monday morning, rush to class, now they test.  
I told you before I'd bring tests anytime.  


  
 Impact knowledge.  
Impact knowledge.  
I said be different.  
Be so different until your colleagues begin to say, why are you so different?  
We have a message in series titled, why are we so different?  
Yeah.  
 be so different because that's what Jesus said.  
Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your father.  
No, I'm one of a kind.  
Say that with me.  
I'm unique.  
Now, you know, when you turn out that way, get ready for trouble.  
Yeah?  
Oh, there will be trouble.  
They'll call you proud and bragadocious.  
 Call your names.  
There'll be those you greet and they don't answer.  
But you know, never mind, that's their trouble.  
Hallelujah.  
But they're just going to keep watching you fly.  
That's all.  
And you will be humble.  
No matter how high you're flying, you remain humble, flying high and higher with humility.  
Do you understand?  
 And don't be saying hi to people who are older than you.  


  
It's not civilized.  
I know you think this is a new word.  
Somebody saying he's older than you.  
 Grigio, good money, say hi.  
Where do you think you're from?  
Hi.  
Hudson.  


  
How's it come to that?  


  
 The Bible says for us to be clothed with humility.  
All right?  
Be clothed with humility.  
Wait, wear humility.  
Put it on.  
If you greet someone, greet correctly.  
All right?  
And be heard.  
Now some of you spend some time in your dad's place and you wake up whenever you like.  
 and daddy's going out, mommy's going out, they have to knock at your daughter, say, are you still sleeping?  
I wish you were with my dad.  


  
How can you stay in your dad's house?  
I said, stay in your dad's house, because I know some of you have grown up, you stay in your own house, and then you come home, so with daddy, and then you, you know, you're now big.  
If you stay in your dad's house,  
 or your dad passes the night in your house.  
You get up in the morning and you go there and knock that his door and you say good money to him and to your mom.  
How you hear what I'm telling you?  
That's the right thing to do.  
 You know, I've tried to teach a lot of people.  
I've seen people say that, well, we never went to the mommy's room or daddy's room in the morning.  
We never did.  
I said, you never did.  
Whatever happened to you?  
Okay, now in the house of God, you must learn it.  
Let your dad be surprised and where you're from.  
He said, they taught us in church.  
You hearing me?  
Yeah, they taught us in church.  
He asked me, who cleans your father's room?  
I don't know.  
 Who cleans your father's room?  
What's your mother's room?  
Some of you are surprised.  
We should clean it now.  
Everybody to his room.  
I'm surprised at you.  
If your mom  
 has been the one cleaning her room.  
They said, my mom cleans daddy's room.  
Your mom, after she gave back to you how many years ago, she was cleaning before you were born.  
She was cleaning right after you were born.  
She cleaned all the time, you were growing up.  
Now you are growing up, your mom is still cleaning.  
Something is wrong with you.  
 No, you have arrived.  
You have arrived home.  
Your mom, you big man.  
You've arrived.  
Your mom.  
Your mom is going to cook something for you.  
So she quickly gets in the taxi or gets wherever to go to the market to buy things to cook for you because you came from Lagos.  


  
 She's going to the market.  
Do you know what that market is like?  
Have you ever been there?  
Your mom is still going there, tea today.  
When I was a teenager, when I was a teenager, I learned to drive.  
And I took my mom several times at the market.  
 One day, because I had followed them to the market from when I was young, like this, either my aunties, or my uncle, or my mom followed them to the market.  
So I was excited to move around in the market, you know?  
But as I became a teenager and I learned to drive, my mom would say, come and take me to the market.  
Now, she didn't like it when I learned to drive.  
She was like, you touch that car?  
Now, when daddy allowed me to drive, mom used to come and carry me to the market.  
So I took my mom to the market several times.  
One day.  
 While I was in the car, because I went away to come back to pick as she told me when to come.  
So when I came back, I was waiting in the car, and I saw different women coming out of that market, carrying things, sweating, you know.  
I said, one of these people will be my mom soon, coming out, waiting.  
Finally,  
 My mom came out.  
So I jumped down and went, helped take some of the things and put it in the car.  
But that picture reminded my mind.  
I didn't like it.  
I said, the people that they are going to cook for now are at work or in school or somewhere.  
They don't know what's going on here.  
That market is not the shopping mall.  
 There are people all over the world that are fascinated by African markets.  
They want to come and see what happens here.  
They've heard about our markets.  
They want to come and see them.  
What am I saying to you?  
You can plan for your mother or your father to live a better life than what they met because of you.  
You know what I'm telling you?  
 The Bible says, when you study in divisions chapter number six, and you read from verse one down, he says, oh no, your father and your mother.  
That it may be well with you, and that thou mayest leave long on the earth.  
 That it may be well with you.  
When you find things not well with your business, I mean, you are excellent, everything is okay, but things are always going up and down for you.  
Go and check.  
What is your relationship with your father or your mother?  
Go and find out.  
Maybe you don't know how to honor them.  
Maybe that is the problem.  
Your mother is talking, you are shouting back.  
For some of you, you control your mother or your father.  
 You are telling your mother, hi.  
When life starts telling you, hi.  
You will know.  
He says, honor your father, your mother, that it may be well.  
That it may be well with you.  
That it may be well with you.  
 This you go back and practice.  
Are you hearing what I'm telling you?  
You make definite changes.  
See, we're talking about this is the year of the sevenfold increase.  
That increase will be frustrated, except you put this kind of things right.  
Honor your father and your mother, that it may be well with you.  
You hear that?  
And don't talk back at them.  
 If you don't agree with them, keep quiet.  
Let them say whatever they are saying.  
Then settle down and explain your path.  
If they still don't agree, you don't have to shout.  
Just keeping your heart, what you know is right.  
But to start arguing with them, talking back, talking back, God will be angry with you.  
And you don't want God to be angry with you.  
See, I chose longer because I saw these things in the Bible.  
I chose longer ago to let nothing of such  
 getting to my blessings, I'm going to have perfect and pure blessings, and it will be well with me.  
So I'm not going to let any of these things.  
So if someone's arguing, talking anyhow with daddy or mummy, that's not going to be me.  
Not because I'm naive or stupid or afraid.  
I'm not afraid of them.  
I am in reverence to God.  
I don't want God against me.  
 Because God will hear whatever I say.  
So I'm gonna be quiet so that God can look at my heart and say, Son, all right, you pass this test.  
Okay, move to the next level.  
Did you hear me?  
All right.  
Glory to God.  
Okay, start asking God to forgive you.  
Now those of you that have been doing the wrong thing.  
Pray now ask God to forgive you.
