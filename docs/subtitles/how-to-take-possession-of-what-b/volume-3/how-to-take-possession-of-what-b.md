title: How To Take Possession Of What Belongs To You (Vol. 3 Part 3)
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 Wow, are you ready?  
All right, Hebrews chapter number 11, from verse one, and you know where we're going, it's verse three, but from verse one, now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen, for by the elders obtained a good report,  
 Through faith, we understand that the eons, you should become familiar with that now.  
Through faith, we understand that the words.  
The eons were framed by the Word of God.  
Oh, hallelujah, framed by the Word of God, by the rhema of God.  
 Frame.  
And we say that word is catatizo, meaning restore, to restore, to repair, to frame, mend,  
 through faith we understand that the aeons were framed by the Word of God so that things which are seen.  
Now this is the area I want to deal with tonight.  
So that things which are seen we're not made of things which do appear.  
What is God telling us?  
He says, so that things which are seen.  
He says the aeons were framed by the Word of God.  
 the ages, the wars.  
And remember what we said, Aeon means.  


  
It is the structure and administration of your life.  
The way things go with you,  
 the way things go in your life, what comes into your life and what goes out of your life.  
Everything and the parts of your life.  
The day in which you live, how the world around you, how your environment affects you, the results you get,  
 how things are going to be in your life, in your words, as they affect you.  
You can't blame anybody now.  
He gives us an example.  
He tells us that that day on, that cause of your life, can be framed by the rema of God.  
And the rema of God is minister to you.  
 The Rayma of God is minister to you, it's granted you.  
God speaks to your spirit and gives you that Rayma, the creative word, and you can use it.  


  
If things have gone wrong in your life, in your word, if your word has become chaotic,  
 If your world has turned out to be something different from what you want it to be, you can caratizo it, restore it, repair it, mend it, and then frame what you want.  
It is such that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  
In other words, you can bring into your life, into your world.  
What wasn't there before?  
 Something that didn't even have the chance of being there.  
Oh God, what a life he has given us.  
With this, I know I can only be absolutely successful.  
And you can be as successful as you want to be.  
As victorious as you want to be.  


  
 So the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  
Thanks beyond to God.  
Can we read from 2nd Corinthians chapter number four and see something in this direction?  
2nd Corinthians chapter number four.  
And I'll begin reading to you from verse  
 13.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Say with me, I'm a success.  
Say, I'm an absolute success.  
And nothing can change that.  
I know who I am.  


  
 Verse 13, we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written, I believed and therefore have I spoken.  
We also believe and therefore speak.  
The spirit of faith according as it is written, I believed and therefore have I spoken.  
You see, he didn't say I believed and therefore was I happy.  
I believed therefore I was quiet.  
No, if you believe, speak what you believe.  
 That is the spirit of faith.  
The spirit of faith.  
The spirit of faith.  
According as it is written, I believed and therefore have I spoken.  
He says, we also believe and therefore speak.  
I speak in His base and I believe in Him.  
 The spirit of faith, therefore, believes with the heart and voices that faith with the mouth.  
Otherwise, you don't have faith.  
The spirit of faith believes in the heart and speaks out according to his believing.  
So believing is not enough.  
You must speak your believing.  
You can't believe and keep quiet.  
It will not work.  
 It will not work.  
Speaking is like the action.  
 I mean, if somebody was sick and he was told as this wonderful drug, if you take this thing, you're gonna be fine.  
And while lying on the bed, he said, I believe if I take it, I'll be fine.  
I believe.  
Would that make him fine?  
No, I believe if I eat, I'll be fine.  
Okay, come on, eat now.  
Relax, I believe if I eat, I'll be fine.  
Come on, eat.  
See, he may die believing.  
 believing is not enough.  
Even in our salvation, for us to receive salvation, the Bible says in Romans chapter 10 and verse 9, if thou shalt confess with thy mouth, the Lord Jesus, believing in thine heart that God had raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  
Now in verse 10, it says, for with the heart.  
 Man believes on to righteousness and with the mouth confession, that means declaration.  
Procommission is made on to salvation.  
That means you catapult yourself with your mouth into the salvation that you are believed in in your heart.  
Otherwise, even though you believe you will not experience salvation.  
 Now what's the problem with a lot of Christians?  
You know, there are Christians who are oppressed by demons.  
They experience all kinds of oppressions.  
They have nightmares in the nights.  
They have something pressing them in the night.  
They have something squeezing them in the night.  
They have something getting into their body in the night.  
They're frightened.  
Oh God, oh God, oh God.  
In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, nothing will happen.  
 just because he said, oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus, that's not what he said.  
Oh Jesus, he said to use the name.  
You're not using the name.  
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  
Jesus will not do anything for you on earth.  
Now get this.  
 Get it clear.  
Some people don't understand it, then it sounds as though we are robbing God of his ability and his desire to do something on our behalf.  
Come on, don't you remember that Jesus gave us the power of a Tony to use his name?  
He went out of the earth.  
He's ascended into heaven and left his name here for us to use.  
 It doesn't make sense to be crying, oh Jesus, oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  
You suffer crying.  
You use the name.  
Don't call him to help you.  
Use the name to get, oh boy.  
Let me explain.  
Imagine you got a seal given to you and you were told that there's a checkbook  
 And all you have to do is feel how much you want and use the seal or the stamp.  
All right?  
And you strike that thing and you can get the money you want.  
Now you feel it and you're crying, oh, the seal.  
Oh, the seal.  
Oh, the stamp.  
Oh, the seal.  
You'll still be broke.  
 just because you have filled what you asked for doesn't mean that check is going to work.  
It will only be acceptable and you get the money when you put that stamp on it or you put that seal on it.  
Now we are not using it when we cry, see the name of Jesus is an instrument.  
 Do you understand?  
It's an instrument.  
You can't just cry, oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, oh, call his name 10,000 times.  
In the name of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, you be tired and nothing will change.  
You see, that's the difference between some of us and some other people who call the same name and warn that they think that maybe we are doing something else.  
 Because he said, are we not using the name of Jesus?  
The same name of Jesus?  
No, you are calling on the name.  
You are calling on the name.  
He has answered.  
He answered.  
So he gave you the name.  
Now, use it.  
Use it.  
OK, something is pressing you in the night.  
Let me see.  
Oh, Jesus.  
Oh, Jesus.  
Oh, Jesus.  
Jesus.  
 Say, go!  


  
It will go.  
Now somebody says, what if you say go and it doesn't go?  
That's saying to God.  
What if your word fares?  
Fairs?  


  
 What if your word fails?  
You're talking to God?  
I don't know.  
You are so used to all the people you have dealt with all your life.  
They told you they were coming at five.  
They didn't come.  
So you are so used to being disappointed.  
Now God has spoken to you and you don't want for that disappointment.  
You say, oh, Father, will it really, really, really, really happen?  
You know, you're looking at God from the standpoint of the experiences you have had.  
 It matters where you grew up.  
Yeah, it matters.  
I mean, if you've been present in a place where everybody has prayed in the name of Jesus, there was no change.  
You are used to prayer without results.  
Oh Lord Jesus, hey, no, no.  
Then you are looking, nothing changes.  
So even when you two are using the name of Jesus, you are used to it feeling.  
 No, when you're present there, like many times you see that at the healing school or in some of our meetings, and we command blind eyes to open up and they open up right away, you change your mind about God answering prayers.  
Or you command the lane to get up and walk and to get up and walk, you become bold about Christ, you know?  
But when you know the hand is put on the sick and the Father in the name of Jesus, go through this problem with Him,  
 Help him to go through.  
Then you are used to Jesus being on the defensive and going through problems with you.  
No, a thousand times no.  
Do you know why the disciples asked Jesus to teach him how to pray?  
They said, Master, teach us to pray.  
Did you think they never prayed before?  
They've been praying all their lives.  
These were Jews.  
They were taught and raised to pray.  
 They prayed several times a day.  
But now somebody came on the saying, who will receive results?  
I said, Master, teach us to pray.  
Hallelujah.  
Teach us to pray.  
I remember years ago, back in 1985, and we went for a certain crusade.  
 And then on Sunday afternoon, after the outdoor meetings, we had an indoor meeting, and it was a special healing service that all afternoon.  
They brought the sick from everywhere, carried them on their bags on beds that did everything, just to bring the sick in.  
And I'd gone with several people who were ministering to the sick.  
 And while I was just resting against the wall and watching some of them as they were ministering, some of those who weren't with me, you know, we had so many people to minister to her, but it was helping.  
And I noticed one of the brothers was casting out a deaf spirit, and he commanded the deaf spirit to come out, and it seemed like nothing happened.  
He tested a guy, couldn't hear him, couldn't talk.  
He tried again.  
 Same thing happened.  
I just noticed it was resting with that demon.  
So finally, I was uncomfortable with this situation.  
So I went close to him as, excuse me.  
So I put my fingers in the ears.  
I said, come out.  
I said, one.  
One.  
And he started hearing and talking right away.  
What was the difference?  
 Why was it that he talked to that devil and the devil didn't go?  
And I talked to the devil and the devil left.  
What was the difference?  
We used the same authority in the name of Jesus.  
What was the difference?  
 Because you see, he was talking to the devil that I was watching him.  
He was talking to the devil and asking him to come out and try to find out whether or not the devil went out.  
And he thought the devil didn't go out just because the guy's thing could respond.  
And I had no time for that.  
I told that the devil would play out and as far as I was concerned, he was gone and I told the fellow to count.  
And that was it.  
You don't try to find out whether the devil has gone.  
 So when you say, in the name of Jesus, get out of here.  
Don't try to find out.  
Has he gone?  
You see, even if he's standing there looking at you, he doesn't have no option.  
You act as though he is gone.  
Now, let me put it this way.  
Put it this way.  
See, let me show you something.  
Can I get up?  
Oh, come on.  
 Stand here.  
All right.  
Now, it's not always, it's not always, all right, you know, it's always nice to use somebody as like a devil.  
You understand what I mean?  
Okay.  
But then you say, you tell him in the name of Jesus, get out.  
Now, he may still be standing there.  
Just go.  
He'll be out.  


  
 You understand what I'm saying?  
You don't wait to see that.  
Oh, he's still there.  
I said go.  


  
When you tell him to go, and he's still standing there, act like no, he is gone.  
 Now just because he is still doing what he was doing before you said, go, doesn't mean you didn't have the authority.  
Act like he's gone and he'll be gone.  
Now in certain cases, in certain cases, you say go, thank you.  
You say go and he acts like he didn't hear you.  
 It happened with Jesus.  
It happened with Jesus.  
That man who was demon possessed in Gedara, who caught himself with stones, he had a demon, he was possessed of a demon, and Baba says that he had a legion of demons, evil spirits in him.  
The Baba says that Jesus commanded the devil to come out of the man.  
 But a devil didn't quite come out.  
If you started properly, the devil engaged Jesus in a discussion.  
Jesus had come out and therefore didn't come out.  
He kept talking to Jesus.  
Don't ask us to leave the city.  
Please, leave us here.  
And then Jesus said, what is your name?  
This was after telling him to leave.  
The demon didn't go.  
 So Jesus said, what is your name?  
He said, my name is Legion.  
Because we are many.  
Over 12,000 demons were in that man.  
12,000 evil spirits dwelled in him.  
But he was possessed of one.  
All right?  
So Jesus said, what is your name?  
He said, my name is Legion.  
For we are many.  
Please, don't send us out of the city.  
 We have a competition in this city.  
Well then, they said, please, give us permission to go into the swine.  
About 2,000 of them, 2,000 of them pigs are there.  
And Jesus said, okay, go.  
Why?  
Why did you let them go in there?  
Because the Jews were not supposed to wear a swine.  
 So they were already breaking the law for keeping sorry.  
So he said, all right.  
And the demons went into these 2000s, and the Baba terrorists, all of them, they couldn't let no devil live in them.  
They all ran down the steep slope and drowned, killed themselves.  
Of course, the demons couldn't stay in dead bodies.  
They started looking for somewhere else to stay.  
 But he has the point.  
Jesus told that devil to come out, he didn't come out immediately.  
And so Jesus said, what is your name?  
Now, except you understand certain things, there are some other things you should understand before this one, which if you don't understand yet, this might sound like Greek to you.  
But whatever it is, for the purpose of the discussion, here it is.  
 When Jesus said the devil to come out and that devil acted like he didn't hear Jesus, until he engaged him,  
 In that dialogue, it was because he then needed to make contact with that spirit.  
Sometimes he talked to a devil, he acts like he didn't hear you because he knows that except you can make contact because he knows he lives in a different word, in a different realm from the physical realm from which we function.  
So when you talk from here, sometimes you pretend he didn't hear you or you act like you don't know he's here.  
 He needs to know, you know he's here.  
Are you getting it?  
And so when Jesus said, what is your name?  
Oh, he knew, oh, oh, he knows I'm here.  
My name is Legion for we, how many?  
You see, so that's the way it is.  
So sometimes you've got to get across to that other dimension.  
 to deal with Satanic forces.  
So just because you're shouting, go, go.  
You know, you can be saying, leave here, out of this place.  
And you're acting like he's hanging somewhere.  
The devil knows you.  
Oh, he thinks it's physical.  
There was over here.  
And you say, in the name of Jesus, you come out because something was shaking and you leave that place now.  
 And what is second?  
It is over here.  
He's not moving because he knows you're functioning from the flesh.  
Until he knows, you know the realm in which he is functioning from.  
And he discerned that.  
And he's saying the name of Jesus Christ are the man that you quit.  
That never will leave.  
Now somebody said, what about when Jesus said, this kind go at not but by prayer and fasting?  
 Well, the question you ask yourself is, what does prayer and fasting do for you?  
Prayer and fasting will help you get your antenna straight and become focused in hearing the Spirit of God direct you, all right?  
And also to minister or respond from your spirit.  
Is it from your head or from your mind?  
 And so those demons that will not go except by prayer and fasting are this kind that I just told you about.  
You need to be functioning from the same realm so he knows that you are aware of Israel.  
And prayer and fasting helps you to be alert to that realm.  
Praise God.  
 Now, it doesn't mean that if you don't pray and fast on a particular day, you're not.  
You're supposed to function with that consciousness all the time.  
After when Jesus cast that devil out, he didn't fast that day.  
All right?  
Because he was acquainted and he was still in the disciples.  
You've got to function at that realm to deal with this kind of demon.  
Because this is another level of demon is very intelligent.  
And he watches for what you know and what you don't know.  
Praise God.  
 All right, so understand what we're talking about.  
Faith works, amen.  
He gave us the authority to use his name, and we can use his name.  
He gave us the authority.  
We can take over our word.  
You can't be disadvantaged that way.  
You can't just lie down and hope that if you just don't say anything, the devil will go away.  
No, he wouldn't do it just because you're quiet.  
He said, let's sleep in dog's life.  
No.  
 That's your quiet and troubling no one doesn't mean the devil's going to go away.  
Oh, Father, as I want to go to bed this night, I don't want any disturbances.  
Oh, Father, I want to sleep well.  
It's been a long time since I slept well.  
 That's not going to work.  
See, listen, Jesus has come.  
Jesus has died.  
Jesus has risen.  
Jesus has ascended.  
Jesus is seated.  
You can't function as though he hasn't come.  
So you can be telling him to do this thing for you.  
He has finished.  
 And He has given you victory over demons, disease, and death.  
He's given you the authority.  
So in the instant of asking, oh Lord, please, I want to sleep tonight.  
I need a peaceful night rest.  
At least, oh God, what's in the old model, God?  
You want to go to sleep?  
Say, father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, I thank you.  
Oh, glory to God, I'm at peace.  
 Amen.  
No devil shows up in this room tonight.  
Ha ha, glory to God.  
See, put them.  
That's what Jesus said.  
He said, I give unto you power.  
That means authority over all devils.  
 Again, he said, I'll be here sitting far from heaven as lightning.  
Behold, I give you what?  
Power.  
He shall tread upon supents and upon sculptures.  
And over all the ability, that means over everything he can do, over all the ability of the enemy.  
And then he's at end nothing shall by any means.  
 So if that is true, why are you waking up with, hey, what happens if something did me last night?  
What did you last night?  
You wake up with marks in your body, you know, they said, which is, I've achieved you, you know, with marks on your face,  
 You know?  
Even as I'm talking now, there are those who are afraid of disaster.  
Just don't talk about what she's like that.  
Now you got marks, you know?  
Every time you sleep, you wake up with marks, bruises, you had a fight in the night.  
When will your life change?  
No, you're thinking that God needs to do something.  


  
 He's not going to do anything about it.  
You think God needs to do something.  
Father, you have to do something about my case.  
He did something about your case 2000 years ago.  
If you don't appropriate it now, nothing will be done.  
Use what your God.  
Use your authority if they have been troubling you in the night.  
Tonight you say, Devil, wherever you are, in the name of Jesus Christ, I demand that you disease from coming to my house.  
 See, from the night, I put you on the run.  
And when you say, don't be afraid.  
Don't say it and say.  


  
Don't try to find out whether you have annoyed him.  
I didn't mean to be offensive.  
 Hallelujah.  
Fear not, fear not, fear not, fear not, fear not, refuse to fear.  
Say it again, say I refuse to fear.  
Even when things sometimes, you know, there are times you think like  
 Whether financially, business-wise, there are things that can look like, hey, you're failing.  
Things are going bad.  
You say, no, not with me.  
I'm different.  
I'm different.  
To me, things that be not as though they were.  


  
 Did you ever make losses in business?  
Have you made losses in your thinking?  
Some people make losses, they feel like dying.  
Not you.  
Not you.  
Losses?  
Don't you know who God is?  
You're too big for that.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
 He said, our restore, that with the conqueror have eaten.  
That with the locust, the palma one had eaten.  
It's an hour restore.  
He can restore what you lost.  
So you can never be disadvantaged.  
Understand this kind of life.  
How could you be disadvantaged?  
 He can restore everything that you lost.  
He's the one who's at our restore.  
You're wasted, yes, wasted, yes.  


  
He put his word to work.  
Put his word to work.  
He said, I will restore who the Holy Ghost, because it's the same prophet Joel.  
 As when he said, in the last day he said, God, I pour out my spirit upon all flesh.  
That's the spirit of restoration.  
It's the Holy Ghost.  
And when you have the Holy Ghost in your life, losses have ended.  
You miss them like this.  
They go out like this.  
You release your word of faith, they come back to you.  
 They come back.  
He said, in all these things, we are more than conquerors.  
I told you, I told you what it means when you say more than conquerors.  
It doesn't mean that, you know, people have a lot of explanations, but I wish they would just read the Bible and understand it.  
It's very simple.  
 What it says, we are more than conquerors.  
It's King James' reindream that sometimes mislead certain folks.  
And then, of course, there are other people who pick up some versions without studying properly so that it can understand it in context.  
So they have different explanations for that.  
What it says, in all these things, we are more than conquerors.  
Go into it.  
Can you read it?  
All right.  
Romance after eight.  
 Glory to God.  
Man, oh, man.  
Eight verse 37.  
Romans chapter eight verse 37.  
Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us.  
You studied the whole context.  
I'll tell you.  
 what this means.  
It says we are more than conquerors.  
What it's saying is, in all these things, we are the best communication in English.  
Sometimes English is not adequate for these spiritual communications.  
And even the Greek language was much richer.  
So if the Greek  
 had problems explaining, you can imagine how many words you would need in English to communicate the same thoughts.  
It means we've gone beyond conquering.  
In all these things, we are not celebrating that we have conquered.  
We've gone beyond that level.  
That's actually what is telling you.  
We have passed conquering.  
 So he says, King James says, we are more than conquerors.  
The expression is that we have passed conquering in all these things.  
We've gone beyond it.  
This is no longer a challenge to us.  
I've passed that level through him that loved us.  
 We are not trying to go through.  
He says, we have passed that level.  
Those things that would have held us back, we have passed that level.  
Oh.  
That's why he says, for I am persuaded, the next verse, that neither death nor life, nothing's present, nothing's past, not angels, not principalities.  
He says, nothing, nothing.  
 and separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus.  
It says we've passed that level.  
It says nothing in life or death, not angels or principalities.  
We've passed that level.  
You know what he's telling you?  
That we have been catapulted beyond the level of war.  
 Do you understand?  
So the only fight we have today is the fight of faith.  
And when we talk about spiritual warfare, the spiritual warfare is not with demons.  
Oh dear, dear, dear, dear.  
You know, people are imagining that we are in a fight with demons.  
No, find out what they are using and find out what the weapons of our warfare are.  
The kind of weapons we are given  
 And what we are supposed to be dealing with or war in the gates would tell you what this is all about.  
Since the weapons of our warfare are not canon.  
But they are mighty through God.  
To the pulling down of demons?  
No.  
Says to the pulling down of strongholds.  
What are strongholds?  
Strombores are ideas and theories.  
 Those things in your mind or in the minds of men that have made them to believe certain things that have held them back from success and victory and prosperity.  
Those things that are those thoughts in their minds that have made them to feel like Satan has gained the upper hand.  
These are strongholds.  
 says, but the weapons of our warfare are not canon.  
They are mighty through the Holy Ghost, to the pulling down of strongholds.  
Then says, and casting down imaginations.  
 imaginations, you are imagining that something will happen, you're imagining that that devil is behind your door, you're imagining that financially you might be a wreck, you're imagining that your marriage is falling, you're imagining that your child is going to get, you know, he's casting down imaginations.  
The weapons of our warfare.  
 are not canna, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds.  
Those strongholds in the mind are shattered by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
Casting down imaginations and bringing down every high thing that exalted itself above the knowledge of God.  
And bringing also into subjection  
 Glory to God.  
See, let me tell you something.  
He says, in all these things, we are more than conquerors.  
We have been blessed beyond the battle line.  
We are not in the battle.  
Someone said, I've been in the battle, heavy battle, heavy spiritual battle.  
You're in the wrong battle.  
You are not in the battle.  
You were born beyond the battle line.  
 What are you supposed to do now?  
It's called a fight of faith.  
What is the faith?  
Why is it a fight?  
Because now your victory and your success can only be seen through the eyes of faith.  
It is a confident assurance that that which you were hoping for is real.  
The time to lead to unseen realities.  
Faith is the substance.  
 faith is holding us real, my victory in Christ, even when I don't feel so.  
I know it's real.  
I have gone beyond the battle line because I am a victim already.  
Satan may say, look, we are still fighting as a devil.  
You are defeated and you are behind.  
Glory to God.  
 Through faith we understand that the eons were framed by the Word of God.  
So that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  
We were reading 2nd Corinthians chapter 4, you remember?  
And I read to you from verse 13, and that's not where we were going.  
That was just the beginning to get wet your appetite.  
 You understand?  
We're also having the same spirit of faith.  
As it is written, I believe, never have I spoken.  
We also believe and therefore speak.  
Say, I have the spirit of faith.  
You say, see, I got the spirit of faith like David.  
You remember David?  
David said to Goliath, I'll take your head off of your shoulders today.  
He was bursting for Goliath.  
Goliath the giant.  
 David only had his stone.  
And he was ready with that sling.  
Goliath had somebody in front of him holding his shield.  
And he had a great sword.  
He couldn't imagine this little rascal talking to him.  
And David said, yes, he said, you come against me with a sword and with a shield and with a spear.  
So the man had a spear and he had a sword.  
 And David said, I come against you in the name of the lot of hosts.  
The God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied, then he began to boast in the Lord.  
He said, I will take your head off of your shoulders today, and I'll give your cakas.  
And the cakas is at the host of the Philistons, from the birds of the earth, and the whole world shall not this day.  
And there is a God in Israel.  


  
 He had a timing for his miracle.  
He said, today, God will give you into my hands.  
Imagine what was going on in Goliath's mind.  
He said, today, God will give you into my hands, and I will take your head off of your shoulders.  
He was saying, oh, this is Goliath, and Goliath was hungry.  
 What?  
Then he said to David, am I a dog?  
And while he was doing that, David went.  
He was aiming for his head.  
You need to read that portion of the Bible for yourself.  


  
Spirit of faith.  
 Spirit of faith.  
Spirit of faith.  
There I got the spirit of faith.  
I got the spirit of faith.  
I believe.  
Therefore do I speak.  
I believe.  
Therefore do I speak.  
So I believe and speak.  
I believe and speak.  
I believe and speak.  
I believe in my future.  
 And I speak my future.  
I'm a success.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Listen, we understand this.  
Nothing in the whole world can defeat you.  
Nothing.  
Nothing.  
Nothing.  
 Glory to God.  
All right, now let's read from verse 16 of that chapter four, second Corinthians.  
Read verse 16 now.  
You're actually going to read from 16 to 17 to 18.  
You ready?  
All right, read 16.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 A while.  
A light affliction.  
He says, when we go through triers and tempests, pain, and virtual disappointments,  
 and persecutions.  
This is our light affliction, which is but for a moment.  
Works out for us a far more exceeding Anitana wet.  
It's talking about wearing something like a wane gold.  
Anitana wet of glory.  
He says, when we go through these things that we gotta go through,  
 All right, the persecution, the disappointments, the pains, and all of this kind of things.  
He says, when we go through them, they only produce for us heavier weights of glory.  
So long as we look not at the things which I've seen.  
Sando Gabbaradahiah.  
 says, why will look not at the things which are seen?  
But at the things which are not seen, how can we look at the things which are not seen?  
It means they are real.  
Those are the things you see with the eyes of faith.  
Faith is the title deed to unseen realities.  
Why will look not at the things which are seen?  
But at the things which are not seen,  
 For the things which I see in are temporal.  
That means they are subject to change.  
They don't last for long.  
They are subject to change.  
You said, tumor, you are subject to change.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Did you lose your job for the letters that you are subject to change?  


  
 Bad news?  
Did you hear bad news?  
Put it before you and say you are subject to change.  
If I can see you, you are subject to change.  
In America!  
Hey!  
If this optical eyes, if this physical eyes can see you, you are subject to change.  
 We look not at the things which are seeing.  
For the things that are seeing are temporary.  
They are subject to change.  
Subject to change.  
Never be worried about such things, subject to change.  


  
Say, brother, don't worry, it is subject to change.  
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
 Why will look not at the things which are seen?  
So, as a brother, don't look at it.  
It is subject to change.  


  
Why will look not at the things which are seen?  
But are the things which are not seen?  
How can we see that?  
Through the Word of God.  
 Through faith we understand that the aeons were free.  
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.  
Aye.  
You say, Mom, don't worry.  
We will threaten you future.  
Aye.  


  
 You know, a young man said, when his father died, everything went bad in his life.  
No, young man, you can frame a new future.  
You can.  
Don't worry.  
Che up.  
Che up.  
You're gonna frame a new future.  
You're gonna frame a new A on.  
 You're going to frame a new one.  
And you begin from tonight to speak into that future.  
Through faith we understand that the eons were framed by the Word of God such that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.  
Oh God.  
What is missing in your eons?  
 Catatizo it.  
Repate.  
Maint it.  
Catatizo also means to complete perfectly.  
So complete it perfectly.  
Is there something missing in your aeon?  
Is there something you wish you had in your word?  
Through faith.  
 We understand that the words, the aeons, were framed by the Reimer!  
The Reimer!  
When God puts Reimer, I'm telling some of you have received Reimer tonight.  
I mean, you got it in your spirit.  
Hallelujah!  
You've received Reimer!  


  
 Some of you heard it in your spirit.  
When I said, from a new future, you cut it, you cut it.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
You got it.  
You got it.  
Some of you were listening.  
When I said that thing was subject to change.  
It was Raymar.  
Raymar for your spirit.  
Raymar for your spirit.  
Subject to change.  
Subject to change.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 Our condition is subject to change, subject to change.  
Ah!  
Oh, no, no, no.  
Maybe you haven't had the place to live.  
You've been sleeping in a friend's back house.  
You've been sleeping in the garage tonight.  
You say, this subject to change, go like that.  
Go like that.  
subject to change.  
 Hallelujah.  
It's subject to change.  
It's subject to change.  
I, oh, glory to God.  
Rayma, Rayma, that's what you need.  
Rayma, Rayma in your mouth, that's what you need.  
Rayma, the spoken word of God.  
Rayma is a creative word.  
 Hallelujah.  


  
Glory to God.  
Amen.  
Hold on for a minute.  
Hold on for a minute.  
Hold on.  
 Somebody just acts in, you know, someone just act and pick that in the Spirit.  
He said, what exactly is Raima?  
Let me explain a little further.  
Raima is that word that the Holy Spirit speaks.  
And when he speaks it, it is personnel to you.  
At that moment, you just, it's like you can sense it in your Spirit that is talking to you.  
 That is Reema.  
Reema is the word that God speaks that concerns you right now for your peculiar case at this time, at this moment.  
And you receive that word and it's like, it's talking to me.  
That is Reema.  
And when you pick it in your spirit and you say, He's talking to me, you use it.  
You said, therefore, in the name of Jesus.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 Whatever you want at that time, whatever situation you are in at that time, that thing that God said to you, act on it, use it, worries it, speak it hallelujah.  
Come on, shout somebody.  
Oh, glory to God.  
I got my life made.  
I can see my future.  
 I'm working with the Ray Malka.  
I'm speaking farce, success, victory, prosperity.  
Oh, Glory to God.  
Oh, Glory to God.  
Hallelujah.  
It's working, it's working, it's working.  
The Word of God is working, working, working, working, working.  
Man, oh my.  
 You got it in your spirit, brother.  
You got it in your spirit, sister.  
You got it.  
You got it.
