title: How To Take Possession Of What Belongs To You (Vol. 1 Part 2)
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Labor is yours.  


  
 Do you have your Bibles?  
Last Sunday.  
You remember we talked about, that Satan has been defeated.  
You remember that?  
Yes.  
And that the victory is ours.  
We're read from the book of Ephesians chapter number one, from verse 15 down to the last verse, and then we also read in Hebrews chapter number two.  
 14th verse, I'd like to read that Hebrews chapter 2 again, and that 14th verse, glory to God.  
He says, for as much death as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil.  
 And leave them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.  
Glory to God.  
Beautiful.  
So the victory of Jesus Christ over Satan was for our sake.  
 He defeated the devil for us, meaning that we don't have any trouble with the devil.  
Because as far as we are concerned, he's been defeated.  
Hey, come on.  
Say the devil has been defeated.  
He was defeated for me.  
 Which means, I have defeated devil.  
That's sure.  
You know, but for a lot of people, Satan is a problem.  
For many Christians, Satan is a problem.  
They're those who believe they need deliverance from the devil, and they do, because you see,  
 As far as they can believe that Satan has them wept, they are wept.  
They believe they have been defeated by the devil.  
They are defeated.  
They believe the need deliverance.  
They do need it.  
Because you see, they let the devil defeat them.  
And that means  
 live in a defeated life, thinking the devil is so strong and powerful.  
But this is because of the lack of knowledge, the lack of knowledge, lack of spiritual understanding.  
Did you ever ask, why do many people have so much trouble with Satan?  
 Satan that's been defeated.  
Why do so many people have trouble with the devil?  
Many have never been taught.  
Then some others are too hard-headed.  
They've been taught but never accepting knowledge.  
Because you see, they believe more in their experiences than they do God.  
They believe their experiences.  
 They say, well, if I'm delivered, I will know I'm delivered.  
You see, they're going by their experiences.  
And all the time, they're talking about their experiences.  
They're talking about the nightmares.  
They're talking about the pain, the affliction that they suffer with.  
All the time, that's their story.  
How can a Christian  
 come out of that trouble.  
If he got himself into it, how does he come out of it?  
Simply by walking out.  
We say that sounds too simple.  
How can anybody walk out?  
But that's true.  
Just by walking out.  
 In the 14th chapter of the Book of Acts, you read from verse 7 down from Bible Theoruses how that the city called Leestra Paul was preaching the gospel of a man who was importing these feet and never walked from birth.  
And he was sitting on the ground, listening to the words of the Apostle Paul.  
And then Paul said, perceiving that the man had faith to be healed, he just had stand upright and died feet.  
That's all, didn't pray.  
He said, man, get up.  
 That's all he said.  
Get up.  
Now that's a man who never walked.  
He said, get up.  
And he got up.  
Get up.  
Because that's the gospel.  
The gospel is good news.  
It means if you couldn't walk, now you can.  
If you were poor, poverty is over.  
If you were defeated, defeat is over.  
Victory has come.  
 If you were in the dark, light has come.  
Hey, work out of the dark.  
Walk in the light, simple.  
But you know, like in many things, people think if it's too simple, it's not real.  
If it's too simple, it's not real.  
Gotta be hard to be true.  
If you told them to get a spotless, white cow,  
 of eight years old, exactly.  
A white cock with a red crown.  


  
Then, along with that, two young pigeons, pure white, bring them in, and we will cut them  
 and buzz you with their blood and you'll be all right.  
Don't do it.  
They'll be excited that they believe because they did something that was difficult.  
See, man always wants to buy God out, but doesn't work with him.  
Hallelujah.  
 Well, this gospel is not cheap, it's free.  
Amen.  
It's not cheap, but it's free.  
It's free.  
If you were told to do something about it, you could not have made it too hard, simply impossible.  
No one would have ever made it, but Jesus made it  
 and gave us the result.  
Hallelujah.  
That's why it's free, but it's not cheap.  
Glory, Hallelujah.  
So you now that you are away in the Word of God, that Satan has been defeated and that the victory has been given to you.  
Why don't you make a choice?  
 of the life you would live.  
Many of us here have made a choice.  
Am I right?  
Yeah, a lot of us have made a choice.  
And we are living victoriously.  
Amen?  
Glory to God.  
You know, whatever, whatever now and then we have to pull some of those who haven't understood what we're talking about yet, you know.  
We have to step back a little and pull them along with us.  
Yeah.  
Otherwise, I love it when I share among people who are spiritually minded.  
 It's exciting when you have such a meeting.  
But you know, every now and then, that those who don't understand it and who got to pull them along.  
Well, well, well.  
Romans chapter five.  
Book of Romans chapter number five.  
I love the word of God.  
I love the word of God.  
I love it, I love it, I love it.  
Somebody say, what kind of song is that?  
A great one, beautiful.  
 And the purpose is to make melody in your heart due to the Lord, amen?  
Glory to God.  
You know, sometimes you sing in the Spirit.  
It doesn't sound nice to someone who's listening.  
Because they say, what kind of tune is that?  
He says, it's a spiritual one.  
Hallelujah.  
Did you ever hear someone laughing and you thought, why is it laughing like that?  
 Then sound funny.  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,  


  
 I refuse to be sorry.  
Nobody's going to make me unhappy.  
Hahaha.  
Hallelujah.  
Romans chapter five.  
I'm reading to you from verse 17.  
For you by one man's offense.  
Talking about Adam.  
 If by one man's offense, death reigned like a king, that reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ.  
It's not talking about reigning in heaven, because you're not going to be reigning in heaven.  
That's nothing to reign over in heaven.  
You're reigning in the earth.  
 over circumstances that fail to recognize God.  
You reign over them.  
You triumph over them.  
You reign over devils and demons of hell.  
You reign over them.  
Hallelujah.  
That's what it's talking about.  
You reign over live circumstances.  
Look at it, it's right there.  
Even by one man's face, that reign by one,  
 He said, for if by one man's offense, that reign by one much more, they which receive a bonus of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign alive by Jesus Christ.  
I was talking about us.  
Then he says, they which receive a bonus of grace.  
And of the gift of righteousness, the gift of righteousness.  
So righteousness is a gift.  
That's another day's subject.  
But notice where he says, they shall reign in life.  
 reign in life.  
If you're waiting to feel righteous, you're wasting your time.  
The devil's gonna make sure you don't feel righteous.  
You know, sometimes when you fast and pray, you feel clean.  
And you want to like, I just thank the Lord, you know, you want to be stainless.  
 You'd wish every day would be like, yeah, don't until some fellow somewhere say something against you or to you or about you, something that makes you, and you feel like, forgive me Lord, now everything's sports.  
I mean, the forgive me pray as I've already started.  
You thought you were over that for a week.  
Your life has been since you fasted and prayed and read the Bible, it's just been thank you Jesus.  
 Thank you, Jesus.  
You have an act of forgiveness for some time now.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Until that telephone call came, and it was the wrong number, and you told the fellow the wrong number, he called you again.  
And you said, I said, it's wrong number.  
And he said, I'm sorry, I called you again.  
And he finally said, what's the matter with you?  
And then, oh, Lord, forgive me.  
Now he spoilt your day.  
 So you think you've dropped from your level of righteousness.  
Listen, you don't grow in righteousness.  
How are you listening?  
This is very important.  
Some people think they grow in righteousness.  
You cannot grow in righteousness.  
The righteousness of God that is given to you is a gift of God.  
You cannot increase in it.  
Your righteousness does not increase.  
 you can be more righteous in heaven than you are today.  
Because the righteousness you have is the righteousness of Jesus Christ given to you.  
Not your righteousness.  
Your own righteousness will not work.  
So Jesus obeyed God and got that righteousness and give it to you.  
 So you stand in the presence of God with the righteousness of God from Jesus Christ.  
So when God looks at you, he doesn't see your own righteousness.  
He sees the righteousness of Jesus Christ.  
And that's what qualifies you.  
 That's how you qualify to talk to him, to pray to him.  
You qualify not by what you did or didn't do, but by what he did, Jesus Christ.  
That's why we have boldness to pray.  
You know, one time somebody listened to another preacher pray, and when the preacher prayed, he said, in the name of Jesus, I command, he was in a, I command this to happen.  
I command, I can say, how can he just keep commanding?  
Does he know he's talking to God?  
 No, we're not commanding God.  
We're commanding with the power of God.  
How can you pray with so much boldness?  
How can you speak to God with so much audacity?  
How could you?  
Well, because of the righteousness of God.  
The righteousness of God gives you the sense of dominion.  
It gives you a sense of boldness.  
 and confidence in the presence of God.  
Hallelujah.  
Did you ever read in your Bible where Joshua commanded the sun and the moon to stand still until he warned the wall?  
Wonderful.  
 That's amazing.  
When Moses stretched his hand over the Red Sea and it spit wide open, the Bible says the water's congealed.  
The water's congealed on both sides.  
At the faith of a man,  
 What can we not do?  
I can't see it.  
I can't see what we can't do.  
No, no, no, no, no.  
Amazing.  
Hallelujah.  
God always wants to listen to us.  
Believe that.  
 God always wants to listen to us.  
He always wants to listen to us.  
Oh dear Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Can I read St.  
Mattie's gospel to you?  
St.  
Mattie chapter number 17.  
 Listen, Jesus wants you to live a triumphant life.  
Say that with me, a triumphant life.  
Every day.  
Now, there are people who don't believe that.  
They say, in life, there ought to be ups and downs.  
Who said so?  
Who said so?  
How did they know?  
They're reading other people's experiences and their own experiences, not because God said so.  
And they've never thought about it.  
 They've made their experiences and the experiences of other people, the rule for their life.  
They've seen life that are ups and downs.  
Who said?  
Because that's what they are acquainted with.  
That's all they've ever known.  
That's all they've ever been taught.  
The Word of God never said so.  
 They're like the Jews.  
When Jesus called God His Heavenly Father, they picked up stones, because nobody ever called God Father.  
Everybody before Jesus said, God.  
God, Adonai, El Shaddai, Jehovah Shalom,  
 Jehovah Nissi, Jehovah Rafeka, that's all the new.  
Nobody ever called him father.  
So when Jesus came and said father, they said, who's he talking about?  
God, our great God.  
How can you call him your father?  
Because the calling your father means you are his son.  
 And, and, you know, they understood the implication.  
And to say that you're his son is to say that you are in the same class with him, the same nature with him.  
They say, how dare you?  
You see it?  
Religion blinded them.  
So when you talk about having a great life, they say, no, no, no, no, no, no, because everybody's used to something different.  
 Say this with me, I'm a victim in Christ Jesus.  
I'm a success.  
I'm a success.  
Now you see, you can have that success mentality and you're finding working through you.  
I'm a success in everything, in everything.  
I'm a success.  
Come on, come on, I'm a success.  
Glory to God.  
All right, look at this.  
 Somebody was gospel chapter number 17, right?  
And Jesus here responds to a question from his disciples.  
Something happened.  
A man had brought his son to Jesus, and his son had been possessed of a devil, and he wanted Jesus to cast a demon out of his son, out of his little boy.  
 And when he got there, Jesus was not immediately present with his disciples.  
And so he brought the boy to the disciples then and complained and said, please, my little boy is often demanded of a demon who tries to destroy him.  
And oftentimes he puts him in the water or into the fire to kill him.  
Please help me cast the devil out.  
 And the disciples tried and tried and tried and shouted and begged and did everything and the demon didn't go.  
And just about that time, Jesus came.  
And he noticed that they were gathered around the disciples and somebody there with a little boy.  
And Jesus said, what's the matter?  
And the man stepped forward to Jesus and said, Master, I brought my boy to you.  
And to your disciples cast the demon out of you.  
And they haven't been able to do it.  
 So Jesus looked at them and said, oh, let's generation, how long shall I bear with you?  
So he said, bring the boy here.  
So the poor didn't close him.  
And then when the poor did walk closer to Jesus, right away, the demon began to manifest himself and to the boy down and was forming in the mouth.  
That was a sign of epilepsy.  
 So Jesus said to the man, for how long has this been?  
And he said, from a child, and explained to Jesus how the demon had thrown him into the fire and into the water to destroy him.  
And while he was saying that to Jesus, his voice broke.  
He said, Master, if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.  
 With tears in his eyes, Jesus said, if you can't believe, all things are possible to him that believe it.  
You see, the question wasn't whether Jesus could because he could.  
If we're going to have a miracle here on this boy, it's going to have to be you believing.  
So Jesus said, if you can't believe,  
 all things are possible to him who believes.  
And the men cried, Lord, I believe, help my own belief.  
But you see, he was positive somewhere and said, I believe.  
And Jesus commanded the devil to come out of the boy and suddenly  
 The demon threw him down as one dead and the people thought he was dead.  
They said, oh, he's dead.  
He's killed him.  
And Jesus waited for a moment and let everybody believe he's dead.  
So they thought he was dead.  
No, Jesus said, come on, picked him up and restored him to his father.  
Now, you know, all that time the disciples were very disturbed.  
 You know, it didn't leave their minds.  
So when they were alone with Jesus, they came to him and said, Master, you know, we did everything we saw you do.  
We said everything we heard you say.  
And we noticed you didn't quite see anything different from what we said.  
I mean, if he had said something different, they would have said, oh, that's what we didn't say.  
I said,  
 We said, everything you said, we did everything you did, and they didn't come out.  
Why couldn't we cast him out?  
I love Jesus.  
Look them right in the eye and gave them his answer.  
Let's read verse 20.  
You're ready now.  
And Jesus said unto them, because of your unbelief.  
That's the problem with many people.  
Because of your unbelief.  
 Why didn't I get that business?  
I prayed.  
I believed.  
Why didn't I get it?  
I even saw the seed.  
Why didn't I get it?  
Because of the unbelief, somebody said, no, no, no, no.  
If anybody's going to tell me I was unbelieving, I'm not going to accept it.  
Because I prayed.  
I fasted.  
I confessed it.  
I said everything that was to say.  
I said everything that was to say.  
And I can't believe I didn't get it because of unbelief.  
I was not unbelief.  
Hey, what is unbelief?  
What's unbelief?  
 How could Jesus say to this man, because of your unbelief?  
You think that was easy on them?  
They've been with Jesus alone.  
That's in all the miracles sprouted this time.  
They heard his messages.  
How could they be unbelieving?  
Charge them with unbelief?  
No.  
No, Jesus must be wrong.  
What do you think?  
Jesus must be wrong this time, huh?  
 Could he be wrong?  
Nobody knew like Jesus what faith was.  
Nobody knew like Jesus what unbelief was.  
He said it.  
He said it.  
He said it because of your unbelief.  
Somebody said, I've asked God to take it away.  
I really, really, really, really believe.  
 I even sued my best seed ever, but it hasn't gone.  
How did you know it hasn't gone?  
Because it affected me last night.  
Uh-oh.  
And what did you say when it happened?  
It hasn't gone.  
Uh-oh.  
See that?  
How did the disciples know the demon didn't go?  
Because they're waiting to see him go.  
 And as long as he was forming in the mouth, they kept on talking.  
Come out!  
Come out!  


  
 So I said, I believe, I believe in the name of Jesus, I've gotten that job.  
In fact, my letter is waiting for me right now.  
Father, I'm dressing up and I'm going there to collect it right now in the name of Jesus.  
In the end, he got to the office and they said, yes, what do you want?  
I'm here to collect my letter.  
What letter?  
My appointment letter.  
 I have it in Jesus' name.  
Jesus' name.  
Ow.  
I'm not living here till I get my letter.  
In that case, hold on.  
Then they call the police.  
This dude out of here.  
Then take him out, and then father, I acted my fate.  
I don't know.  
If this is not fate, I don't know what fate is.  
Yes, you don't!  
 I tried everything.  
You see that?  
Why is he feeling bad now?  
Because of the result he got.  
You see that?  
Meaning that he didn't expect any resistance.  
 You know, the general visual came out of Egypt and they were headed for the promised land.  
And now Moses says, we need 12 people to go over there to the land of Canaan and find out whether or not that land really flows with milk and honey.  
We'll like to know.  
And they say, yay!  
There are houses.  
You never have to build your house.  
You just get into a house and it's yours.  
 I mean, they were so happy, everything was there.  
They were happy and waiting, then the 12 spies went.  
Beautiful houses, yes.  
It flows with milk and honey.  
Mm-hmm.  
Then they saw the giants, the sons of Enoch.  
Big, huge!  


  
They said, no, we'll go back to all Moses, but let him know we're not coming here.  
 And they went back.  
And Moses was happy to receive them and called a whole congregation.  
Let's hear the news.  
And the 12 spies came out.  
Brethren, we've been there.  
Hey!  
Did you see the land you're holding?  
10 last hours to land.  
Everybody just wanted to hear milk and honey in the land.  
 They say, yeah, surely the land flows with milk and honey.  
Everybody was, oh, and some of them were spinning round.  
Then they said, hold on, hold on, hold on.  
Yeah, it flows with milk and honey.  
We haven't told you the rest of the story.  
What else?  
Let's go.  
Let's go.  
Hold on.  
We saw something else.  
 And that's the one that we are not happy about because, you see, we don't like to be deceived.  
Moses actually told us about the milk and honey, which we found.  
But he never suggested to us that there was any possibility of seeing the giants that we saw.  
We never saw such huge fellows in all our lives.  
And the people were,  
 Listen, look, they were so big, running our own eyes.  
We were as grasshoppers.  
And in their eyes, we were also as grasshoppers.  
Sorry, we cannot take that bad.  
And the congregation started weeping.  
Moses, why did you deceive us?  
Why?  
 Two men stood out of the 12 and said, brethren, if God is with us, we will be able to take the land and we will drive out the giants.  
You know what the congregation said?  
Shut up.  
Didn't you hear that very many?  
They shut them up.  
 See, faith doesn't think of the process.  
Faith has focused on the result.  


  
Did you hear that?  
You know what Joshua and Caleb said?  
They said, look, those giants shall be bred for us.  
They shall be bred for us.  
 or eat them up.  
Let's go up at once."  
The congregation said, never, never.  
We're moving.  
That's the way many people are today, and they think that is faith.  
Faith doesn't chicken out because of the result, the temporary result.  
 Okay, I believe, I've been healed.  
I just want to go to the doctor for a proof.  
So he goes to the doctor for a proof, whoever's in in there.  
Then he, they say, oh, you sure you're all right?  
This is, yeah, I'm all right.  
You sure you're breathing fine?  
I'm breathing fine, yeah?  
Look,  
 You are worse now than the last test.  
Then he goes, you sure?  
No, sir, it can't be.  
I say, look at it.  
Can you read this day?  
Yeah.  
It's worse now than before.  
We told you you need surgery, the earlier the better.  
So go and make up your mind.  
 Then he goes, Father.  
Now when he was coming to the hospital, he was rejoicing in the name of Jesus.  
We have the victory.  
Now he's going back and says, Father.  


  
Now he sees himself in the hospital.  
He sees himself admitted.  
He sees himself being caught open.  
 I reject it.  


  
I reject it.  
And the more he rejects it, the more he sees it.  
So he wonders what faith really is.  
 Because he thought this was fate.  
He thought it was fate because he proclaimed it and went to the doctor and was expecting something nice.  
And it didn't happen.  
He might have even done it three times.  
And the doctor was now finally angry and said, why do you keep coming?  
I've told you this thing is worse.  
Let me tell you something.  
Nobody can know fate.  
 like the knowledge you can have in your spirit.  
Because faith is a response of the human spirit to the Word of God.  
It's not a feeling.  
It's a response of the human spirit to the Word of God.  
And don't let the circumstances of your life be dictated by what others say, but by what the Word of God says.  
 what the word of God says.  
And you should be unshaken by the temporary result, unshaken.  
In faith, you set your focus on the result that the word gives to you.  
You stay your mind on the word.  
The Bible says, that would keep him in perfect peace.  
 Shalom, shalom, the peace of prosperity.  
Thou would keep him in perfect peace.  
Whose mind is stayed on thee?  
Stayed on thee, for he trusted indeed.  
So you stay your mind.  
You stay because your mind can wander from place to place.  
So you stay your mind on what God gives you.  
You stay your mind.  
And every day you set a time  
 to focus your attention on it.  
Every day, give yourself the picture of the results you expect by meditation.  
And then like we talked about the three stages of meditation, you remember?  
What's the final stage?  
Hagar.  
What happens there?  
You roar.  
 At that point, it just dawns on your spirit, and nobody can take it from you.  
See, at the beginning stages, you're meditating on it.  
See, I'm working on something.  
See, faith may not create it for you at once.  
It can create it over a period of time.  
It could be hours, days, weeks, months, or even years, depending on what the case is.  
You set your mind on it.  
 From time to time, you create that picture in your mind and drop it in your spirit.  
You see, you create it in your mind because your imaginative power is your creative ability.  
Are you hearing me?  
So you use your mind to imagine it and drop it in your spirit and your spirit will create it for you.  
And once you have it strong in your spirit, it will come out in your words.  
 until you live in the rim and the reality of that which you have created within your spirit.  
And then nobody can take it away from you because it's now so real.  
It's there, it's real.  
The circumstances may lie to you, but that's what they are now, they're lying.  
Now you know, you know that you know that you know you've got it.  
 Outwardly it may not look so.  
But now you know you've got it.  
You know.  
You know.  
Now it will be revealed in your prayer, the way you talk about it.  
You're not going to be asking God for it anymore.  
You've transcended that.  
Because now you know you got it.  
Faith knows.  
Because faith is evidence.  
 You see that?  
Faith is evidence.  
It's proof.  
When it's faith, it's proof.  
You can't have faith and come back and say, I don't know why I didn't get it because faith doesn't know it didn't get it because faith got it and faith had the proof.  
 How could you have had faith and come back to say, I don't know why I didn't get it?  
The moment you can think, why didn't I get it?  
You should know you didn't have faith.  
Because faith couldn't, couldn't, didn't get it.  
 You get it?  
Because faith is the substance, substance.  
That means proof.  
Presence, present evidence.  
Faith is the title deed.  
Don't you understand?  
The title deed.  
Don't see realities.  
That means when it's faith, it means you have the proof that you have it.  
Now, if you come back and say, I don't know why it didn't work.  
It didn't work.  
 I thought you said you had evidence.  
You mean your evidence was a lie.  
If it was a lie, it was not faith.  
You see that?  
Faith is the evidence!  
Proof!  
How could you have a proof of something and say, I don't know why it didn't work?  
It didn't work?  
I thought you said you had evidence that it worked.  
You see?  
 That fellow didn't know what fate was.  
He was living in unbelief and thought he had faith.  
You see there?  
Faith is proof.  
Faith is evidence.  
Faith is substance.  
I got it.  
I got it.  
I know, I know, I know, I know.  
I know.  
 I know I'm living in the reality of it.  
I know, I know, I know.  
Glory to God, I know.  
Thank you, Lord Jesus, I know, I know.  
And I give praise to God.  
Father, I thank you.  
In the name of the Lord Jesus, see, I'm not praying to make it happen because I already have it.  
See that?  
I'm not trying to make God do it because I have proof that I have it.  
That's faith.  
Can you see it?  
 Hey, pit the picture, hop the image, drop it in your spirit, let your spirit create it for you.  
And once your spirit has it made, you got it.  
Now you can walk around saying, I have it, I shall do.  
I'm a successful life.  
Man, oh man, I'm a successful life.  
I'm telling you, I'll never be defeated.  
See that?  
 I'll never be defeated.  
It's impossible.  
I'm a victor for life.  
Oh, yeah, sure.  
Come on.  
Come on.  
I'll never be broke in my life.  
Never.  
There's no somebody that said, ah.  
If something's your opponent and your broker, you change.  
 Change, you don't understand this thing.  
Let me ask you a question.  
Have you ever thought about one day you might just wake up and discover you are now a girl?  
Does it go through your mind?  
That maybe one day you just sleep and then you just wake up.  
You that you are a man.  
You just suddenly, I mean you are a man.  
You have maybe three, five children.  
Suddenly you just wake up and find you are now a girl.  
No, does it go through your mind?  
That it might happen.  
 If that can't go through your mind, neither should this go through your mind about failure.  
Listen, listen.  
See, you can have a weapon and you don't know how to use it.  
You're not dangerous.  
And even if you know how to use it, you don't have the guts to use it.  
You are not dangerous.  
But if you got it,  
 They know how to use it, and how the gods do.  
You're short dangers.  
If you have money in the bank, lots of money, and you don't know about it, you don't change your life.  
You've got to know about it to be able to use it.  
If you don't know, you live like you never had it.  
But if you know,  
 You must have the faith to use it, the willingness to use it.  
Otherwise, it still would mean nothing of what uses it if somebody gave you a check of some $100 million.  
All right?  
And somebody say, ah!  
That seems far away.  
No, it's not far away from you, brother.  
 Now you say, you have this $100 million check.  
Somebody gave you a check.  
You have options, what to do with it.  
You can take a picture of it, and enlarge it, and put it on your wall, and every day say, Father, I thank you.  
It won't change your life.  


  
You can hold it, just frame the check, and take it everywhere.  
So look what I got.  
 It don't change your life.  
That check is a promissory note.  


  
So you got to go to the bank and get the money out and make it yours.  
And use it.  
That's what some of us found out.  
We found out so much had laid aside for us by Jesus Christ.  
 Some others couldn't find out.  
Didn't even care to find out.  
Some of us found out.  
And when we found out, say, hey, man, that means we can never be poor.  
Oh, yeah, you can't have this much and be poor.  
Yeah, I'll never be poor in my life.  
Never.  
With all of this, oh, Lord Jesus, life on earth is made and life in heaven is made.  
How could I be poor anymore?  
It's a choice now.  
Lord,  


  
 You make a choice.  
Father, I'm only asking you for just one little thing.  
See, you're still asking for just one little thing.  
I've been asking you for two weeks.  
You haven't given it to me.  
When were you?  
Oh Lord, please wait.  
Another one you sent Father in the name of Jesus.  
Thank you.  
I'm so rich.  
Oh, glory to God.  
I receive.  
 I receive.  
You want to make a trip.  
Father, I receive all the money I need for this trip in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Amen.  
Praise God.  
Amen.  
And you go.  
That's all.  
I receive.  
I receive.  
Praise God.  
Amen.  
You've got a project you're working on and you need finances.  
Is it fathering the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?  
I receive all the money I need for this project in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
I got it.  
I got it.  
I got it.  
Amen.  
Praise God.  
Amen.  
You go your way.  
 Then don't worry.  
You know, some people worry along with it.  
The Bible says, Castin' all your cares.  
Do that.  
Yeah.  
Castin' all your cares.  
Up on him, for he carrot for you.  
Shout him in somebody.  
 Oh, glory to God!  
Man, how am I?  
Come on, square your shoulders.  
Say, I'm a child of the king.  
I'm a child of the king.
