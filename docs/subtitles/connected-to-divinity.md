title: Connected to Divinity
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining, and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 Our sonship with God qualifies us for an extraordinary life of greatness and continuous growth.  
When God blesses you, His blessing works on everything that concerns you.  
Your understanding of this truth will escalate you to a whole new level.  
So whether they're my clothes, my shoes, my thighs, anything that connects with me is an item of blessing.  
 Listen to Pastor Chris as he communicates these thoughts in this life-changing teaching message.  
That would increase my greatness.  
And he's increasing my greatness.  
And this year, especially, he's increasing my greatness in a significant way.  
God bless you as you listen.  
Thank you for your love.  
Thank you for your grace.  
 Thank you for your kindness.  
Thank you for the power of the Holy Spirit.  
That works within us.  
The worship is known like you.  
Your glory is excellent.  


  
 And all the meaning is yours.  
Thank you for the victory in Christ Jesus.  
Thank you.  
That your kingdom is alive in us.  
 Your word is truth.  
It worships you.  
There's no like you.  
Thank you, Father.  
Thank you, our hearts are full of your presence, of your love.  
 What is this here for us?  
Really.  
Can you turn into your Bible?  


  
 During the 31st night service, we read from Isaiah chapter 60, right?  
And we read the whole chapter.  
Very inspiring indeed.  


  
 The message given to us there was encapsulated in the last verse.  


  
Can we take a look at it?  


  
 The last verse of Isaiah chapter 60.  
Have you found it?  
He says, a little one shall become a thousand.  
And a small one, a strong nation.  
Did you notice?  
He didn't say a little one is a thousand.  
 is that a little one shall become.  
It does spell of growth, change.  
Right?  
Change.  
Going from one level to another, a little one shall become a thousand.  
That means  
 When a little one is said to be little, you're talking about a thousand.  
Can you imagine that?  
For example, the Bible tells us some real beautiful things.  
There are many Christians who don't believe  
 in prosperity.  


  
Do you know that?  
But they seek it all the time.  


  
They seek it all the time.  
But the Bible is replete with information on  
 the power of God, the glory of God, the honor, the majesty, the splendor of our Heavenly Father and His will to share what is God with His children.  
That's the basis of prosperity, not because we are seeking prosperity,  
 But because the truth is we are children of this true God.  
If we weren't, we shouldn't think of prosperity.  
The truth is we actually belong to Him.  
The problem between those who are the deference between those Christians  
 who believe in it and walk in it, and those who don't believe in it and criticize it, is that one group believes in their true connection with God.  
And if he's real, you don't need to seek prosperity.  
 It just works in you.  
Now the other guy doesn't understand that.  
He thinks you're seeking it and you're trying to get it.  
And so because he's been seeking it and trying to get it and couldn't get it, so he criticizes it.  
But there's no human being who doesn't want to prosper.  
There's none.  
They all go to work.  
They all want to work.  
 They are sick to improve themselves.  
They all want to take care of their families and loved ones.  
They all want to help other people.  
Every human person wants to be able to do something not only for himself, but for other people.  
That's prosperity.  
Every human being that's not sick in the head wants to do that.  


  
 But when they try and it doesn't work, then they think if it's working for anybody else, that person must be doing something different, something wrong.  
Because I'm good and it's not working for me.  
Can you see it?  
So that's a problem.  
And so they've got to try to pull you back to where they're at.  
 But if you understand the scripture, for example, when I read the Bible, it's difficult for me to think differently.  
I find it difficult to accept something that's different from what's in the book.  


  
It's difficult for me to not accept divine health.  
 Because the book says so in so many places and so many ways, I'll have to be blind and stupid to not accept it.  
If I didn't read the Bible, maybe I would accept what others say about it.  
But because I've read it and I keep reading it,  
 I find it difficult to not accept what it says.  
And so I can't listen to someone who claims to have read the Bible because I'm reading it too.  
I can't accept it just because you said you read it.  
I wasn't there when you read it.  
I don't know that you read it.  
 You claim to read it, but if it's not working in your life, I can accept that you read it.  
It doesn't matter how many degrees you've got on the Bible.  
You understand that?  
Anybody can say he's read the Bible.  
That doesn't mean he's done it.  
That doesn't mean he even understood it.  
What I want to see is, is his life producing what it talks about?  
Because I'm reading the Bible.  
 And I find it hard to not accept it.  
So just because somebody is religious and he says, you know, he looks like he knows it.  
And then he says, you know, the Bible doesn't say this.  
Or the Bible says this.  
You know, a lot of people just listen to somebody else.  
They don't know what our knowledge is to.  
That's why in this ministry, we make the effort to show you the scriptures.  
 We make the effort to guide you through the scriptures, not just claim the Bible says.  
And we want you to read it for yourself.  
We want you to see it for yourself and understand it for yourself.  
So you can make your own conclusions.  
I want to show you something in the Bible.  
Let's just look at this.  
You know, back in those days, they use silver and gold, all right?  
 as legal tender.  
And even today, money is still measured in gold, all right?  
Even though we use different currencies, but it's all referenced to gold.  
But I want you to turn to First Kings in chapter number 10,  
 You remember the man called Solomon.  
Do you remember him?  
There was something that God said.  
This was the young man who prayed one day, and God said to him, what do you want me to do for you?  
And he said, give me wisdom and understanding.  
All right?  
If you read from some translations, it would say wisdom and knowledge.  
 The real word was understanding.  
He asked for wisdom and understanding.  
And so he could lead the people.  
He had just become king.  
 And God said, he asked for the right thing.  
And because of that, I'm going to make you so wise.  
No one can compare with you.  
I'll give you wisdom.  
Then God said, I'm going to make you rich.  
You didn't ask for riches, but I'm going to make you rich and richer than anybody else.  
He said, I'll make you rich.  
God said, so to this young man.  
And then he said, I'll also, I'll also subdue your enemies.  
 And so Solomon was a great king.  
God made him great.  
Now let's see what happened here.  
This part of the book is about how successful he was in some of the things that happened with him because of what God did for him.  
All right, first king's in chapter number 10.  
I want us to begin with verse 23.  
 This is, it's a result of what God said to the man.  
You ready?  
Okay, verse 23, first king, chapter 10.  
Can you all read it for me?  
Want to go.  


  
Did you see that?  
Because God blessed him.  
He was God who blessed him.  
He wasn't a devil.  
 So the Bible says, King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.  
Because God made him wise.  
Look at verse 24.  
And all the earth sought to Solomon.  
Everybody wanted to hear him.  
All the earth sought to Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.  
 And they brought every man he's present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armor, and spices, horses, and mirrors, a right year by year, every year.  
Can you imagine that?  
This guy became so right.  
Everybody wanted to hear.  
 words of wisdom from Solomon.  
And the Bible says it came from so many different nations just to hear what he had to say.  
Think about that.  
That's wonderful, isn't it?  
That's wonderful.  
That's wonderful.  
God said so.  
God said so, and it happened.  
 He said, so, and it happened.  
Now, wonderful.  
Let's look at verse 27.  
I want you to read verse 27.  
Want to go.  


  
Did you see that?  
Read it again.  


  
 It says, and the king made Selva to be in Jerusalem as stones.  
Now, I'm ready to hear from a newer version.  
It says, the king made Selva as common in Jerusalem as stones.  


  
You know the men of that?  
They were so wealthy.  
 The Bible actually tells us you studied a little more.  
It tells us that silver was not reckoned in the days of Solomon.  
Why everybody was so blessed.  
Everybody had become so big.  
The country, the whole nation had become so blessed.  


  
That's amazing.  
Okay.  
 So let's go back to our scripture.  
We're studying in Isaiah chapter 60 and we were in verse 22.  
Isaiah chapter 16 verse 22.  
So can you read that now?  


  
A little one shall become a thousand and a small one.  
 a strong nation, a little one shall become a thousand.  
And I like the fact that he said, a little one shall become a thousand.  
And when God blesses you, his blessing works on everything that concerns you.  
I tell people I grow in everything.  
 And I grew pretty fast.  
I say, everything about me grows real quick.  
And it's true.  
You say, why?  
Well, I'm the seed of Abraham.  
I know who I am.  
I'm the seed of Abraham.  
You know, if you've read some history,  
 They talk about nobility.  
In almost every nation, they've got some story in their history about medieval kings.  
They've got almost every region in the world has some story about some aristocracy, some nobility.  
 in their nation.  
Some people with some names that they say were descendants of some monarch or of some great person.  
And if you were a descendant of such a person, if you were in that family, they recognized you as some noble person, of noble birth.  
 You're special.  
You're from a great family.  
So they've got some family, some recognized families in different societies because there was some great person that made a great name in that family.  
You can trace the greatness of that family to a particular person who became rich, powerful, wealthy.  
And so everybody in that society recognized that family for who they are.  
 Oh, he's a prince.  
Oh, she's a princess.  
Oh, she's the daughter of King so and so.  
She's at the same end of the, they are that family.  
Every society's got something like that.  
So it's something we should be pretty used to, something we should understand.  
Why do we have difficulty  
 understanding that God and he made a man named Abraham so great, blessed him and said, your seed will inherit the nations.  
And he says, your seed would be a blessing to all the nations of the earth.  
 He didn't say, your seed will be seeking blessings from the nations of the world.  
He didn't say that.  
Right from when I was in the secondary school, I began to see this kind of truths in the Bible.  
I began to say, it doesn't matter which country I go.  
I'll bless them.  
I have got something to give them.  
I can't go to any nation to try to get something.  
I was a teenager and I was talking like that.  
 I said, I can't go to any country and try to get something from them.  
Why?  
I knew I was a seed of Abraham.  
I knew where I'd come from.  
I didn't think the world had anything to give me.  
No, the world belonged to Abraham and I'm his seed.  
Which means all of these blessings belong to me.  
I know who I am.  


  
 And I said, I'll never be poor.  
I'll never be broke.  
The seed of Abraham.  
I know who I am.  
Which means everything that I do is blessed.  
That means there is an invocation of power to make good in everything that concerns me.  
That's an invocation of power.  
 to make it good, whether I was going to be a shoe-shiner, whether I was going to be a tailor, whether I was going to be a cow wash, and make any difference to me.  
I didn't care what I was going to do in this world.  
I was going to be the best.  
I knew it.  
So I never had to discuss what I was going to be anymore.  
Did you realize I didn't think I was going to be preaching full time like this?  
 What I thought was I was going to do anything and then I'll preach.  
I'll preach because I said, I'm a student, but I'm a preacher.  
I'm a full-time Christian.  
So I'll preach the word.  
So in the same way that I'm a student, whatever job, whatever business I was going to do, I will do it.  
So I set up my first office when I was two from the university.  
I set up my first office.  
 And I started some business.  
But I was holding camp meetings.  
I was holding crusades.  
I was preaching in churches.  
I just thought that was what I was going to do.  
But then I had lesser and lesser time for the business.  
I had to give it up.  
Praise God.  
 But I always thought I was connected to a successful victorious and almighty God, Alleluia.  
So what he just saw, he said, a little one shall become a thousand.  
That means growth.  
And that means, I said, when God blesses you, he blesses everything that concerns you.  
That includes  
 Think about it.  
Whether it's your money, whether it's your clothes.  
Think about this.  
The Bible says handkerchiefs and aprons were taken from the body of Paul.  
And when it got to the sick, they got healed because they touched handkerchiefs and aprons that touched the body of Paul.  
So there wasn't an onion on the clothes.  
 And then the Bible tells us, even Jesus, somebody touched the hem of his gammon, God healed.  
And then the Bible says, all men sought to touch him.  
They did it and they got healed, meaning the blessing.  
They're not in God on his clothes.  
What do you think those clothes were supposed to produce?  
That means whatever I had would produce more by attracting more clothes.  
So always the care of anything that God gives me.  
 because they're not enemies on them.  
So whether they're my clothes, my shoes, my thighs, anything that connects with me is an item of blessing.  
It's got the power to attract more.  
And so when I receive money, the same thing happens to my money.  
It's got the power to attract my money.  
My money is never, it's never out of value.  
It's always got value.  
 So it produces more.  
It attracts more money.  
So anything that's connected to me is connected to the anointing.  
And that anointing pulls more to it.  
Because I'm blessed.  
Say I'm blessed.  
See, when you understand you're blessed, your life takes on a new meaning, the way you think, the way you talk, the way you walk among others.  
 And the blessings will continue to grow if you're consistent.  
You've got to be consistent.  
You can do it this week and then do something different next week.  
You can talk like this this week and talk opposite direction next week.  
No, that's not going to work.  
The Bible says an unstable man is unstable in all his ways.  
So in his way of prosperity, he'll be unstable as well.  
In his road of greatness, he'll be unstable as well.  
So you've got to be consistent.  
Consistent.  
 Because he says, a little one shall become a thousand.  
So you're going to keep growing, maintain your composure, continue in your consistency.  
You get there.  
And a small one, a strong nation.  
We're going to do big things around the world.  
But we're few.  
But we're there.  
 I was taking some time to get there.  
But there was a consistency, not up and down, up and down, no.  
I don't believe in up and down.  
There are a lot of people who believe in up and down.  
I don't believe in up and down.  
I go up only and forward.  
I've got a consistency in my life.  
Now, I always go.  
I allow no distractions.  
I've set my sail.  
It doesn't matter what tries to pull me this way or that way.  
God said, turn not to the right hand or to the left.  
 So, pull me this way.  
No, I'm not going to look your way.  
What about this?  
No, I'm not going to look your way.  
Doesn't matter what problems, what distractions.  
You know, no, I've set my focus.  
I'm on the goal.  
And I'm going for it.  
Praise God.  
So God said he will hasten it in his time.  
It's God who's going to make it work.  
 Hallelujah.  
Say, it's my year of greatness.  
All right, one more thought.  
One more thought.  
You ready for this?  
Psalm 71, Psalm 71 and verse 21.  
What do you have there?  
Can you read it out?  
Want to go.  
Thou shalt increase my greatness.  
Hallelujah.  
You see,  
 He shall what?  
And what?  
Come fought me on every side.  
Now I want to give you the sense of what is telling you.  
He says thou shall increase my greatness.  
David was already a great king.  
But he knew that in greatness there are levels.  
So he says thou shall increase my greatness.  
 He was already great.  
He was the seed of Abraham.  
He knew it.  
And if you were the seed of Abraham, you were great.  
Because God said, I'll make you great.  
And you're seed after you.  
That's what he said to Abraham.  
So greatness was in him.  
And everyone who came from Abraham was great.  
So we talk about those who were born great.  
 All right?  
Those who have greatness bestowed on them and those who achieved greatness, three ways of becoming great.  
You're either born great or you have greatness bestowed on you or you have achieved greatness.  
Well, I was born great.  
See, I was born great.  
When I was born again, I was born into this wonderful  
 family of God connected with God Almighty and the kingdom of God.  
I'll never be broke in my life.  
She got to say it.  
Say, I'll never be broke in my life.  
So I said, man, I'm broke.  
I know it.  
Well, you're looking at the wrong thing.  
You're looking at the wrong thing.  
 Don't live your life according to what you see and what you touch.  
That's living your life like an animal.  
You're a spirit being.  
You're not an animal.  
Your life is not the pain and on the outward body.  
Don't live like that.  
Listen, you're human spirit, not a human body.  
You got a spirit that's now connected to God, to the divine nature.  
 Don't live according to your sight.  
Don't live according to your senses.  
Your senses are limited.  
All you see is not all there is.  
There's more to life than what you see than what you feel.  
Thou would increase my greatness, and he's increasing my greatness.  
In this year, especially, he's increasing my greatness.  
 in a significant way.  
See, it doesn't matter what job you do, make it great.  
 You understand?  
Because you're great.  
There's greatness in you.  
You're royalty.  
You see, you're royalty.  
You're not an ordinary person, you're royalty.  
Imagine this.  
Imagine if you found out that one of those cleaners in your office is actually the son of the, let's say the above Lagos.  
 You found out he was the son of the Abba of Lagos.  
You say, look at that guy.  
Do you know that guy is a prince?  
They're not talking about it.  
They may not come to him to tell him that somebody found out.  
He said, do you know that guy is a prince?  
I said, that guy who is that cleaner is what?  
He's a prince.  
What do you mean prince?  
He's the son of the Abba of Lagos.  
 So why is it cleaning?  
That's what goes through your mouth.  
So why is it cleaning?  
Because you think, he's the son of the author.  
So why is it cleaning?  
Why is it cleaning?  
Now, even though he's still cleaning, you know, with due respect.  
You see, now you may come there and say, hello, sir.  
You've never greeted him, sir.  
 You've been his immediate boss, the chief of the cleaners.  
You've been running him around the place because you are also from, you know, you know the obba that he is big.  
So now you come to him and say, Elusa, because this cleaner might change your destiny.  
Imagine you're looking for another job.  
You even know he's a cleaner.  
You're coming to him to say, is there anything you can do for me?  
You're his boss.  
 Why are you coming to Him?  
Because He has what?  
Connections.  
You see it?  
He's got connections.  
That's the point.  
You're no longer looking at the fact that He's cleaning.  
That's His business.  
If He wants to clean up His business, I want His connections.  
Hallelujah.  
That's what it's like.  
That's why people come to us.  
They believe we've got some connection with the Divine.  
So they say, can you pray for me?  
 See, can you pray for me?  
Can you talk to God for me?  
You know what it is?  
The talk to God?  
They've been talking to God themselves.  
They're not sure.  
He's hearing them.  
So they said, well, can you talk to God for me?  
What is it you want?  
Now, dear Lord, they want, can I write them down?  
Because they believe when you talk to God, you hear you.  
 Talk to him on my behalf.  
So you represent him, right?  
In a matter of time.  
God bless you.  


  
Talk to the Lord by yourself.  
Thank him.  
Thank him.  
Thank him for his word.  
 May His spirit rest upon you and strengthen you and guide you in the way that you should go and bless every work of your hands.  
In the name of Jesus, worship Him, thank Him, worship Him.  
Thank you for listening.  
We trust that you've been blessed.
