title: October 2022 â€“ The Month of Peace
---
 St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 14, verse 27, peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world give us, give I unto you, let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.  
Can we go to chapter 16, same book, and verse 33,  
 These things I've spoken unto you that in me, he might have peace.  
In the world, he shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer.  
I have overcome the world."  
In Philippians 4, from verse number 4, the word declares and instructs us.  
 Rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice.  
Next verse.  
Lecture moderation be known unto all me and the Lord is at hand.  
Be careful for nothing.  
But in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving,  
 let your request be made known under God.  
I want us to read this from the new national version.  
It says, do not be anxious about anything.  
Do not be anxious about anything.  
But in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanks given,  
 present your requests to God.  
Do not be anxious about anything.  
Those are strong words.  
God doesn't want us to be anxious.  
Have no anxiety about anything.  
Anything.  
When you find yourself,  
 Having anxiety, you're walking away from the Word of God.  
You're walking into Satan's arena where you can take advantage of you.  
The word says, don't be anxious about anything.  
But in everything, by prayer and petition, we thanksgiving, present your request to God.  
 That's all you got to do.  
Don't be worried.  
What present your request?  
What do you want?  
Instead of complaining about the situation, is it worrying about the situation or the circumstances?  
Present your request.  
What do you want?  
Look at the next verse.  
And the peace of God  
 which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  
That's remarkable.  
Let's read from verse six into verse seven.  
Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your request to God  
 And the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  
Look at the next verse.  
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent,  
 Or praise worthy.  
Think about such things.  
It's told you what kind of things to think about.  
A lot of people who worry themselves into a frenzy.  
Worry themselves until demons take advantage of them.  
But the word of God tells you what to think about.  
It tells you how to guide your mind.  
It says, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right,  
 Whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent, or praiseworthy, think about such things.  
These are the kind of things to think about.  
If it falls out of this, don't lend your mind to such thoughts.  
And look at the next verse.  
 Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me, put it into practice and the God of peace will be with you.  
The God of peace.  
He calls out God, the God of peace.  
That's who he is.  
And the God of peace will be with you.  
 Wonderful.  
Wonderful.  
You know, this man of October is a mound of peace.  
There's a mound of peace.  
And this is commanding peace.  
This is peace from God.  
 A lot of God's people have never given attention to what the word says about peace and how to live in peace, not only just to experience it, but to carry that atmosphere everywhere you go.  
There are those who live in chaos.  
 their minds are constantly troubled.  
And yet the Bible tells us we're not supposed to live that way.  


  
When you look at the word, the scriptures, you can have an understanding of how God thinks.  
Let me show you these verses.  


  
 Psalm 122 verse six.  
He says, pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  
They shall prosper that love thee.  
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  
They shall prosper that love thee.  
Look at the next verse.  
Peace be within thy wars.  
 That's the prayer for Jerusalem.  
Peace be within thy wars, and prosperity within thy palaces.  


  
Read it from the new national version, from verse six.  
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  
May those who love you be secure,  
 May those who love you, who love Jerusalem, be secure.  
May there be peace within your wars and security within your cieladares.  
That's a prayer.  
Let there be peace within your borders.  


  
So is God only concerned about Jerusalem?  
 Because of Jeremiah, chapter 29, verse number seven.  
He says, He then seek the peace of the city, whether I've caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the Lord for it.  
From the peace thereof shall ye have peace.  
Read the game from the New International Version,  
 like we just did.  
It is also seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I've carried you into exile.  
Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prosperous, you too will prosper.  
That's wonderful.  
They were even in exile.  
And they didn't get into that place by choice.  
They didn't go into exile by choice.  
They were carried away.  
 They were taken there as captives.  
And yet God said, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which you've been carried as exiles.  
And it says, free.  
 to the Lord for it because if it prosperous, you too will prosper.  
So God wants peace for your city and it's for your sake.  
 He wants peace for your city and it's for your sake.  
There's something even better what I want to show you.  
These two portions of the Bible that I just read to you is to show you God's thinking.  
God's mind about peace and rest in your city, in your nation and around the world.  


  
 Let me read to you from St.  
Matthew's Gospel, chapter 10, from verse 11.  
I want you to follow this carefully.  
These are the words of Jesus.  
And into whatsoever city or town you shall enter, inquire, who in it is worthy.  
And thereby till you go thence, till you leave there.  
 And when you come into a house, salute it.  
Do you love the word of God?  
So enlightening, so different.  
This is when you come into a house.  
Salute, give greetings.  
 He goes on to say, next words, and if the house be worthy, let your peace, let your peace, yeah, yeah, because you're a child of God.  
You're a child.  
Think about this.  
He's called the God of peace.  
If you are his kid, if you are his son, you are a son of peace.  
That means you carry peace with you.  
You've got peace.  
 So he says, and if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it.  
But if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.  
Return to you?  
Yes, because you gave it in the greeting.  
When you said, peace be unto you, you released peace.  
He says, if those in that house are not worthy of your peace, your peace will return to you.  
 And then they're going to get into trouble.  
They get next verse.  
And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.  
Verily as soon as you eat shall be more terrible for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city."  
Wow.  
Wonderful.  
 Wonderful.  
This is really beautiful because it tells us something we have.  
Something we have.  
Did you notice in  
 In 1st Timothy chapter 2, from verse 1, the verse that we've read again and again and prayed with, says, I sought therefore that first of all, supplications, prayers, inner sessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead, that we may lead, say, if we pray, make supplications.  
 and thanksgiving in behalf of all men and the leaders.  
He says, we can have this, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.  
Honesty and godliness will not come by government.  
It won't come by laws.  
 or it will come as a blessing from God, the God of peace.  
Did you know, with the exception of the first episode of St.  
John, all the episodes have blessings of peace.  
The writers will either begin with communicating peace  
 Pouring out peace, grace and peace onto you.  
Grace and peace onto you.  
Grace, mercy and peace onto you.  
Grace, love and peace onto you.  
The peace of God.  
Be upon you.  
All of these words are in all the epistles.  
The exception of first job.  
 Or he's got nothing to do with John because he's got it in his second piece and in his third piece as well.  
When was the last time you spoke peace when you went out?  
When was the last time you prophesied peace?  
Grace and peace onto you because they learned from Jesus to give peace.  
 He said, when you get it, if the one in that house or city is worthy, your peace will come upon them.  
Many of you have preached in your city.  
You've preached in your streets.  
You've preached to family members.  
Did you remember to release peace?  
This month?  
 You're gonna prophesy peace, release peace, because you have peace inside you, and we have to fill the world with our peace.  
This is the month of peace.  
And we are pouring out peace to the ends of the earth.  
Peace by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
We have it inside.  
It's time to bring it out by the Holy Ghost that dwells in us.  
 I'm gonna make it happen this month, this month.  
Everyday declare peace, peace to your city, peace to your state, peace to your nation in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus.  
He's the God of peace.  
Let me tell you, if we release peace, it shall be so.  
It shall be so everywhere.  
We're children of peace.  
 We serve the God of peace.  
I told you in the Bible, in the New Testament, Jesus Christ, and the Father are called the God of peace more than any other title.  
More than God of love, God of faith, God of anything.  
Peace is attributed to them, to the Father and the Son, more than any other title.  
 Isn't that instructive?  
That's how much he wants us to live in peace.  
Peace be on to you in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Wherever you are today in this great world, peace be on to you.  
 and to your family in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Peace be unto you, and to your city, in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
Peace be unto you, and to your nation, by the power of the Holy Ghost, in the name of the Lord Jesus.  
And so wherever you are right now, I want you to pray.  
I want you to pray for your city, for your country, and to pray for the nations of the world, and release peace upon them.  
 Peace upon them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.  
Remember Jesus said, peace I leave with you.  
My peace I give unto you.  
He's given us his peace.  
Now we can release that peace to the ends of the earth.  
Go ahead and pray right now.  
Thank you Lord, thank you Lord, thank you Lord.  
Go ahead and pray.
