title: 7 Facts of the Higher Life Part 3
---
 All around the world, men and women, people of all ages, have witnessed the awesome manifestation of God's presence, power and His love rendered in words, words beyond the written pages.  
Why are we preaching like this?  
Why do we travel all around the world, preaching the gospel?  
Because Jesus is coming again.  
 and he left us with a message to tell the untold, a message for the whole world.  
This message of faith in God and his unfailing word has brought about change in the lives of millions around the world, an improvement that brings many more to such meetings with the Man of God, knowing that their lives will never be the same again.  
Today, we bring you excerpts from a special meeting with our Man of God, Pastor Chris.  
 Pastor Chris, we're hearing.  


  
Oh boy, they shall reign in life.  
And you know, the word translated, reign is the best way that the English could render it.  
Because it's the word for king.  
 And it's the verb of king, but English couldn't form it, so they used to work rain.  
But if you were going to really qualify, it means to king.  
The language says they shall king in life.  
And it is the verb, it means they shall act as kings.  
And not just act as king, they shall be king in.  


  
 Seven facts of what?  
Seven facts of the higher life.  
Seven facts.  
And of course, there are lots of more facts, frankly speaking.  
I could stand here in a few minutes to tell you more.  
But there are some basic ones.  
 And these basic facts are the ones we are talking about.  
And the first one we gave was what?  
Come on.  
Again.  
And the second one.  
Did we get to a third one?  
And what was it?  
And the fourth one?  
 Okay.  
Now, we're going to number five, right?  
Number five, we reign as kings in life.  
It's a fact.  
Now, if you don't know it, it doesn't mean it's not true.  
God said, my people are destroyed for the lack of what?  
Knowledge.  
Not the lack of power.  
 Not the lack of anything else, but the lack of knowledge.  
They just don't know.  
If you were born a prince and you were heir to the throne, okay, you were born a prince and you were heir to the throne, and you were never raised that way.  
You were never informed.  
You grew up with one of your cousins.  
You were never informed.  
 You would never be king.  
You would never live like a prince.  
You would live like everybody else, for one reason, ignorance.  
You didn't know who you were.  
You didn't know, because you didn't know, it'll fail.  
Even though you're prince,  
 Even though your royalty, your life will be like anybody else.  
In fact, you might even be a beggar until you're informed, until you are educated about the life of the prince that you are, what your rights are and what your privileges are.  
 When you get to know your rights and your privileges, your life will change.  
But until you know, you live like everybody else.  
Now that's the very situation with Christians, most Christians.  
Can you imagine the millions that go to churches every Sunday, every Wednesday, and every other day that they are  
 expected to go to church?  
How many Christians attend lots of conferences and so on?  
But how many of them know who they are?  
Many of them suffer the same things that non-Christians suffer.  
They think it's normal.  
They don't expect anything.  
They don't expect to be different.  
Because they don't know they're supposed to be.  
 Some even think that some of the things we talk about from the Bible don't really belong to us.  
They're just niceties.  
But they're so wrong.  
He says, we are, didn't say we shall be.  
He says, ye are, are chosen.  
Ye are.  
 Or chosen.  
There's many are called.  
A few are chosen.  
You are among the few that are chosen.  
They are a chosen breed.  
A chosen breed.  
A chosen generation.  
It means breed.  
A chosen breed.  
Meaning that you are a special class of people.  
 When Jesus said, you must be born again, that's what he was talking about.  
When you were born again, you're born in this class of men with the life and nature of God.  
We talked about that in Numbers 1, 2, right?  
And then of course, we got to 3 and 4.  
This is so important.  
All right, so we're talking, we reign as kings.  
Look at Romans chapter 5, let's read verse number 17.  
 But if by one man's offense is talking about Adam, Adam's offense, Adam's transgression back in the garden.  
If by one man's offense, death, spiritual death gained the mastery, reigned as a king over human beings.  
Much more than death has reigned, there which receive abundance of grace.  
 And of the gift of righteousness, that is powerful.  
You know what is telling us?  
Which of course you can see in several other portions of the Bible, but that's not our topic today.  
And that is, I told you just another several other facts.  
For example, righteousness is a gift.  
I am righteous, is a fact.  
You see, you cannot please God with your personal righteousness.  
You cannot please God with all your struggle to be righteous.  
 So in Jesus Christ, which this is consistent, this is the gospel of Jesus Christ.  
In Jesus Christ, He gives us the gift of righteousness.  
He gives us the gift of righteousness, the nature, the life of righteousness.  
It justifies us in Christ Jesus by the new birth.  
 That is amazing.  
Because you're born again, God says you're not what you used to be.  
And therefore, all the sins you ever committed before you were born again are backdated to camarie.  
You are as one that never existed before.  
He says, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation.  
He is a new person altogether.  
He says, all things are passed away and behold, all things have become new.  
And that all those new things are from God.  
That is amazing.  
 And because of that, he says, you're justified, Romans 75 as well.  
Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.  
Justified means declared not guilty, declared righteous.  
Wow.  
So there we receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness.  
There we receive.  
Some don't receive it.  
 Because they don't want it.  
They argue with it.  
They say it's not true.  
So they don't receive it.  
It's like you're handing something over to somebody and he doesn't take it from you.  
But there which receive, abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness.  
He says, they shall reign in life.  
Oh boy, they shall reign in life.  
 And the word translated rain is the best way that the English could render it.  
Because it's the word for king.  
And it's the verb of king.  
But English couldn't form it.  
So they used the word rain.  
But if you were going to really qualify, it means to king.  
The language says they shall king in life.  
And it is the verb.  
It means they shall act as kings.  
And not just act as kings, they shall be king in.  
 That's what it means.  
That's the best English rendering for it.  
But you know, it's not in the everyday English.  
They couldn't find it.  
Oh boy.  
Amazing.  
They shall run in life by one Jesus Christ.  
What does this really tell us?  
Can you go to  
 Revelation, Book of Revelation chapter 1, some people are afraid of Revelation.  
Instead of Revelation, I'm not going to read it.  
They said some people read it and they ran mad.  
No, no, Revelation is wonderful.  
Revelation chapter 1, you haven't even gone far enough, that's just chapter 1.  
Chapter 1, let's read from verse 5.  
Read it for me, want to go.  
 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness in the first begotten of the dead?  
Wow, I wish I could talk on that.  
In the prince of the kings of the earth, on to him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood.  
You know, the term there, when it says, unwashed us from our sins, it uses a word in the Greek that refers to the washing of a dead person.  
 It's terrible.  
It's a washing of a dead corpse.  
A dead person.  
It's a corpse.  
Washed us from our sins.  
That's why the Bible tells us in the book of Titus, it says, the washing of regeneration.  
You see?  
Because the washing of the dead.  
But then it produces life.  
So it causes the washing of regeneration.  
Glory to God.  
 All right, onto him to love this and wash this from our sins and he's on blood.  
Oh boy, next verse, in a hat.  
Hey, come on here.  
How many of you agree Jesus Christ saved us, offered himself, washed us from our sins in his own blood?  
If you don't believe that, you're not a Christian anyways.  
How many of you believe that?  
 Thank you.  
If you believe that part, you must believe the next one, because it doesn't stop.  
He says, and a hat, not is going to.  
It's not a promise.  
It's a statement of fact.  
It's already done it.  
And a hat made us kings and priests unto God and his father, to him the glory and the minion forever and ever.  
And everybody said amen.  
 unto him that love doesn't wash us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests.  
He hath made us.  
It's not a promise.  
It's not something that's going to happen.  
Are you still there?  
It's not something that's going to happen.  
It's already done.  
 You know, in the book of Exodus, he made a promise.  
He's talking to Ezekiel, and he said, if you obey my voice, if you obey my commandments, I'm gonna make you a kingdom of priests is the reindeer.  
 But that is the King James and several other translations.  
This is Exodus 19, 5, when you read from 5 in the 6.  
But in the Hebrew and as well as in the Greek, the word translated kingdom is not often perfectly translated because it's the same word that's used in several other places.  
The only way you know which of the synonyms is the best rendering is the context.  
 The word is royalty.  
So you read in the King James, or several others, and they will say kingdom of priests sometimes, and some will say kings and priests, but not perfect, not perfect.  
A few translations get it correctly because you've got to look at the context.  
 The word is royal, or royalty, as the case may be.  
So what God was saying, and which is proved to every other scripture, like all the other ones we just read, was, I will make you not a kingdom, whether a priest, like Israel is a kingdom, and then their priests in the kingdom, or like you said, the beneath kingdom that has priests.  
 or you say the oil kingdom with priests or the united kingdom with priests.  
That's not what he was talking about.  
He says, I'll make you royal priests.  
Why?  
Because in Genesis, there was a man revealed to us called Melchizedek.  
And the Bible says Melchizedek was the king of righteousness.  
 That's amazing.  
King of righteousness, he had no beginning of days, no ending of days, and made like unto the Son of God, before whom even the great patriarch Abraham made obeisance and gave tithes of all.  
Now, speaking of Jesus, he says, he's been made the priests, high priests in the order of Melchizedek.  
Who was Melchizedek, the king priest?  
 He was a king priest.  
Now that's the actual Greek rendering, where he says, where you find a royal priesthood, we got it right in first Peter.  
They translated it correctly.  
Royal priesthood.  
That's the same thing they translate into a kingdom of priests.  
 Kings and priests, but the end doesn't exist in the original.  
It's King priests.  
Can you see it now?  
So they are royal priests.  
That means this priests are royalty.  
And that's what he says.  
Okay, Revelation 5 verse 10.  
This should just put everything I just told you together.  
You'll see it now.  
Revelation 5 verse 10.  
Ready, ready, ready.  
 and has made us unto our God, kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.  
How can priests reign if they are not kings?  


  
 The day is coming, in which many, many, many, many, many, many more Christians will discover who they are in Christ.  
And the bigger the life that many lives will cease to be.  
So the day is here, in which you are in your home and somebody's sick and we're not running like everybody else looking for help.  
Oh, doctor, doctor.  
No, you come in and you say, in the name of Jesus Christ.  
 You thought you were a victim of circumstances.  
You thought you were a victim of the society.  
You thought you were a victim of bad government.  
You thought you were a victim.  
Now you have discovered you are a victim.  


  
 Have you ever measured to see if you're making progress?  
Or have you ever thought, making advancement in life isn't possible?  
Don't give up now.  
The right answer to make progress in life is here.  
The Word of God brings you the secret to success.  
 These seven factors will produce the life needed in everything about you.

 Have you seen it?  
So it's perfect.  
But the end really doesn't exist.  
But even if you put it, it makes no difference.  
They are kings and they are priests.  
Or you say, as the original says, and had made us unto our God, king priests.  
Hallelujah.  
 Are you still there?  
So he says, and we shall reign on the earth.  
And this is so powerful because it's a vision.  
The man was seeing a vision.  
And in the name of Jesus Christ, who has been exalted above all, if you left in his name, Colossians chapter three verse 17, you will reign every day.  
Look at Colossians chapter three verse 17.  
And what so?  
No, you read it for me.  
Let's be sure you are seeing it too.  
 Really want to go.  


  
Giving complaints.  
If you're renting, you have no complaints.  
Because you're winning every day.  
Because you live in the name of Jesus.  
The name of Jesus never loses its greatest name in the universe.  
 What sort of are you doing word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus?  
Giving thanks to God.  
Not giving complaints.  
Giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.  
I give thanks Lord, I give thanks.  
Because I'm in charge, I'm winning every time.  
 Irrespective of those circumstances, you remember we talked about that?  
Independents of circumstances.  
We talked about that last week.  
Independents, I'm independent of circumstances.  
I win all the time.  
I'm winning all the time.  
My life was born for this.  
I'm born of the Spirit of God.  
Therefore, I live as a king continually and in all situations and circumstances.  
No matter what comes my way, I'm on top all the time because I live in the name of Jesus Christ.  
 I love in the name of Jesus Christ.  
Glory to God.  
Woo, woo, woo, woo.  
Oh, let's see if we can take the next one.  
We have authority to use the name of Jesus.  
That's number six.  
We have authority to use the name of Jesus.  
And you know who that brings us?  
Look at it.  
Just add this to it.  
We have overcome the world.  
 we have overcome the world.  
The day is coming, in which many, many, many, many, many more Christians will discover who they are in Christ, and the bigger life that many live will cease to be.  
Because Jesus came for a purpose, not only to save us from our sins, he says he saved us, he washed us from our sins in his own blood, and had to make those kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.  
 there which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life," he says, by one Jesus Christ.  
So the day is here in which you are in your home and somebody's sick and we're not running like everybody else looking for help.  
Oh, doctor, doctor.  
No, you come in and you say, in the name of Jesus Christ.  
I rebuke the pain.  
I rebuke the affliction.  
I rebuke the diabetes.  
 You're in charge.  
You discover your hands are for blessings.  
Now you're laying your hands.  
Oh, the baby has been choking.  
Oh, I swallowed something.  
No, no, no, no, no.  
You put your hand and say, in the name of Jesus Christ, be made whole.  
Things have changed.  
Life has changed.  
Oh, glory to God.  
Glory to God.  
Glory to God.  
 And then you learn how to use the name of Jesus Christ in your finances, in your job, in everything that you do.  
You'd be amazed at suddenly what life becomes.  
You thought you were a victim of circumstances.  
You thought you were a victim of the society.  
You thought you were a victim of bad government.  
You thought you were a victim.  
Now you have discovered you are a victor.  
Hallelujah.  
 Wow, St.  
Mark's Gospel, chapter 16, verse 17.  
Jesus said something in my name.  
These signs shall follow them that bleed.  
In my name shall they cast out devils.  
Oh, they're not gonna be afraid of devils.  
They cast out devils.  
They're not afraid of witches.  
They say, oh, somebody bewitched him.  
If they bewitched him and you have come, you are the solution.  
Because Jesus gave you authority to cast out devils.  
 In the name of Jesus Christ, you cast out devils.  
Hallelujah.  
Glory to God.  
Look at St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 16, verse 23.  
We're reading 23 into 24.  
And in that day, He shall ask me nothing.  
Verily,  
 Verily I say unto you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.  
Isn't that wonderful?  
He that will have yet nothing in my name.  
Ask, ask, and I will think about it.  
 Ask and we ask the Father to do it for you.  
Ask and he shall receive that your joy may be full.  
See, he wants you to ask and receive that your joy may be full.  
He wants your life to be full of testimonies all the time.  
He says ask and he shall receive.  
He didn't say ask and God will look at it whether you qualify for it or not.  
Ask and he shall receive that your joy may be full.  
Hallelujah.  
 in his marvelous name.  
Glory to God.  
He gave us authority to use his name.  
We have authority to use his name.  
Glory to God.  
John chapter 16 verse 33.  
He did this for us.  
John chapter 16 verse 33.  
Look what he did for us.  
Look what he did for us.  
Are you there?  
These things I've spoken unto you.  
 That in me, you might have peace.  
In the world, you shall have tribulation.  
So let's travel in the world.  
But what?  
Be of good cheer.  
That's what we call chair up, right?  
He says, be of good cheer.  
I have overcome the world.  
Look at it.  
He didn't need to overcome the world for God.  
He didn't need to overcome the world for Himself.  
He didn't need to overcome the world for anybody.  
He overcame the world for us.  
First John chapter five.  
 Verse four, look at it now.  
Jesus already did it and I walk right into it.  
What, for whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the word.  
Hi.  
For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the word.  
And this is the victory that overcometh the word, even our faith.  
 I'm born of God.  
I have overcome the world.  
I'm born of God.  
Because I'm born again, you see.  
I've overcome the words.  
I've overcome the words.  
 and its systems.  
I have overcome the words and its hatred.  
I have overcome the words and its own belief.  
I have overcome the words and its economies.  
I have overcome the words and its economy.  
I have overcome the words and its economics.  
I have overcome the words.  
 With all his circumstances and situations, I have overcome the world.  
Chair, brother!  
Chair, sister!  
You have overcome the world!  
How old Julia!  
Glory to God!  
 Number seven.  
Oh, I didn't know we'll get there.  
Go with it.  
God.  
Number seven.  
God, this is fact number seven.  
God lives and walks in us.  
Oh boy.  
Lebaraka sandalabaha'i.  
L'on no graiso scapra higa hasta rejet.  
L'eron no sguirahangaradikos.  
Shau para acta caradillo onsto ges.  
 If my people walk in my lights and in my truths and in that which I reveal all to them by my spirits at the Lord, they shall not only live in victory, they shall see their victory transferred to others.  


  
 That means we live in victory.  
We communicate victory.  
We help others to be in victory.  
Glory to God.  
What a word.  
Think about it.  
Think about it.  
Think about it.  
Blessed be God.  
God lives and walks in us.  
First John chapter 4 verse 4.  
 Look at it.  
First John, chapter four, verse four.  
Year of God, little children.  
Year of God.  
That means you hail from God.  
That means your origin is in God.  
Do you understand that?  
Year of God, little children, in half overcome them.  
 You are not trying to overcome.  
You are not struggling to overcome.  
You're not praying to overcome.  
You're not hoping to overcome.  
Listen, the word of God is God talking.  
You've got to understand it.  
The Bible says, you see, a lot of people think in their minds what you got in St.  
John's Gospel chapter one, when you read in the beginning, what's the word?  
And the word was with God.  
And the word was God.  
They think the word was God means he used to be God, he no longer God.  
 Come on here.  
The Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.  
He is still God.  
The Word in your mouth is still God.  
The Word is God.  
And it says whatsoever comes from God, hairs from God, overcomes the Word.  
Look at it.  
Year of God, little children, in half overcome them because...  


  
 Because greater is he that is in you.  
He is in you.  
Can you shout amen somebody?  
He is in you.  
Because greater is he that is in you.  
 Oh, years ago, I remember I was going through some pressures and they were riding all kinds of nonsense.  
And they thought I would just be crying.  
Oh, they thought Pastor Chris is somewhere licking his wounds.  
Oh, he's in pain right now.  
I wasn't at all.  
I just went to a prayer place.  
I said in the name of Jesus, I have overcome the world.  
Greater is he, that is in me, than he, that is in the world.  
 Every day I was passing the floor in my room.  
Greater is he that is in me.  
Then he that is in the world.  
I am of God.  
I have overcome the world.  
I have overcome the world.  
I have overcome the world.  
That was my son.  
That was my testimony.  
That was my confession.  
Day in and day out.  
Glory to God.  
Because that's who I am.  
That's who I am.  
 That's what I'm sharing with you.  
That's what the Word of God has made us.  
Are you still there?  
Second Corinthians chapter 6 and verse number 16.  
Boy, this is nice.  
You'll love it.  
And what agreement had the temple of God with idols?  
For he... Ah!  
There you are.  
It didn't say you're going to be.  
It didn't say you are preparing to be.  
 the temple of the living God.  
As God had said, I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people.  
Can you shout amen to somebody?  
First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 16.  
First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 16.  
 No ye not, ayah, bakasayah.  
No ye not that ye-ah, the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?  
Just don't you know that you are God's temple?  
The word translated temple is nahos.  
It means the very shrine where the God presence is.  
That's who you are.  
God lives in you.  
 Because you have received the Holy Spirit into you.  
He says, don't you know that you are the temple of God?  
You are a moving temple.  
Can you shout amen, somebody?  
You are the living tabernacle of a living God everywhere you go.  
God goes.  
Somebody says, it's God here.  
I say, yeah, because I brought him with me.  
He's in me walking in me, talking in me.  
Can you shout amen, somebody?  
Go away again.
