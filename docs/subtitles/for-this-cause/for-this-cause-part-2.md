title: For This Cause Part 2
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirits.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 Why do many Christians get sick?  
Why are many weak in their spiritual life?  
Why are many weak in their faith?  
And why are many weak in their physical bodies?  
Why are many sickly?  
The most important thing in life is God's Word.  
 As you digest the word, your life is regulated accordingly.  
Listen to this important message by Pastor Chris titled, for this cause part two.  
After you have become a Christian, you should never again be sick in your life.  
Because you have come to Christ.  
And get a better understanding of who you are and why you shouldn't be sick.  
Christ is the answer.  
 Christ is the home you have arrived.  
The struggle is over.  
And if you are, it shows you how to become healthy.  
If you've been sick in your body, why?  
If you've been carrying an infirmity in your body, why?  
If you were born with a particular kind of sickness or disease and you've come to believe in Jesus Christ, why is it still there?  
God bless you as you listen.  
 This would tell you why.  


  
We began sharing on a message that I titled for this course.  
And we are endeavoring to answer a question, why  
 Do many Christians get sick?  
Why are many weak?  
In their spiritual life, why are many weak in their faith and why many weak in their physical bodies?  
Why are many sickly?  
After you have become a Christian, you should never again be sick in your life.  
 Now that is the honest and truthful presentation of the Word of God.  
Because you have come to Christ.  
Christ is the answer.  
Christ is the home.  
You have arrived.  
When a man comes to Christ, he has arrived.  
He has come home.  
He has arrived.  
The struggle is over.  


  
 But where is it that in spite of that reality, many are weak and sickly.  
To the point that it has become like something that's normal.  
So many Christians don't even realize they ought not to be sick.  
They don't know that they're not supposed to be.  
They think sickness is normal.  
 Let's think that if they have an infection that they can biologically explain or medically explain, scientifically explain, then it's okay.  
No.  
Jesus said something about the Christian.  
He said, this sign shall follow the unbelief.  
He said, in my name, they shall cast out devils.  
They shall speak with new tongues.  
They shall take up surprise.  
If they shall drink any deadly thing.  
 Whether they drink it through their mouth or through their veins doesn't matter if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall have no power over them.  
Meaning they ought not to have any infection of any kind.  
They are a different breed.  
 That's what the Bible says, he are a chosen generation.  
The word generation is the same thing for breed.  
You are a special breed.  
That's what he's saying.  
You are not ordinary.  
You are a special breed because you are a new creation superior to the devil, superior to failure.  
You see that?  
Superior to sickness, superior to infirmities.  
 You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.  
Then it says, a peculiar people.  
That means unique, one of the kind, a special kind.  
Then the Bible says, of his own will, James 1, 18, of his own will, he begat us.  
He gave birth to us by the word of truth, that we should be a species.  
 are first fruits of his creatures.  
That means the first and the best, the highest kind of God's creatures.  
The first and the best.  
Now, if you get sick, how are you the best?  
Is that the best that God can do?  
 Subject to the devil?  
Subject to infirmities?  
Is that the best that God can do?  
Yet the Bible says you are the first, the topmost and the best.  
Wow.  
But God says, my people suffer.  
My people perish.  
My people are crushed because they lack knowledge.  
They just don't know.  
They don't know it.  
 They don't realize it.  
This is the suffer because of lack of knowledge.  
He didn't say because of the lack of their faith, the lack of knowledge.  
Specialized knowledge.  


  
Praise God.  
Hallelujah.  
 I remember one time I was listening to a certain preacher, he said something, he said something to the congregation and he said, when he was in the course of his preaching, he tried to emphasize something, he said, I didn't say that you will not die.  
He said, hear me, he wanted...  
 to be in line with what most of his predecessors in frames have said, that every Christian, everybody will die.  
So he said to the congregation, listen, I never said you will not die.  
Everyone will die.  
Hear me.  
Now say, I will die.  
And they all say, I will die.  
You see, that's how much he wanted to be straight and correct to the generality of the teaching that he was surrounded with.  
 You see that?  
And that's completely wrong as far as the Word of God is concerned.  
But it doesn't know it.  
Why?  
Because Peter, James and John, Paul and the rest of them died and yet God used them to write in the Scriptures.  
They said, if they died, everybody ought to die.  
But that's not it.  
That's not the way you look at the Bible.  
 That's not the way.  
I love what T.L.  
Osborne said one time.  
T.L.  
Osborne said he always, when he studied the Bible, he always thought that men ought to die at age 70 or 80 if he got strong enough.  
So because he saw it where in the book of Psalms he was written,  
 man's days are 70 years, and he by reason of strength, they leave on, then there's an additional 10 years, meaning 80 years.  
Then he said, I found out that was not written by David, it was written by Moses.  
That's Psalm, Psalm 90 was written by Moses, and Moses lived up to 120.  
And then he said, and I started in Genesis, that God actually said he had given man 120.  
So he said, he heard John Austen preaching that message.  
 All right?  
John Austin preached that message about man living up to 120.  
So, to your husband said, now I'm 61.  
At the time he preached it, he was 61 years old.  
He's past 80 now, you understand?  
So, he said, he said, I'm 61.  
And as an old man, it may be difficult for me to adjust my thinking.  
He said, if I don't live up to 120, don't say, oh, that preacher said 120.  
He didn't get up to 120.  
He said, the younger generation, believe it.  


  
 He said, believe it.  
God gave you 120.  
Don't stop before that, but here's the point.  
The truth is, when God said 120, that was because I've seen.  
Mother says, because man's iniquity had become so much, God reduced their years of life to 120.  
But now, the matter I've seen has been dealt with.  
 You see that?  
Well, that's the part of it that John Austen and Tia husband didn't notice.  
That the 120 have been canceled.  
You see that?  
That's been canceled.  
If Jesus Tari is in his coming back, anybody can leave as long as he chooses to.  
That's a fact.  
Anybody can leave as long as he wants to.  
 You know, there's this idea, religious idea that God has counted everybody's days.  
And so when it's time, God comes knocking at your door saying, hey, I need you tonight.  
But that's not the way the Bible shows us.  
Now that Christ has come, things have changed.  
You make a choice.  
Paul said, I'm thinking about what to do, whether to die or to live on.  
 It's amazing, but that's it.  
You study your Bible in Philippians chapter one, you see it.  
He said, I'm thinking of what to do, whether to leave on or to die.  
Then he said, anyway, for you, I'm going to stay because it's more profitable for you that I'll leave on.  
So I'm going to leave on and teach you God's Word.  
And he stayed many more years until when he was ready, then he said, no, I fought a good fight.  
I've run the race.  
I'm ready to go.  
And gave up and died.  
 So when it was time he was ready to die, Machelia, because he was ready.  
Until then, nobody could kill him.  


  
Just like Jesus.  
They hated him so much, they wanted him dead, but nobody could kill him.  
 until when he was ready.  
Then he said, this one thing I received from my father, he gave me power to lay my life down and power to take it up again.  
And he laid down his life for us, raised God forevermore.  
Hallelujah.  
Well, you know, our religious thinking sometimes affects our lifestyle and definitely  
 dictates what happens in our lives, whether we are successful or we fail, whether we are rich or poor in our material and financial life, whether we are happy, sad, joyful, all of these things will be dictated by what we understand about God, hallelujah.  
 someone could be bitter because of the things that have happened in his life.  
Someone, you know, people, we need to understand that whatever life we're living today is the outward expression of those, what you may call a personal ideology, the summation of all your beliefs, your belief system,  
 All of these things that you have come to accept that are inside you, they are what you live out every day.  
The things you say, the way you reason, your mind sets, the way you think about anything.  
You see that?  
Everything about your life has been programmed, pre-programmed by you.  
 through how you were believing, how you were thinking, all the information you received all this time, all these years till now, they have helped to from what you are and how you will respond on any given occasion or to any information or to any kind of action against you or for you.  
 It's just what you have inside you.  
See that?  
Your response to stimuli.  


  
See, pre-programmed, it's all inside you.  
That's what makes us different.  
That's why one person can be successful, another person will be a failure.  
 Sometimes we think, oh, look at that guy.  
He wasn't expecting to be something and he became.  
He's that fellow.  
He's so lucky.  
Oh, he was a nobody.  
All of a sudden, somebody granted him something and he became something.  
What you don't know is what his reasoning system has been up to now.  
That's what you don't know.  
If he had it in him,  
 It'll open doors for him.  
If he didn't have it in him, doesn't matter who puts him up, he'll come down.  
Doesn't matter.  
But if you have it in you, even when there's no human way of getting to your dream, all of nature has a way of responding to the call of the human soul.  
 I want you to understand it is that being embedded in your soul, the creative power of God is embedded in your soul.  
It is so strong within you that no matter what happens, it can deliver you into the reality of your dream.  
 That's the reason your mind is so important.  
That's the reason God gave us His Word to help us frame our thinking.  
Because only our thinking can help us have our dreams materialized.  
Without the right thinking and the thinking process, you'd be a failure.  
So God, He says, hey, renew your mind.  
Renew your thinking.  
Renew your mind.  
 It doesn't matter what sickness anybody goes through.  
If you renew your mind, if you renew your thinking and think the way God will have you think, you'd come out of it.  
I mean, there's a lot of people who came out of cancer, without anybody praying for them.  
It just left.  
And the same kinds are killed another person.  
In spite of the fact that many people prayed for him, prayer doesn't heal.  
 Do you understand?  
Prayer doesn't heal.  
I want you to understand that.  
You may pick up what James said, the prayer of faith shall save the sick, but the Lord.  
See that?  
The Lord chariots him up.  
So it's not the prayer.  
It is the God who hears an answer as the prayer.  
You see, the transaction is between the one who's praying and the one who answers.  
 You get it?  
Now it doesn't matter.  
Look at what Jesus always said.  
Your faith has made you whole.  
Your faith.  
It had to do with them.  
Your faith has made you whole.  
Your faith has made you whole.  
Your faith.  
 He had the power to make them whole.  
But the power couldn't work.  
Their unbelief shot, secured at his face.  
Shot, secured at God's power.  
That's why the Bible tells us when Jesus went to Nazareth, his own city, he couldn't do many mighty works.  
He couldn't perform many miracles.  
The Bible says he tried and failed.  
You know some people think.  
 Some people think that Jesus had a hundred percent result.  
Everybody, Jesus, minister to God heal.  
It's not true.  
Read your Bible.  
Those people haven't read the Bible.  
They are assuming.  
They are assuming.  
Now, I've studied the healing ministry of Jesus Christ and find out how many individual people Jesus ministers directly to.  
The few  
 then find out what happened on those occasions where large crowds were healed.  
Find out what happened.  
Then find out exactly what the Bible says when you study what happened in Nazareth.  
The Bible tells us that Jesus went to Nazareth and he tried to heal them and that he couldn't  
 Not that he wouldn't, but that he couldn't.  
The expression is that it failed to work.  
It didn't work.  
In Nazareth, Jesus commanded the blind to open up and receive sight, and it didn't open up.  
He commanded the land to rise up and walk, and it didn't rise and walk.  
In Nazareth,  
 You say, how do you know?  
Because of the presentation.  
It didn't work.  
It failed in Nazareth.  
So the Bible says that Jesus maverhed.  
He was surprised.  
The Bible says he maverhed at their unbelief.  
Because the same power that worked in Capana  
 failed in Nazareth.  
So it wasn't Jesus that was the failure.  
Because the power was the same.  
It worked in Jerusalem.  
It worked in Bethsaida, in Bethesda.  
It worked all over the place, except in Nazareth.  
Why?  
Because they said we know him.  
What does he think he is?  
 They said, we know him.  
We know his mother, we know his father.  
We know his brothers and sisters.  
How can he say I'm from above?  
So when he said, receive your sight, the fellow said, mmm, pray again.  
I'm sure I will soon see.  
 When he said, rise up and walk.  
You see, they listened to him as though they were listening to their village boy.  
They knew his house.  
They knew his house.  
His uncle's house was next door.  
They knew them.  
So now that little boy that watch growing up is telling them, rise and walk.  


  
So it's okay, okay, I'm trying.  
Right.  
Hold on now.  
 So it failed.  
But it could pan out.  
I want to show you the difference.  
I'm trying to explain something to you.  
We have some people who have ministered to, OK?  
They expected us to keep praying and praying and praying and praying.  
Some others said, if I can only just sit past the crisp pass, I will be healed.  
And they saw and said, I'm healed.  
Then you have the other one saying, please, can you take me there?  
You see?  
I want him to touch me.  
 differences in responses.  
See that?  
So in Nazareth, he failed.  
And Jesus wondered about this, he mathered by the unbelief.  
Ah!  
He said, what kind of people like this?  
Rise and walk!  


  
 See, it's not standing, please.  
Don't let me fall, it's not standing, please.  
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall.  
It's not standing.  
This leg is no strong yet.  
Pray for this one.  
I want to pray for somebody one time, and I put my hand on this side.  
He took it and said it's on this side.  


  
 He took my hand and tried to put it on the other side, that there's no decided on this side.  
It didn't matter where it was.  


  
It didn't matter where it was.  


  
Hallelujah.  
 No wonder the Bible says, without faith, it is impossible.  
It is impossible to please God.  
Impossible without faith.  
Somebody says, can God not just remove faith and just do things or somebody?  
What was there be faith?  
Faith is a spiritual law.  
Let me explain something to you that's important.  
Do you know why you are able to sit on the chairs you're sitting on?  
 because of the law of gravity.  
There's a law of gravity that is keeping you on your chair.  
If that law were not in operation in this world, you wouldn't be able to sit on this chair.  
You see that?  
That's what's keeping you there.  
That's why you were able to walk into this place.  
The law of gravity,  
 That's at work in the world, in the earth.  
It's that force that pulls everything to the center of the earth, keeping them on the surface.  
That's why you're able to stay there.  
 That's why even though the Earth is spherical, and some people are standing like this, and the other ones are standing upside, there's a force at the middle of the Earth that's pulling all of them and keeping them so that no one is falling out anywhere in space.  
That force is based on the law of gravity.  
 In the realm of the Spirit, when you read in Romans chapter 3 and read verse 23 to verse 26, it tells you that faith also is a law.  
It is a law in the realm of the Spirit.  
So if that law is not in operation, God cannot help you on earth because you see, you're not in heaven.  
 The relationship between the earth and heaven is based on the law of faith.  
That is the connection.  
 So without that faith, God can't help you.  
That is the law that's established for God to reach you.  
You see that?  
You can't see God with your optical eyes.  
So the law of faith, faith has been granted us to believe in something we do not see so that we can get something from heaven that we can't touch with our physical hands and get it to function here.  
 Secondly, so that we can pass from the physical realm into the spiritual realm in the earth, the same earth.  
You see, the earth is in the world of the Spirit.  
The earth is in the world of the Spirit because the lesser is included in the greater.  
Are you getting this?  
So the Spirit is here now.  
 Now, that doesn't mean that this is where heaven is.  
No, but the spirit realm is here now.  
I mean, look around and not see the angels that are here.  
There are angels here.  
So I mean, look around and not see them.  
But for me to see beyond what my optical eyes can see, I must operate with another law.  
That or the law functions under a different light, not these ones.  
 Then our city angel.  
The reason you can't see the angels right now is because he lives in another realm, from the realm in which you function, with your physical body.  
So you need faith to go beyond this physical body and see them and see their activities.  
 Now, healing is from the Spirit Realm.  
And God has granted it to you, but it is not real to you until you pass from the physical thinking to the spiritual thinking and make it real.  
Then you enjoy it and say, wow, I'm here.  
But the healing is present there with you.  
Can you see it?  
Oh, come on here.  
Hey, did you get it?  
It's so important.  
 Now, wanting to clarify some of these things so that you can understand it much more easily from our subject on for this course.  
Okay?  
For this course.  
Jesus had an interest in discussion with the Jews.  
I told you.  
Many of his disciples were there and he was teaching them in the sixth chapter of St.  
John's Gospel.  
A beautiful exposé of spiritual  
 intelligence, and Jesus communicated with his disciples.  
Some of them couldn't believe him, couldn't trust his message, and he got offended and left.  
Some others stayed and enjoyed the benefit of listening.  
Praise God.  
 Okay, you ready to see this?  
All right, I'd like you to look at St.  
John's Gospel chapter 6 and read to me verse 47.  
Let's begin from there.  
Verse 47.  


  
 No, I don't like the way you read it.  
Can you read it again?  
Stop there.  
Did you see that?  
He says, very, very, I say to you, you hear that?  
Believe it!  
On me, hats, everlasting love.  
You believe, you get.  
It's yours.  
 But now I want you to turn to verse 51 of the same book, same chapter.  
Have you seen 51?  
All right.  
Read for me.  
Want to go.  
Stop.  
Stop.  
Stop.  
Take from verse 50.  
I don't want you to miss verse 50.  
Read verse 50.  


  
 Oh, do you like that?  
He said, this is the bread which came down from the heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die.  
You eat this bread, he says, you live forever.  
Okay, verse 51 now.  


  
 Stop.  
I want you to notice something.  
He says, there's a bread that came from heaven.  
Proud of this, he was telling the Jews, your father's eight manner in the wilderness.  
Where are they?  
They are dead, so okay.  
But there's another bread that came from heaven.  
If any man will eat that bread, he'll live forever and do a listening.  
 What kind of bread would that be?  
Then he says, I am that living bread.  


  
He says, I am that living bread.  
And if any man will eat of this bread, he shall live forever.  
I am the living bread.  
 Anyone who will eat of this bread shall live forever.  
And the bread, now notice, and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world, which I will give for the life of the world.  
The bread that I will give is my flesh.  


  
Go on reading.  
Verse 52.  


  
 He wasn't the situation.  
He said, except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood.  
You have no life in you.  


  
 You have to eat his flesh and drink his blood.  


  
He says, I am the living bread.  
So let's read.  
This is not over yet.  
Now verse 53, read it again.  


  
 Go on.  


  
Stop.  
What verse are you now?  
No, read 55 again.  


  
 But now King James, you know, King James is his word indeed.  
Now, what is saying is, my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.  
That's what it means.  
Praise God.  
Okay, now verse 56, gone.  


  
 He that eat at my flesh and drink at my blood, dwells in me and I in him."  
I want you to notice what he says.  
We'll talk about the communion.  
And I wanted you to understand what the communion actually signified.  
 because a lot of times we look at the immediate thinking.  
 You think, you know, people share the communion all the time, and then they think, oh, he died for me, then he died for me, he died for me, you know, the breath, then the drink, oh, he died for me, it's covenant, it's covenant, it's covenant.  
This thing is not about covenants.  
I've told you before, the Christian is not in covenant with God.  
I've told you that before, it doesn't matter who's telling you that kind of stuff.  
You know, a lot of people, there are books, big books that have been written on Christian covenant with God.  
It's a lie.  
 That's the truth.  
We are not in the covenant with God.  
How?  
How could we be in the covenant with God?  
We are not in the covenant with God.  
We're not in the covenant with Jesus.  
So what's this covenant all about?  
 We are the result of a covenant of the Abrahamic covenant.  
We are the result of that covenant.  
We are not in the Abrahamic covenant.  
We are the result.  
We were burdened by the covenant.  
We were brought forth by the covenant.  
We are the result.  
We are the promise of the covenant.  
Don't you understand?  
Do you know who the Christian really is?  
We came because of the covenant.  
It made us possible.  
 Do you understand?  
We're not in the covenant.  
In terms of, oh God, in terms of how we covenant with God, what covenant is that again?  
The Bible says the Old Testament was set aside.  
Why?  
He was replaced by a new one.  
He says this New Testament was established upon better promises.  
 Better, more excellent promises.  


  
Are you still there?  
Better promises.  
So what covenant would you want to have with God for God to do a particular thing for you?  
Something that is already covered, you don't understand what I'm talking about here.  
 Buh!  
 I've spoken to them in several generations.  
I've spoken to them through several ministers.  
I've spoken to them, but many didn't hear me, said the Lord.  
But I've made up my mind, said the Lord.  


  
 that before the coming of my Son, many will hear and rise.  
And they shall walk in the realms of my glory, said the Lord.  
Yes, they will hear.  
So said the Spirit of God.  
They will hear.  
Hallelujah.  
Because you see, the glorious church shall arise and come out of the ashes of the feet.  
Raise God.  
 Understand this.  
Understand this.  
We are joint heirs with the risen Christ.  
Do you know what that means?  
He's the possessor of heaven and earth.  
And we are joint heirs with him.  
What could be better?  
Paul said, all things are yours.  
He said, the world is yours.  
What do you want?  
What's not covered?  
 No, what's not covered?  
Somebody said, we're in a covenant, we've got covenant.  
How?  
Didn't you read it that we were born of Him?  
We are born of Him.  
He gave birth to us.  
 He gave birth to us by the Holy Ghost and the Word.  
He gave birth to us.  
Our origin is in God.  
 He says, he are of God, little children.  
He have overcome them.  
Why?  
Because he are of God.  
He hail from God.  
Your origin is in God.  
You are from God.  
Do you understand?  
You are my God.  
You are from him, from God.  
So you have overcome them.  
Ever before they became your enemies, you overcame them.  
Why?  
Because he says, Greta, is he?  
 Watch this.  
I want you to understand those who think of covenant.  
He didn't say, Greta, is he in with whom you have a covenant?  
He said, Greta is he that is inside you.  
Not Greta is he that is in heaven.  
Not Greta is he that is with you.  
But Greta is he that is in you, in you.  


  
He that is in you.  
 Not he that is with you.  
Jesus said the Holy Ghost when he comes, he says, for he is with you, but shall be in you.  
So Jesus distinguished between the Holy Spirit being with you and the Holy Spirit being in you.  
The prophets of all had the Holy Spirit with them.  
The great men of all had the Holy Spirit with them.  
But Jesus came with the Holy Spirit in him.  
Then he said, the Holy Spirit is with you, but he shall be in you.  
 Now that he has come to live in us, John said, yeah, of God, little children, you have nothing to fear because you have overcome them already.  
Why?  
Greater is he.  
That is in you.  
Then he, that is in the world.  


  
Hallelujah.  
Wow.  
Greater, greater, greater.  
Let's continue reading.  
 Verse 56.  
Can you see that?  
Now notice he has now moved.  
He says, he that attacked me.  


  
 He that eat at me is a shall leave by me.  
He that eat at me.  
He says, me, I am the one.  
He says, I am that bread.  
So he says, you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood.  
Now he says, he that eat at me.  
So he's not talking about, let's divide the flesh, the bones, the sun, the tendons, and the blood.  
No, no, no, no, no.  
He uses the flesh and the blood in a generic form to refer to his totality.  
 You see that?  
So he says, he attacked me.  
So what are the constituents of this meat?  
Everything from head to toe.  
So I don't want you to get into, oh, but there's a bread, then there is a cup.  
This whole thing is referring to one individual.  
That's what he's telling you.  
It is my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.  
Now he says, he attacked me.  
 So all of that, the bread, the drink, all referred to him.  
Praise God.  
You're still there?  
Okay, now verse 58.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 That's so important.  
He that eateth of this bread shall live forever.  
Live forever.  
Just a minute, live forever.  
He shall live forever.  
Okay, now let's look at this stuff.  
Okay, eating the bread and the drink, eating the son of man, eating his flesh.  
Wow.  
 When you read it from the 26th chapter of St.  
Matthew's Gospel, you begin reading from the 26th verse.  
You'd find what Jesus was with his disciples in that night and the Bible tells us that he took bread and brook it, all right?  
We read that account in 1 Corinthians chapter 11 yesterday.  
So he took bread and brook it, and he said to them,  
 it, this is my body.  
He had preached this matter before.  
The disciples were there, and some of the disciples stopped walking with you.  
Now, we didn't quite read all of that, but I think it's good for me to show it to you.  
Can you go back to that verse 59?  
You finished with verse 58.  
Now, let's read 59.  


  
 Okay, 60.  
Go on.  
No, no, no, no.  
Read carefully that verse again.  
Verse 61, 61.  


  
 Stop, who no more that eats?  
Check it.  
The crowd.  
The unbelievers.  
Who no more that eats?  
His disciples.  
Many of his disciples, no more that eats.  
And Jesus said unto them, go on.  
He said, this offends you, 62.  


  
 Go on.  
That shows you the thinking of the Lord when He spoke to them.  
 It shows you what Jesus thought about.  
I explained something yesterday.  
The account of the communion is not all about bread and cup.  


  
This whole thing has to do with an understanding that he wants us to have.  


  
I want us to go again  
 and read.  
Let's begin like this.  
Read for me Romans 12 and verse 5.  
Verse 5, 1, 2, go.  
Again,  


  
 I don't know whether you're catching that.  
When I read things like this, I'm standing my spirit.  


  
But you know, most Christians are distracted by the peripherals.  
 They are distracted by some little things here and there that are not the focus, but because those are the things they have their minds on.  
Let me show you one big truth that is close to a destruction.  
Are you ready?  
A big truth, very close to a destruction.  
You will see that that's what most people have preached from that scripture, but the big truth is before it.  


  
 It'll tell you why some people are exciting, exciting, successful Christians.  
Why some?  
I'm not quite happy.  
Have you found it?  
First Corinthians chapter number six, and I want you to read for me verse 15.  
Uh-huh.  
Uh-huh.  
Want to go.  


  
 Stop.  
Stop.  
You see, most of the church measures on Pat B. They measure on Pat B, which is halotry, fun occasion.  
That's almost all you hear.  
But the Pat A, that is more important, nobody talks about it.  
 The part A says, don't you know that your bodies are the members of Christ?  
Listen, that's one of the biggest things you'd find in the Bible for your health.  
He says, your physical bodies are the very members of Christ.  
You see, in Romans chapter 12 verse five, he showed you that we are members of the body of Christ.  
Now, that's the mystical body of Christ.  
 But then he said, in this one, he says, your very physical bodies are connected.  
Now here is the connection with the community.  
He says, your very physical bodies are connected together in Christ.  
So not only are your spirits, part of the physical body of Christ, he says, your physical bodies are the very members of Christ.  
 Do you understand what this is?  
Maybe I should give you another scripture that can help you clarify it.  
Ephesians chapter 1.  


  
Have you seen it?  
Ephesians chapter 1, read verse 23.  


  
Did you see that?  
 Which is what?  
And his body is what?  
Stop there.  
I read my Bible as I read.  
I have mixed emotions.  
Sometimes I cry, cry, cry.  
Sometimes I laugh, laugh, laugh.  
Sometimes I shout, shout, shout.  
Sometimes I'm just so dazed.  
I'm just looking.  
Hey.  
Hey.  
 Look at this big one.  
He tells us that Jesus Christ was made the head.  
He was given to be the head over all things to the church.  
So he continues in that verse 23 to listen to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him.  
Him, that's him, Christ, that fillet, all in all.  
He feels all in all.  
But that the body of Christ, the church, is the fullness of Christ.  
That means all...  
 We are His fullness.  
Do you understand that?  
Meaning that without us, He is not complete.  
Meanwhile, He is my completeness.  
But without Me, He is not complete.  
And yet the Bible now lets me know that my very physical body is part of this whole structure.  


  
My physical body is part of the structure.  


  
 We are the fullness of him.  
We are the expression of his grace.  
We are the expression of his glory.  
We are the expression of his kingdom.  
We are the expression of his power and personality.  
We are the expression of his fullness.  
Without us, he is not complete.  
 So every one of us is important in the body of Christ.  
He says He are members of the body of Christ.  
I love the way He puts it in 1st Corinthians 12, when you read from verse 27.  
He uses a term, members in particular.  
That means each one, each one, each one is important in this structure.  
 Each one of us, not only your spirit, but your physical body.  
 So that's why he brings the emblem, the physical body.  
He says, now, here is the bread.  
Here is the drink.  
He says, eat it.  
He says, drink it.  
He says, remember me.  
When you eat this bread, he says, remember me.  
Because this is the bread that was broken for you.  
It was broken so that you would be whole.  
It was broken so you would never be broken.  
It was broken so that you'd be healthy and strong.  
He says, eat it as you eat it.  
He says, remember me.  


  
 He says, but Son do it irreverently.  
Son do it in the wrong manner.  
He says, for this reason, let's go there.  
First Corinthians chapter 11, say this with me, I'll never be sick again in my life.  


  
 You see, when I didn't know it, I got sick.  
When I didn't know it, I was taken off with fever and all kinds of things when I didn't know it.  
That was a time of ignorance.  
That was when I didn't know it.  
But now I have found out, no really God, I have found out, hallelujah.  
I found out, whoa, no really God.  
I found out.  


  
 Manuma, I've found house.  
First Corinthians chapter 11.  
First Corinthians chapter 11, where we're reading from verse 27.  


  
Are you there now?  
 Great, where for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord on whatily shall the purity of the body and blood of the Lord.  
 But let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of the cup.  
For he that eat it and drink it, unworthily, eat it and drink it, damnation to himself.  
Not discerning the Lord's body.  
I want you to notice that again.  
He says, he that eat it and drink it unworthily, eat it and drink it, damnation to himself.  
Condemnation to himself.  
 He speaks here concerning Christ and the church.  
He speaks here spiritually.  
He's not talking about the communion of the bread and the cup.  
Because in the 10th chapter, he explained it to us.  
He said, the bread which we break.  
He said, it's not ordinary bread.  
It's not just eating and drinking.  
He said, it is the communion of the body of Christ.  
He said, the cup that we drink.  
 We're not just drinking something.  
He said, it is the communion of the blood of Christ.  
He says, it's a matter of communion.  
It's a matter of sharing.  
It's a matter of fellowship.  
It's a matter of partnership.  
It is not the drinking.  
It is not the remembering of something.  
It is what?  
The communion.  
We are dealing with communion here.  
He says, it's a fellowship that's important here.  
We're not just remembering that somebody died.  
It's more than somebody died.  
It's what it signified.  
What was the reason for the deaths?  
He died that I'm alive.  
 You see that?  
So he says, that bread is the communion.  
The eating of that bread is the communion of the body of Christ.  
The drinking of that cup is the communion of the blood of Christ.  
Then he says, we, being many, are one bread and one body.  
Now he tells us.  
 Anyone who eats and drinks on wazidi eats and drinks damnation to himself.  
It is not God that is damning him.  
It is not God that is condemning him.  
That man or woman is bringing condemnation to himself.  
What does this mean?  
As he is the living bread, he is the living word.  
Didn't you notice?  
He said, if you believe in me, you live forever.  
 Then he said, if you eat my flesh and drink my blood, you live forever, that means they're one and the same thing.  
So eating his bread and the blood, his body and his blood, is the same thing as digesting his word.  
Hearing and believing and eating, acting on it, that is what it's all about.  
But here's the big thing about this stuff.  
Why people get sick?  
 He says, because they do not discern the body of Christ.  
Now, if you speak wrongly about the word or misuse the word, you can get sick.  
You see, people who use the word have got carelessly?  
They use the word carelessly.  
They are eating and drinking on water.  
 They are bringing the word to distribute.  
You see that?  
They are treating the word lightly, and the Bible says, he that despises the word shall be destroyed.  
You see that?  
He shall be crushed.  
He shall be defeated in life.  
So you're careful with the word of God.  
You become serious with the word.  
You don't play with the word.  
This word is your life.  
That's so important.  
 No, he has another thing that he lets us understand in communion.  
Because he says, we are members one of another.  
This is so big.  
We are members one of another.  
If I criticize you and talk evil about you, then that evil begins to manifest in my body.  
Because the source of the trouble must be found.  
It will be traced to you, to your body.  
 That's what he's saying.  
He says, he that eat it and drink it unwazily.  
Eat it and drink it damnation to himself.  
He says, because they do not discern the body of Christ.  
They don't understand the body.  
That I am connected to you.  
Now notice, he says, our physical bodies are involved in the structure.  
So I am there like, maybe I'm just a finger.  
You are not a finger.  
The other one is a leg.  
 So, if I start causing trouble from here, I'm causing it to the whole body.  
But if you want to find out and treat it, you must locate the problem.  
The problem is in the head.  
Oh, Brother John, you have the problem?  
 So the Holy Spirit, when he looks at the church and is fixing the problems in the church, he has to locate the source of the problem.  
This one with the bitterness, since the end with the bitterness, he says, you are the one.  
You are causing problem in the body of Christ.  
And the body has to be healthy.  
He says, I'm coming for a body without spots, without wrinkle, without any such thing.  
 So when he's looking for how to remove the evorus in the church, then he's going to you because you are where the sickness is.  
Why?  
Because you brought damnation.  
You brought condemnation.  
You opposed yourself.  
Now let me show you another thing.  
In 2 Timothy 2, let me show you something.  
2 Timothy 2.  


  
 I can never be bitter in my life.  
I told you before, I have never met somebody that I didn't like.  
I can't have someone that I don't like.  
I don't know where that person, which words that person will come from.  
I love everybody God made.  
Hallelujah.  
 It's important.  
You see, you have to live a higher life.  
There's a higher life in Christ.  
The way you don't look at people according to what they do or say.  
You live above them.  
You look at them according to who they really are.  
And what they are is described by the words.  
Jesus has bought them with the price.  
You look at them from that perspective and love them because God loves them.  
 Never treat people the way they treated you.  
Never look at them and regard them the way they regarded you.  
Leave a higher life.  
That's the only way you can pull them up too.  
But if you stoop down and say, because they talk to me like this, I would rather go down.  
Either of living the higher life, you bring condemnation to yourself.  
But going down, don't go down.  
Stay up.  
Let's show you this.  
Second Timothy.  
 Chapter 2, I want to read to you from verse 24.  
And I want you to notice what it says and what it does not say.  
In 2nd Timothy chapter 2 from verse 24, says, And the servant of the Lord must not strive  
 But be gentle.  
Who, the servant of the Lord?  
He says, must not strive.  
He must not be involved in unnecessary fighting.  
But be gentle, unto all men, after teach.  
Patient, uh-huh.  
Patient, about the patient.  
Patient.  
Patient.  
Then in verse 25, in mittness,  
 Doing what?  
Instructing.  
The word instructing there refers to what we call educating, teaching, training.  
He says, the servant of the Lord must not strive, but must be patient, educating.  
 Educating who?  
Those that oppose themselves.  
If God, now I want you to notice some things.  
First is a line there, those that oppose themselves.  
What is the meaning of those that oppose themselves?  
I'll explain it to you and it's important.  
There are two types of people that the Bible shows us can be found in the church who oppose.  
The first group,  
 are those you would find in chapter three of the same book.  
Second Timothy chapter three, when you read from verse five to verse eight.  
Then he likens them to Genesis and Jambres who opposed Moses.  
He says these men resist the truth.  
He says they have a form of godliness, but they deny the power of it.  
He says they have deceived us, they are wicked.  
Then he says to Timothy, be careful of them, avoid them.  
 You see that?  
He says, avoid them.  
Why?  
Because they are not teachable.  
They oppose.  
It says they resist the truth.  
He's not talking about sinners outside.  
He's talking about people inside.  
They resist the truth.  
So he says, avoid them.  
Then there is another group.  
He says they oppose themselves.  
He didn't say they oppose the truth.  
They oppose themselves.  
 they oppose, they stand against themselves.  
They are like, they go like this and turn again against themselves.  
So they take one step forward and take another step backward.  
So they go like this and say, I am healed.  
Oh, I am sick.  
I claim my job.  
Oh, I'm looking for a job.  
 He says they oppose themselves.  
They go back and forth.  
He says, it's a matter of positioning.  
They position themselves like this and then suddenly they set themselves against themselves.  
Then he says, he says to Timothy, in sickness, educate them.  
You see that?  
This one says they can be trained.  
They can be changed.  
He says, train them in sickness.  
Be patient with them.  
 So that God will give them repentance.  
I want us to read.  
Are you seeing it?  
Let's read it.  


  
Verse 25 again, in meekness, instructing those that oppose themselves, if God per adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.  
That is a prognosis of the truth.  
You see, he wants them to come to a full understanding, a full knowledge of God's reality.  
 Look at verse 26 to show you what kind of people they are.  
He says, and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by the devil at his will.  
You see, anytime the devil wanted to take them and use them, he did.  
He took them captive at his own will, anytime.  
Now another translation says, he uses them to carry out his own will and purposes.  
 But he says it's God, by adventure, grant him repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth.  
He says that they may recover themselves, that they may become sober.  
He says that their eyes should cry up.  
The Greek understanding there is like a man who has been drunk and has been his behaving.  
Then he does not become sober.  
His eyes have cleared.  
And he says, ah, now I understand.  
So until he had an understanding, he was behaving foolishly.  
 He was behaving abnormally, even though he thought he was normal.  
But in the spiritual realm, he was not normal.  
You see that?  
I'm healed.  
Oh, I'm sick.  
He's a kind of madness.  
So that's what the Bible says, that if God will grant him repentance.  
Now, in the etymology of English words, okay, repentance is from the word repent.  
It comes from one word, re, which denotes a returning.  
 Now, paint means the top.  
So it actually means a toning back to the top of the level of life that God has given you.  
You see that?  
So God will pay attention, grant them a toning back to the top so that they no longer will be taken by the devil out his will.  
So they must be trained, educated, patiently.  
 Praise God.  
Now that's so important because that's what he lets us know when he says he that eat it and drink it unwordily, eat it and drink it damnation to himself.  
He brings that sickness to himself as he accuses that brother, as he abuses that brother.  
The sickness is coming back to him.  
He finds it in his body.  
Now he becomes weak and sickly.  
His face does not work.  
 But he doesn't know why his faith does not work.  
Is that brother at work that you're always accusing?  
Is that neighbor of yours that you're always talking against?  
You see it?  
He says, for this cause, many are weak, and sickly among you, and many die.  
It's because they do not discern the body of Christ.  
You see it now?  
You want to live a healthy sound life?  
They discern the body of Christ.  
 Understand that we are members together of the same body.  
We are one bread.  
So every time you take that communion, remember, that body was broken for us, that we might be one.  
Praise God.  
And my health does something about your health.  
Imagine, because I'm healthy and strong, I can share the Word of God with you.  
You see that?  
Now look at what you're benefiting from what I'm sharing with you.  
Now think about everybody else who's here.  
 Sometimes we don't know what we gain from one another.  
But the Holy Spirit can minister through us.  
There's someone who's praying for you who doesn't even know you.  
The Bible says, likewise, the Spirit also, 26th verse of the eight chapter of Book of Romans.  
Likewise, the Spirit also helped but are infirmities for we know not what to pray for.  
It didn't say we know not how to pray, but we know not what to pray for as we arch.  
We don't know who we are going to be praying for.  
 We don't know what the condition is.  
We don't know what is happening to that person.  
We don't know what is the real cause of the problem.  
But as I speak in tongues and groaned in the Spirit, God is praying for brother so and so, but the Holy Ghost.  
He says, He that knoweth the mind of the Spirit.  
That's the Holy Spirit.  
You see, that Holy Spirit prays for you two groanings that cannot be ordered as you pray.  
You are not able to say that so quickly.  
 But God knows what is the mind of the Spirit.  
You see that?  
That's why we need every one of us healthy and strong because we don't know who was God's choice for Him to minister for you and to pray for you and to intercede for you.  
Every brother is important.  
Every sister is important.  
That job you've been looking for.  
Maybe is that very person that you've been condemning, that Holy Spirit had chosen to manifest Himself through and intercede for you.  
 Let me tell you one of the secrets in it to understand about God.  
He helps us primarily through people who know us.  
Primarily.  
He can, in a secondary format, use anybody.  
But in a primary way, he functions to help us first by those who know us.  
He makes them pray for us.  
He reminds them to help us.  
Because he knows that we live in a physical world where we deal with relationships.  
Listen.  
 If God tells someone who knows you already to give you something, and yet that person says, it has been for three months now that the Spirit of God has been telling me to give you this thing.  
I've just been, I don't know how I've been resisting it.  
Three months, He knows you.  
How much more I visit you?  
How much more is stranger?  
If it got three months to finally convince someone that knows you to give you what He was supposed to give you, how much more the person that does not know you take in five years?  
 But what you will be praying, because God is holding him responsible.  
Look at Daniel.  
Daniel prayed.  
He fasted.  
How long did he take?  
Three weeks before the angel finally brought what he was sent.  
 Now, imagine, what did the angel say to Daniel?  
He said, 21 days ago, your voice was heard in heaven.  
21 days.  
What have you been waiting for?  
He says, I was willing up there.  
He said, there was a fight.  
Until there was reinforcement, he took three weeks for reinforcement in angelic realm.  
What about human realm?  
Now, I want you to understand why everybody is so important to you.  
 All those you know, don't take anybody like it.  
He says, for this cost, many are weak and sickly among you and many die.  
He said, because they do not discern the body of Christ, they have no understanding of the body of Christ.  
So they think this is just about bread and cup, but it's more than bread and cup.  
Hallelujah.  
That's the reason you're in the case, you're in.  
 You may have been born with this certain infirmity.  
Born with it.  
Meanwhile, your parents would have known what to do to remedy the situation if that sister that the Holy Spirit asked to pray, had prayed, prayed for your parents.  
They would have been guided to do the right thing that would have saved your life.  
But no, now you have grown up with the trouble.  
You don't know who is responsible.  
You won't know until the day of judgment.  
But then you have lived out your life on earth.  


  
 You see that?  
Now you see, so someone else will be responsible for my life.  
No, someone else is not responsible for your life.  
You are responsible for your life.  
That's why I'm telling you that you are responsible for your brothers and sisters.  
Think rightly about them.  
Talk rightly about them.  
Because whatever you do for them will come back to you.  
You see that?  
And whatever you do, engage them will come back to you.  
 It will be found, it will be located in your leg.  
That wound that does not heal is your bitterness that does not live.  
You see that?  
It will be located to you.  
You say, hey, hey, no wonder.  
God didn't didn't remove it.  
Aspirin didn't remove it.  
God started didn't remove it.  
Our day didn't remove it.  
Forgiveness, we take it away.  
You see it?  
It reminds me of a certain story that Shambak told about a woman that had not received the Holy Spirit for years.  
 She had been in the church, but she didn't receive the Holy Spirit.  
Everybody had prayed for her.  
She couldn't receive the Holy Spirit.  
She couldn't speak in tongues.  
She was there.  
There was another lady in the same church, the Hadi Gauta.  
Every healing service she had been present, but never got healed.  
 So one day, the pastor said he was sitting on the platform on a Sunday morning as they were sitting coming into the church.  
And these two ladies, he noticed that one of them was already in the church.  
And the second one came and wanted to sit down and notice it was that of that woman.  
He didn't know they had trouble, but he was watching.  
And when she noticed that it was that of that woman that was there,  
 You know, she wanted to live.  
This one was the one that had not received the Holy Spirit.  
The other one was the one that had the goita.  
He said he was watching them and noticed that, oh, there was something between them.  
So he walked down to them and said, I'm tired of this.  
In hell, then he said, but if you better get together, you get out of the church.  
And then they broke down and said, they cried.  
 One of them said, it was my fault.  
The other one said, it was my fault.  
Then they hugged each other.  
When they hugged each other, the guy that disappeared.  
And the other women started speaking in tongues.  
Right there.  
Are you still there?  
How much will it cost you to live the right life that you need to live?  
 How much really cost you?  
I never forget.  
We're in the healing school one day.  
And a man was in the wheelchair.  
His wife was pushing him in the wheelchair.  
And then for some reason, you know, I was standing right in front of him.  
And then for some reason, because I was ministering to people, and I got very close to them.  
For some reason, whatever age was the woman did, I don't even know.  
And he turned in anger and hit her.  
 He was a very, I mean, he didn't look like he was mad.  
He wasn't mad.  
He hit her and frowned at her.  
And I looked.  
Then I turned to him.  
I said, so you want to be here?  
He said, yes.  
With a nice smile.  
I said, all right, you come back in two weeks time.  
He said, please.  
I came from the east.  
Please.  
I don't live in Lagos.  
 I said two weeks time.  
T.S.  
came out of his eyes.  
The wife was looking at me.  
I said two weeks time.  
Thank you.  
I don't know.  
I want you to understand.  
Here he was.  
He couldn't move by himself.  
He couldn't get up.  
His wife was taking care of him.  
Yes!  
The very person that was taking care of him was the one he was beating.  
 No, I'm trying to tell you how wicked human beings can be.  
Don't be deceived by someone's physical condition.  
A physical situation doesn't change the state of a man's spirit.  


  
 That's why someone can be dying.  
He's dying.  
He's on the deathbed.  
The doctors are ready.  
They say, he's going to die now.  
Any moment.  
He says, please call for my family.  
Call for my family.  
Then the family members will now come.  
He says, house one, give it to John.  
House two, give it to Mary.  
That's my son.  
That richard.  
He says, food.  
I will never forgive him.  
 Richard is a fool.  
Don't give him anything.  
Don't give anything.  
Don't give anything.  
He is dying.  
He has not forgotten what Richard did to him.  
He is dying.  
Richard is a fool.  
Don't give anything.  
At my labor, make sure you call it a house for him.  
Even if I got to have a restaurant in debt, he is dying.  
 No, I'm trying to let you know that a man's physical condition will not alter the state of his spirits.  
That's a wickedness.  
He's a pollutant of the spirits.  
It must be removed.  
Are you hearing me?  
Everything that is not like Christ must be ejected from your spirits.  
 Don't allow it, refuse to hate, refuse to dislike anybody, refuse to get angry with others.  
That anger that does not leave.  
Don't say if they forgive me, I'll forgive them too.  
Am I the only one that you forgive?  
No!  
No matter how they want to act, you become strict with God.  
You understand me?  
Don't worry about whether they like you or dislike you.  
Don't let it be your issue.  
Don't even think about it.  
No!  
 Christ in you, the hope of glory.  
Hallelujah.  
You see, one of the many times, some people ask me some questions.  
There are things they like to know.  
But you see, I can tell you this, I resolved many years ago to work in love and in love only and to see things from that perspective only.  
 I can never be bitter, never.  
I can't.  
It's too expensive.  
Do you understand?  
It's too expensive.  
When I was growing up, I was very wicked.  
But you understand, now my parents, especially my mom, could tell that I was terrible.  
But she doesn't even know how wicked I really was.  
Because even though I was small,  
 If somebody did something against me, I wished I could kill him and I meant it.  
If I could have done it, I would have done it.  
I was very wicked.  
Very, very wicked.  
It's true.  
You see, but because I was small, you wouldn't have known.  
But the wickedness was inside.  
How was it there?  
I don't know.  
 But it was there, why?  
Well, it has to, there must have been some walking with Satan somewhere, because you can't have anything like that without the devil.  
But see, when I received Christ into my heart, and I was born again and filled with the Holy Spirit, the same way my fears disappeared, my ability to hate and be bitter disappeared.  
 They all dissipated.  
I couldn't think like that anymore.  
I seem to love everybody.  
You couldn't talk evil of anybody around me.  
I would say, but that guy is nice.  
And I meant it.  
Sometimes they said, yeah, tell you everybody is nice.  
But that's the way I thought about it.  
You see it?  
That's the way I thought about it.  
That's the way I could see things.  
That's the way I could regard people.  
And then many years after that, all I could do was just see that way.  
 and functioning love.  
Are you hearing me?  
So I love everybody.  
Are you hearing me?  
Then most especially when I get to meet someone, I just can't think of anything about you that's not lovable.  
You are wonderful.  
And that's the way I really think.  
Now when you think like this, your health is as then shall your health spring up.  
Your strength, your ability to see,  
 and the way the Holy Spirit can walk in your life.  
All of these things will just multiply.  
The grace of God in your life will multiply.  
You don't care about what others think about you.  
I remember a few years ago, when they were writing all kinds of things about me on newspapers and talking about television, I never really cared.  
I never got bitter.  
I couldn't think evil or think angry about anybody.  
No!  
 No, a thousand times, no.  
It just wasn't part of my system.  
I never went back to God in prayer.  
Oh, God, why are all those things happening?  
Oh, God, you must vindicate me.  
I didn't talk like that.  
Are you hearing me?  
I had a certain kind of excitement inside me for a reason, for a reason.  
The Bible says, the righteous, you'll come out of trouble.  
 You see that?  
I just knew.  
I just knew one thing.  
It'll turn out for my good.  
I just knew inside.  
I had inside information that I couldn't go down.  
I could only go up.  
I had a different attitude to all those things.  
It's important.  
 And this will help you in your health.  
This is the way to fight cancer.  
This is the way to fight all kinds of sicknesses in your physical body.  
Satan can't stand love.  
I tell you, this one thing that Satan cannot resist is the power of love.  
He flees before love.  
Hallelujah.  
Are you still there?  
 Refused to be bitter about somebody who could help you and didn't help you.  
They say, my uncle could have helped me, but he refused to help me.  
Refused to be bitter.  
Refused to be bitter.  
Yeah.  
They look at my condition.  
Is somebody that cost it?  
Look at my condition.  
No, don't worry about those who cost it.  
Think about the one that can take it away.  
 His name is Jesus.  
He's the one that can change everything.  
He says, all things, all things, all things are possible to Him that believers.  
I don't know what your condition is today.  
But I can assure you, you are in for a miracle.  
Hallelujah.  
You're in for a miracle.  
God would touch you today.  
 Spirit God will touch you today.  
Yes, yes, yes, yes.  
That infirmity will not remain in your body.  
You have come to your place of health.  
You have come to your place of strength.  
Yes, the Lord is with you.  
As a mighty terrible one.  
And you be a terror to your adversaries.  
Can you shall amen somebody?  
 Say this with me.  
Say this with me.  
I made up my mind to walk in love.  
I made up my mind to walk in the light of God's Word.  
I made up my mind to function according to God's Word.  
I made up my mind to see others  
 with the eyes with which God sees them, only with compassion.  
Why do you think that brother misbehaves to you?  
Why do you think that sister dislikes you?  
Why do you think that brother says unkind things about you because they don't really know you?  
If they knew you, they wouldn't talk like that.  
That's the truth.  
 So forgive them because they are shortsighted.  
They don't know everything about you.  
They then really knew your heart.  
They wouldn't think about you the way they do.  
Can you see why you must forgive them?  
Because they are not God.  
They don't know how wonderful you really are.  
That's the fact.  
That's the fact.  
Hallelujah.  
Some people called you wicked when you were not wicked.  
You are the only one who was willing to help them, but they didn't know it.  
 And now you have become angry too.  
No, don't stoop down to their level.  
Remain that kind person that you are and say, I will cover them with the umbrella of my kindness in the name of Jesus.  
Lift your hands up high and pray in the Holy Ghost.
