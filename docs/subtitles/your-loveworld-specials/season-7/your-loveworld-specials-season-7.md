title: Your Loveworld Specials Season 7 Phase 7 Day 3
---
 want to join you and help you fulfill God's plan for your life.  


  
 I feel this in my bones, people, for you are feeling it.  
I'm telling you.  
We've got to display the Ministry of the Spirit today.  
Something that is so incredibly powerful to change the world.  
We must not lose today's opportunity to reach the whole world for Jesus Christ.  
This is your love world.  
I want to share a few things with you.  


  
 We began discussing these important truths in the world on day one, which was day before yesterday, especially on eternal life.  
And I thought today that I would  
 I would do a major series on eternal life sometime soon.  
It'll help you immensely.  
I did touch a little bit on it during the phase season three, phase five.  
In fact, I think  
 because I've never seen it anywhere.  
I think that one of the beautiful things that you would have gained also in your love or specials would be some kind of information in God's word.  
For example, for example, I defined for you eternal life.  
I don't think you ever had a definition of eternal life.  
 And that's the reason I had to bring it to you.  
Because I knew that the church had not been given a definition of eternal life.  
So the English term eternal life, or sometimes everlasting life, and we try to distinguish between those two, mere semantics, but then are  
 The fact that it is the life that Jesus brought made it so important that we needed to know what it meant.  
What is eternal life?  
What is eternal life?  
What does it mean?  
So when the Bible says eternal life, what was it talking about?  
 You would have to understand the scriptures to be able to define eternal life.  
You would have to know what the Bible says about God, about deity, divinity, Jesus Christ, idolatry,  
 You'll have to know what the Bible says about all of that.  
And about life itself.  


  
And yet, I gave you a very simple but profound definition of eternal life.  
And I told you to write it down.  
 So for those of you who have been a part of this for at least up to including that period would have it.  
So I told you that eternal life is the life and nature of God.  
Now that is very simple.  
But then  
 I gave you the definition that helps it.  
It is the organic and existential attributes of deity.  
In those few words,  
 You have the distinguishing factors, everything that separates our God from all that may be called gods.  


  
As said, it's the organic and existential attributes of deity.  
 In other words, these attributes, because anyone can be called a deity.  
But these attributes must be organic, and they must be existential.  
You can only find that in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as expressed in Jesus Christ.  
 That's what makes it so beautiful because we don't see him.  
And so we could claim anything, we could say, you know, God, we could call him God, but who is he when you don't see him?  
And that's why many have represented God, whatever they think he is, with some stone, with some wood, with some shape.  
 The build is massive idols, great shrines, and we see their gods with eyes that don't see.  
Hands they have, but the hands don't move.  
And even if they move, they're swinging by some, whatever, some man has to make them sing.  
They can't do anything.  
Where you put them is where they remain, until somebody carries them from there.  
 What kind of gods are these?  
But these are the gods that many worship, the god that they have to carry, that have ears that don't hear.  


  
But when we talk about our god, you can't find him.  
You can't find him.  
You can't find him.  
So somebody can say, well, that means it doesn't exist.  
 Because you can't find him, but then he came to us in Jesus Christ.  
He came to us in Jesus Christ.  
And I showed you that this Jesus is himself God.  
Oh, hallelujah.  
The day you discover who Jesus is, it will change everything for you.  
 Change everything for you.  
And that's why I like to talk about him.  
I like the whole world to know.  
See, he sent me to tell you.  
See, that's why I tell you who he is.  
That's why, that's why I explained to you the divinity of Jesus.  
So you know who he is.  


  
 Let me read you two portions of the Bible.  
One that I read to yesterday and then I read it into another verse.  
Everywhere I look at the Bible, I see Jesus is God.  
You can't run away from it.  
 And why is this so important?  
You know, I had some arguments with certain Christians through the years when I said, Jesus is God and they say, not quite.  
I said, so if he's not God, who is he?  
They say he's the son of God.  
I said, you don't understand the meaning of son of God then.  
They thought I was kind of maybe assuming or  
 trying to construct something for the Bible.  
But no, it's all about the Scriptures.  
So let's read again yesterday what I gave to you.  
First John chapter five, in verse number 20.  
And you add this to all the others that I've been sharing along these lines.  
 And we know that the Son of God has come and had given us an understanding that we may know Him that is true.  
And we are in Him that is true, even in His Son, Jesus Christ.  
This is the true God and eternal life.  
And I read to you from the Living Bible.  
Let's read it from T.L.B.  
 And right after that, we'll read from the AMPC.  
And we know that Christ, God's Son, has come to help us understand and find the true God.  
And now we are in God because we are in Jesus Christ, His Son.  
Did you see that line?  
No, we are in God because we are in Jesus Christ, His Son.  
Who is the only true God?  
Look at that.  
 Jesus Christ, the Son, who is the only true God, and He is eternal life.  
Oh, blessed be God.  
Look at it from the amplified translation.  
 and we have seen and know positively that the Son of God has actually come to this world, like that, has actually come to this world and has given us understanding and insights progressively to perceive, recognize, and come to know better and more clearly him who is true, and we are in him who is true.  
In his son, Jesus Christ the Messiah,  
 This man is the true God in life eternal.  
Hallelujah.  
Okay.  
So let me take you now to first John chapter one from verse number two.  
First from the King James translation.  
For the life was manifested and we have seen it.  
Listen, we just read this.  
He's the true God and eternal life.  
 That Jesus Christ is the true God and eternal life.  
Now, here this is, for the life was manifested and we have seen it.  
And bear witness and show unto you, that eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested unto us.  
Hi.  
You know, I read this scriptures and sometimes I don't know what to do with myself for joy, you know?  
I'm thinking, Lord,  
 How the world needs to know it.  
The whole world needs to hear this.  
Let me read it to you from the living Bible, what we just saw.  


  
This one, who is life.  


  
This one, who is life from God, has been shown to us.  
 And we guarantee that we have seen him.  
I'm speaking of Christ.  
Who is eternal life?  
Did you hear that Christ is eternal life?  
This is I'm speaking of Christ.  
Who is eternal life?  
He was with the Father and then was shown to us.  
Christ is eternal life.  
Do you get it?  
 Here comes Jesus in the street.  
You're told this man is life encapsulated in a human body.  
It's beyond comprehension.  
You cannot comprehend this with your mentality.  
 You can only receive this with your spirit.  
How can life, do you know what life is?  
How can life be encapsulated in the body?  
But that's what the word says.  
It says the life was manifested and we have seen it.  


  
Go to the new living translation.  


  
 This one.  
Who is life itself?  
Oh, Lord.  
This one who is life itself was revealed to us.  
And we have seen him.  
And now we testify and proclaim to you that he is the one who is eternal life, the emphasis.  
Look at it, the emphasis in one verse.  
 So much is said in one verse.  
You can run away from it.  
That's right again.  
He says, this one who is life itself.  
So Jesus was more than a prophet.  
He was more than a rabbi.  
He was more than a great man.  
Next time you think about Jesus, look beyond what all the scholars of this world have told you.  
 Look, he says, this one who is life itself, Jesus Christ, life itself was revealed to us.  
In other words, the apostles were convinced Jesus was God.  
That's what he's writing about.  
That's what John's saying.  
And you read Peter says the same thing.  
You read Paul says the same thing.  


  
 So in Christianity, a major doctrine which had been lost to so many because they weren't taught is that Jesus is God.  


  
Hear his own words, he that has seen me, has seen the Father, anyone who has seen Jesus Christ has seen God.  
 The Bible says, God was in him, in Christ, reconciling the world to himself.  
Those are the words of Paul.  
God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself.  
Not counting their sins against them.  
He was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself.  
Look at it.  
 Second Corinthians chapter five and verse 19.  
Tell it that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself.  
So when we talk about what Jesus came to do, he came to reconcile the world, but who was he?  
Was he just a good man?  
If he were just a man, he wouldn't qualify to die for us because the Bible says, all have seen him come shut on the glory of God.  
So how could he if he were only a man?  
 How could it qualify for our redemption?  
How could it's blood?  
The adequate for the sacrifice for salvation could never be.  
But the Bible says, through this man is preached unto you, the remission of sins.  
And by him, all I believe are justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the Lord of Moses.  


  
 It's extraordinary.  
It's extraordinary.  
Extraordinary.  
Oh, D. Oh, D.  
 Let's finish reading that the new living translation where we were in 1 John.  
Yeah.  
This one who is alive itself was revealed to us and we have seen him and now we testify and proclaim to you that he is the one who is eternal life.  
He was with the father and then he was revealed to us.  
Hallelujah.  
See, this is  
 In the beginning, when he says he was with the father, that's what he's telling you.  
In the beginning was the word.  
And the word was with God.  
And the word was God.  
He says, and he was revealed to us.  
The word became flesh and dwelt among us.  
And we beheld his glory.  
That's what he's telling me.  


  
 in St.  
John's Gospel, chapter one, and verse number 18.  
No man had sinned God at any time.  
Oh boy, I love this one.  
No man had sinned God at any time.  
The only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.  
 Do you know what he just said?  
He says, the only begotten son, Jesus Christ, he says, which is in the bosom of the Father hath declared him.  
The word declared is from the Greek, exegil my.  
Now, exegil my means to rehearse.  


  
It means to unfold.  
 Right?  
Unfold.  
Declare.  
Rehearse.  
So what is telling you is that Jesus rehearsed divinity to us.  
Oh, why would he do that?  
Oh, my goodness.  
He rehearsed divinity to us.  


  
 So what we saw was a practice for us to see.  
He came to show us God.  
He came to rehearse divinity to us, the life of the kingdom, the way to live.  
He came to show us, no wonder the Bible says he has given us an example that we should follow his steps.  
You see it?  
 Look at it in first Peter chapter two from verse 21.  
Let's read from verse 21.  
First Peter chapter two.  
For even here unto where he called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example that is you follow his steps.  
See, he rehearsed divinity.  
He rehearsed righteousness.  
He rehearsed the God life to us.  
He came to live before us so we can know.  
 what God is like.  
If you have seen me, he said, you have seen the Father.  
Hallelujah.  
Who could have talked like that?  
Anybody talked like that?  
Who talked like that?  
When the soldiers were sent to go get him.  
 They stood there to hear his words.  
They went back without him.  
They said, why have you come without him?  
And they said, no man ever spoke like this man.  
No man ever spoke like this man.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, dear.  
Amazing.  
Amazing.  
Amazing words.  
Amazing words.  
When you're reading  
 First, let me give it to you for Ephesians chapter five.  
I'm gonna read to you from verse one into verse two, and I want you to follow this.  
Be there for followers of God as dear children.  
We just read one, all right, where he says he's given us an example.  
I wish you follow his steps because he came to unveil God.  
 You see, that's what it came to do.  
He came to rehearse God.  
So he gave us an example that we should follow his steps.  
Now he says, be there for followers of God.  
The word followers means it's from the Greek memetes.  
Memetes is referring to be an imitator, to copy another.  
 Do you see that?  
To copy another.  
Be therefore imitators of God.  
How can you imitate God when you haven't seen him?  
The only way you can imitate him is when you see.  
And that's why Jesus came to rehearse God.  
So we can see.  
 Now, you would notice it as I read it.  
Be there for followers, imitators of God, as dear children, beloved children.  
Watch, look at the next verse.  
And walk in love as Christ also had loved us.  
You see it?  
Christ showed us.  
He showed us how to love.  
See, we talk about God loves us, but how can you know God loves you until you see Jesus in action?  
Jesus in action.  
That was God at work.  
Hallelujah.  
 and walk in love as Christ also had loved us and had given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet spelling seven.  
Amazing.  
Hallelujah.  
In first a piece of John, St.  
John, chapter two, we're going to read from verse five, in verse six.  
But also keep at his word.  
In him verily is the love of God perfected.  
Hi.  
 This is so beautiful.  
Think of this, that the love of God is perfected in you, perfected.  
In other words, it's finalized.  
You have the complete love of God in your heart, Saqor Raba Khandiliha.  
You're not trying to get some of it.  
 It's not a question of, oh God, give me more love.  
He's not giving you more love.  
In you, verily, is the love of God perfected.  
Perfected, it is complete sealed.  
Delivered sealed.  
You can love as much as you want to.  
It's all in you.  
The God love is inside you.  
In you, the Bible says, verily is the love of God perfected.  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
He says, here, I know that we are in Him.  
 You see it?  
He that said he abided in him.  
Oh Lord.  
You know, when I studied the Bible, from one scripture to the other, it's always an exciting moment.  
Lord, which one?  
Where do I even stop?  
It's all just so beautiful.  
 Look at it.  
He that said he abided in him.  
If you say that you're in him, himself also to walk even as he walked.  


  
I have to hold myself because of this.  
I have to kind of appear dignified.  
I would have been removing this jacket.  
 So what?  
What's more?  
Do you know what he's telling you?  
He says, if you say that you abide in Christ, you ought to walk even as he walked.  
Do you know what he's telling you?  
That you can walk like God.  
Because to walk as Jesus walked.  
You can walk as Jesus walked.  
In other words, you can live like Jesus.  
You can be like Jesus.  
I get it.  
I get it.  
I get it.  


  
 I understand.  
I get it.  
I get it.  
You see, he gave us his life.  
We have the same life with him.  
We think like him.  
No one says, you have the mind of Christ, but you have the mind of Christ.  
Hallelujah.  
I have the mind of Christ.  
And I walk, even as he walks, glory be to God.  
He was never intimidated.  
Glory be to God.  
He was always a success.  


  
 So we ought to walk even as he walked.  
So, on Monday when you're going to work, you know that you are Jesus in a blouse or in a gown or in a suit.  
Because today, you are the manifestation of him.  
You are the expression of him.  
 Once that dawn's on your spirit, your life would take on a different meaning.  
You come out of religion.  
 You know, Christianity is not a religion.  
Don't be deceived.  
Those who don't know what it is think is a religion.  
No, the Bible says Christ in you, the hope of glory.  
When we say salvation, salvation in Christ means that you receive eternal life into your spirit.  
In other words, eternal life of God is imparted to your human spirit.  
And suddenly you become one with him in fellowship with God.  
Same life with him.  
 And that life supplants the human life which you were born of at the parents.  
And right away, this eternal life begins working in you.  
Sarugatura-angradiga-safastes.  
Yeah, yeah.  
God's people are getting it.  
They're getting it.  
They're getting it.  
They're getting it.  
Hallelujah.  
And you know what?  
This is what's changing the world today.  
 many discovering who they are in Christ Jesus.  
Discovering that when they came to Christ, they didn't come to a religion.  
You know, years ago, I was trying to witness a gentleman.  
The moment I started, he said, I'm not interested in religion.  
I said, I didn't bring you religion.  
I didn't bring you religion.  
I'm not discussing religion.  
 I'm discussing Jesus.  
I'm talking about a person.  
They don't know him, so they think it's a religion.  
The Christian religion.  
No, all religions are the same.  
 Religion is about trying to reach out to God, trying to look for God, trying to discover who God is somewhere.  
And then you say, well, we can't find him, so we're representing with something.  
In Christianity, he came to look for us.  
The Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.  
He came to seek and to save us.  
 Even from the very beginning, he wasn't Adam.  
He wasn't Adam who was saying, Adam, an Eve saying, God, where are you?  
We need you, no?  
It was God who came.  
Adam, where are you?  
It was Adam who was hiding.  
It wasn't God that was lost.  
It was Adam who was hiding.  
And think about the foolishness of it, hiding from God.  
So he says, where are you?  
 Because I heard your voice, and I hit myself because I was naked.  
God said, who told you you naked?  
Who told you?  
Did you do what I told you not to do?  
Yeah, I am the lady who gave me, she was the one.  
She gave me to eat, and I did it.  
And God left the matter for the moment.  
And said, woman, what is this that you have done?  
Yeah, the serpent deceived me.  
 And God didn't have no dialogue with the serpent.  
He just cursed the serpent.  
But because he already blessed Adam, he could not curse Adam.  
He couldn't curse him.  
 Because the gifts and the calling of God are with our repentance.  
He can cast him.  
So he said, Adam, cast is the ground for your sake.  
Come, cast him.  
Said, because of you, because you're a blessed man and you've done this stupid thing, cast is the ground for your sake.  
Says, now the ground can't respond to you as it should.  
 But in his redemptive acts, all of that got reversed.  
Now, all nature responds to us in Christ Jesus.  
Did you remember what he said?  
This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
All nature was commanded to hear Jesus.  
 And Jesus said, in my name, go, exercise authority over all devils.  
We have authority over all demons of darkness.  
When we tell them to clear off, they clear off.  
Doesn't matter how far away.  
They listen, they obey.  
 because we are in Christ Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Now, the righteousness of Christ gave us this eternal life.  
This is important.  
It was His righteousness because He fulfilled God's will.  
We couldn't please God.  
Adam didn't please God.  
Adam disobeyed God.  
 But Jesus Christ is called the second and last Adam and he pleased God because he functioned as a man.  
The Bible says, being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, became obedient even unto death, the death of the cross.  
He humbled himself and that righteous act of Jesus  
 made eternal life possible for us.  
So let me read the scriptures to you.  
In Proverbs chapter 12 and verse 28, in the way of righteousness is life.  
Hallelujah.  
In the way of righteousness is life.  
 And in the path where they're off, there is no death.  
Oh boy, does that tell you something?  
You know what he's just, does that tell?  
You know, this is over an old testament.  
Does that tell you something?  
A principle you get when you come over in the new testament.  
Let me read to you again.  
In the way of righteousness is life.  
And in the path where they're off, there is no death.  
Hi.  
This is so huge.  
 To get it across to you, I've got to show you a few things.  
Go to Romans chapter five.  
Let's read from verse 18 to verse 21.  
Let's read.  
Okay.  


  
 brought judgment upon all, for the righteousness of the last Adam, Jesus Christ, brought righteousness and thus justification of life.  
Praise God, that's wonderful.  
All right, for us by one man's disobedience, many were made sinners.  
So by the obedience of one, shall many be made righteous.  
Glory be to God.  
Verse 20.  
 Moreover, the law erred that the offense might abound.  
But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound, talking about the law of Moses, and how that was brought in.  
Verse 21, that our sin had rained, hey, hey, hey.  
Oh, I need to take like maybe like a month to discuss this.  
That our sin had rained onto debts.  
 Even so might grace reign through righteousness onto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.  
Our sin had rained onto death.  
Even so might grace reign through righteousness.  
See why the understanding of righteousness is so important?  
Because grace, God's intention is for the grace of God that came in Jesus Christ to reign through righteousness.  


  
 until he says eternal life by Jesus Christ, our Lord.  
Okay, haven't gotten this idea, come back to what we just read in Proverbs chapter 12, verse 28, what we saw.  
He said, in the way of righteousness is life.  
You see that?  
So righteousness leads to life.  
 So he's telling you.  
And so he's out of righteousness, brought life because the end of righteousness is life.  
You see it?  
He never asked you to practice righteousness for nothing.  
It has an end.  
It has a result.  
Now, he says, in the way of righteousness is life.  
And in the pathway thereof, there is no death.  
In the pathway thereof, there is no death.  
 I want you to understand the construction of this language.  
In the pathway thereof, there is no death.  
Okay, so how do you describe that pathway?  
You call it what?  
Death free.  
It's a death free pathway.  
All right?  
A death free pathway.  
There is no death.  
 in this pathway of righteousness.  
Okay.  
Now you've got to romance chapter eight.  
We're going to read from verse one into verse two.  
I want you to notice.  
There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life.  
I told you about the law of life yesterday.  
 It's called the law of life or the law of the spirit of life.  
The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death.  
Now, the great construction of what you got here is not that he delivered you from the law of sin.  
Okay?  
 like you were in sin.  
So he brought you out from this sin or that he brought you out of death.  
Is it?  
That's you were in death.  
So he freed you from the conscious of death.  
No.  
He's saying the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had met me death free.  
 Like that pathway.  
He says, in the pathway thereof, there is no death.  
It's not like it's been freed from death.  
No, there is no death.  
This is a death-free pathway.  
So the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me what?  
Death-free.  
So there is no death in me.  
O Raseco, Arabande, Glorades, Kufrahes.  
 You know, God's people need to understand.  
Let me show you something.  
Let me show you something.  
In Romans 7, let's read from verse 23.  
You're going to get this.  
But I see another law in my members.  
That means the members of my body, all right?  
My physical body.  
He says, warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin, which is in my members.  
Look at verse 24.  
Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?  
 Do you get it now?  
The human body is called a body of deaths.  
Right from when a man, a woman is burned.  
Right from when you're burned.  
You've got deaths in you, deaths in your body.  
Why?  
Because that man lived a curse of deaths in the world.  
So he's born into deaths.  
 from the, we call it from the womb to the tomb.  
So right from the day is born, everything is being done to stop him from dying.  
Because he called it, he says, in dying you shall die.  
He said, in dying you shall die.  
So once he is born, every effort is being made by mother and father to stop him from dying.  
I thought he just gave birth to this child.  
 But you're trying to stop him from dying because the tendency is for him to die now if you don't give him food is gonna die I'm giving drink is gonna die right from the after he's born you're doing every effort to keep him alive Otherwise it's gonna die So he's in the body of death From when he's born or wretched man, right?  
He says who shall deliver me from the body of this death  


  
 Then he goes, look at the next verse.  
He says, I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  
Why?  
Because he's the one who brought the solution.  
That's what he just told you.  
The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me dead free.  
Hallelujah.  
Dead free.  
There is no death in me.  
So brachira alagastus.  
Prandola grown de glidahaste.  
 You see, God's people have to learn the language of the kingdom.  
He had said, so that you may boldly say, if you don't say it, you believe in the life of the ordinary man.  
You believe in the life of this world.  
You be functioning from a dead dull body.  
But he said, if the spirit of him that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also vitalize your model body by his spirit that lives in you.  
 Once a Holy Ghost has vitalized your model body, it's no longer dead doomed.  
And the generation of the church that catches this is the generation of the rapture.  
That's when the church has to get it.  
Because listen, remember, the Bible says by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see dead.  
 The rapture is not going to happen just like, gosh, and we say, oh, he's taking a look.  
Oh, I didn't know we're going.  
Oh, it's the day, it's the day.  
No, a thousand times, no, it's going to be by faith.  
He says, by faith, Enoch was translated that he should not see death.  
Before his translation, he had the testimony that he pleased God.  
And without faith, it is impossible to please him.  
For he that comment to God must believe that he is, and that he is a reward of them that diligently seek him.  
 That's important.  
So we're going to work in this world with such faith, with such understanding.  
Each one of us begin to say, the day is close.  
The day is close.  
We're going soon, Gloria, God hallelujah.  
Hallelujah.  
He said, who shall deliver me from this body of death?  
It's a body of death.  
 But the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made me debt free, sin free.  
He said, same shall not have dominion over you, for you are not on the law, but on the grace.  
Says, in the pathway thereof, there is no death.  
In the pathway thereof, this way that I live, in my pathway there is no death.  
 I'm the light of the world.  
I'm not a victim of the wicked.  
No, I'm not.  


  
 So you declare in my pathway there is no death.  
The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus had met me dead free.  
Send free.  
I walk in righteousness.  
Eternal life is not working in me.  
 I have the life of God in me, in my spirit, in my soul and in my body.  
He said, I pray God, your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless under the coming of the law.  
Preserve blameless.  


  
 Ah, yeah, yeah.  
Look at Jesus.  
The power says, the power says of Him, full of grace and truths, full of grace.  
And of His fullness, have all we received, grace for grace.  
Chate me in somebody.  


  
He says we have received of His fullness.  
God sent John's gospel.  
Let's take it from 14 into 16.  
 Chapter one.  
And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us.  
We beheld His glory.  
The glorious of the only begotten of the Father.  
Full of grace and truths.  
Aye.  
Full of truths.  
Can you think about someone that's full of truths?  
Full of reality.  
What was Jesus like?  
Here's the description.  
Full of grace and truths.  
Children ran to Him.  
 Sin has run to him.  
They're all away from him.  
They run to him.  
The sick came to him.  
The weak and the hungry came to him.  
What was Jesus like?  
Full of grace and truth.  
How?  
Next verse.  
 John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, this was he of whom I speak.  
He that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me, 16.  
And of his fullness have all we received in grace upon grace.  
This is grace heaped upon grace.  
Grace heaped upon grace.  
Read from the Amplified Translation.  
 For out of his fullness, abundance, we have all received, all had a share, and we were all supplied with one grace after another, and spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing, and even favor upon favor, and gift, heaped upon gift.  
 He's breaking down the meaning of the word grace there.  
So you understand what he's talking about.  
Grace heaped upon grace.  
Favour upon favor.  
Look at your life.  
Now that you're in Christ Jesus, your life must exude.  
Favour upon favor.  
Grace upon grace.  
So every day of your life, you say, I'm full of grace today.  
 from grace to grace, from grace to grace.  
I'm working the greater grace today than I did yesterday, than I did last year, than I did last month.  
A greater grace today, grace is working in me, grace heaped upon grace.  
Hallelujah.  
 I am full of grace, all this fullness I have received.  
Abund and grace.  
Before the Father, I am full of grace.  
I have grace before God.  
I have grace before men.  
I have grace everywhere.  
Glory to God.  
I am full of favor.  
Sarah goes to the man, Gleta Hagenes.  
 Have you seen some people?  
They got so much problem.  
They say, everywhere I go, people just dislike me.  
I don't know why.  
Everywhere I go, every job I've had in the last three years, they just make trouble for me and they kick me out.  
My brother, my sister, I know that there are such problems, but you know what?  
It's time to change it.  
Do what I'm telling you now.  
Change it.  
 Change it now and declare the name of the Lord Jesus Christ of His fullness.  
I have received grace, heaped upon grace.  
My life is full of grace.  
I want to share the Christian life.  
This is what it is.  
Onending grace.  
Onending grace.  
Every day of your life, there's more than enough grace for you today.  
 How could you have lived without this?  
How did you manage without this?  
How did you manage?  
How did you manage without this?  
Now begin a new journey of absolute success.  
Some of you have struggled too much.  
You've worked too hard and you've struggled too much.  
 You struggled so much to take care of your home.  
You struggled so much to take care of your spouse or your children.  
You struggled so much until the weight of the Lord you're carrying is like, oh, Lord, I'm carrying so much.  
Oh, God, look at what I'm doing.  
I'm carrying so much.  
Why are you?  
Ah, he says, take my yoke upon you.  
For my yoke is easy and my body is light.  
Come on, shout amen so much.  
 If you're doing it for the Lord, then his yoke is easy, and his burden is light.  


  
 What a life has given us.  
Stop carrying the law, casting your cares upon Him, for He cares for you.  
He cares.  
Can you trust Him?  
Begin today to trust Him.

For he's the power of God unto salvation to ever one that believe it to the Jew first and also to the Greek.  
Look at the next verse.  
For bearing, bearing in the gospel.  
He's the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.  
 My life is from faith to faith.  
You see, if you're walking in this righteousness, then your life is from faith to faith.  
See, the more we talk about the righteousness of God, the more our faith grows.  
Look what has just happened with you even in the last few minutes that I discussed the righteousness of God.  
See how your faith went up.  
Your faith soared.  
 Darren is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.  
As this written, the just shall live by faith.

To live in Christ is from faith to faith.  
And that means you've got to know the righteousness of God.  
In this gospel is revealed to you, the righteousness of God from faith to faith.  
My life is from faith to faith.  
 I don't have doubts.  
I don't have fears.  
I walk in faith.  
Did you see it?  
For we walk by faith, not by sight.  
We walk by faith, not by sight.  
We walk by faith, not by sight.  
We walk by faith, not by sight.  
We walk by faith, not by sight.  
We walk by faith, not by sight.

I walk by faith.  
Not by sight.  
I am prosperous.  
I walk by faith.  
Not by sight.  
Hallelujah!  


  
 Then come to this next one.  
Oh boy, this is big.  
Second Corinthians chapter three.  
And we are reading from verse 18.  
But we all, we're open face, beholding us in the glass.  
That's a mirror, the glory of the Lord.  
I changed, met him first.  
 into the same image.  
Hey, as we behold a glory of God in a mirror, God's mirror, the Word of God is God's mirror, the Bible says.  
So the more I read the Word of God, the more I see the glory of God.  
And it tells me that the Word is a mirror reflecting the glory of God.  
 He just told me by that that I am called the glory of God because it caused my reflection, the glory of God.  
If my reflection is the glory of God, I am the glory of God.  
Oh, I get it now.  
I see the life that Christ has given me.  
I am the glory of God.  
 My life is set for the glory of God.  
So every day that I live in this world, I live to the glory of God.  
I live to the glory of God.  
Now, look at it.  
Look at what he says.  
He says, we all with open face, beholding us in the glass, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, into the image of what I saw, that reflection.  
 Because he says, if I look at me, it don't look like the glory of God, but I look at the mirror, I see the glory of God, but that's my reflection.  
So I look at me, oh, stop looking this way, look that way.  
He says, because as long as you're looking at the mirror and looking at that reflection, he says, there's a metamorphosis, there's a transfiguration.  
 From glory to glory, the more I look, the more I'm transfigured, the more I look, the more I'm transfigured, from glory to glory.  
So I get it now.  
My life was designed by God to be from glory to glory.  
You see it?  
You have some people who say, well, you know, last year was better in business.  
This year has been terrible.  
 Last year was so wonderful, but this year, they always have this something about how things went down in their lives.  
You know, is it like we've been struggling?  
How are you?  
Rather, I say, well, we're struggling.  
They were struggling.  
They're struggling.  
No, I never struggled.  
No, no, no, no, a thousand times, no.  
No, no, no, we don't struggle.  
 We are royalty.  
Don't you get it?  
We're royalty.  
We don't struggle.  
Don't say we are struggling.

No.  
No, no, no.  
Not for us.
