title: Your Loveworld Specials Season 8 Phase 2 Day 2
---
 want to join you and help you fulfill God's plan for your life.  


  
 I feel this in my bones, people, for you are feeling it.  
I'm telling you.  
We've got to display the Ministry of the Spirit today.  
Something that is so incredibly powerful to change the world.  
We must not lose today's opportunity to reach the whole world for Jesus Christ.  
This is your love world.  
 Father in the name of the Lord Jesus, we thank you for your love, for your grace, for your kindness.  
Thank you for the Holy Spirit, our teacher, our guide.  
Thank you for giving us information.  
Thank you for guidance.  
Thank you for the enlightenment.  
In Jesus' name.  
 I want to welcome you to today's program.  
This is day two of season eight and phase two.  


  
The documentary that you just saw.  
 pretty enlightening.  
And it's important for us to realize that the sad chutes expressed there are still there today.  


  
 In 2020, I pointed out to you through this program that eugenics were the real ideas behind COVID.  


  
It's the same dream.  
That was what was behind the Holocaust.  


  
 And at that time I showed you several documentaries about the Holocaust, just to remind you about the reality of man's inhumanity to man, as they were building what they called isolation centers.  
I reminded you,  
 of the concentration centers, which eventually became extermination centers.  
You think those who were building them and your fishers who were given the immediate assignments and the contracts, you think they knew what they were doing?  
No, they didn't.  
 The masterminds were not on site.  


  
The masterminds were far away.  
And you studied the history properly.  
You'd find how even Hitler was lured into this.  
He didn't start out the idea of eliminating the Jews.  
 He was guided into it.  
He was guided into it.  


  
By the eugenicists.  


  
And it was a proud thing of the day.  
Many of the organizations bought the names.  
 They were glad to be identified with it.  
Especially after Francis Galton coined the term.  
They had been at it for long.  


  
 Because we have to understand how our world has evolved.  
Because many times people forget.  
They forget.  
Some, of course, didn't really know what they were told.  
And some of the sweet talk in school, in class.  
And they never asked the right questions.  
 Sometimes, of course, even if you didn't ask the question in class, because you would have never been given the right answers.  
Or at least within your heart, having the right questions.  
And then going forward to getting the answers.  


  
 For example, throughout Africa, the educational curriculum was based on British writings, including their own history that they studied in class.  
 I'm talking about the history of African nations, studied in their classrooms, were written for them by the British.  
Or at the very least, a lot of the information was given to them as it was given to their own people  
 In England, a simple example, a very simple example, where Mango Park was said to have discovered river Niger.  


  
But there were people living around river Niger in Nigeria.  
 And yet it was Mungo Park sent by the British government that discovered it.  
And so in the classrooms of Nigeria, the kids were taught that Mungo Park discovered river Niger.  
How stupid.  
 How could the children have been convinced to think so?  


  
He was okay in England to study that because he was sent to discover something for them.  
 So that's the way it was supposed to be.  
Yes, he discovered river Niger in Nigeria.  
He was sent to go find out about it.  
But the Nigerians should have never been taught that Mung Park discovered river Niger.  
Well, they were living there using the water from there.  


  
 and many other things.  
Just to give you an idea of those controls.  


  
Who was the minister of education when that was put into their history books?  
Who was he?  
 What was he thinking?  
Where were the commissioners of education in the various states, including the states that had the river Niger going through them?  
Where were they?  


  
Their minds were sleeping.  


  
 And so you can think of several other things like that.  


  
So today, who's looking into the books that the children are studying in schools, who's looking in?  
 Is there a structure to review what they're studying?  


  
Or after more than 60 years of the so-called independence?  
Is educational institution still dependent on the British curriculum?  


  
 So I wonder what they're thinking in Cameroon, in Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, all of Africa.  
You can think the same thing for a lot of the Asian countries.  
For South America and Central America, there are some differences.  


  
 So who's looking into what these children are studying in school as they're being taught some of the most terrible things today?  


  
So I call on you to look into the books that the kids are being asked to read.  
 Something has gone wrong.  
We showed a documentary the other day having to do with kids and what's happening in schools.  


  
Now, I've got quite a number of things to refer to here on that documentary.  


  
 But first, was it yesterday?  
I asked a question.  
I said, how come Israel didn't know about the Hamas attack?  
Well, it turns out everything I said to you yesterday was true.  
Here are the facts.  
 officials in Israel, some officials in Israel were informed.  
Three days before the attack, Egypt informed.  
Three days before the attack.  
Question, who were those that were informed?  
And what did they do about the information?  


  
 That's interesting.  
So I asked yesterday, I said, who was taken by surprise and who was not taken by surprise?  


  
So it's come out now.  
The three days before the attack, some people were informed that it was going to happen.  
 So who were these people?  
And what did they do with the information?  
What did they do with it?  
So yesterday, when I was telling you about the Illuminati, I was telling you something that was factual.  
I was telling you something that was factual.  
We have to understand the dynamics in our world.  
 how things have evolved to the present state and the goal of certain groups.  


  
Someone asked a question yesterday and said, what exactly is the Illuminati?  
Well, the Illuminati is a group  
 that originally started in Bavaria in 1776 by Adam Wyschott.  
And what he wanted to do, he called it Illuminati, explained that to you yesterday.  
It's coming from the plural of,  
 the enlightened.  
So he was supposed to be the enlightenment era of the 18th century Europe, which particularly followed the long period of the Renaissance.  
 All right?  
And what happened at that time was the secular humanism, which was the, the philosophical culture of the hour had taken over, taken over the people.  
 The church was partly sleeping.  
Not much was happening.  
And this went on until some of these cars were springing up and some of them became much stronger.  
I haven't been there for even longer.  
And so was this young man in Bavaria.  
 which became a part of Germany, today's Germany.  


  
So he started this group and there are core aims, let me just give you some thoughts about their core aims.  
And this is important for a reason.  
 their stated goals were to oppose superstition.  
And I want you to mark the word superstition.  
Religious influence over public life and abuses of state power.  
And of course, to put an end to  
 And this is on their side, to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice.  
Because as far as they were concerned, there were different groups that provisioned injustice.  
So they said they wanted to control them without dominating them, which is a contradiction.  
How are you going to control them without dominating them?  
 But this was the original idea.  
And he had known about the Freemasons.  
He wasn't particularly impressed by the Freemasons.  
And that was why he wanted to start another organization.  
But the very following year, he joined the Freemasons.  
So you see the relationship.  
 Because of course, we wanted to learn some things from them and improve on them in the Illuminati.  
But these are very similar organizations in different ways, even though they're not the same.  
Now, the reason even thinking about that is important.  
 is because at about this time, you had several people who were getting into, who were becoming strong in the society.  
They're becoming strong, okay?  
They're becoming influential in the society.  
For example,  
 At about this time, Charles Thompson, who was the Secretary of the Congress of the Confederacy in the United States, co-designed the great seal of the United States.  
 And being a latin, he was versed in latin, a latin teacher, he coined the two models on the seal.  
And knew it coactus, and then under it, novels, audio, so clone.  
Which of course, for both of them,  
 And thinking about the, in fact, all the symbols there, assumed to be talking about both the United States in its relationship with God in a way, because they have this ego, okay?  
So they think it's an ego and it's not an ego.  
And then it's got this pyramid, this uncompleted pyramid with an eye over it.  
 I know it quite just meaning like a nod on our endeavors, okay?  
A nod to our course, which is read by many to mean God has favored our course.  
 But in the Latins, that says nothing about God.  
God is not in there.  


  
And he translated the Old Testament Bible.  
He dedicates his life, his lot of part of his life to translate into Old Testament of the Bible.  
 So that, again, gives the impression that he was a great Christian of some sort.  
I believe he was some Christian, but that doesn't mean that he was not involved in what he was involved in.  


  
 So that's an interesting part to it.  
And then the novice artist or quorum, which is the new order of the ages.  
Okay, new order of the ages.  
And not just new order of the ages is a secular world.  
 a secular world.  
And his coinage was very, very carefully done because these things are done in secrecy.  
They're done in secrecy.  


  
 For example, what's translated ages there is a word for word.  
So from there you get the new word order, which was the pursuit, which was the cause of the uncompleted parameter.  


  
 And where does that take you?  
The Tower of Babel.  
That was stopped.  
They're supposed to be building this pyramid to heaven.  


  
Now, what many like to say when these things are brought to the fore is that they are conspiracy theories.  
Not quite.  
 Not quite.  
Not quite.  


  
It was based on the pursuit of enlightenment of the era.  
And they were every group, the Freemasons, the Illuminati,  
 Every group, the secular humanists, all of them wanted to do away with religious influence in the society.  
They wanted to stop the dogmas, the Christian dogmas, in which their society had been kind of raised.  
 for a long time.  
And they were not alone in this.  
Something else had been happening also for years.  
The protestantism had gathered a lot of steam by now.  
The problem with it was, while they were against the status quo, against the establishment,  
 they didn't bring something that others could stay on.  
In other words, the others who were infiltrating the populace with this secular humanism,  
 went through popular culture.  
They got it into their books, they got it into their music, they got it into their games, they got it into their education, they got it everywhere.  


  
Making it very difficult for those who  
 had in the class strategy to hold their grounds.  


  
And so a lot of these people who were into population control, because they'd been dreaming of it for a long time, how to bring down the population.  
In fact, let me just,  
 I wrote down some thoughts some time ago.  
Yeah.  
Here's a thought that I put down sometime back here.  
 The 18th century European era of enlightenment or age of reason, a cultural and intellectual revolution, which promoted the reason of a superstition and science of a blind faith, helped to usher out of its society the un-spirited, no, not un-spirited, I use a better word, the un-spiritized.  
Now, you may not find spiritized in many dictionaries,  
 But it actually means to, to fill with the spirit, to imbue with the spirit, which is different from, to be spirited, which is to be courageous and so on and so forth, but to spiritize.  
So the church was unspiritized at the time, okay?  
And was fleshly minded.  


  
 So no wonder it was easy to dominate it.  
And just about that time, they had a lot of debate on racial and population controls.  
And by 1798, of course, the most matters theory in which that is this theory of population.  
 in which he argued that the resources have become so limited and since it's of much slower growth than population.  
So there's gonna be a problem.  
People are not gonna have food to eat.  


  
That is the same argument today, even after his fears have been nullified.  
 But that is the same argument today by the same eugenicists who are driving for population control.  
And magnum mistakes about it, when you talk about population control, they are actually referring to two things.  
Because about this time, they really wanted some form of solution.  
 Okay?  
The word it answers.  
And something interesting happened.  
And that was the beginning of the evolution of vaccinations.  
 They're interested.  
By 1801, Denmark had carried out its first forced vaccination program.  
And several others followed.  
By 1840, the British government had passed the bill  
 on first vaccination, all this against smallpox.  
But the truth of the matter is no one was cross-examining them and all those scientists who opposed their narrative were silenced or ignored.  


  
And this went on until  
 The scientist's garden, Francis's garden, was excited enough to bring this together eugenics.  
And so population control  
 became, in fact, they got the solution.  
It gave them two things.  
Number one was population control through racial hygiene and eugenics.  


  
 Bill Gates said it very clearly in his TED Talk where he put a formula on the screen and said if they would do a good job with vaccines.  
And whatever else he added, but it was interesting to note that he said with vaccines.  
 They could bring down the population, interestingly, closer to zero, closer.  
Closer to zero means a very small number.  


  
So if they're gonna use vaccines to bring the population closer to zero,  
 after he said the population might go to 12 billion and that the world cannot support that.  
Like the world was asking him to help them support, you know, you know, philanthropists like this, they can be a real problem because they feel everybody wants to take something from them.  
So he wants to take down the population before they ask him for anything.  
That's quite interesting.  
 So his answer is to take down the population from 12 billion.  
It should be driven down close to zero.  
If they do a good job with vaccines, did you miss that?  
Doesn't that tell you?  
That vaccines therefore were intended.  
He didn't misspeak.  
Because you know, the politicians and people like this, when they talk, they say, sorry, I misspoke.  
 He didn't misspeak because he said the same thing, similar things on several other fora.  
So the vaccines definitely were designed to bring down population.  
Listen, from the beginning, that was it.  
They found two things, two things.  
The reason why they continued with vaccines, even though there was never a proof, there was never a scientific proof.  
 that he produced the results that they told the people that they got.  
It was never proved.  
 Given the guy who said that he treated someone by giving him a little bit of smallpox, okay, so that the reaction would be his immunity would become strong and everybody else, you know, all that.  
Nobody subjected their talk, their theory to full scrutiny.  
Why?  
 Because vaccine or vaccinations will produce two nice things, which they liked.  
Number one, it was going to help with population control by racial hygiene.  
That means you determine who are those you're going to vaccinate and what you're going to put inside the vaccine that can help control the population.  
 Secondly, economic prosperity threw it because they were gonna make a lot of money by either getting the individuals to pay for it or getting their governments to pay for it.  
Whichever way, those behind the vaccines will make a lot of money.  
So for these two reasons, they were never going to give up the idea.  
Even though they knew  
 that vaccinations were never proved to work.  
Now they have worked on the psyche of a lot of people who now think that except their child is vaccinated, the child is not ready to live in this world.  
They have come to believe that vaccination is compulsory, it must be done, otherwise the child is an endangered species.  
 But they're wrong.  
Absolutely wrong.  
They're wrong.  


  
So they don't want us to say things like this.  
They don't want us to tell the truth like this because it promised huge economic returns  
 and then they could eliminate whichever groups they wanted to eliminate.  


  
And that's why you have to be very careful and don't be deceived by those politicians and  


  
 and celebrities who posed on camera and told you that they were taking the vaccine.  
I told you, it's not the same thing that they put into you that they'll put into them.  
Not the same.  
In fact, when those vaccines came out, they were clearly levered.  
The ones that should not be used in Europe,  
 Oh, America, that must not be used there.  
And those ones were sentenced to them in Africa, to those in Africa.  


  
You know, there's this sickle cell disease, sickle cell anemia.  
 So I wanted to find out where did it start from, since the set is concentrated in Africa.  
It's an African disease.  
And the very first person that was diagnosed with it in the United States was an African American.  
 from Africa.  
Okay, so SQL cell.  


  
So, what led to it?  
And why has it stayed with them?  
I said, it's a blood problem.  
But what does the Bible tell us?  
 Let's read the Bible.  
Acts chapter 17, from verse 24.  
Let's see.  
God admit, I love this declaration.  
He starts it out with the big name, God.  
 God that made the world and all things therein, saying that his Lord of heaven and earth, dwelt not in temples made with hands.  
Look at the next verse.  
Neda is worshiped with men's hands as though he needed anything, saying he give it to all life and breath and all things, and had made of one blood.  
 All nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and are determined the times before appointed and the bounds of the habitations.  
He made all men of one blood.  
So where the African blood come from?  
Why do you have Indian blood?  
Why do you have European blood?  
American blood, right?  
 How can you have Germanic blood, right?  
Or Brazilian blood.  
How?  
Where did you get it from?  
Look at it again.  
He had made of one blood.  
All nations of men.  


  
 Listen, that was why the blood of Jesus Christ was enough for everybody.  
Everybody, because there's something that is coming to all of us and it's blood.  
God said so.  
Maybe the hair is not common.  
Maybe the skin is not common.  
Maybe the certain features are not common.  
 But God said, the blood is coming.  
It's the same.  
So, what happened to some who are having these blood types?  
And where's this hoax coming from?  


  
I call for another study.  
 on the blood groups and genotypes and so on and so forth, because there's been a fraud.  
There's been a fraud.  


  
There's been a fraud.  


  
 What are they testing for when you go for your genotype?  
What are they testing for?  
What exactly?  
What are they looking for?  
We need to find out.  
Because otherwise, how come they've not been able to solve the blood diseases or the blood problems that they talk about?  
They're never curable.  
Why?  


  
 Once it's in the blood, it's in the blood, and they got nothing to do about it.  


  
Science, they say, is discovery, isn't it?  
We should question it.  
We should question it.  
That's the only way our world has developed.  
Remember,  
 There was a time that didn't believe that you could transfer sound from one place to another without cables.  
There was a time.  
They didn't believe you could fly.  


  
 So all those things that the world has achieved in science is all based on the freedom and the ability to question things.  
We should be able to ask questions.  
No, they don't want us to ask questions.  
Like they were sanctioning all those who were asking questions about COVID.  
All those who disagreed with them were sanctioned.  
They're sanctioned.  
Their posts were taken down.  
 and some people lost their jobs for questioning vaccines.  
And then they even gave them a name, anti-vaxxers.  
I told them that name wasn't going to be, even going anyway, because it was right to be an anti-vaxxer, because the vaccines were a fraud, was a fraud.  
And when they realized that it was a boomerang,  
 They immediately started dropping the name.  
In the same way they dropped the goat greeting.  
You remember, they were so foolish.  
They said they'll greet with the elbows.  
I knew where that was going to.  
It was going to be with the head.  
Yeah, because the goat sign is the sign of Satan according to the Bible.  
It's a goat sign.  


  
And some time ago,  
 Those in that club came up with the good name and deceived the world by saying it meant greatest of all time.  
But it was a lie.  
It was a lie.  
They were being pushed and they wanted to get the good sign into popular culture.  
They wanted everybody to become just used to it and be saying it in their language.  
 greatest of all time, really?  
So why don't you just say it's in full?  
No, they wanted the acronym, good.  
So they wanted the people to begin to say, they are good.  
So they say, they suppose, I am a good, you get it?  
That's what they wanted.  
So you really wanted to be a good?  
And Jesus said he would separate the sheep  
 From the Gods.  


  
No, don't let it happen to you.  
Don't let it happen to you.  


  
Don't let it happen to you.  
The deception of the hour.  
 Don't become a victim of deception.  
Because the word tells us that deception will throughout the world.  
And it will be the grace of God to be saved from the hour of deception.  
And you should not be deceived.  
 Don't let it happen to you.  


  
So they said that they wanted to go into an age of enlightenment.  
And for those who found themselves joining these groups and joining the Illuminati, because these are groups that are there today.  
It grew from Bavaria.  
 And even though the government of the day a few years later wanted to actually prescribe them, but they did find other opportunities to reorganize themselves and continue and spread through university campuses and around the world.  


  
 But such things gain grounds because of what they said they're in pursuit of.  
They gain grounds because they say, we don't believe in any religion.  
We are free thinkers.  
We're just free thinkers.  
Free thinkers, really?  


  
 So that just means that they rely on reason, logic, naturalism, as opposed to spirituality, spiritualism, or the supernatural.  
But then on the first,  
 I'll read something to you.  


  
I want you to go to the Book of Acts.  


  
Chapter 23.  


  
 Paul had been arrested and it came to the time for him to defend himself before the council and they brought the leaders.  
And so I want to read to you what the Bible tells us here.  


  
 As they gathered and questioned him and he spoke, he made a certain statement and the high priest of that time hit him.  
 He responded, didn't quite like what he said, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  
So we get to verse six.  
But when Paul perceived that one part was Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, main and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead, I am called in question.  
 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.  
Now, this is quite interesting.  
See, I'm talking about the fact that these groups that came from the secular humanism of the Renaissance  
 and then went on into the 18th century, alright, 18th century Europe into this era or age of reason or era of enlightenment, okay?  
Some key things that they say it was that they relied solely on reason, on logic and naturalism.  
 And I told you a word earlier on, okay, when I was reading to you about Illuminati, they said they abhorred what, superstition.  
That means anything on the supernatural, like spirits and so on, no, no, no.  
 It was just about reason, air and science.  
Anything that we can prove with our senses is what we believe in.  
Can you imagine that?  
A contradiction by itself.  
But I'm reading something to you here to let you know they're not the first.  
So Paul is in this council.  
 And as they question with him, he discovers that there are two groups.  
He discovers that the one group is Pharisees and the other group is Sadducees.  
And so he explains to them that he is a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee.  
And so let's see.  
 So he says, I'm here because of my belief in the resurrection of the dead.  
I'm calling question because I believe in the resurrection of the dead.  
What's that mean?  
So verse seven, and when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.  
Next verse.  
 For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit.  
But the Pharisees confess both.  
Hold on, hold on.  
I want to help you observe something.  
For the Sadducees say there is no, what?  
Resurrection, neither angel nor spirit.  
That means they are saying  
 Number one, there is no resurrection.  
And number two, no such thing as angel or spirit.  
That is number two, no such thing as angel or spirit.  
So not three, they're two, because it says the Pharisees confess both.  
 So, angel nor spirit referring to one.  
So, they don't believe that man is a spirit.  
They don't believe that God is a spirit.  
They don't believe that there are angels.  
So, they didn't believe that an angel spoke to Moses.  
So, they saw the law as provided by the political leader, Moses.  
 Don't tell us that God talked to him.  
Don't tell us that God gave him the law.  
We obey the law because he was Moses.  
Don't tell us that it came from God.  
Because man is not a spirit, man is an ordinary person, an ordinary being.  
When he dies, it's the end.  
These were the Sadducees.  
 The Sadducees were the Illuminati of Jesus' day.  
The Sadducees were the secular humanists of Jesus' day.  
Looking right there, for the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit, but the Pharisees confess boats.  
The Pharisees agree with boats.  
 Just to let you know, when they talk about the age of enlightenment, that they were deceiving themselves about, they're not the first ones.  
The Sadducees were already there.  
So they've been deceived in the same way that the serpent beguiled Eve, Genesis chapter three.  
I'm reading from verse one.  
 Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field, which the Lord God had made.  
And he said unto the woman, yea, had God said he shall not eat of every tree of the garden.  
And the woman said unto the serpent, we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden.  
But of the fruit of the tree, which is in the midst of the garden, God had said he shall not eat of it.  
Neither shall ye touch it lest ye die.  


  
 And the serpent said unto the woman, he shall not surely die.  
He's countering what God said.  
Next.  
Forgot that know that in the day he eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, enlightenment.  
He let the woman astray.  
He lied to her.  
 He told her how she could be enlightened by doing what God said not to do.  
Is this for God God to know that in the day they're off?  
Then your eyes shall be open.  
He is accusing God of deception.  
He said, God has deceived you because God knew something and told you the opposite.  
 You lied against God.  
For God, God, no, that in the day that you eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as God's knowing good and evil.  
This was the same thing that they wanted back then in the 18th century.  
They wanted to be enlightened.  
They wanted to know more.  


  
 Yes, and those who became well-known philosophers, the great thinkers of the hour, were greatly revered.  
 And of course, a lot of the things that they talked about and put a lot of people in trouble destroyed their lives completely.  


  
Because they were deceived, they were lied to by the same devil that deceived Eve with a promise of enlightenment.  


  
 But I want to show you a far better enlightenment.  


  
In 1 Corinthians chapter two, I'm going to be reading to you from verse number six.  
And I want you to follow the reading there carefully.  
 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect, yet not the wisdom of this world, nor the princes of this world that come to not.  
Let's read that from the amplified translation.  
 It is yet when we are among the full-grown, spiritually mature Christians who are ripe in understanding, we do impart a higher wisdom, the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden, or it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age, nor of this world, nor of the leaders and rulers of this age who are being brought to nothing and are doomed to pass away.  
Wow.  
Wow.  


  
 Yeah, I'll look at it again in that.  
Let's read from the NIV.  
Says, we do however speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are coming to nothing.  
He's telling you their future.  
So they're being brought to not, they're coming to nothing.  
Go back to that, King James.  
 We speak wisdom among them that are perfect, mature.  
Yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world have come to not.  
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery.  
That means in esoteric language.  
Not everybody gets it.  
We speak the wisdom of God.  
I love it.  
Not just wisdom, but we speak the wisdom of God, the wisdom of God.  
 Like what I'm speaking to you now.  
The wisdom of God.  
We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery.  
 in esoteric communication, even the hidden wisdom which God or dead before the world onto our glory.  
Boy, I love this.  
I love this.  
You see, Paul encountered the Sadducees, the Illuminati of his day.  
You understand?  
And he understood their language.  
He knew where they came from.  
He knew what they thought about.  
He knew the ideas.  
They thought that they were enlightened.  


  
 And so we're reading from a man who encountered them in his day.  
And he says, we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, in esoteric language.  
They themselves thought that they were esoteric.  


  
 even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory.  
I want you to look at the next part.  
This is beautiful.  
He says, which none of the princes of this world knew?  
None of the princes of this world knew.  
Emmanuel Kant didn't know this.  
No, Hegel didn't know this.  
Coraba casaandarabaha.  
 For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.  
Look at that.  
They didn't know it.  


  
None of the princes of this world knew it.  
For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.  
 Now look at the next verse, this is beautiful.  


  
 The God I reveal, name unto us by your spirit, for the Spirit surge at all things.  
He had the deep things of God.  
The Illuminati cannot find this out.  
The Free Messon will never discover this.  


  
 God has revealed them unto us by His Spirit.  
For the Spirit's search at all things, He had the deep things of God.  
How can they know the deep things of God without the Spirit of God?  


  
O Rasonda Kilabahand Radiskas, look at the next verse.  
 For what man knoweth the things of a man?  
Save the spirit of man, which is in him.  
Ha ha.  
The saddest is that there's no spirit.  
But man has a spirit in him.  
Even Job, old Job said there is a spirit in man and the breath of the Almighty give it them understanding.  
 And Job the Bible tells us, well, there was the wealthiest man in all the East.  
In all the East, Middle East, Far East, in all the East.  
He was the richest man.  
Job of the Bible.  
He tells us there is a spirit in man.  
And the breast of the Almighty gives him understanding.  
 He knew it.  
And then the Illuminati said that there's no spirit.  
They're lost.  
That's why.  
So let's go, let's read further, or in that verse 11, for what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man, which is in him, even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God.  
You see it?  
 Even so the things of God know it, no man, no man can know the things of the Spirit of God.  
No carnal man can know the things of God, except by the Holy Ghost.  
Look at the next verse.  
Now, we have received, those of us who have received the Holy Spirit, he sees right into the Corinthian church, remember, is right into the church.  
 See, we, so he's referring to us, we, the church.  
So he says, now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit, which is of God, that we might know, Mashakar, Baba, Kundalabha.  
And we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.  
Holy, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
 The Holy Spirit of God helps us know the things that are freely given to us of God.  
That's why we can know of salvation.  
That's how we can know of eternal life.  
That's how we can know about the blood of Jesus Christ.  
That's how we can know about our redemption, our justification, our sanctification.  
That's how we can know that we have received the Holy Spirit and understand things about speaking in tongues and prophecy and the gifts of the spirits.  
 and divine healing.  
All of these amazing things.  
And that's how we can know about heaven and the spirit realm and about angels and the glory realm, Hallelujah.  


  
Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus.  


  
 Did you ever hear glass gold?  
Glass gold?  
Glass gold?  
Whoever saw glass gold?  
They haven't seen it.  
 That's what's used in the streets of the city of God.  
Grass gold.  
Did you ever see it anywhere?  
It's grass, it's gold.  


  
100% gold, but grass gold.  


  
That's for the streets, that's for the streets.  
 I think I understand how God looks at gold.  
I remember several occasions actually, I took off my shoes and I had gold dust.  
Gold dust on my toes.  
The first time it surprised me, I was surprised, I was very shocked.  
I looked out and I was sparkling.  
I thought, what?  
How?  
Didn't I remember?  
Oh, gold dust.  
 I said, Lord, I have to see this again.  
I have to see this again.  
I don't want to clean them.  
I thought, wow, this is amazing.  
This is amazing.  
Then the next day and the next day and the next day at Gold Dust, they were there when, you know, when God put them there and then they disappeared after  
 I'm not talking about some little sparkle here, and it's like, no, no, no, I'm talking about gold.  
It's all my toes.  


  
Why toes?  
That's how low he thinks they are.  
Down there.  


  
That's why I'm not moved by gold.  
 No.

 This now we have received not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.  
The Holy Ghost came into us.  
We receive the Spirit of God to help us know the things that are given to us of God, the things that are given to us freely of God.  
Well, so when you know them,  
 What's next?  
He tells us, he tells us.  
Look at it.  
Which things also we speak?  
Not in the words which man's wisdom teach it, but with the Holy Ghost teach it.  
Comparing spiritual things and spiritual things.  
This is amazing.  
So we have a different vocabulary.  
We don't talk like the world does.  
We talk differently.  
We speak the things.  
We speak them.  
 He says, which things also we speak?  
Not in the words, taught by physics, chemistry, and biology.  
Not in the words which man's wisdom teaches about finances.  
You know, to teach you some things about finances.  
Terrible, terrible.  
He didn't use so much about finances.  
Why are all the nations broke?  
 And those of you who have gone to have had to learn finance, America owes the largest debt in the world in trillions of dollars.  
So where is their knowledge of finance?  
Which they are teaching the world.  
Can you see the foolishness?  
The very country you went to to learn about finance owes the largest debt in the world.  
Where do you think is your future then?  
You're gonna owe.  
 You're gonna be a debtor.  
Because that's what you learned about finance.  
You see it?  
How foolish the world is.  
They're going to the guy who's failing to learn about failure.  
Why they're thinking they're learning about success.  
How does that work?  


  
 No, they didn't think about it.  
They didn't think about it.  
They want to go to study finance in the United States where they are owing the largest debt and it's increasing by the day.  
Their debt has just increased further since the new war began in the Middle East.  


  
 So every day, huge debt.  
So what are they teaching you about finance?  
That's quite interesting.  
That's quite interesting.  
So they teach you how to have fake wealth.  
Fake wealth.  
If you don't understand it, when you talk about the national debt,  
 It affects everyone who operates in the system.  
Everyone who's covered by that system.  
That's why God's people have to think differently.  
You gotta be covered by a different system.  
You have to think differently.  
You have to think differently.  
You can't think like the world.  
You can't play the world's game and act like the world and expect supernatural results.  
 No, no, no, you have to use supernatural principles to have supernatural results.  
If you think like the world, you will have the world's results.  
But if you think like God, you will have God's results.  
He told us in Ephesians 5, verse 1, let's read.  
 Be there for followers of God as their children, mimitates.  
Now, let's read it in the NIV.  
It says be imitators because the word that's translated followers of God in the KJV, all right, is actually in the Greek imitators.  
So this one gets it right because that's actually what it is in the Greek.  
 Be imitators of God.  
Therefore, as daily loved children, be imitators, let's copy him.  
Copy him.  
Let's read from the Amplified Translation.  
He says, therefore be imitators of God, copy him and follow his example.  
As well, beloved children, imitate their father.  
You see that?  
 So he used God's principles for God's results.  
He won the results and he promises you cannot think like the guy who's failing.  
Unexpected different results.  
No, you're going to go down in debt.  


  
Look at the world's intelligentsia.  
 are completely failing.  
They're failing their nations and failing the world.  
The IMF, the war bank, the failed the nations.  
There's not one nation on earth, helped by the IMF or the war bank that brought them out of poverty or brought them out of debt.  
No, none.  


  
 So what is it about?  


  
You have to operate with God's wisdom.  
That's what I'm telling you.  
As children of God, listen, God has planned for us an extraordinary future.  
Between now and when the rapture of the church takes place, there are amazing things that are going to be happening with God's people.  
 But we have to follow His ideas.  
We have to work in His wisdom.  
We have to work with the Spirit of God.  


  
He told us, He of God, little children.  
He of God.  
And have overcome them.  
You have overcome them.  
This is because greater is He that is in you than He that is in the world.  
 Lambran, don't go ski brahas.  
Now go to Samadhi's gospel chapter 21 and verse 43 in the NIV or in the amplified version like we just read.  
 Look at what he says.  
Therefore, I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you.  
I told you, he was referring to the Jews.  
He says, the kingdom will be taken from them because they didn't believe him, they didn't accept him.  
So he was going to give it to, look at his, will be taken away from you and given to people who will produce its fruits.  
And when we discussed this, we showed that he was talking about the church.  
 He said, I will build my church, my church.  
And we refer to the ecclesia, those called out for a purpose.  
They were called to gather for a purpose.  
I'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.  
So this is his church, all right?  
It's his nation.  
He are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.  
 So, look at what it says.  
It says the kingdom will be given to a people who will produce its fruits.  
So what are the fruits of the kingdom?  
It says we're going to be producing the fruits.  
These are fruits of righteousness the Bible says.  
We're producing fruits of righteousness.  
 That means there's a lot of good stuff coming out of us.  


  
Get ready for your creativity, your innovation, the innovativeness of your spirit, the visionary power of your spirits, the ability to perform  
 that has been given to you in Christ Jesus.  
The ability to make things happen, that is within your spirit.  
Because this is your day.  
Hallelujah.  
Go ahead and talk to the Lord and thank Him for His amazing grace.

 Thank you.  


  
 Now this time, for the next 15 minutes, for the next 15 minutes, we want to pray.  
And first, you make declarations of words, of faith as the Spirit of God stares this within your heart.  


  
 And then also pray for the nations of the world.  
Pray for them against deception.  
Pray against deception.  
But there will not be victims again of deception.  
Because the shadow of deception is still hanging over many.  
 But we have to pray and break that power of deception and pray that the spirit of truths will minister to them.  
That's the Holy Spirit of God.  
Pray for them that the spirit of truth will prevail in their lives.  
And they should not be deceived.  
 And they'll be able to stand up against falsehood and deception.  
Pray for them, and pray for the churches of Christ around the world, and the ministers of God everywhere.  
Pray for all of God's people, everywhere.  
So in the next 15 minutes, that's how we're going to pray, and acquire sin praises to God as we pray.  
 Yeah, let's do that for the next 15 minutes.
