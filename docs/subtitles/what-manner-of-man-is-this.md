title: What Manner Of Man Is This
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirit.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
People is yours.  


  
 What the Word of God does is to show you a mirror.  
The Bible says the Word of God is a mirror.  
It is God's mirror.  
What does a mirror do?  
It shows you your reflection.  


  
 At the High Life Conference we've passed the Chrisette Christ Embassy Conference Center, Arlington, Texas, United States of America in August 2011 was indeed a time of transformation.  
As you listen, your life will never be the same again.  
God bless you.  


  
 Hallelujah.  
If your hands do it together, precious Father, we honor you.  
Thank you for your love.  
Thank you for your grace.  
Thank you for your kindness.  
Thank you for your mighty presence.  
We worship you.  
 There's none like you, Lord.  
There's none like you.  
Thank you, Lord.  
Hallelujah.  
Praise the Lord.  
You may be seated.  


  
I want to welcome you  
 to this very special conference, we call it a higher life conference.  
And there's a reason for that.  


  
There's a reason for that.  
Of course, there's a higher life in Christ.  
Tonight,  
 We're starting a series of meetings that will change you forever.  
You see why?  
Why change?  
Change because you see man is a dynamic creature and constantly changes.  
But those changes depend on  
 Whatever factors of change are present or influential at the time.  
So some change for good, some change for evil, some change for excellence that depends on what you allow.  
 But the greatest change agent in the world is the Word of God.  
It's the greatest change agent there is.  
Hallelujah.  
St.  
John's Gospel, chapter 10,  
 I want us to read verse 10 together.  
Want to go.  
Again.  


  
 He said, the tith come at not but for the steal and a kill and a destroy.  
I am calm that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly.  
Who said those words?  
Again.  
Jesus.  
All right, so when he said the tith, who was it talking about?  
Again.  
Again.  
One more time.  
 One more time, you are wrong.  
I know some of you said that devil and you are wrong.  
That scripture doesn't say anything about the devil at all.  
You say, who's the thief then?  
Jesus wasn't referring to the devil there.  
He wasn't talking about it.  
Well, when you studied the Bible,  
 Learn to study it in context.  
That means don't read scriptures in isolation.  
You see, we picked verse 10.  
What about verse 9?  
What about 8?  
What about 11 and 12?  


  
 When you study, try to look for where the subject started.  
Because the Bible deals with so many subjects.  
Jesus, in his many speeches and teachings, taught a lot of things, so many subjects.  
In this case, you'd find that he began what he was talking about  
 From the first verse, you'll actually notice from the ninth chapter, there had been an encounter with certain folks.  
And he brought this into chapter 10.  
And the real issue was, he was talking about, okay, let's see it.  
You want to see it?  
Because now I'm trying to make you change something you've heard all your life.  
 So I better show it to you from the book.  
All right, chapter 10, St.  
John's Gospel.  
Verily, verily, I say unto you, unto you.  
Who in the world is he talking about?  
Or talking to?  
So we find it couldn't start from there.  
We want to know who he was talking to.  
So we go to chapter 9, the previous chapter.  
 And let's look for a comfortable place there.  
I'll give you the background.  
Jesus had ministered to a man who was blind.  
And he received his sight.  
And the Jews were angry with him, the Jewish leaders.  
And they said, how did you receive your sight?  
He said, a man named Jesus healed me.  
And they said, oh, that man's a sinner.  
He could not heal you.  
 And this man said, well, whether it's a sinner or not, I don't know it.  
I just know once I was blind, but now I see.  
Where is God?  
And they kicked him out of the synagogue, and Jesus found him later.  
And here was what the Lord said.  
Verse 35.  
 Jesus heard that they had cast him out.  
And when he had found him, he said unto him, Does thou believe on the Son of God?  
He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?  
And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.  
This is one of the several occasions that Jesus said emphatically that he was the Son of God.  
 It couldn't be made any more.  
Look at it.  
Have you seen it?  
Look at it.  
He said, do you believe on the Son of God?  
And Jesus, the man said, who is he?  
He said, I'm the one.  
That's what he said.  
Jesus said unto him, Thou has both seen him and it is he that took it with thee.  
And he said, Lord, I believe, Aralu YAH.  
 And He washept Him that shows who Jesus is.  
He accepted worship.  
He accepted worship.  
He was no ordinary person.  
All right.  
Verse 39, now listen.  
Man shouldn't accept worship.  
Angels don't accept worship.  
Only God.  
 Deserners in accepts worship.  
In Jesus he approved.  
He was God.  
Hallelujah.  
All right, verse 39.  
In Jesus said, for judgment now.  
Watch.  
He's just spoken to this young man that's been an interesting dialogue here.  
And then he starts talking bold now.  
Listen to his words.  
 And Jesus said, for judgment, I am coming to this word, that there which see not might see, and that there which see might be made blind.  
Wow.  
And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him, are we blind also?  
 Jesus said unto them, if you were blind, you should have no sin.  
But now you say, we see, therefore your sin remain it.  
Verily, verily, I see unto you.  
Can you see it now?  
The Bible was not written in chapters and verses.  
The chapters and verses were put there for easy reference.  
So now you can see who was talking to.  
The Pharisees questioned him and he replied,  
 And in his reply, he says, verily, verily, I say unto you, he that enter it not by the door into the sheepfold, but climb it up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.  
OK, what's more?  
But he that enter it in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.  
 to hear the potter open it and the ship hear his voice and he call it his own ship by name and leaded them out and when he put it for his own ship he go at before them and the ship follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers this parable speak Jesus onto them  
 but they understood not what things they were which is speak unto them.  
Then said Jesus unto them again.  
Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.  
Ah, there you are.  
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.  
You get it now?  
 All that ever came before me, he says, thieves and robbers.  
Now we can see the context.  
He hasn't said anything about the devil here, because it's all that ever came before me.  
Ah, thieves and robbers.  
Not going to be Satan.  
 He's talking about those who came before Him.  
He's talking about those who came to say, I am the Christ.  
There were fours Christ that came before Him.  
Fours prophets that came before Him.  
Now He calls them thieves and robbers.  
I am the door.  
By me, if any man ever in, he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture.  
To thief come at not?  
 That's the 10th verse.  
Now you get it.  
You already told us who we're talking about.  
Okay, just for the records.  
We'll read on.  
 It'll make it clearer to you.  
Let's read verse 10.  
You already understand from verse 9 who we're coming from.  
The thief cometh not but for the steal and the kill and the destroy.  
I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly.  
I am the good shepherd.  
The good shepherd give it his life for the sheep.  
Now, you see, he is comparing himself to the thief.  
Okay?  
And he already told us, all that ever came before me, thieves and robbers.  
 And the sheep did not hear them.  
That's what he said.  
Then.  
Okay.  
Verse 12.  
But he that he is an island and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, see it the wolf coming and leave it the sheep and flee it.  
And the wolf captured them and scattered the sheep.  
 The Harlan flee it because he's an Harlan and caret not for the ship.  
I am the good shepherd and know my ship and I'm known of mine."  
Isn't that clear enough?  
It's clear enough.  
He's now dealing with his pastoral ministry.  
You see that?  
He's dealing with his pastoral ministry.  
He says, I am the good shepherd.  
 Jesus was a teacher.  
Jesus was a prophet.  
Jesus was an apostle.  
Jesus was an evangelist.  
Are you still there?  
Jesus was a pastor.  
He deals with his pastoral ministry and he compares himself with the highly.  
The guy who has a job  
 to pass to the people as a job and doesn't have a heart for them.  
The one who comes and says, I'm the Christ.  
The forest Christ.  
The Bible talks about the forest Christ and forest prophets and forest teachers in forest brethren.  
These are different groups the Bible talks about.  
 Forest Christ, forest prophets, forest teachers, and forest brethren.  
Okay.  
All right.  
Did you get it?  
Is it clear to you now?  
Okay.  
Let's go back to that verse 10, something I won't show you.  
 The thieves commit not but for the steel and the kill and the distraught.  
Ah, in combat, they might have life in that they might have it more abundantly.  
The King James' language is a little blind to us, makes it a little more difficult for us to understand, which is to have it more abundantly as though they already have some of it, you know, and they're going to get more and more.  
But that's not what he's talking about.  
The language here is somewhat different from what it should be.  
It actually means to the food.  
 that it shall have life to the fool.  
Now, the amplified translation gives us something that clarifies this verse, and you would like this.  
If you have the amplified translation, go there.  
Let's see it.  
What's the original Zenjian chapter 10 and verse 10?  
Are you there?  
Okay.  
The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy.  
 I came that they may have an enjoy.  
You didn't think that word was in the Bible.  
Enjoy.  
I came that they may have an enjoy life and have it in abundance to the fool till it overflows.  
I came that they may have an enjoy life.  
 to the fool until it overflows.  
Look at why Jesus came.  
I came that they may have and enjoy life.  
How many people I enjoy in life?  
I came that they may have and enjoy life.  
 I came that they may have and enjoy life.  
Settle that in your heart.  
Settle it in your spirit.  
This is the reason Jesus came.  
I came that they may have and enjoy.  
Have and enjoy.  
Have and enjoy.  
 Have an enjoy.  
Have an enjoy.  
Have an enjoy.  
Have an enjoy.  
Have an enjoy.  
Have an enjoy.  
Have an enjoy.  
Have an enjoy.  


  
It's not enough to have it.  
 Do you enjoy it?  
Do you enjoy it?  
That people who wish they were dead, they have life, they're not enjoying it?  
Too many people don't even know how to enjoy anything.  
They don't enjoy anything.  
They don't enjoy anything.  
 They don't enjoy their family, they don't enjoy their home, they don't enjoy their clothes, they don't enjoy anything, they enjoy nothing.  
Because they never thought, they never thought they were supposed to enjoy anything.  
They don't enjoy their job, their business, their money, they enjoy nothing, they don't enjoy their food, they just eat.  
 I enjoy life.  
I enjoy everything I do.  
Let me tell you why.  
Why?  
And this is so important.  
God made us get this clearly, get it in focus.  
 God made us.  
Could this be true?  
If it is, for what purpose?  
Why did God make me?  
Why did God create me?  
Why?  
Why?  
Why are you here?  
 Somebody said, well, I don't know my parents.  
I don't know what they were thinking when they brought me here.  
Forget about what they were thinking.  
You're here now.  
Question is, why were you born?  
Why are you here?  
There must be a reason.  
God made us for Himself.  
That's clear to me.  
It's in the Word.  
God made us for Himself.  
 He created us for Himself.  
He made us for Himself.  
Say this with me.  
God made me for Himself.  
What a thought.  
Oh boy, what a thought.  
Let's go again.  
God made me for Himself.  
 You realize you're not living for yourself.  
He made you for himself.  
He made you to derive pleasure in you for himself.  
Think about it.  
He made you so he could enjoy you for his own benefit.  
 God doesn't live for us.  
We live for Him.  
He doesn't exist for us.  
We exist for Him.  
If that's true, then if He made me for Himself, so He could have pleasure.  
 In me, if I'm unhappy and sad and broken, how much pleasure does he derive?  
When I can't function, I can be what he wants me to be.  
I can't do what he wants me to do.  
How pleased does he get?  
 It means he doesn't get the benefits for which he created me.  
If I'm sad, unhappy, broken, dejected, discouraged, it means that God is not deriving from my life the purpose for which he made me.  
That's simple.  
That's like Jesus said, I am coming.  
 that they might have life in having to do full, that they might have and enjoy life.  
He came for that purpose.  
Let's look at the frames of God in the Bible.  
Are you ready for this?  
For what we know, I want to assume, you know, this is the hard life conference, okay?  
So it's assumed that you know Jesus.  
Hey, come on.  
 That's what this conference is.  
It's for Christians.  
It's for those in the house.  
It's assumed you've been in the house.  
You've learned some things about Jesus, right?  
Okay.  
Okay.  
Glory to His name forever.  
Are you still there?  
This is wonderful.  
Let's go again.  
God made me for Himself.  
 I belong to God.  
I belong to God.  
He made me for Himself.  
He made me for Himself.  
Okay, let me carry along properly.  
Thank you Lord Jesus.  
Hallelujah.  
Jesus said, I am calm that they might have life.  
 have and enjoy life.  
He came for that reason.  
He came to do something for us so that we would fulfill the call of God.  
What kind of a man was Jesus?  
What was he like?  
Who was he?  
That'll tell me what I'm supposed to be.  
 What was Jesus like?  
How did he think?  
If you want to know what a man's character is, you read his words, you listen to him, you hear him speak, all right?  
You listen, read his writings, and you can tell.  
What did Jesus say about himself?  
What did he say about God?  
What did he say about us?  
 You know, something beautiful the Bible tells us in St.  
John's Gospel chapter 20 and verse 31.  
It tells us that so many miracles, so many things that Jesus did that are not written in this book.  
It says, but these are written that he might believe that Jesus is the Christ.  
Not believing he might have life through his name.  
Life through his name.  
Life through his name.  
 life through his name, glory to God, life through his name.  
He said so much about life.  
You know, Jesus said, I am calm, but they might have life.  
He wasn't talking to corpses, and he wasn't talking about corpses.  
He was talking about living people.  
 But he brought another kind of life.  
He was talking about a life that was foreign to them.  
Something that knew nothing about.  
 Watch this.  
Jesus is in the boat.  
He's traveling with his disciples.  
And he's sleeping at the rear of the boat.  
And the traveling, and there's water now.  
The waves are high.  
And the water's coming into the boat.  
And the disciples are troubled.  
They wake him up.  
They say, Master, don't do care that we perish.  
The waves are roaring against us.  
 These were fishermen who knew how to swim.  
But they knew this was dangerous now.  
And they said, Master, get up.  
And Jesus woke up.  
He said, how come you don't have faith?  
And he turned to the wings and the waves.  
And he said, peace.  
Be still.  
And the Bible says suddenly there was a great calm.  
And as the disciples watch in that,  
 looked at one another, and they said, what manner of man is this?  
That even the wings and the waves of bear, what manner of man is this?  
What kind of man is this?  
He blew their minds.  
This was no Pharisee.  
This was no Sadducee.  
This was no Jewish cry.  
 This was no room and teacher or scholar.  
He was different.  
He talked to the waves and the waves.  
They heard him.  
They heard him.  
And the disciples noticed it.  
On one occasion, 11 chapters in Mark's Gospel of Iberculosis and Jesus passed by a tree.  
And there was no food on that fig tree.  
He had wanted something from there.  
 This happens when they're watching him and the Lord said to the tree, no man will eat fruit from you anymore.  
As far as they were concerned, he cursed the tree and it still looked as green as ever.  
And Jesus walked away and they followed him.  
Few hours later, next day, they come by the same place.  
And Jesus passes by that tree  
 And Peter wouldn't do that, he would stop.  
Because he wants to know what happened yesterday.  
And the Bible says he called to remembrance.  
He said, Master, behold, a victory that your curse has weeded away.  
It's dead.  
The tree you curse is dead.  
The Bible says it dried up from the roots.  
Jesus talked to the tree.  
It heard him.  
 And what Jesus said, have the faith of God.  
Have the faith of God.  
He walked away.  
He's walking down toward the gate of the city cod name.  
And there's a funeral procession.  
A young man has died.  
The only son of his mother, a widow.  
And she's weeping and weeping and not going for it.  
 In Jesus, the Bible says, oh, I love Jesus.  
I love Jesus.  
The Bible says, he had compassion.  
He had compassion.  
Oh, oh, oh.  
He had compassion on this weird old lady.  
Her husband had died.  
Now her only son was gone.  
In Jesus, without any preliminaries, walked straight to the beer.  
 touched it.  
The man Karen had stopped.  
Then he speaks to the man that was dead.  
He says, young man, I say unto you, arise.  
He set up.  
He was dead.  
He set up.  
Imagine what happened, the commotion.  
Think about it.  
The commotion.  
 The Bible says Jesus delivered him to his mother.  
Compassion drove him.  
What manner of man is this?  
Even the dead heard him.  
The dead heard him.  
What manner of man is this?  
He lived a life that was different.  
They come asking for money.  
He calls his disciples.  
 He says, who's supposed to pay the taxes?  
Citizens are strangers.  
There's a strangers, of course.  
This is anyway, let's not offend them.  
Take your hook, go to the water, put your hook in, the fresh fish you catch, pick a coin out of his mouth.  
The disciple goes there, he does it, brings out the coin, and pays for he and Jesus.  
Now, now, think about this.  
 What manner of man is this?  
He said, the first fish you catch, bring a coin out of its mouth.  
This is amazing.  
Bring a coin, he didn't say, kill it, open it and find it.  
No, he said, bring a coin out of its mouth.  
The fish was coming with a coin in its mouth.  
For Jesus.  
For Jesus.  
 What manner of man is this?  
I don't understand when you say you are broke.  
Something is wrong.  
Maybe you don't know where you're from.  
Ay, ay, ay, ay.  
What manner of man is this?  
Now he's dying on the cross.  
 It'll take at least 13 hours for men that's crucified to die.  
And tomorrow is the Sabbath.  
The soldiers can't wait.  
They hold a little median and they say, look, we've got to break their bones.  
Otherwise, they will not die.  
And tomorrow is the Sabbath.  
The Jewish people are getting troubled now.  
Look, these guys are not going to die.  
We know how long it takes.  
 the three of them are on the cross, Jesus at the middle, a thief over here, a thief over there.  
And Jesus cries out, father, into your hands I commend my spirit.  
He commands his own death with words.  
He doesn't take pears.  
He doesn't take any poison.  
He's not struggling to die.  
 He commands his own debt.  
He says, into your hands, I command my spirit and his head drops.  
And they say, well, let's break their bones.  
The bones are the first one.  
He dies.  
They said, the middle one is the big one who comes to you later.  
They come to the other one.  
They break his bones and he dies.  
They come to this one.  
They say, no, he can't be dead.  
 No, he can't be dead.  
We heard him cry.  
Into your hands I commend my spirit.  
Did you mean that meant something?  
He's dead.  
He commanded his own death.  
A soldier gets a spear.  
And thrust it to his side.  
Blood and water.  
Gosh, ours.  
And the Bible says he thus saw it bore witness.  
 Why?  
Because his heart ruptured.  
How could that have happened to him?  
That's another day's talk.  
But the point is, he commanded his own death with words.  
Are you still there?  
With words?  
What manner of man is this?  
He said something.  
I am from above, ye are from beneath.  
 I am from a ball.  
My father dwelt in me.  
How many of you, when you knew your dad, you found him inside you?  
Did it happen to you?  
This one was different.  
He said his dad was inside him.  
He was a mystery to all who heard him.  
 He says, my father above, my father in heaven, and they all raised their heads.  
Then he said, he dwells in me and they look down.  
A mystery to them.  
A mystery all the time to them.  
Praise God.  
Let me tell you something.  
When you were born again, something  
 actually happened when you were born again.  
A lot of Christians who don't realize that when they gave their hearts to Christ, it wasn't joining a church.  
You didn't join a church.  
You didn't get religion.  
You didn't change from bad to good.  
That's not what happened.  
 When you were born again, you were actually born of the Word of God.  
You were actually born of the Spirit of God.  
God literally gave birth to you.  
Are you hearing this?  
It is not a parable.  
It's not an assumption.  
 When we say that we are born again, you know, some Christians who say this, they say, are you born again?  
They say, well, I'm a Christian, but not the born again.  
They think the term born again applies to some Pentecosters or Protestants or something, some sects of Christians.  
No, Jesus used the term himself.  
 He said, except a man be born again.  
He cannot see the kingdom of God.  
He cannot see it.  
He can be a part of it.  
He can experience it.  
Except he's born again.  
Then he said, that which is born of the flesh is flesh.  
And that which is born of the spirit is spirit.  
This is, you must be born again.  
 So when you were born again, you were born of the Spirit of God with the nature of God, the nature of God.  
See, the Word of God gave birth to you.  
Say this with me, the Word of God gave birth to me.  
Okay, one more time.  
Go to James chapter one, the Book of James chapter one.  
Verse 18, I want you to read it together.  
One to go.  


  
 Thank you.  
He says, of his own will, he begat us.  
He gave birth to us that we should be.  
Notice the tenses.  
He's talking about God's expectation.  
Of his own will, gave birth to us for the purpose that we should be  
 a kind, a type of first fruits of his creatures.  
What's first fruits?  
First fruits means the first and the best.  
It means the trapmost, the cream of it, the best of it.  
Oh, God.  
Oh, God.  
Longradeskobra hashta.  
Oh, dear Lord Jesus.  
 that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.  
Did you see that in your Bible?  
He says of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.  
He gave birth to us by the word of truth.  
The gospel is the word of truth.  
He gave birth to us by the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.  
First fruits of his creatures.  
 The best, the top class, the first class of his creatures, of all that God made, we are top class, first class, the best of his creatures.  


  
If that's true,  
 How should I live?  
Who am I?  
Who am I?  
The best of God's creatures.  
Let me explain something to you.  
You know, have you heard of angels?  
Angels.  
What are they?  
Spirits, right?  
The spirit beings.  
Now, angels are not the race.  
Angels are not the race.  
 They don't multiply.  
They don't give birth.  
Every angel is a unique creature, has no one like him, his unique.  
Every angel is a unique creation of God and has no type.  
 Did you hear what I said?  
The angels are all different.  
Each one is different.  
Each one is the only kind of his kind.  
There are no two of them that are alike.  
Each angel is the only kind of his kind.  
God doesn't have another one.  
 Now, human beings are a race.  
Are you hearing me?  
Human beings are a race.  
They might apply.  
And depending on what part they were for a long time, they could be darker light.  
Stressed hair or kinky hair.  
But they all came out of the same stuff.  
 They are race.  
So God said, multiply, and they multiply.  
Okay?  
They'll race.  
But then, there are unique things about each one of them.  
Each one of them.  
For example, there are no two fingerprints alike in the whole world.  
Right?  
Great.  
 You're unique.  
One of a kind.  
Yes.  
But when you were born again, that became even more true.  
You became the best of God's creation.  
You are subclass.  
No one was ever like you.  
No one is like you today.  
And no one will ever be like you.  
You see it?  
 And why does God have you here in the world?  
Simple.  
To manifest His glory.  
All His creation is to show forth His praise.  
To show forth His glory.  
Let me show you your calling in this regard.  
You ready for this?  
First Peter.  
First Peter chapter two.  
 from verse 9.  
But ye, O dear Lord Jesus, understand something brothers and sisters, when God talks, understand his tenses, understand the past tenses of God's Word, the present tenses and the future tenses.  
If God says you are, whatever he says you are, you are.  
God calls by names.  
 Okay, I'll give you some time.  
Come on here.  
But ye are... There it is.  
Ye are not ye shall be.  
Not ye were.  
Not ye are trying to be.  
Ye are a chosen generation.  
That means a chosen breed.  
A chosen breed.  
Ye are a chosen generation.  
A royal priesthood.  
That means I'm royalty.  
 Sam, royalty.  
Let me tell you.  
Until and unless you have this consciousness, it will not be activated in your life.  
You know, you got angels.  
The angels are functioned with us.  
The work with us, the move with us.  
They're sent by God to attain us.  
If you don't have the right mentality to activate the power of God, they cannot function for you the way they should function for you.  
You've got to realize this.  
 Knowledge is so important.  
Conscious knowledge.  
And then you voice your knowledge.  
This is the loss of the Spirit.  
When you voice your knowledge, the knowledge that you have voiced goes into operation and starts working for you and the spiritual forces also act upon them.  
I hear this.  
He says, you are a chosen breed, a chosen generation.  
 Arroy our priesthood.  
He says, you are.  
He didn't say you're going to be if you don't sin against me.  
He says, you are.  


  
All right, just to go.  
Go to Hebrews.  
We'll come back here.  
Go to Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 13.  
Let me quickly show you this.  
Hebrews chapter 13.  
Are you there?  
 I will read to you from verse 5.  
Listen to the principle of God's Word, a principle of the Kingdom of God.  
Are you ready?  
All right.  
This is let your conversation, the word conversation here actually means manner of life.  
Let your conversation be without covetousness and be cunning with such things as he hath.  
For, because he hath said, I want you to notice,  
 Notice when you find a law of the Spirit, for he had said, he had said, he had said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.  
Hey, I don't know if you heard him.  
He said, for he had said, so that we may boldly say, oh dear Lord,  
 Let me give it to you.  
What is he telling us?  
He's saying the reason God said what he said was sort of I could say something that is in agreement with what he said.  
God talks.  
Not so we can just hear him.  
So we can take his word and talk back.  
There's got to be a connection.  
 Are you hearing this?  
You know why many Christians are not living a Christian life?  
They are living a religious life.  
Just being nice and humble and kind and trying to be sinless because they don't understand what sin is.  
 They think that sin means I did something wrong.  
I cursed.  
Oh, God, forgive me.  
I stole.  
Oh, God, forgive me.  
They think that's what sin is all about.  
No.  
I'll tell you what sin is.  
Are you still there?  
Because they don't understand it.  
They think just being nice and making sure you go to church on Sunday.  
I didn't hurt my neighbor.  
 I don't tell lies against anybody.  
I'm nice to everybody.  
I'm kind to everybody.  
They think that's what Christianity is.  
No, no, it's not enough.  
What else does God want?  
I'm trying already.  
He's not asking you to try anything.  
He's not asking you to try anything.  
 What the Word of God does is to show you a mirror.  
The Bible says the Word of God is a mirror.  
It is God's mirror.  
What does a mirror do?  
It shows you your reflection.  


  
In your Old Testament, he said to them, read it, hear it, and obey it.  
 In Christianity, you don't obey it.  
You don't obey the Word of God.  
Too many Christians are trying to obey the Word of God, and that's why they cannot obey.  
I know I've got your attention.  
You're thinking, maybe I said what I didn't want to say.  
Maybe I made a mistake.  
That's not what I wanted to say.  
You're thinking, that's not... No, that's what I wanted to say.  
 Christians don't obey the word of God.  
They've been taught to obey it and that's the problem.  
The revelation of my word.  


  
 is given to those who have their hearts open.  
There am I in planning to them and in them, that which I spoke years and years ago.  
Before the beginning of time, I want you to know, say it to the Lord, that I've met you with my word, and that you are the offspring of my word, and all you have to do is be what I've made you go with the God.  
Hallelujah.  
That's what I said in other talks.  
 That's what I said in other talks.  
Glory to God.  
Are you still there?  
Okay, let me explain this to you.  
In the Old Testament, they read the word or heard it read to them and they tried to act accordingly.  
It didn't work.  
They tried to bait the field.  
They heard it.  
 and said, Thou shalt not steal.  
Thou shalt not kill.  
Thou shalt not be a false witness.  
They said, okay, okay, okay.  
They tried to obey it.  
It didn't work.  
They failed God.  
And then they said, it's too hard.  
You know what God said?  
He said, I'm going to do a new thing.  
 is that I will write my words in their hearts and in their minds.  
Glory to God.  
In the New Testament, we don't try to obey the Word of God.  
He shows us a principle.  
You can read it for yourself in the book of James, chapter 1, from verse 22 to verse 25.  
It'll be a blessing to you.  
We'll look at the Word.  
 and we see ourselves.  
He calls us his obedient children.  
He doesn't tell us to obey to qualify.  
He calls us my obedient children.  
 As far as God is concerned, we are his obedient children.  
We have obeyed.  
When we obey the gospel and receive the gospel, we accept the obedience of Jesus Christ in our place.  
We have fulfilled God's requirement.  
We don't need to obey.  
What we have to do is to look and see who we are.  
 and then walk in the light of who we are.  
He says, if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.  
And automatically, the blood of Jesus Christ is sung, cleansed us from our sin.  
Can you shut him in somebody?  
 In that situation, you don't have to try to find out did I sin against God last week?  
Did I sin against God yesterday?  
He says no, if we walk in the light that God has given us, as He lives in the light, what does that mean?  
If I walk in the light of my justification, as He is in the light of my justification, justification means declared righteous, declared not guilty, acquitted, can you shout amen to somebody?  
 He lives in the light of my sanctification.  
What does that mean?  
It is to fold.  
It means that one, he separated me from the world onto himself.  
And now he cranes the world out of me.  
He is my sanctification.  
I say, wow, God is my sanctification.  
Christ Jesus is my sanctification.  
I am not trying to sanctify myself.  
He is my sanctification.  
Hallelujah.  
Do you get it now?  
 Christianity is called a great confession.  
You know what that means?  
It means saying what God said.  
Saying what God said in agreement with him.  
The Greek is homologia.  
It means speaking the same thing in consent.  
In agreement.  
That's what Christianity is.  
 Hey, how did you receive salvation?  
Romans 10 verse 9, if thou shall confess with thy mouth, the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in thy heart, that God adraced him from the dead, thou shall be saved.  
He didn't say to do anything, for with the heart men believe it unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  
That's what it says.  
 With the heart you believe, and I'm made right with God.  
With the mouth you declare, you confess, and you are catapulted into salvation.  
You know why there are many struggling Christians who are trying to be more Christian-ly?  
Because they haven't done what God said.  
God said, say it.  
That's what he said.  
So that's what we read in verse 5, chapter 13, Book of Hebrews, when he said, for he had said,  
 He had said, so that we may boldly say, he said, so that I may boldly say, he had said, so that we may boldly say, hallelujah.  
What are you going to boldly say?  
Let me give you an example.  
I'm aware the whole world is aware that the United States  
 is facing economic difficulties right now.  
Now, they're going to be those who would say, we don't know what's going to happen.  
We don't know what the future holds.  
We don't know what's happening.  
We don't know what the government's going to do.  
We don't know.  
We don't know.  
We don't know.  
And because they keep speaking confusion like this, the life goes, we don't know.  
You know, as the economic cuffs, they quick.  
 When something happens, it affects them.  
No, you're going to have to live beyond this.  
You're going to think differently.  
For he had said so that women boldly say, I don't belong here.  
 How long he?  
Everything in this world is an instrument for my use.  
They can't rule over me.  
They don't dominate me.  
The economy doesn't rule me.  
I function from a different economy.  
 If you don't think that way, it's not going to work, let me remind you of something.  
The book you hold, the Bible, the Bible shows us how that God was always with his people when they had trouble like this.  
Every time they had trouble, economic problems, he showed up and put them through victorious leaves.  
And not just by the skin of their teeth, no!  
 He led them through a bone and I was saying something to you.  
In the Bible, who are God's strengths?  
Let's think.  
Because in your life you might just think that God likes it when we are quiet and suffering and just barely getting along.  
Let's think for a moment.  
 Who are those that God called his friends?  
The first one that God called his friends said, Abraham my friend.  
God said so.  
He said, Abraham my friend.  
What was Abraham like?  
Genesis chapter 24.  
I want to read verse one.  
Are you there?  
Read, want to go.  


  
 Did you see that?  
The devil blessed him?  
Who did?  
In what?  
All things Abraham was God's frame  
 And He was all, and well stricken in age, and the promises in the Lord had blessed Him in all things.  
Say, God has blessed me.  
See, if this becomes your confession, you know what happens?  
It will start showing.  
It will start showing.  
It will start showing.  
But if you don't say it, it will close up.  
And everybody will know that you are really suffering.  
 And I think I really hard with you.  
Glory to God.  
I'm blessed of God.  
Say again, I'm blessed of God.  
Okay, then, then was Isaac.  
Isaac was blessed of God.  
Is that right?  
Genesis chapter 26.  
Mando-romo-skis-um-ra-haya.  
Hallelujah.  


  
 Are you there?  
I want to show you something here.  
This is nice.  
Read from verse 12 to verse 14.  
Want to go.  


  
 Did you see that?  
Listen, this is not for a select few, it's for every one of us.  
Are you hearing me?  
Look at it there.  
It is then I was exhorting that land and received them the same year.  
And the same year when everybody here was having problems.  
 All of us didn't get it.  
What he did?  
What?  
He was a best man.  
He was a best man.  
I'm a best man.  
I'm a best man.  
Every day I live, I'm a best man everywhere I go.  
I'm a best man, best, best, best.  
It's my consciousness.  
I'm blessed.  
 When you get home tonight or to the hotel tonight, while you're inside there, you say glory to God.  
I'm blessed.  
I know what?  
Make sure you celebrate.  
You say glory, I'm blessed.  
Do a little dance for the Lord.  
You say I'm blessed.  
I'm blessed.  
I'm blessed.  
Glory.  
 I'm blessed.  
You'd be amazed at what will begin to happen.  
I'm showing you how to use the keys of the kingdom of God.  
Don't just be quiet.  
Say, I'm blessed.  
I'm blessed.  
I'm blessed.  
You know, somebody said, I'm blessed and looked around to be sure nobody heard him.  


  
 Let's see.  


  
 Let me explain something to you.  
So you can understand.  
What country is this?  
Where are we?  
What country?  
What's this country?  
What is it?  
I want to be sure.  
What country is this?  
Ghana, right?  
Rwanda.  
Sorry.  
Sorry.  
Senegal.  
 Oh, Nigeria.  
Oh, I'm sorry.  
This is not Africa?  
Oh, oh.  
Is this the United States?  
The United States of Africa or America?  
This is the United States of America.  
Okay, let me tell you something so you can understand where I'm coming from.  
Are you hearing me?  
 You're not listening to some fellow who has been in the United States and listening to some nice things and trying to tell us something.  
I'm gonna try and tell you something.  
Are you there?  
Okay.  
Several years ago, while we were ministry,  
 in Africa, in Lagos, Nigeria.  
I told a congregation something.  
At the time, that congregation was about maybe 200 to 220 people.  
That was the size of the congregation.  


  
 And I said to them three years ago, I said to them, America has been a blessing to the whole world.  
I said, I received magazines from America, free magazines, and Bibles from American Christians.  
I said, we have been blessed from America.  
 Christians in America have sent money around the world for evangelism, missionary work.  
I said, the day is coming.  
Well, they will need us.  
And we will send bibles to America.  
I said, who will send magazines to America?  
Let me tell you something.  
We are already sending magazines to America.  
 We are sending Bibles to America.  
Are you hearing me?  


  
 And you know what?  
That's just the beginning.  
Because there's so much more.  
It's by the anointing of the Holy Spirit.  
It is not by might.  
It is not by power.  
But by my Spirit, say it to the Lord.  
Now, what I'm sharing with you is how the anointing of God's Spirit works.  
When you understand that these are principles.  
The principles.  
 It's that spirit that brought you here to this meeting.  
Do you know how we got this building?  
The same way they're noting.  
The same way they're noting works.  
The same way.  
There's nothing that we want that we can't get.  
Nothing, absolutely nothing.  
We're here.  
 on the King's mission.  
We're doing the King's business.  
We've got a job to do.  
We're changing the world.  
I hear me.  
We're changing the world.  
You see, understand the vision, understand it, flow with it.  
Because it replicates itself in each one of us.  
 See, I'm sharing something with you like this, how the learning works in us.  
Well, that's the way it'll do you in your business, in your finances, in your job.  
You just discover you have become the number one in your job.  
The most respected in your job.  
You just become.  
Number one doesn't mean the managing director or CEO.  
Number one means the most prosperous person.  
 The Bible says about Isaac, the Philistines envied him.  
He was in their land.  
Until the king of the Philistines came to him and said, now you are greater than us.  
You can read the rest of it.  
They came to him.  
They said, now you are greater than us.  
This promise was that you would not destroy us.  
Tell us you're not going to fight us.  
You are greater than us.  
That's what they told Isaac.  
They said, you are greater than us.  
Please promise us you're not going to fight us.  
 How are you following this?  
I'm showing you your future.  
I said, I'm showing you your future.  
It won't take long before those same words are being said about you.  
Look at that last part there.  
Look at what he says.  
Look at what he says.  
 He says in verse 13, and the man watched greats and went forward and grew until he became very great.  
Oh God.  
The man went forward.  
He watched greats.  
He grew until he became very great.  
 Said, that's my testimony.  
So again, that's my testimony.  
One more time, that's my testimony.  
That's my testimony.  
See, we're holding some of the largest programs around the world.  
And there's a reason for us.  
The many who don't believe it's true.  
 There are many who don't believe it's true.  
They can't believe it.  
They think it's some juxtaposition of some images and pictures.  
They think we are.  
They think we're creating that.  
They can't believe it.  
But it's real.  
No, you come into those meetings and you are surprised.  
You are amazed.  
And all you can say is that half of it was not told me.  
 Yeah?  
It's going to happen in this country.  
And it's going to happen here.  
It's going to happen here.  
It's by the Holy Ghost that dwells in us.  
Hallelujah.  
And the Lord is getting you ready.  
You are getting ready.  
And what I'm sharing with you is to show you that vision so you can see that God has made you great.  
 God has put something in you.  
You are not ordinary.  
No, you're not ordinary.  
And the Lord will create opportunities for you.  
These are things that He does, and He does them well.  
You create opportunities for you.  
He says, I put before you an open door, and no man can shut it.  


  
 You know why it's nice?  
Because you see, God uses such situations to sneak up on them.  
It's very nice.  
 It's very nice.  
So, that's why something like this is happening inside here.  
It's almost what I would call a hideout because this is not open.  
This is here.  
But we're sharing words that can take over the whole nation.  
See that?  
And we listen to this and we're getting ready.  
We're getting bigger on the inside.  
 Smith Wigglesworth used to say, a great man of God many years ago, I'm 10 times bigger inside than I am outside.  
Well, I'm many more times bigger than that.  
Ain't you side than outside?  
Because I'm a giant inside.  
See, outside, I may not look like a giant.  
Of course I don't look like a giant, but inside,  
 Oh, greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world.  
Hallelujah.  
Start operating those laws.  
Start operating them.  
When you get home tonight, action one, when you get home tonight, or you get to the hotel tonight, action one.  
I said, what?  
Get in there.  
Get in there.  
And you said, boy, I'm blessed.  
I'm blessed.  
 Bless!  
Then you say, I'm gonna enjoy my life.  


  
Does anybody have a phone or something?  
Do you get a phone?  
Yeah, you know, this is a phone.  
You know, some people can't even enjoy their phone.  
You can even, it just falls all the time.  
It drops and it's like, what is all this?  
You can enjoy it.  
 Or you can enjoy something as nice as this.  
It's nice.  
You look at it.  
See?  
Relish the moment.  
Relish it.  
Like it.  
Enjoy yourself.  
Are you hearing me?  
If you don't love you, you can't love anybody else.  
When you stand in front of a mirror, if you don't have a mirror, get one.  
 You need to see what God made.  
You stand in front of the mirror.  
You look at yourself and you say, Lord, I love you.  
Yeah.  
Look at yourself in the mirror.  
Don't wait for somebody to pay some compliment.  
You may never get one.  
 And you shouldn't care.  
Look at yourself in the mirror and say, Lord, I love what you made.  
So you enjoy that.  
See, I love me because I love God and I love what God made.  
And if I can love me, I can love you.  
You see that?  
That's the way it works.  
Enjoy every moment.  
Enjoy every moment.  
 When you look good, look at something real good.  
Look at it nice.  
Take a good look and say, I like it.  
It's nice.  
I like it.  
It's nice.  
Speak positively.  
Look at a positive side of things.  
Say, I like it.  
It's nice.  
If you can't find something you like there, maybe you find it here.  
If you can't find it here, look down.  
Look up.  
 And say, that strand of hair looks nice.  
Look for something.  
Stand channeling your mind in the positive direction of life.  
You'd be amazed at what's happening to you.  
All the good things is that journey towards you.  
All the opportunities will be coming to you.  
There are people who never find opportunities.  
They never just get it.  
Because they're not aware that life is full of opportunities.  
 They're all the time.  
Life is full of opportunities.  
Beautiful ones all the time.  
And I can take advantage of them.  
Praise God.  
I know who I am.  
Say, I know who I am.  
I'm God's number one.  
Hey, say, I'm God's number one.  
You know who I am?  
I'm God's number one.  
 Come on!  
Some of you are too shy to say, you're just smiling at me.  
I'm God's number one.  
I'm God's number one.  
I'm God's number one.  
So look at me.  
I'm God's number one.  
I'm smart.  
I'm intelligent.  
 I'm wise.  
I'm wise.  
Greater is he.  
That is in me.  
Then he that's in the world.  
I'm a success.  
I'm a success.  
 Greta!  
Greta!  
Greta!  
Greta!  
Greta!  
Greta!  
Is he that is in me?  
Hallelujah!  
Shout him in somebody!  
Hallelujah!  
I know who I am.  
See, your life goes where your mouth goes.  


  
 Say I'm full of joy.  
And I'm full of power.  
God lives in me.  
I'm strong with the strength of God.
