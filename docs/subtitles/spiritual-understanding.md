title: Spiritual Understanding
---
 One thing is sudden.  
If you stick to the Word, you will come back with a testimony.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a healing.  
What God wants to give in your life is not a job.  
What God wants to give in your life is not money.  
What God wants to give you is the Word of God in your spirit.  
It'll make you what it talks about.  
 And you are shining, and you are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining by the power of the Holy Ghost.  
You are shining and nothing can stop you.  
It is your season.  
It is your time.  
Nothing can hinder you.  
This is your time.  
This is your hour.  
Fable is yours.  


  
 in this insightful expose for believers.  
Pastor Chris teaches on how to live a victorious Christian life.  
That you might want one of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work.  
 and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with all might.  
Expounding on the teachings of Apostle Paul in the book of Colosians, he teaches on the importance of being fruitful and increasing in the knowledge of God's word.  
As you listen, you will be transformed by the power of the Holy Ghost, and you will understand the importance of the Word of God.  
Let's go to  
 Colosians, you're looking like you're getting ready.  
Okay, Colosians in chapter number one, and I'll begin reading from what verse would be the best for you now.  
I'll take it from verse nine.  
Colosians chapter one, from verse nine, I'll give you the background.  
 This great apostle of God, the apostle Paul, had been informed of these Christians in this great city.  
And he said, we learned of all that's been happening with you.  
It was one of his converts who had gone to minister to them.  
 And so Paul said, we've heard of your love toward all the saints.  
How you love God and love God's people.  
They were young Christians.  
They've just come into Christ.  
And they're strong for the Lord.  
And so he says, no, these were in verse 9.  
 I've just given you a little gist of verses one to eight.  
Okay.  
And verse nine says, for this cause we also, since the day we heard it, what did they hear of your love towards the saints?  
Do not cease to pray for you and desire that he might be fair with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.  
This is very instructive.  
 very informative.  
He says, this is the desire of the Spirit.  
Now, understanding that Paul here is letting us know the prayer and desire of the Spirit working through him and his companions at this time and the inner sitting for God's people.  
And here's a content of their prayer that he might be filled with the knowledge  
 This knowledge is talking about is a special kind of knowledge.  
The English language doesn't give us the best expressions sometimes.  
The word here is translated from the Greek epagnosis.  
It means precise knowledge.  
Precise accurate and absolute knowledge.  
It only comes by revelation.  
This is a knowledge that comes through the Spirit.  
 So he says that we desire that he might be filled with the knowledge, the precise knowledge of his will, God's will.  
We want you to have the knowledge of God's will.  
Did you know that not many Christians have the knowledge of God's will?  
They are hoping things might just fall into place.  
They are hoping that they are functioning in God's will.  
They are hoping that things would just be right.  
They don't know the real will of God.  
 But accurate, they don't know it.  
And yet this is the prayer of the Spirit, that He might be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom.  
And in this end, spiritual understanding, I like that expression.  
There's a difference between mental understanding and spiritual understanding.  
He's thought about the understanding that comes from God.  
 God's ways of seeing things.  
I like this.  
How does God see it?  
Let me pick Jesus as an example.  
A man is brought to Jesus.  
He's a death mute.  
He's never, he's never taught.  
He's never heard.  
They bring this man to Jesus and Jesus doesn't say like the  
 Others might have said, based on their understanding, their equity understanding, they would have said, you know, there was a damage, something, trying to tell us something that happened at these birds or some hereditary problem, you know, thinking like that.  
But Jesus had a different understanding, spiritual understanding.  
He had spiritual insights.  
He knew what it was.  
 The farmer says that Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears and commanded the deaf spirit to come out.  
You could find out in the hospital.  
You couldn't find out in the laboratory.  
You couldn't find that out through science.  
This was spiritual understanding.  
He knew that life, human life, is spiritual.  


  
Spiritual understanding.  
 Life is spiritual.  
How can you explain?  
Here is this great doctor.  
He's been so wonderful.  
He's helped so many people.  
Now he's dying of the very thing that he killed others off.  
How can you explain it?  
It's not the understanding of that sickness that it doesn't have.  
He has that understanding based on science.  
 What it lacks is what we call reality.  
Hey, come on.  
Even in simple science, we all know that the colors we see are not the real colors.  
Come on.  
Once you see the color that you see is not the real color, it's the color that comes back to you depending on the kind of light that falls on the object.  


  
 Not simple.  
And yet the Bible tells us that the Word of God is light.  
So you want to know the real situation turned the Word of God on that object.  
So you talk about the x-rays, right?  
As I'm going for an x-ray, I want to find out where the stuff is inside of me.  
I'm going for the scan.  
 Hey, if you tried the word, you'd be amazed.  
Because we can really find out through the word of God what the problem is.  
The Bible says the word of God, the logos of God is living and active.  
Shapa, then any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow.  
There's a scanner of the thoughts and intents of the hearts.  
 That's what the word is.  
The word of God is a scanner.  
Hallelujah.  
You're still there?  
All right, so verse nine again, Colossians chapter number one, verse nine.  
For this cause we are so soon so they were hurting, did not cease to pray for you and the desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom in spiritual understanding, verse 10.  
 That she might walk, oh, I wish I had time to talk about all of this.  
That she might walk worthy of the Lord onto all pleasing.  
That means pleasing the Lord in everything.  
Being fruitful in every good work.  
Dear Lord, there's no place for failure.  
He says, being fruitful in every good work.  
That's my life.  
I'm fruitful in every good work.  
 being fruitful in every good work.  
And while at that increasing in the knowledge of God, you know, some people, you know, the more they make progress in their job,  
 the less than no of God.  
Because now, you know, I've got to give some time to my work.  
Sorry, I couldn't go to church, or I didn't have time to read the Bible, because I've been, I've been really busy.  
Uh-uh, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.  
Fruitful in your job, fruitful in your school, fruitful in every good work, and at the same time, increasing in the knowledge of God.  
 I mean, every good one, including sports.  
Fruitful in whatever you do, every good work.  
And at the same time, increasing in the knowledge.  
Again, it's that word, epicnosis of God.  
Precise knowledge, revelation knowledge of God.  
Know what it is to get to new God?  
From your spirit, relating with Him?  
 This is not made of knowledge.  
Oh, glory to God.  
 I said, I wish I had time to give you all of this.  
This is wonderful, but I want to start from somewhere else.  
Not a verse 11, just putting you in the right context.  
Strengthening here is the will of God again.  
In his prayer, his praying that we be strengthened with all might.  
He means invigorated.  
The word there is miracle-working ability, dunamis in Greek, invigorated with miracle-working ability.  
 Can you imagine that?  
This is the will of God for us.  
This is the prayer that he prays for those saints.  
He says, we desire and pray for you.  
That he is strengthening with might.  
Strengthening with might, invigorated with might.  
And this, I said, might there is some dynamism, miracle working ability.  
 that should be invigorated with power.  
According to his glorious power, unto all patience and long suffering with joyfulness.  
You know, King James can be sometimes, yeah, oh my, this is nice.  
He's as strengthened with all might, according to God's glorious power.  
 Not according to man's power.  
You can be invigorated according to God's power.  
To God's ability to make it happen.  
Man can't do that for you.  
On to all patients.  
No matter what's going on.  
You are so strengthened of God.  
 So invigorated with miracle-working ability, that means you can change anything.  
So you're not troubled, you're not perturbed.  
If this thing doesn't turn out my way, I'll fix it.  
And when you have that mentality, hey, he doesn't believe it shall not make hiss.  
Then you refuse to worry.  
He says, be anxious for nothing.  
 Be anxious for nothing.  
But in everything, not in some things, in everything, by prayer and supplication, we thanks give in.  
Make your request known to God.  
And the peace of God that surpasses all understanding shall garrison your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.  
Be anxious for nothing.  
I refuse to be anxious.  


  
 Because I am invigorated with miracle-working ability.  
I can change anything.  
You should go on down and make your worst move.  
I'll change it.  
 When I show up, I fix it.  


  
They say, listen, the devil's doing something over there.  
He don't worry.  
Is it the devil?  
He's no factor.  
He's no factor.  
Hallelujah.  
Oh, go back to verse 11.  
I'll win verse 11.  
 strengthen with all might according to his glorious power honor our patience and long suffering with joyfulness that's it so he says relax and be joyful in the midst of all this because you are invigorated with might verse 12 ah-ha  
 Now, here's where I want to begin to explain something.  
And I hope you can get this.  
Yes, you will.  
Yes, you will.  
You sure will.  
He says, in all of this, while he's praying that all this will happen to you, he says, giving thanks.  
You're doing this.  
He says, giving thanks onto the Father, which had made us meet.  
Now, that's King James.  
What is just saying?  
The Father, who has qualified us.  
That's what it means.  
 Giving thanks unto the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life.  
Let's examine this.  
Giving thanks unto the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints.  
You see, He qualified me.  
 Do you understand?  
He qualified us in Christ Jesus.  
By yourself you couldn't qualify.  
By your parents you couldn't qualify.  
By your ugly nationality you couldn't qualify.  
By your words and actions you couldn't qualify.  
But he in Christ Jesus qualified you.  
He made you fit to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints.  
 In lights.  
That means in the kingdom of lights.  
Where we dwell.  
Verse 13, you'll like this one.  
Who had mamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamam  
 That means has already, has already, has already, he has, who has delivered us.  
Let me explain the meaning of that word delivered so you can understand God's not afraid of that devil.  
The word there is, you know, sometimes we think,  
 The people don't even understand English enough yet, and here we are trying to add some Greek and Hebrew.  


  
What it means there, that word is jumai.  
What it means is to pluck and bring to yourself.  
You know you can pluck something and let it fall.  
You understand?  
You can take something out of there and let it go away.  
 But it's different when you pluck it and take it to yourself.  
It means to rush it out of where it is and pull it to you.  
That's what he's talking about.  
Who has delivered us?  
He brought us out to himself.  
Who had delivered us from the power, the dominion, the control, the jurisdiction, the authority of darkness.  
 My goodness.  
He had delivered us from the control of darkness.  
What do you mean by darkness?  
Darkness means evil and evil powers and all their works.  
Darkness represents all that's blind and ignorant.  
Darkness means all that's destructive.  
Everything that makes a lie.  
Everything that works against the purposes of God.  
 Everything that's negative to you.  
That's what it means by darkness.  
Satan's dominion.  
This is, he had delivered us from the control of darkness.  
Oh Lord Jesus, he had delivered us from the dominion of darkness.  
Satan has lost his dominion over us.  
Evil has lost his dominion over us.  
Darkness has lost his dominion over us.  
 from the jurisdiction of darkness.  
I am not under Satan's jurisdiction.  
He has no authority over me.  
He cannot decide what happens with me.  
I don't function under his jurisdiction.  
I've been proked out of there.  
I'll belong there.  
My, my, my.  
 Glory to God.  
Is it sickness?  
That's attacking your body?  
Disease and infinity of the body?  
The fear of failure, fear of darkness, fear of the future?  
Everything of fear, the Bible says fear brings to mind.  
So fear is not from God.  
Fear is of the darkness.  
 And you have been delivered from the dominion of fear.  
Are you afraid of financial failure?  
Failure of your business?  
Fear is not allowed.  
In the Kingdom of Christ, fear is not allowed.  
It's outlawed.  
 Oh glory, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated?  
Come on here, let's look again.  
Who hath delivered us past tense, present tense or future tense?  
That means he's already done it.  
In the mind of God, he's already done it.  
 It doesn't matter what you're going through.  
In the mind of God, you wear blood out of it.  


  
Now you can understand why you've been asking for the same thing for so long and nothing has changed.  
Because you're trying to look for what's with you already.  
You're trying to get something that already belongs to you.  
 You're trying to become what you already are?  
Who had the lever, Das?  
So, I don't need the leverance, do I?  
No!  
He's already done it!  
I don't know, yeah.  
 He's already done it.  
Who had delivered us from the dominion of darkness in hats like this.  
This is amazing.  
And hats, hats translated us.  
He's not trying to do it.  
That word translated means transferred.  
He has transferred us.  
 He has transferred us.  
In the mind of God, we have been removed from the dominion of darkness, from the jurisdiction of darkness, and transferred.  
We are not in the process.  
We are not on our journey to freedom.  
Somebody said, I'm on my way to glory land.  
No, I was born there.  
Hallelujah.  
 I was born there.  
I'm not on my way to glory land.  
I'm not trying to be successful.  
I'm not trying to be victorious.  
Let's look at it.  
This is the word of God who had to leave it us from the power darkness and had to translate it.  
 past tears translated us into the kingdom of his dear son.  
Oh my goodness.  
This is wonderful.  
Where are we?  
He says, translated into the kingdom of his dear son.  
The word, the word dear is wrongly rendered.  
It's a Greek agape.  
It means love.  
 What it means is his love song.  
You know, you read it and it becomes a conundrum of revelation.  
You used that one, what exactly is he saying?  
What is he trying to say?  
What is this?  
Transferred to the kingdom of his love song, his love song.  
Do you remember?  
 This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.  
That's the son of his love.  
Hi, Jesus is all love.  
He's all love.  
And guess what?  
We're in his kingdom.  
There's where we live.  
Now, here's the question.  
 Is this true or false?  
So what should we do in the light of this?  


  
Pray about it?  


  
Oh God, bring me into  
 You remember that old song he used to sing?  
I don't know if that's the same thing.  
I've done those things many years ago.  
I said, I will enter his gates.  
We Thanksgiving in my heart.  
I will enter his cards.  
We pray.  
I will sing.  
This is the day that the Lord had me.  
I will rejoice for him.  
I will enter.  
I will enter.  
Where are you now?  


  
 Hallelujah.  
Let me tell you something.  
You see, these things might seem, might seem little.  
They are not little.  
He says, the entrance of thy words, give it light.  
If you don't know what the word says, you will live a life of assumptions.  
And you would think that you are close to God just because, you know, you feel close to God doesn't make you any closer than when you're done fear like it.  
 It's got nothing to do with your feeling.  
Somebody's like, oh wow, he's not meeting on how to good feeling.  
I really felt close to God.  
What's feeling God do with it?  


  
If Jesus lived according to his feeling, then maybe he was not the Son of God then.  
Because you see, one day he didn't feel so cool.  
He was in the boat and he was sleeping.  
 I mean, he was tired.  
On another occasion, the Bible tells us that Jesus was tired.  
That he had come from a long journey.  
So he was tired.  
On another occasion, the Bible says he was hungry.  
Think about it.  
Those were feelings.  
So you mean when he was hungry, he was no longer the son of God temporarily.  
 Because if he's the son of God, he shouldn't be hungry.  
Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more.  


  
But that same man said, I am the bread of heaven.  
But he was hungry.  
The bread of heaven was hungry.  
 So that tears his hunger is a feeling.  
You don't eat because you're hungry.  
Because those who eat whenever they're hungry, you can tell when you see them.  
Hunger is a feeling.  
We don't eat because we feel hungry and we don't stop because we don't feel hungry.  
We eat when we shoot.  
It takes discipline to know.  
 that you should eat and that you should stop.  
And we should not be controlled by our feelings.  
We should be controlled by the word of God, what God says.  
You know, sometimes maybe you did something wrong in you.  
You said, oh, Lord, forgive me.  
And then temporarily, you felt like he heard you.  
A few days later, it weighs on your mind again, and you think like,  
 Looks like he hasn't forgiven me yet.  
And you say, Lord, I'm really sorry.  
Then you think, for now, it's OK.  
A day or two later, it's still there.  
And you say, Lord, I told you I was sorry.  
Now, is that wondering where I'm not?  
He's been listening to you.  
But he wasn't responsible for that, for that accusation that you got.  
 He wasn't responsible for that.  
Did you know that's not the ministry of the Holy Spirit?  
To convict you of your sin?  
How many don't understand that?  
The Bible says the Holy Spirit will convict the word of sin, not the church.  
For the church, the Bible says if we will judge our zeroes, we shall not be judged.  
That means we, by our own spirits, can tell when we've done something wrong.  
 And our own spirits will judge us.  
And we let ourselves judge ourselves that we be not judged of the Lord.  
See, your spirit has the nature of God.  
So it's your spirit.  
It's your own spirit that lets you know whether or not you've done something wrong.  
And when you do, you act on the Word of God.  
What do you do?  
You don't ask for forgiveness.  
 For the Bible didn't say that you ask for forgiveness.  
Oh.  


  
Surprise?  
Okay, let's see what it says.  
First John chapter 1.  
Let's begin from verse 7.  
 and we're going to read it down into chapter 2.  
All right?  
Let's go.  
But if we walk in the light as he's in the light, we have fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ is some cleansed us from our sin.  
This is really powerful.  
Verse 8.  
If we say that we have no sin, what is it that has errors and the truth is not in us?  
Verse 9.  
If we confess our sins,  
 He is faithful and just to forgive us, our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  
Are you noticing this?  
If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a lion, his word is not in us.  
My little children, these things right are only you that is sin not.  
 So that means sin is not compulsory.  
That means it's possible not to.  
Look at it.  
These things, right?  
I want to use that.  
You sin not.  
And if any man sins, did he say when any man sins?  
No.  
If not when.  
If he had said when any man sins, that means, hey, you're all going to be drinking in equity like water.  
 But that's not what he said.  
He says, if, and if any man said, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.  
And he's the propitiation for our sins and not for us only, but also for the sins of the whole world.  
Run to Hebrews chapter 4.  


  
Verse 15.  


  
 For we have not an high priest, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.  
Go on.  
Let us therefore come boldly.  
Let us therefore come boldly onto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy.  
Obtain, not ask for.  
Obtain, obtain, find grace to help in time of needs.  
That means collect it.  
 Can you see that?  
Uh, Kayla Andrews gave her a bottle in the stages.  


  
There's much more.
