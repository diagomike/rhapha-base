Divine health is God’s will for me; therefore, I walk in it always. Jesus bore all infirmities on His body, securing my divine health forever. I reject sickness, infirmity, and all the works of darkness in Jesus’ Name. It makes no difference what I feel, hear, see or what my experience has been; I have a more sure word of prophecy than my experience; it’s the Word of God’s grace for my health. Therefore, I hold on to that Word always and my experience conforms.

February 15th, 2021

The same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in me; He who raised Christ from the dead has given life to my physical body through His Spirit who dwells in me.

February 16th 2021

I consciously practice enjoying my life in divine health. I insist on the Word, affirming boldly that divine life has replaced the human life and its attendant effects. I do not live by the dictates of my body; I only respond to the leading and guidance of God’s Word for my life and health. The Word says, “They that dwell in Zion shall not say ‘I am sick’.” Based on this Word, I know I can never be sick for divinity now resides fully in my body. Glory to God!

Eternal life is at work in me, and every part of my being is inundated with the life of God. The result of this life is undeniable, inevitable, and evidential for all to see.

February 20th 2021

I live the transcendent life of God. This life is superior to viruses, plagues, infirmities, and death. I do not get infected by that which infects the ordinary man; I do not get affected by that which affects the normal man; I am not moved by that which moves the mortal man. The Word of God in me preserves me from all ills and evils. I am fully protected in Christ, who is my life, sustenance, and my solid rock.



## Dívíɳҽ 卄ealtɧ Cσnfҽssiσɳs~3246
