*DO ALL THINGS IN HIS NAME.* 

Monday, March 11th

Pastor Chris   

_*And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him (Colossians 3:17).*_  

In our opening text, the Apostle Paul was referring to the instrumentality of the Name of Jesus; using the Name of Jesus as an instrument, as a weapon, the way you’d use a knife or any weapon.

Imagine what your life would be like if you lived every day, doing all things in the Name of Jesus! Imagine that all your projects were started in the Name of Jesus! Imagine coming into your office every day, declaring, “I come in the Name of Jesus!” It immediately takes away every form of limitation. What a life of success and glory that is! 

The Word is clear: you can do anything in the Name of Jesus as long as it brings the Father glory. If you’d live this way, there’d be no fear in your life; you wouldn’t go to bed at night wondering what might happen to you, because you’re living for Him—in His authority. Nothing compares to that; it’s the way to live the supernatural Christian life. 

If there’s a tumour in your body, for example, use the Name of Jesus as an instrument against it. Say, “Tumour, in the Name of Jesus, you can’t stay in this body; I cut you out,” and it’ll go! If you had a problem with your heart, command it to function normally, in the Name of Jesus. If you’ve been having trouble at work, command the storm to cease, in the Name of Jesus. 

His Name is the solution to every problem; it’s the way out of every quagmire. Even now, declare, “In the Name of the Lord Jesus, I have the wisdom to function and deal excellently, to answer questions, and solve problems. I do the right thing at the right time, in the right way for the right purpose.” Blessed be God!

*PRAYER* 
*Dear Father, I thank you for every hindrance has been taken away from my path, in the Name of Jesus. I walk the path of success, victory, and triumph, because I function, and do all things in the Name of Jesus. I’m in good health, and at the top of my game. My life is for glory and excellence, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.*

*FURTHER STUDY:* 
*Acts 3:2-7 & 16* 
2. And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 
3. Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. 
4. And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. 
5. And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. 
6. Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. 
7. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted [him] up: and immediately his feet and ancle bones received strength.
16. And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.  

*John 14:13* 
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 

*Philippians 2:9-11* 
9. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: 
10. That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things] under the earth; 
11. And [that] every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ [is] Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

Be Like a Child When It Comes To Money – Pastor Chris
NOVEMBER 15, 2018

In continuation of his mind blowing exposition to delegates at the ongoing Pastor’s Conference of the International Pastors and Partners Conference, 2018, Pastor said that when it comes to money, he is like a child, according to him, “I was a child when I started. I didn’t know it cost so much to do big things for Jesus. I refused to be troubled with money like a child. Grown men have problems with money”, he added.

Pastor Chris wondered how anyone can be thinking how much you are going to give God, pointing out that “if something was wrong with the way I give, I would have told you. Think differently about money. Think like a child and that the money is always there in abundance. Think like that because it’s true. Refuse to think otherwise”. He warned that this is very important.

He further explained how David empowered Solomon with resources. He recalled the humble beginning of David and how God blessed him so much that he was able to leave abundant wealth for his son, Solomon. Pastor kept repeating that wisdom without money is not good and that Powerful message without resources is not good.

In conclusion, Pastor admonished delegates not to “ work so hard to make what Jesus already did happen. Don’t make things your value and driving force. It will make you to keep moving because of better offers. You’re a child of God. I think differently. Try what I’m sharing with you for three to five months. Let it stick. You will be amazed. Don’t drown in the water”.



## DEVELOPING THE SPIRIT OF GENEROSITY~587

The more you stay in God, the better the aura you carry. Stop surviving, live for Him. If you plan your life well, you will achieve certainly. Allow God to interrupt your plan but make sure you have a plan so your life can be a testimony in the face of the earth. You must intentionally be a giver. 

Mark 12:41-44, every offering you give without excitement does not appreciate what God has done. Our giving is a response to what God has done. Sacrificial Giving is not a sin but nobody will command you to do it. Generosity wins people to you. 

Acts 8:32, gifting creates opportunities often times. 1 king 3:5-13 your relevance is as a result of your vision. Riches come in the place of staying with God’s word. Equality is in Christ but our functionality distinguishes Us. You can’t be generous until you kill self. When you know something, joy is always in you. Wisdom is a form of capital. When you have wisdom you must have money. 

Ephesians 4:17.-20, you are greedy, because you don’t know who you are in Christ. Money doesn’t give you voice but your knowledge does. Knowledge gives you expression. Another way to get grace is to stay humble. When you give to someone, you leave a memory of you in that person. Your knowing is your activism. You can’t love God and not be a giver. 

God in a leader brings a sense of direction. You are saved for a generation. Change the narrative of your society. If you don’t change your association each time, you might just remain somewhere. To update, you must drop the spirit of I know and keep learning,



## PROPHECIES AND WORDS OF FAITH AS DECLARED BY THE HIGHLY ESTEEMED CEO.~588

Today is the day of singing. It is the song of worship, praise and confessions because the lord has done great things.

I have given you victory, a song of victory for you have won the victory and he has won the victory for you. Judgement has been given to the favour of the saints.

Any false accusation against you is cancelled. No one will be able to lay a charge against you. Every lying tongue is brought to nothing. He has  vindicated you, he has clothed you in righteousness, he has clothed you in glory and beauty.

No charge can stand against you and the plans of the wicked are cancelled. The extraordinary strategist has taken your case. Your advocate has spoken on your behalf. It is to your favour and let the song victory rise up in your Spirit.

Judgement has been given on your behalf to your favour. You are favoured and graced.

IT'S DONE IT'S DONE IT'S DONE IT'S DONE. The lord has done marvellous things in your life. Halleluyah.



## THE ACCESS TO A PASTOR~589

If you are close to a Pastor, there are things you must know and settle fast. If you do not settle it, you will walk into offence and it will truncate your relationship with both God and man. It will cause you pain and hinder purpose. 

Access is the best gift a man can give to you. If you do not know how to handle it, you will be locked out of your training school. 

Michal, the daughter of Saul, the wife of David, knew David from the days he showed up in the palace as that shepherd boy. She saw him rise in the military. She saw her father Saul scheme to kill David. 

She knew David in his "small boy" moments. She did not connect to the kingship, priesthood and prophetic dimension of David. The image of that "shepherd boy" never left her. Therefore, when David did his thing in worshipping God, she despised him. She never accepted his priesthood. 

Do you know David was on his way home to bless his family and met an angry wife? Rebecca accepted the priesthood of Isaac and barrenness ended. Michal despised the priesthood of David and died a barren woman. 

People who are the closest to a Pastor are the ones who despise correction most times. You can hang around a grace and it does not smell on you. Why should the son of the prophet die in debt yet his wife ran to the same man he served and got a miracle? 

If you are  close to a Pastor, double up your walk of honour. You will see their weakness but never take it for granted. You will see faults but do not let it lead you into offence. Remember that they are men. Honour them. Honour is not worship. 

This is the rule - Anytime you see the faults,  remember that it is because you have access. Access is a gift. 

If you are married to a Pastor, it is a tougher demand. It will be pretty hard at times knowing when to relate with him as your pastor or as your spouse- be discerning. 

People can share testimonies about how your spouse has been a blessing and you look at your life and wonder if they are simply lying. 

Some people never stopped seeing Jesus as the carpenter's son. 
Know when relationships have shifted. Align with it. 
Settle it fast. Choose either you want the Pastoral Relationship or all you want is the friendship and fellowship. They are different realities. 

Thank you.

Pastor Joy Amenkhienan.

ANGELIC ASSIGNMENTS
  
(Angels Are Around You To Help And Serve You)

TO THE BIBLE:
Hebrews 1:14 JMNT
“Are they not all spirits of ministration, who are sent to minister on account of them that are to inherit life?”

LET’S TALK

Have you ever been in an eatery where the server showed you a menu, and waited for you to make an order? You may have noted how attentive he was as he waited on you and was ready to get you whatever you wanted, as soon as you gave the word. That’s the same thing that angels do: they’ve come to serve and help you, waiting to be instructed.

In the Old Testament, angels only helped or delivered instructions from God to His people. When the angels were done, they went back to God. But as a child of God, your angels don’t come and go; they stay with you and are at your service 24 hours every day, 7 days every week, and 365 days every year! Every Christian has angels, as they are sent by God to help and guard His children. The Bible tells us that they are “...ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation” (Hebrews 1:14 NIV), and you’re an heir of salvation!

These angels are always with you wherever you go (Psalm 91:11). They go to work on your behalf whenever you speak God’s Word, and when you’re obedient to spiritual authority. Always be conscious of the presence of your angels, and get them working, for they’re always ready to take your order!

GO DEEPER
 
Psalm 91:10-11 AMPC; Hebrews 13:2

PRAY

Dear Father, thank you for giving your angels charge over me to guard and keep me. I walk with the consciousness of their presence, and I take advantage of their ministry in my life in Jesus’ Name. Amen!

DAILY BIBLE READING
 
ONE YEAR
Acts 24:1-27, Psalms 1-6

TWO YEAR
Galatians 4:21-31, Isaiah 36

ACT
What do you require done today? Speak in other tongues and give your angels assignments in the Name of Jesus, with specific instructions regarding what you want done.

## ALWAYS GIVE THANKS~597

(STAY IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF THANKSGIVING)

“Therefore by Him let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name.” -  HEBREWS 13:15

Jesus taught on the importance and benefit of worship and thanksgiving using the story of the ten lepers: “And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. And when he saw them, he said unto them, go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. And Jesus answering said, were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole” (Luke 17:12-19 KJV)

He commended the one who returned to give glory to God, and said unto him, “Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.” By coming to thank God for his miracle, he got something more than healing; he was made whole. Everything he had lost as a result of the leprosy was completely restored.

Never complain, grumble, or reminisce over the failures and disappointments of yesterday! Rather, let your heart be in a continuous state of gratitude, praise, joy and thanksgiving. Count your blessings and worship the Lord specially and passionately from your spirit each day.

It’s important that you do so continually: celebrate His goodness and many blessings upon your life. Worship Him from the very depths of your heart, for His great love, kindness, mercy and grace revealed to you from His Word. Be in perpetual joy every day of your life!

FURTHER STUDY: Philippians 3:3; Psalm 68:3-4

PRAYER FOR YOU: Dear heavenly Father, I worship you today from my heart, for your love, kindness, grace and tender mercies! You’re glorious and worthy to be praised; may your Name be glorified forever in my life and in all the earth, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.



## RAISED FOR A TIME LIKE THIS~598

BY PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.

I have raised you up for a time like this says the Lord. Face the world and the circumstances of your times, with courage, with faith for I have chosen you for this time, therefore, fear not for I am with you. Fear not for the times belongs to you. You are the one to reveal my glory. For I have spoken of the latter days and these are the latter days and you were chosen for these days. Trust my Word, trust my Spirit and walk in the light of the Word that I have given unto you. Behold there is rejoicing in the realm of the Spirit and it is known that I have always done that which is fit for my glory and you are fit for my glory. I chose you so fulfill my Word. Hallelujah!



## July Is The Month of Thanksgiving~605

What was Jesus like? How did He pray. What's the prayer of thanksgiving?  It's more than thanksgiving offering. 

We prayed in the month of June and we'll continue. How did Jesus pray? People claim their healing. Claim from who? We got our claims back through Jesus. Satan doesn't even have enough sense to steal from you. 

It's got to do with how you're raised spiritually. How can you believe God for a new car or house. How low. It the lowest of what Jesus said that all things are yours. In Christ Jesus there's no limit to what belongs to you. Your faith has to grow no doubt. 

The heir as long as... 

Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be Lord of all - Galatians 4:1 KJV. 

This month of thanksgiving you've got to understand prayer in a new way... 

Remember when Jesus fed five thousand men... 

 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.  And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. 
Matthew 14:19 - 20 KJV 

Jesus wanted a miracle. He had only five loaves and two fishes. He prayed by blessing the loaves and the fishes. How exactly did Jesus do it. He blessed, but how did He do it. 

He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.  And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all - Mark 6:38 ,  41 KJV.

But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.  Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude - Luke 9:13 ,  16 KJV.

John clarified the dark areas. He gave us the details... 

After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.  And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.  And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.  And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.  When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?  And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.  Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.  One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto him,  There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?  And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand - John 6:1 - 10 KJV 

Jesus had only a little boys lunch to perform this miracle. 

And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.  When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost - John 6:11 - 12 KJV 

Jesus gave thanks. That's all He did. Practice this throughout the month of July. When something comes to mind that you require, just give thanks. If you can think it out, it's there. It's ready. The speed of thought.  
 
He's done it. Thanks be unto God. Bless the Lord



## Pray-A-Thon2019 Grand Finale~610

Pst Chris Oyakhilome
It doesn't mean that because we prayed in the month of June, we are not going to pray again "NO", but something happened at that time when we prayed, we subdued spiritual forces.

Rev Ray Okocha
Importance of Thanksgiving in our Prayers 
We give thanks because we know God has heard, God has answered.
We know that tomorrow is beautiful because we have prayed and He has answered. 
In our Thanksgiving we know God has done something in our situation. .
Every time we thank God, we align ourselves with God's will, we are in a place of Victory, our faith has triumphed and overcome. 

We are thanking God because no matter what the enemy has done or is doing, there is an UPTURN.
The future is assured, we have prayed, we have spoken and God has given us directions.
Every time we give thanks, the forces of Heaven are on our behalf against the forces of darkness and everyone of them will crumble.
IT'S TESTIMONY TIME.

Pst Chris Oyakhilome
Someone sings you're the air I breathe and another says you're bigger than the air I breathe, both are expression of who He is to us. 

Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.  See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant
Jer. 1:9-10

When we pray, words are put in our mouth, when we pray what God says to us is the answer. What is the Lord saying to you, can you get a hold of it?
When God shows you something, pay attention, it's got meaning. When you pay attention, God guides you. 

In prayers, we turn our attention to God, we turn our Spirits to God.. 
Prayer is a fellowship, it isn't about just throwing words. 

The speed of thoughts is faster and higher than the speed of light. In the realms of the Spirit, most of our transportation is by thoughts. God is watching over His Word to make it come to pass in your life. You don't have to try to make God's Word come to pass in your life.

Because we are the expression of His glory, none of the things in the world moves us. In prayer you're synchronized in God's plan and God's way. 
We never have to wait to be forced into prayer by crisis. If we pray as the Spirit of God leads us, when crisis happen, we walk through because we have already won. 

Rev. Tom
There has been a positioning in the realm of the Spirit as we prayed. We
Have Moved. While we prayed, we gained dominion and now we function from a point of possibilities. 
We are thanking God for what He has done, but even the Thanksgiving is also a weapon for further victories, as we are thanking God, we get more. 

Pst Emeka Eze
The most powerful team in the world is the Church. When the church takes a stand, there would be a change.
When we pray in tongues, our Angels swing into action. Every time the body of Christ prays, things happen 
As we thank God, we are celebrating increase.

Prophecy by Evang Eddy Owase.
Our spirits have been inspired, inspired to see the future of the Church.
Our spirits are lifted to see results. We see the future. Behold, the Church has risen, the church is standing, the church is operating in the realms of endless possibilities.
The church is lifted into the realms of perpetual victories.
Thank you Jesus! 

The church has been called to walk with God at a higher level, the church walks more than ever before in the revelation of God's Word, for the earth be filled with the knowledge of the glory of God.
The voice of the church is louder than before. 
Hallelujah!"

Pastor Chris Oyakhilome
We are in the Kingdom of God where all things are possible. 
• There's no need of a human heart, whose answer is not already in the earth.
• There's no need that has not been met, nothing that you will desire that has already been produced.
• Ever before your desire, the very fact that your heart is able to conceive it and desire it, is to let you know it exist.

How is this possible?

• Every time you dream of something, you think of somet



## WHAT YOU ARE~616

1Peter 2: 9
But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: (KJV)

The identity of the man born in Christ is different from the man not in Christ. The identity of the believer is the same as that of Christ Jesus. Knowing Christ is knowing the believer. Till you understand Christ, you cannot know who you are. Christ is our prototype, our first fruit as new creations. Everybody born again is born after the nature and status of Christ. You are not an ordinary person.

You are righteous. You are justified. You are pure and holy. You are the salt and light of the world. You are God’s delight and joy. You are the seed of Abraham. You have faith and love. You are more than a conqueror. These and many more are the identity of the man in Christ. Don’t be afraid to see yourself as God sees you. 

The knowledge of who you are will make you strong and productive in the faith. Don’t respond to any identity which is not consistent with your true identity in Christ. Don’t let your circumstances or situations give you a false identity. Call yourself by your true identity. You are not defined by what you do or feel but by what Christ has done. You are the best of God’s creation. Live with this Christ consciousness. 
 
I am all that Christ is because as he is, so am I in this world.
 
1Peter 2: 9– 10, 
1John 4: 17,
2Corithians 5: 17– 21



## DON'T GIVE UP ON PRAYER! - YOU CAN EFFECT THE CHANGES YOU DESIRE!~617

Luke 18:1, 7 MSG “Jesus told them a story showing that it was necessary for them to pray consistently and never quit…. ‘What makes you think God won't step in and work justice for his chosen people, who continue to cry out for help? Won't he stick up for them?'”

Andrew looked at his watch over and over. “Only ten minutes!” he thought, “I thought I had prayed for an hour. But really, do I need to pray long hours before God hears or answers me? I know He knows everything, but I wonder why I have to keep praying for long hours.” Prayer, in reality, isn't about the length or duration, but applying right and effective principles while talking to the Lord and addressing various issues. Its communication and fellowship to be enjoyed than endured, because you have a loving relationship with Jesus Christ, and He's the One who admonishes us to pray without giving up, because He loves to fellowship with you.

Besides, you can change anything through prayer, so why not engage in it more? The divine power necessary to cause that change facing you is in you; it was deposited in you the moment you received the Holy Spirit into your life (Acts 1:8 ). James 5:16 says, “…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]” (AMP). So keep praying! There's nothing too difficult for God to do (Jeremiah 32:27). He's the God of possibilities, and He's given you the power of attorney to use the Name of Jesus and effect the changes you desire.

The God to whom you pray, reigns and rules in the affairs of men: “…in order that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, gives it to whomever He will, and sets over it the lowest of men” (Daniel 4:17). He's given you the authority to decree a thing and have it established (Job 22:28). Therefore, in praying for the things that you want, let these thoughts always be in your mind.



## MUCH RESPECT TO WHOEVER WROTE THIS ARTICLE~622

It is a mistake to think time is going. Time is not going. Time is here until the world ends. It is you that is going. You don’t waste time. Time is infinite. You waste yourself. You are finite. It is you that grows old and die. Time doesn’t. So make better use of yourself before you expire. And one of the worst things to do with time is comparing yourself to others. A cow eats grass and gets fat but if dog eats grass, it will die. Never compare yourself with others. Run your race. What works for one person may be that which will kill you. Focus on the gifts and talents God gave you and don’t be envious of the blessings He gave others_ .

Both Lion and Shark are professional hunters, BUT:
A Lion cannot hunt in the Ocean and a Shark cannot hunt in the jungle
That a Lion cannot hunt in the ocean doesn't make him useless and that a Shark cannot hunt in the jungle doesn't also make him useless both have their own territory where they can do well

If a rose smells better than tomatoes, It doesn't mean the rose can make a better stew. Don't try to compare yourself to others. You also have your own strength, look for it and build on it. All animals that exist, were in Noah's ark. A snail is one of those animals. If God could wait long enough for snails to enter Noah's ark; His door of grace won't close till you reach your expected position in life. Never look down on yourself, keep looking up. Remember that Broken crayons still colour.
_Keep on pushing, you never can tell how close you are to your goal...!



## PRAYER INTELLIGENCE - (THE GREATER PURPOSE FOR PRAYER)~623

“Pray at all times (on every occasion, in every season) in the Spirit, with all [manner of] prayer and entreaty. To that end keep alert and watch with strong purpose and perseverance, interceding in behalf of all the saints (God’s consecrated people).” - EPHESIANS 6:18 AMPC

What most people know about prayer is making requests; that’s the lesser purpose for prayer. Prayer is primarily fellowship with the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, through the power of the Holy Spirit; and it’s something we’re called to do always, not occasionally. Jesus said “…men always ought to pray and not lose heart” (Luke 18:1).

Reading the opening verse, you’d immediately see that prayer isn’t just about asking God for things; prayer is a continual “intelligence” communication.

When you pray, you’re connected to “spiritual intelligence,” such that you’re aware of the happenings around you; you’re not in the dark as to what steps to take, or where to go. “Intelligence information” is constantly being given to you, such that you’re informed, enlightened, and guided by divine wisdom at all times; you’re never confused.

In the place of prayer, you receive impartations, ministrations, visions, and guidance from the Holy Spirit! There’s also the conditioning of your spirit to hear and respond to God correctly; a synchronisation of your passions and emotions with His perfect will. These are part of what makes prayer exciting for us.

God has given you the dominion and the authority to alter the course of events in the earth. It’s your responsibility, not His, to see to it that circumstances in your life, your family and in the lives of those around you are framed to conform to God’s perfect will; you can achieve this through prayer.

## THINK TWICE~624

WHO IS IN YOUR FRONT ROW?
BY Pastor Chris Oyakhilome 

Life is a Theatre... Invite Your Audience Carefully. Not everyone is healthy enough to have a front row seat in your life.
There are some people in your life who need to be loved from a DISTANCE. 

It is amazing what you can accomplish when you let go of - or minimize your time with - those draining, negative, incompatible, 'not-going- anywhere' relationships or friendships.

Observe the relationships around you. Pay close attention...
Which ones lift, and which ones lean? Which ones encourage, and which ones discourage? 
Which ones are on a path of growth uphill, and which ones are going downhill?
When you leave certain people, do you feel better or feel worse? 
Which ones always have drama, or don't really understand, know or appreciate you & the gifts that lie within you?

Remember that the people you have around you will have an impact on your life, your values and your income. So, be careful when choosing the people you hang out with, as well as the information with which you will feed your mind. 
We should not share our dreams with negative people, nor feed our minds with negative thoughts.

The more you seek quality, respect, growth, peace of mind, love and truth around you... the easier it will become for you to decide who gets to sit in the FRONT ROW, and who should be moved to the balcony of your life.

Ask for wisdom and discernment, and choose wisely the people who will sit in the front row of your life. You cannot
change the people around you....but you can change the people you choose to be around!
God bless you richly in Jesus mighty name Amen.

                🙏



## PREVAIL FIRST IN PRAYER~627

When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them (Acts 5:33).

In our opening scripture, Peter had ministered the Gospel to a group of people, and rather than give their hearts to Christ, the people wanted to kill him. That’s why it’s important that before you go out to preach, you intercede for the people you’re going to be ministering to; pray that your message will be accepted and won’t just be a witness against them.

It brings to mind the experience of Stephen in the Book of Acts. He ministered a powerful sermon, full of excellent theology and history. Yet when he was done, the Bible says the people “…were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth” (Acts 7:54). They shut their ears to his message and ran upon him to kill him, and eventually stoned him to death.

Just because the message is great doesn’t mean people will be moved enough to give their hearts to Christ; they didn’t in Stephen’s case. So, before you embark on any evangelical mission or outreach programme, prevail first in prayer, because it’s about the souls of men and the impact the message will have on them, resulting in their salvation.

When you intercede like that, the love of God in you wells up, striving against sin, Satan, and the forces of darkness, and the souls of men are rescued from evil. At that moment, you’re God’s champion; the deliverer.

When you’ve succeeded in bringing them out of that darkness in the spirit, you’ll know it. Then you’re ready to go. Your message may just be for five or twenty minutes, it doesn’t matter; while you’re at it, they’ll be getting convicted and crying out for salvation. This is important. Learn to prevail first in prayer.



## PRAYING IN THE AUTHORITY OF HIS NAME~628

And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him (Colossians 3:17).

There are three important factors about prayer that we’ll study in the next three days. The first is praying in the authority of the Name of Jesus. As Christians, when we pray, we do so in the Name of Jesus; which means we’re standing in His stead.

Jesus gave us the power of attorney to use His Name, in prayer. There’re those who pray “through” the Name of Jesus, and that’s wrong. To pray “through” Jesus is to make Him a medium or an intermediary to the Father. However, to pray “in the Name of Jesus,” which is the right way to pray, means you’re standing in the place of Jesus; you’ve become His voice! So, in praying to the Father, do so in the Name of Jesus.

In John 16:23, Jesus said, “…Verily, verily, I say unto you, whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” Notice that Jesus didn’t say, “Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father through my name, He will give it you.” Before you were born again, the Name of Jesus was given to you so you could come through that Name to the Father and be saved.
Having accepted His invitation and come to the Father at the new birth through Christ, you now have eternal life; the life and nature of God, that enable you dwell in Him and function by the power of His Name. Philippians 2:9 says, “…God also hath highly exalted him (Jesus), and given him a name which is above every name.” His Name is the greatest Name in heaven, and in earth.

God has vested all authority in that Name. Whatever you ask the Father, in the authority of the Name of Jesus, will be granted you. The Lord Jesus has delegated His authority to you; the same authority He had on earth to request anything of the Father and have it granted.

## JESUS IS THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD~629

Light is that which describes; in other words, it shows you what exists. If you entered a pitch-dark room with no flicker of light, even though that room may be beautifully adorned with state-of-the-art décor, furniture and electronic gadgets, it would be impossible for you to see and appreciate the beauty. That's because there's no light describing or showing you the things present in that room. 

In the same way, when a man doesn't have Jesus in his life, it's impossible for him to know what true success, fulfilment, peace and prosperity are. Such a fellow gropes in darkness, and in utter hopelessness, journeying aimlessly, with a ticket to no where. Restless will he be until he finds his rest in Christ Jesus, Who is the True Light that lights every man that comes into this world. 

Recognize Jesus today as the light of your life; recognize Him as the only true light that can guide you in the right path; hearken diligently to His Word, for His Word is light (Psalm 119:105). Man is hopelessly lost until he receives God's Word (2 Corinthians 4:3-4). The Bible says, _“He (God) sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions”_ (Psalm 107:20). Therefore, it makes no difference the type of darkness you're going through today, all you need is the Word of God; the light of life; the Lord Jesus Who is the Word of God made flesh. He'll light your life with success, peace, health, joy and prosperity. 

He said, _“I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness”_ (John 12:46). He'll lead you through the darkness of confusion, frustration, disease, poverty and fear. You can walk out of that darkness a victor today; for the light is coming to you today through this material. Therefore, open your heart and receive direction. 

To know the Word of God is to know Jesus, so accept the Saviour today as the Lord of your life, by saying these words of prayer and mean them with all your heart: 
Oh Lord God, I come to you in the Name of Jesus. Your Word declares “...whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord shall be saved” (Acts 2:21). I ask Jesus to come into my heart to be the Lord of my life. I receive eternal life into my spirit and according to Romans 10:9, “That if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” I declare that I am saved; I am born again, I am a child of God. Hallelujah!_ 

Congratulations! You are now born again with the very life of God! You're now a child of God!

## MAKE POWER AVAILABLE!~630

Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man availeth much (James 5:16).

Sometimes, people wonder why they pray and nothing happens. They desire changes that don’t take place, and the reason is they’re not making power available for the change they desire. God shows us how to make power available for change in our opening verse. 

The Amplified Classic translation explains it more; it says, “Confess to one another therefore your faults (your slips, your false steps, your offenses, your sins) and pray [also] for one another, that you may be healed and restored [to a spiritual tone of mind and heart]. The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working].” The prayer that changes things has the peculiar quality of being earnest, heartfelt and continued. That means it’s not done casually; you don’t pray for only two minutes and go away, no; you press in your prayer, and take a hold of your desire with your spirit.

This kind of prayer is done with much passion and emotion; therefore, you may have to separate yourself from everybody and from everything else. Do this as you prepare for the New Year. Pray in tongues passionately and fervently until you receive the prophetic word in your heart.

When that power is made available through prayer, go ahead and give the Word; it’ll come to pass. Make tremendous power available for the things you want to do and experience—your goals and desires—the changes you want to see in your ministry, family, finances, job, academics, or other areas of your life in the coming year. Hallelujah! .



## DON’T THROW AWAY YOUR DESIRES!
Part 01~637

God uses your strong desires to bring your dreams to pass. Write down your visions as God directed in Habakkuk 2:2. He says, “…write down the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.” Some people give up too soon. Even when it comes to spiritual matters, they lose their confidence in the Word too easily. You can give up on physical things but don’t ever give up on praying, studying and doing the Word of God. You must remind God of His promises because not one word of all His promises has ever failed. He is a faithful Father.
The Word of God says, “For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the things whereto I sent it.” (Isaiah 55:10-11)
The Word of God to you will always work for you. No matter who demands that you leave; no matter what situation stretches you to give up, God wants you to know that His indwelling Presence remains in you wherever you go upon the face of the earth. He is definitely with you, working on your behalf. In fact, you might have to leave invariably, but it would of necessity turn out for the best, if you allow God to have full control. As long as God is in control of your life, you will move upward and forward only.



## Our Exceptionalism is Not a Joke~639

– 

Pastor Joy Amenkhienan Thursday night of the ICLC 
was rhapsodizing with the esteemed Pastor Joy reemphasising the importance of our ministry materials in a message titled “Raising Disciples Using Ministry Materials”. She started by reminding the thousands of delegates on the importance of our ministry materials. “People live by the information around them. When they join us, their mindsets are changed using our ministry materials. Train up a child in the way he should go, when he grows up, he’ll not depart from it. “ She also emphasized the importance of ministry materials and highlighted platforms where these materials can be introduced to the brethren. They include the ministry’s online platforms, the foundation school, water baptism classes and Pastor Chris Digital Library (PCDL), amongst others.  “Expose your members to all our materials and let them share with others. Organize book reviews. Lives are changed with these materials”. Throwing more light on how the Ministry Materials change lives, esteemed Pastor Joy shared unforgettable testimonies on the impact of Ministry Materials in the lives of people. She concluded by charging the cell leaders to “organize programmes with these ministry materials. God has multiplied Himself via these materials. You’re what you eat. All Pastor Chris’ messages have ability to change lives. Reculture people into full maturity. Change your members minds through exposing them to the right information”.  For more updates on ICLC 2019, follow this Superuser and visit . The ICLC TV channel on Ceflix and cLoveWorld app which can be downloaded from PlayStore and Applestore is also available for your viewing pleasure.



## The Quality of Our Work Must Last for Eternity - Pastor Lanre Alabi~640

At the ongoing ICLC 2019 where delegates are being pumped with the word for greater exploits, esteemed Pastor Lanre Alabi, the Director of Church Growth International brought every leader's attention to an important and vital aspect of the work in his message titled 'Building for Eternity.' 

Pastor Lanre showed from scriptures that all we do for the Lord will be tested by fire, and as such, our work must last. The quality of our work must last for eternity. 

Citing 1 Corinthians 3:6-15 (KJV), the Director of Church Growth International shared on the importance of making lasting impact from the verses below.

I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.  Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.  For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.  According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.  For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.  Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;  Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.  If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.  If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 

Will your work survive?

Teaching further, Pastor Lanre shared on 5 things to consider in building a lasting work for the kingdom.

1) Build with the Word. Luke 6:47. Let the foundation be upon the rock. Nothing builds like the word. You can't build on philosophy or ideas.  Acts 20:32. Truth is consistent. 

2) Build with love for Jesus. It purifies your motives. The effort you're putting in must be based on the love for the Master.  2 Corinthians 5:14-16. Spread the agenda of the Master. You're not motivated by vain glory. What's your motive? Let the motivation not be offensive to God. Hebrews 6:10. God doesn't forget your labour of love. 

3) Build with the Spirit. John 6:23. You can't offer spiritual things to God without it. 

4) Build with the consciousness of value. We're talking about lives that you're building. How much can you sacrifice to build them? Have and express good value for those God has trusted you with. Nothing will be too much. Revelation 1:5. Acts 20:28. You're an overseer of those purchased with the blood of Jesus Christ. People matter to Jesus. The ministry is about people. Will the time people spend with you add to their eternity? Don't let it be counted as a loss. What becomes of those that encounter you? Add value and have value for them. 

5) Build them to be Soul Winners.  Daniel 12:3. Guarantee their eternity this way. 

6) Build with our materials, structure and followership. This will produce results that last. Do everything decently and in order. Raise them to be like our man of God. 

He ended his message with comforting scriptures letting the leaders know that
the Lord is with us all the way. He has started this good work in us and will perfect it, and He is able to keep us from falling. Glory to God!

## ICLC 1st Plenary session with Pastor Chidi Ezimako~642

_Friday Morning._

Foundation school has a tool for evangelism.
_Foundation is the principle that govern what we believe.It's the bedrock,the starting point of anything.In foundation school,they learn,they are equipped and taught the basic principles of the word of God and our ministry.This is foundation school of Loveworld,not the one you got in another ministry.I have discovered when people argue about certain questions,it shows they haven't gone through foundation school.There are things you might not understand but when you go through foundation school,you understand it. It's a quick start for you to flow and understand the word of God.1Corinthians 4:17.The way God is leading pastor is different from other ministries.The way Paul was leading his people wasn't the way Peter was leading his people.You would get to understand why we do the things we do.Foundation school,It's got several classes.And the courses are loaded.Most times,we take the foundation school in church,but we can take it to where we want like the inner city.In the weeks you are engaged in foundation school,you are transformed and integrated into the cell and church and such a person becomes a soul winner,then he understands a lot of things,he can join the department and the graduation is a big thing and a very important landmark.It should be used as a tool to bring others in.The church hall should be decorated and every graduants should look for a minimum of three unsaved people to church.The hall should be prepared for the number of people.Everything we are doing that day should be geared towards evangelism and soul winning.After graduation,we follow up two categories of people,those who gave their lives to Christ and those who didn't.Every pastor or leader should be soul winning conscious.Ministry transforms and we have to become more strategic in soul winning.The atmosphere had to look different and it brightens people up.Foundation school graduants and their invitees should be invited into the cell and church again and invite them for the next set of foundation school and should be monitored by the the first timers ministry.We are involved in multi-level evangelism.Think about people who are presently in foundation school to talk to them,tell them early enough to bring people fir their graduation.You tell them ,now you are being blessed,bring others to also enjoy what you 've enjoyed.The souls you 've won are the ones we see around us in church not the ones outside.



## INTERNATIONAL CELL LEADERS CONFERENCE 2019
Day 2 - Morning
Foundation School as a vehicle for Evangelism~643

Foundation School is an avenue created by our President to teach the underlying principles of God’s word as taught by our ministry. 
When people argue about somethings, the question is have you gone through Foundation School? 
FS gives you the basic foundation of why the ministry is the way it is. It’s a very important course. Don’t say I’m already a leader so it’s no longer necessary, No! Still go through the course, it’s just 7 weeks and it’s a MUST for every member of Christ Embassy.

At graduation, the student is 
1. Full of the Holy Spirit 
2. A Cell member
3. A giver
4. A member of a service department 
5. On kingschat & has basic ministry app
6. Understands basis things about the ministry 

THE FOUNDATION SCHOOL GRADUATION
This ceremony can be a vital outreach tool. Every graduate should be given at least 3 cards to invite families and friends. Everything we’re doing that day should be geared towards soul winning.
It’s important you have a database of the invitees with vital details so that Followup can be easy. After the meeting, we should Followup on 2 groups of people:
1. Those that got saved 
2. Those that attended the meeting but didn’t get saved 
A special team within the FTM should focus on this and the graduates should be a part of this team

The graduates should ensure that those that got saved are incorporated into the cell ministry and ensure they’re established.

This should be monitored by the FTM and within the next 2 months, these people must be established in church and the report submitted.

In the church we’re involved in multilevel evangelism. 

This invitation should be taught in the classes from class 3 so they’re prayerfully bring these 3 people 

CELL MINISTRY
Every celebration in the cell system should be geared towards evangelism 

Be a leader that’s soul winning conscious.



## SUPER SESSION~644

REV. TOM AMENKHIENAN

TOPIC: THE TERMINAL GENERATION

We live in a day where so much is expected of us. We have so much to do. 

Heb 11 talks about the heroes of faith. (Heb 11:39-40). The heroes could not be perfected without us. 


We have the challenge of opportunity and the enablement and the burden to deliver. Some have little and they did so much, but we have so much and we must not do little. 

Rom 13:11-13(TLB)
There is a job that need to be done. So no time to get angry at someone, be jealousy, malice etc. Focus on the job; there are weightier matters of the law. Don't dwell on things that don't matter.

James 5:8, 1 Pet. 4:7. 
The time is near, give yourself to the work at hand. 

1 John 2:18, Rev 22:10, 1 Cor. 7:29-32(AMP, TLB)

The bottom line is:  where ever you find yourself, in any circumstances or situation ensure you do the work of the Lord. Psalms 67:2. Preach the gospel.

Eph. 3:7-10

I am equipped for the challenges and situations of our day. Since the patriarch of old won, we too are winning and achieving result. We doing what we are doing by divine ability. We are out doing what they have achieved. We must deliver the winning team. 

I am relevant and I am able. We should be focus on finishing the race. Discipline yourself. Set self control measures in place for you to finish the race just like Paul. 

1 Cor. 16:13-14(TLB). 

We are better equipped than the heroes of faith. And the truth is that they marvel at us. Make use of what you have to spread the gospel. 

Don't wished you live in those days, they are washing us and admiring us. The way we have advance technology on earth that is how we have advancement in spiritual technology. We've got something better.

We have platforms and tools that they didn't have. What are you doing on social media? Don't waste resources. Let us maximize all that has been given to us. They days we are living in are better and greater. We will fulfill the Lords agenda. 1 Peter 2:9. We are showing forth the glory of God. We are the one to display the virtues of God. 


We should be the result of the message first before we recommend them to others. Get the messages for yourself first and use them to influence and affect your life. 

Let us run the race that is set before us.



## ICLC 2019 Thursday June 20th~646

Thursday Morning Session
 
Rev Chris Oyakhilome

Jesus is a soul winner. This should be my mentality too. 

No more waiting for the souls to come, or for us to come in contact with them. We’re going to seek them. 

I’m using various methods to achieve this. (Acts 20:20)...Publicly and person to person. 

“Seek first the Kingdom of God..”
Don’t be more passionate about your business than soul winning. It’s time to reorder your priorities. God first!

No 1 priority: God!
No number 2, or 3 or 4...
Every other thing follows priority no 1. If you get that right, then you’re made for/in life. 

Jesus said this. And it’s impossible for him to be wrong. 


1. Priority - 

       God so care about you... Imagine Him taking record of each strand of hair on you. 

What is the Kingdom of God ? 

The Kingdom of God is (in) me. 

Quit trying to figure out the bigness of God by SIZE. Just see him as Jesus is. Rather think about him being, all knowing, all seeing , all powerful etc. 

The color of any item depends on the light that shines on it. You ask, how then do we know the true color of things. Answer = this happens when the true light shines on it. And the true light is the Word of God. 
(John 1:9). 


There’re mysteries in this last days that God’s children are going to know, by which they’ll rule the world. - prophecy 

You need to see yourself as big as God wants you to. 

(Eph 2:24)..Put on God’s nature. You’re created to be Godlike. 

Take the process of renewing your mind, very seriously. The mind of Christ. 

I’m born to be an effulgence of divine beauty.



## In one of my prayer & prophecy lines, I declared that wealth & power has changed hands.
Now, understand that we are in the times of the activation and fulfilment of prophecy!
No more struggles, the graces have be released.
Take as much grace as you require.

Further more, I did proclaimed that God's kids are assuming positions of authority, leadership & influence in our nations.
And while in office i  decreed they're leading with competence & excellence mixed with the fear of the Lord in their hearts that the plans & purposes of God for our nations be fulfilled in Jesus' Name. Amen.

Behold we have taken over in every sphere & industry ( by leading as we promote Heavens Agenda).~655





## Soultune - Sweet My Body~657





## Today's message by Pastor Deola Philip~660

THE POWER OF THOUGHTS.

Definition: Thoughts are pictures of the mind that have constructive or destructive possibilities.

Thoughts give meaning to circumstances.

2Kings 5:9-12 (study the story of Naaman the Syrian general who had leprosy). Naaman nearly missed his miracle because of what he thought the man of God should do.
In this same way some people miss their miracle because they expect every supernatural occurrence to look spectacular.

Mark 5:25-29 talks about the woman with the issue of blood, the thought in her heart that if only the could touch the hem of Jesus' garment she will be made whole, she received her miracle instantly because of the the way she positioned her mind.

Your mind is a gateway through which spiritual possibilities manifest in your life. And you have to always know that your life goes in the direction of your mind.
If anything becomes possible in your mind then it becomes possible in your life.

Eph 3:20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us..

Human thought is a powerful force than can both attract or repel spiritual possibles.

In Luke 24:37 the disciples of Jesus were so terrified when they saw Jesus because they THOUGHT they had seen a ghost.

Your thoughts create pictures in your mind that can affect your actions.

Prov. 15:15 (All the days of the afflicted [are] evil: but he that is of a merry heart [hath] a continual feast.)

You have to guide your heart, program your mind to think only the word, let the word become your consciousness.

The plot by Judas to betray Jesus actually started with a thought (John 13:2) and in John 13:27 Satan finally possessed Judas to enforce his plans, but what you have to note here is that Judas opened the entrance door for the devil by yielding his mind.

HOW THOUGHTS COME
Thoughts can rise from your heart (Matt. 15:18-19)

Thoughts can come from God (Neh. 7:5)

THE THOUGHTS GOD HAS FOR YOU

Jer 29:11
For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.

WHAT TO THINK ON

Phil 4:6-8
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.



## Shepherd of My Soul

Shepherd of my soul I give You full control
Wherever You may lead I will follow
I have made the choice to listen for Your voice
Wherever You may lead I will go

Shepherd of my soul I give You full control
Wherever You may lead I will follow
I have made the choice to listen for Your voice
Wherever You may lead I will go

Be it in a quiet pasture or by a gentle stream
The shepherd of my soul is by my side
Should I face a mighty mountain or a valley dark and deep
The shepherd of my soul will be my guide~665





## WISDOM NUGGET
*******************~666

You can lie down for people to walk on you and they will still complain that you're not flat enough. Men pleasers usually get nowhere, because it's impossible to please everybody. Some will like you, hate you, despise you and care for you. Just play your cards well and know how to relate with each one of them. The mistake you must not do is to wish that all men like you. My friend, even Jesus was hated..

## TRIUMPH IN HIS AUTHORITY~680

“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.” (Luke 10:19) 

When were born again, you were born into a life of greatness and royalty – you were born to reign. Revelation 5:10 says, Christ Jesus has, “…made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.” This clearly shows us that we were raised to reign in Christ Jesus; we’re kings and priests; we’re men and women of honour and authority. 

In Mark 6:7, the Bible says “And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits.” The Greek word for “power” here is “exousia” and it means “authority”. Jesus has given us authority over unclean spirits; we live in His victory and triumph over them: “And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it” (Colossians 2:15). Hallelujah! 

So every Christian has authority over the devil, and his cohorts; it a birth right! Thus, you should never live in fear of the devil because he’s defeated. Live free of sickness, poverty, failure, unproductivity, unfruitfulness, or any other thing connected with the devil and darkness. Triumph in Christ’s authority.



## TRUST…BELIEVE…AND ACT ON THE WORD!~681

When God’s Word comes to you, the first and important thing to do is to accept it. This may sound too simple for some people, but the things about God are so simple; He’s never complicated. If He were to come to us in His complexity, no one will even be saved. He’d remain a mystery. So, accept Him in His simplicity, and accept all that He’s done for you.
That’s what it takes. He’s called you to fellowship; accept it. He’s given you eternal life; accept it. He’s made you righteous, strong, vibrant, healthy, prosperous and influential; accept it! If you don’t accept what He’s done for you, given you, and made you—and live accordingly—you’ll be a victim in life. There’re people who say, “If God is real, let Him do something about my situation.”
He already did; so stop waiting. Find out what the Word says about that situation; accept it, and live accordingly. Romans 1:16 says, “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.” The Gospel of Christ works only for the one who believes. If you don’t believe it, it won’t work, even though it’s the power of God. Believe and accept that God has blessed you. He’s not planning to do it, He’s done it already: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ” (Ephesians 1:3).
Even now, if there’s a situation in your life that you want changed, you can receive a miracle by saying “Yes” to the Word! Quit thinking, “Is there hope for me?” Yes. Christ is your hope. His Word is the answer. There have been many like you who were in similar situations and had a transformation. If the Word could produce results for them, it’ll do the same for you. Trust the Word. Believe the Word. Act on the Word.

## LEARN TO LAUGH~692

“A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones” (Proverbs 17:22)

If you’d observe people over a time, you’d make the remarkable discovery that people who don’t laugh, easily get sick, whereas, laughing people don’t get sick. This means laughter is more spiritual than many realize. 

There’s more to it than a mere response to a joke or hilarious event. In the Kingdom of God, laughter is medicine: “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones” (Proverbs 17:22).

Laughter is generally found in an atmosphere that’s full of joy. The anointing of the Holy Spirit is most effective in such an environment. When the anointing is present in an environment, everything that’s not of God, including sicknesses, diseases and infirmities are dispelled.

Let the joy of the Lord spring up from within your heart in spite of prevailing situations. Learn to laugh your way to health and victory! Let nothing take the laughter of the Spirit from your mouth.



## Don’t Ignore The Spirit!

In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and bare them, and carried them all the days of old. But they rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them~695

(Isaiah 63: 9-10).

The indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives is one of the greatest blessings we have as Christians. He is our advantage and the secret to a glorious and successful life. Thus you must recognize and take advantage of His ministry in your life. Some Christians ignore the ministry of the Holy Spirit, hence their lives are out of joint; full of ups and downs.

It’s the ministry of the Holy Spirit to guide and lead in all affairs of life; it’s His ministry to grant you the wisdom and counsel you need to win every day in life. Consciously acknowledge His presence with you and in you, and learn to yield to Him always. Never ignore His counsel. The Bible says in Isaiah 30:21, “And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.”

Whose voice do you think that is? It’s the voice of the Holy Spirit. He speaks to us daily on life’s issues through God’s Word, but many ignore His counsel because His voice is never strong and harsh against us. It matters that in whatever you do, you honour the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life. Don’t wound his tender compassion by consistently rejecting His counsel.

Perhaps you talked to someone rudely and Holy Spirit corrected you, be quick to heed His correction and make the necessary amends. Otherwise, His voice that used to be clear to you may soon become faint and distant if you continually ignore Him. Live your life in a way that brings honour to the Holy Spirit; appreciate His presence in your life and you’d be glad you did.



## Pastor T.T Edun~758

Money is not Gold, Naira, Pounds, Dollar, Euro but money is anything that has a purchasing power. If you are thinking of been rich with a currency then you have a problem.

There are things money can't buy but favour Can.

Authority is Money. Favour is Money. Grace is Money. Faith is Money. It is what has purchasing power.

In the times you are in a Peculiar situations, life is making a request of you, what will be your response?

In life if you want to be successful through Gods way you must go through fights. Be bold and Courageous. Fight a Good fight of Faith! When God said to Joshua to be bold and Courageous, there was a tendency that Joshua would fear but God kept on Saying my son be bold and Courageous. "No fear No fear"

When you declare about a car, its not the money you need for the car you are declaring for but the car because you might get it for free. Don't look towards the money

Authority can be legal in you but not vitalized in you. You get Authority when God gives it to you, what do you do with what God has given to you?

Never be comfortable with what your money can buy. Go for things your mouth or your Faith can buy.

Put Authority in your words ~ Pastor T.T.



## #MOVINGFORWARD~806

What is your excuse? Strongholds? Strongholds are those beliefs, doctrines or dogma holding you strongly. It's time to let go of any mindset that is contrary to God's will for you. Get rid of any thought that is not in line with God's word. You are called to excel and move forward in life. 

•Get To Work!!

...As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.

He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”
The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.

Like the elephants, how many today go through life hanging onto a belief that they cannot do something, simply because they grew up with the mentality that they cannot.

Remember Lot's Wife ~ Pastor Chris Tells Delegates

After the glorious opening ceremony at this year's IPPC, Pastor Chris spent over three hours ministering deep secrets and insights into the wonderful word of God.

One area Pastor Chris spent time educating the leaders in the ministry was in the area of total devotion and worship of the Lord.

He reminded the delegates that serving God has responsibilities. He admonished them to serve the Lord with whole hearted devotion and to always please Him. "Let the Lord be the center of everything you do. Seek to please Him, not yourself. Make that personal decision how you want to serve God".

Referencing the words of Jesus Christ, he told the delegates to remember Lot's wife. "Don't look back on this journey. Don't compare yourself to your non-ministry friends. The ministry didn't cost you nothing. It gave you everything. Don't think of the earthly things you would have acquired. Remember Lots wife. She could not be saved even when God sent angels to save them".

## Leadership, Empowerment, And Illumination At The International Teen Pastors And Leaders Conference (ITPLC)~820

In inculcating a love for Jesus Christ among the young members of LoveWorld nation the pastors raise the leaders of tomorrow. With caring nurturing devotion, the experienced pastors’ coach, them to be firm in their Christian beliefs. Not only does this prepare them for leadership roles in the Ministry but in life as well.

It is amazing to see so many young adults engaging in glorious acts of worship and listening to the informative sessions. The atmosphere in the ITLPC is electric as the emergent stars learned from those who are already illuminating the way.

Leading lights lead the way

In this, the ‘Year Of Lights’ the attentive teens were told that it is said in Matthew 5:16 ”Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” Highly Esteemed Director of LWCGI, Pastor Lanre Alabi explained that they should ” Become so excellent and indispensable that the world will be looking for you…”

The teen’s conference is part of the International Pastors’ and Partners Conference (IPPC) and was fully packed as participants used the opportunity to expand their knowledge and take time to reflect. The event had several life-transforming activities especially for young people such as inspiring acts of worship, workshops, talk shows, and music ministry.

An exhibition of glorious achievements

There is an exhibition that runs alongside the conference. It was declared open by the Secretary-General of the LoveWorld nation, Pastor Kayode Adesina declared that the theme of the program is leadership, empowerment, and illumination.

Delegates participate in effusive moments of worship at ITPLC and were thrilled when LMAM Artist, Eli J, came to minister at the ITPLC 2019 day two-morning session. The atmosphere was indeed charged because there was also an extraordinary super session with our highly esteemed CEO on” our expansionism agenda; your role as a teenager”. All sessions focus on the needs of teenagers today and are relevant.

There are many parts to becoming a church leader. You must be conversant in the word of God. As Christ Embassy has developed many publications the session on “on the role of ministry materials in evangelism” was well received. Knowing the words of the Man of God, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome is a very positive step in your ability to deliver the message of the Gospel.

Excellent and effective teaching is passed on

This was made clear during a riveting panel discussion on “holding effective cell meetings and making them evangelical.” Pastor Chris has often talked about keeping your agenda focused. These teen pastors and leaders were held in rapt attentiveness during a remarkable super session with the Esteemed Pastor Freedom Eriya-Wealth on” how to have increasing and sustained impact in ministry”. This was combined with an inspiring panel discussion on “strategic outreach meetings.”

The highpoints of the ITPLC 2019 are the personal stories that enthuse young people. One such session was with the Highly Esteemed Pastor Ose Oyakhilome on, ”my personal development” and another was when the Esteemed Zonal Teens Ministry Coordinator, Sister Ama Pululu-Sumu spoke on her soul-winning principle.

When Pastor Lanre Alabi, the Director of Church Growth International ministered to the young people he emphasized the joy in being a part of such a wonderful ministry. That is clearly the emotion that these teens feel as they are part of Christ Embassy. ITLPC is a celebration of the youth of today and empowering them to be the leaders of tomorrow.



## FINAL SUPER session ITPLC Day 3.    13.11.19~821

With Pst. Chris 

Joseph's refusal of potiphers wife and Daniels refusal to defile himself with the kings meal was a proof of CHARACTER. Having searched from teenage years, I discovered so much and how beautiful it is to be enlightened by the word. 

The beauty in the name of Jesus must be spread abroad.

OnlyJesus can make clean. Only him can take away all troubles of life as well as keep you even in the midst of the troubles.

When Jesus guides you in his perfect will, he does this with his voice of wisdom. 

The responsibility of learning and acting is now

*Don't work in rest right now, the rest is coming.

Give him your best and prime time of your life.
Youthful stage is the flower of your life.
The years of strength and vigour.
The art of prayer(gives you disiciplne and character).

God's  core intent is to make you a man of Prayer thus he can be confident in you regards the task given.

The power of the living word(the word that forms the person). Words can affect your behaviour; it's a character).

Purity comes from taking heed to the word of life.

Fasting and Prayer. Acts 10vs44.
Area bombardment 
Pray with the  Burden in your heart as long as its there.  

Young people wants reality.
Never go out ministering without being filled with the spirit.

* Believe adamantly in the power of the holyspirit.

Going into a relationship before time sets your directions on a terrible situation.
Avoid giving in to wrong time actions.

*Meditation strategies  Encourage your hunger and love for God's word.

  Study, meditate, be conscious of it and speak it.

*Make friends with those who love the word.



## IPPC 2019 DAY 5~823

REV CHRIS

Don't learn a bad thing in a good place.  It can happen and its not good.
There is order in the house of God.
Evil prevails when good men are quiet.
Anger doesn't allow the Spirit to flow.
Some people are learning and might not use the word of God rightly.
God's word has to be pulled. Its how much you can  pull that will come to you.
The revelation of the future helps to explain the mystery of the past.
There are times you need to go into the revelation of the future to understand those things in the past that werent brought to light.
When you study Isaiah,  Jeremiah,  Revelations they give you an insight.
Lucifer was appointed by God to be in charge of the then world.
There was sucha being called man, whether he didnt look like us or not.
The account in Genesis is an account of a recreation.  
He recreated what was there because of satan' disobedience. 
He rebelled against God with many angels.
The demons in the qorld outnumber human beings.
Therr are others of the fallen angels which function in the spiritual realm
The universe is big. Imagine the sun is 1000 times the size of the earth. Some of the starts are many and larger than the earth and some are planets.
Satan hates you so much because they fell and fear the obvious.
God's intention was not to replace them with other angels.
There are ages to come. There are things angels were supposed to look upto but they fell. 
God is raising a new breed that will govern His amazing universe in tha ages to come
We are being raised for something and we are getting ready.
The earth is not the place of the call.
We are being called to a higher realm  a greater walk with God.
Imagine over 2000yrs now, its just the church age, ita just a little period.
This period is on for the restitution of all things. The context there is Israel.
Its not about going to heaven, there is a greater life.
Jesus sets up a spiritual  kingdom on earth of men that have been given a new life, regenerated with the life of God.

Romans 5:17 KJV
For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)

1 Peter 2:9 KJV
But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:

1 Peter 2:9 (AMP)
9.  But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God's] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. [Exod. 19:5, 6.]  

I'm special.
Its not when you get to heaven, the people would have been defeated.

Luke 12:32 KJV
Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

He has done it.

Luke 19:11-28 KJV
And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. [12] He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. [13] And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. [14] But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. [15] And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. [16] Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. [17] And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. [18] And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.



## IPPC 2019 DAY 6~824

Rev Chris -The power of the divine life

If you compare yourself to other people you will think you are a failure or you will think proudly that they are failures.
Compare yourself to the purpose, God's plan, God's  expectation,  what does He want?

Ask yourself what God wants as you live for Him, in our relationships with other people.
Its not good if you lived all your life doing what you wanted to do. Does God want it? It doesnt matter who thinks you are successful. 

Human beings look at you and compare you with other people. The question is not what they think. Its about what God wants.
You can achieve everything your mind ever wanted. You can actually be fulfilled doing the wrong thing. Fulfillment is just about a desire until you discover that its not about your desires.

Always want to know whats on His mind. Its useless to invest your life in what He doesn’t want . Remember  Cain. Remember David when He bought a new cart for God but He killed a man for touching the ark. Moses didn't know it wasn't about water and drink. He didn't know what God wanted. He never asked God what He wanted. 

I don’t want to do the best things and find out it wasnt what God wanted. Don't invest your life in what you want.

Remember king Saul who selected the best things not for himself but for sacridice to God but God was not interested in those best things.

1 Samuel 15:22 KJV
And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord ? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

Dont let your desires destroy you. They might not destroy you in this earth, but you are destroyed when at the end of everything you dont hear those words, 'well done thou good and faithful servant' and that you served you own purpose.

Matthew 6:33 KJV
But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

Why do you want to serve God with that He didnt give you?
Why do you want to give Him that He didnt give you?

Do you have the conviction of salvation in your heart? What are you in pursuit of? What are you struggling to be? What are you desiring to be? Is it what He wants or what you want?

You were created by the word of God and only the word of God can build your life. There is a time others can help you with their faith and there comes a time others can't. 

There are 2 things He can do for you as you mature. Paul asked them to pray for him:
1. That utterance be given him
2. That he could be made available to them and come to them

From these none had to do with him. These are the things others can help you with their faith.
If you have a health problem their faith can’t you get well.
Understand certain things about your life, your personal walk of faith, how God wants you to conduct your life.

The most painful thing is when the pastor of the church gets sick and dies in that sickness.
When that happens to a church, it’s terrible.

Knowledge of the word is the first thing. As a mature Christian,  when you have a challenge in your body, what do you do?
Sometimes you get healed and it returns because the conditions that created the condition wouldnt have been changed. 
Most sicknesses are caused by evil spirits,  demons.

Luke 7:19-21 KJV
And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? [20] When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? [21] And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.

Evil spirits are personalities. How do you cure someone of a person?

Luke 8:1-3 KJV

And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him, [2] And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary calle



## IPPC 2019 – Day 4~828

Gathering of world changers

What a time of bliss and blessings in God’s presence on day 4 of the IPPC 2019 with the Man of God, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome. 
He shared an exceptional message on the power of the divine life. It is the God-life which is death-free. The life that produces life. For the law of the Spirit of life has made us free of death and the law of sin and the law of life increases life (Romans 8:1-2). 

The Man of God shared deep insights into the fact that every word from God is spirit, which means that every word from God is God. You address spirits with spirit and thus speak to them and you must be aware that it’s with your mind that you control the power of God. 
After this profound teaching, hundreds and hundreds went forward to testify how this disease-killing life was just manifested in their bodies as pain and sufferings had left them…

## PUT THE BEST IN WHAT YOU DO AND CHANGE YOUR WORLD!~1008

~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME 

"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect." (Ephesians 5:16 KJV)  There are certain things you must do. There are things that are not in abundant supply; they are limited and one of them is Time. Save time and keep track of it. The Bible says for us to redeem the time for the days are evil. You don't have extra time. Life is not a game, therefore make everyday count.  

Improve yourself everyday. Introduce something into your life that counts. Choose to be a success! Become inspiring. Distinguish yourself with character; with excellence! If you are a musician be a musician with a difference. Become inspiring.  Whatever you do, do it with excellence. Put your best into what you do and change your world. Remember there is no extra time. Whatever you do now, do it the best way the first time. 

Success is waiting for the man who says YES to SUCCESS! Success is waiting for the man who plans for it; who reaches out for it; who says I will wake up and he wakes up, who says I will read this book and He does. Who says I will go to school and he goes. Success is waiting for the man who makes a decision. Time is important. Change the position. Say to yourself I will be watched. 

There are those who only think of designer perfume, designer clothes, designer shoes; where are your own designs? Challenge yourself for the future, there's room for you. There's a place for you at the top. Train your mind and use it. Give yourself to a teacher. Give yourself to a tutor. Train yourself. Train your mind. If you train your mind it will be ready to deliver to you the right thoughts and ideas that will earn you commercial value. 

There is no poverty for the man who has made an investment in his mind and is willing to act. There's no hunger for the man who has trained his mind to think through every problem; to solve every problem. Train yourself.  Think through a problem.  Render solution and let men come to you for advice.  

Decide to be smart. Decide to be a problem solver. If you make that decision, that is what you will be. Problem solvers are in short supply in the world. There's a place for a man who decides to be excellent.  Distinguish yourself!  It is time to put your best into what you do. GET BETTER and BIGGER! Be excellent!



## FOUR RIVERS (WAYS) OF RECEIVING BY BISHOP CLERENCE MCCLENDON @ YOUR LOVEWORD PRAISE-A-THON LAGOS, NIGERIA.~1011

1. The River of Compensation.
Compensation is what I worked for and I am compensated for. It is my wage. You must be doing something. 
We spend a lot of time talking about giving and receiving. We spend a lot of time talking about the supernatural but it need to be said that you need to have a job. The Bible says if a man doesn't work, he shouldn't eat. 
There are a lot of people in the kingdom of God who are depending on God to do everything. God only does what His word says He does. He does not do more than that. The Bible is clear, it is a diligent soul that would be made rich. Say to your neighbour, there is a job for you somewhere. You must be doing something. 

Prov14:23 In all labour there is profit.
Your labour is to profit you. 

Prov 12:14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.

The world lives hand to mouth but the child of God lives mouth to hand.

Eccl 5:19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

The power to eat of your labour is a gift from God.

Eccl 6:1-2 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is common among men: 2 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

This is about what they do with their compensation. 

In the kingdom of God, your job is not for your living. You need to have a job but your job is not for your living. In the kingdom of God, your job is for your giving. 

Ephe 4:28 Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.

Your job was never intended to provide for you, it is to give you something to sow so God can bless it. In the kingdom of God, there is nothing like a fixed salary. When you give, it will come back to you good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over. 

2. Harvest.
Your job is not your harvest. Your job is one river, your harvest is another river. Harvest comes from sowing and not from working. 

Gen 8:22 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. 

Luke 6:38 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.

The seed when it is sown, God multiplies it. When you sow an orange seed, you receive an orange tree. 
Harvest doesn't come from work, it comes from seed. 

3. Inheritance. 
It is what Jesus has already worked for and I received by grace with no work at all. You get your inheritance by attending the reading of the will. If you missed the reading of the will, you will not know what belongs to you. That is what happens when we go to church. We go to hear the reading of the will. 
God said, see, I have given you the kingdom. 

1 Pet 1:3-4 ...To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away...

I was begotten into an inheritance. I don't even have to work for it. I was born into it. It doesn't matter how long it has been there and you didn't know, it is still there for you. It has got your name on it. 
And the more you decree it, the more it will work for you. Sometimes you missed out of it but it is still coming back to you. You haven't lost anytime, you haven't lost anything, it is reserved for you. 

4. Favour.
It is from a Hebrew word which means being the one who doesn't look like the one who should get it.
You are seemingly outclassed but God is saying, I am going to give it to you. 

Prov 22:1 A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.

God is saying, I will do t

## CONFESSION: 2020 IS MY YEAR OF PERFECTION.~1035

I am walking in God’s plan and in the centre of His will.

I enter 2020 with boldness and confidence, for the Word of the Lord has gone ahead of me; I look ahead with joy, knowing that the Lord has prepared my path. I walk on preordained pathways, doing those good works which God has predestined for me, and I’m living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for me.

I have clarity of vision and strong focus throughout 2020; no darkness, no distractions, no confusion, no failure in Jesus’ name. The light of God shines on my path; my journey is in one direction only – upward and forward. No down days, no discouragement, no weakness; I walk the path of victory, in perpetual triumph over every adversity, and every situation that confronts me. In this year 2020, the Lord will work through me, and my life will be a wonder; my testimonies will be outstanding, and even I will be amazed at the outworking of God’s grace in me, for the things that are impossible with men are possible with me because God is at work in me.

My testimonies will inspire praise, my results will evoke worship; I will do the impossible, I will achieve the unimaginable by the wisdom and power of God! I am functioning daily in divine wisdom, guided by the Spirit of God at all times and in all situations. I follow God’s plan all the way; He leads me in the way that I should go, and I take my steps with faith and boldness, confident that everything has been prepared ahead of time. I don’t need to worry or try to make things work…I follow God’s plan, and everything is in place. Every step of the way, the picture unfolds, and all I see is glory, all I see is grace, all I see is supply… all things are ready!

No abortions, no miscarriages, nothing fails in my hands – I bring forth fruits unto perfection. I am rightly positioned by God’s Spirit for outstanding results; I am doing big things! It’s a year of perfection; I will do mighty things as one man! I have raised my vision, my dreams are big enough for God to get involved with, and my success will surprise many. I walk through the walls, I beat down the mountains, I break through troops; no obstacle is formidable enough to stop me! I’m set on course; walking the path of greatness, with faith in my heart, with springs in my steps, and with the Word of God in my mouth! Nothing shall be impossible unto me!

This is my time, this is my season, this is my moment! 2020 is my year – PERFECTION, ALIGNMENT, COMPLETENESS, EXCELLENCE, FRUITFULNESS ALL THE WAY!!! That’s my story! Glory to God!



## YOU HAVE ALL IT TAKES TO FINISH 2020 PERFECTLY!~1036

But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD (Genesis 6:8).

This is a new year, and it presents enormous opportunities for increased greatness and progress. Make up your mind that your past won't be your master; it won't be your limitation no matter how successful or how disappointing it might have been. 

One of the things you must do is to start early; be determined to be ahead in your goals. Don't delay or procrastinate on any project or assignment. Don't find yourself doing in March, what you should have done in January. Be an early riser; I'm not just talking about waking up by 4 am, but having an early start in the things you want to achieve. 

The Word of His grace is your advantage; that's what you need to be ahead, and successful in all that you do. That Word came to us last night with so much power at the New Year's Eve Service; run with it! If for any reason you missed or couldn't participate in the service, watch out for the rebroadcast in any of our LoveWorld Networks today and the rest of the week.

Make up your mind you won't struggle in accomplishing your goals. Everywhere you go, be conscious of God's grace, His mighty hand of blessings upon your life. He has opened new doors for you, with opportunities that can't be humanly explained. Therefore, go forth and win, for He's all you need, and He's in you strong; alive and at work. Glory to His Name forever! Amen. 

2020 IS PERFECT!

## WHAT IS FOUNDATION SCHOOL?~1488

In foundation school, members are taught the basic doctrines of Christ. They are equipped for the work of the ministry. The bible also admonishes that we be not children tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine…hence the need to equip the saints.

Knowledge is vital, and it marks the difference between success and failure. To have a successful Christian life, you require the basic knowledge to equip you for this walk with God. And that’s why we invite people to join the foundation school, because in the foundation school, you’d be taught the basic doctrines of Christ that’ll equip you for the higher life in God.

AIM OF THE FOUNDATION SCHOOL

The Aim of the membership school is to educate Christians concerning the basic doctrines of Christ and lay a good foundation, which can be built upon to live an effective and fulfilling life.

To prepare you for the ministry of reconciliation

To enable you grow, by increasing in the knowledge of Gods word(1 Peter 2:2)

To correct any erroneous ideas that you might have had(Eph 4:11-14)

To present you perfect in Christ Jesus.(col 1:28)

Foundation school modules have been designed to span across 6-week period, this is to enable you have a deep understanding of what’s been taught and also gives you more time to study.

…Study to show thy self approved, a workman that needed not to be ashamed rightly dividing the words of truth. 

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? JOIN THE FOUNDATION SCHOOL TODAY!!!



## WHERE ON EARTH WILL YOU HEAR THIS...?~1500

Preach the Gospel to every creature! Perhaps your car has been grounded; if you’d talk to it; if you’d release words of power to that car, before long, it’ll be back on the road. Maybe your house and everything in it is getting old, you can call forth a renewal. Declare, “House, in the Name of Jesus, you’re renewed.” Walk-through the rooms and prophesy that new furniture, decorative items, electronics, etc., are coming in the Name of Jesus! ~ 

 Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.



## QUOTES FROM RHAPATHON LIVE TRANSMISSION~1501

Be of good cheer, don't wear a sad look. That's the way you do the word. It's been written already that you won,  Nothing can change that, regardless.

## FEBRUARY 2020 GLOBAL COMMUNION SERVICE~1561

Pray-A-Thon Talkshow

Pastor Chris 
Unending prayers means unending responses. Without you praying, your faith isn't expressed. 

- Rev Ken. In this one year, the devil has been paralyzed. Our Man of God has given us a platform for Perfection, so this year you have no right to die,you have no right to be poor, ability has been granted you. Everytime you pray is answers, answers, answers, and the proof of answers is your result. 

- Rev Tom. As we pray, there is a stirring up of the gifts of the Spirit. As men are sleeping, we are canceling their evil deeds. We are over running the devils out of town. 

Question and Answer Segment

Acts 10:47, Matthew 28:19 - Question About baptism of water and the spirit.

Answer

It shouldn't be in any particular order. The baptism of the Holy Spirit is the new birth. The receiving of the Holy Spirit to live in you is when the anointing comes. There's no particular order for receiving the Holy Spirit before water baptism... If you're born again, it can happen to you in any order... When you were born again, you were immersed in the Holy Spirit. We are meant to drink in one body. The ones Peter preached to were born again, received the Holy Spirit (baptized by the Holy Ghost)... To time to receive the sinners prayer... In the house of Cornelius, they got baptized in water also...

Question About living the life of glory...

Answer...

When you live the life of Christ and according to the word of God.... Christ in you is the life of glory...

Question About the moral laws of the Old Testament and if they are abiding to Christians now...

Answer...

The word of God is life. The righteous man doesn't require the law. We are in Christ now. God had eternal covenant with Abraham. The old had been done away with, the testament, not the books. We are new creatures. References...

Ephesians 2:14-16 - He abolished in his flesh

1 Timothy 1:8- - The law is not made for a righteous man. 

Galatians 5:1 - In the liberty where Christ has made us free

Romans 5:1 - Being justified by faith we are one with God in Christ 

The law was given to the Jews and under the curse of the law, you're not required to obey it because it wasn't given to you in the first place any way. Moses was the mediator and the law wasn't given to the non-Jews. The presence of the law was their condemnation.

Question About forgiving and having nothing to do with someone

Answer...

Prophecy... It's wonderful to be known of God and express His love. We read forgiveness wrong a lot of times. It's not letting someone off the hook. It means a lot more. It's a complete separation of the sinner from the offense. It's a divorce. If that's true, how can you not want to do anything with the person. Separate the individual from his error. Remit. The sins are remitted. Completely removed. That's how God forgave you and want you to forgive. 

Can I maintain the same relationship before and after? Maybe you might not have changed. You might do the same thing again. Wait until they do it again and I forgive seventy times seventy times? 

Don't go with the mindset of punishing them by not relating with them. Don't love them so much that you don't want to have anything to do with them. So, that's it, I've answered you. 

Blessed be God for ever and ever and ever and ever...

Pastor Chris 
Often times you hear people say that they aren't perfect. They share the idea that perfection is impossible. The scriptures however tells us that perfection is God's plan for us. To think otherwise is to say God's not true. 

The Bible says, "be ye perfect.". There are several persons in the Bible that were recorded as being perfect. For us to apologise about our perfection is to accuse God of a lie. 

Our perfection isn't measured by man's standards. When Jesus walked the earth, they didn't think He was perfect. They accused Him of not conforming to the known standards. 

Jesus was the manifestation of truth - the word & will of God manifested to us. Everything about Him; God's will isn't an act or a thought; God's love



## #MARCH~1663

2020 GLOBAL COMMUNION SERVICE WITH REV. CHRIS OYAKHILOME D.Sc, DD.

Exodus 31:1-5 "And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,"

When you study the Bible, it points us to the Seven Spirits of God. Seven is the symbol of completion, the number of perfection.

Verse 3 above talks of a man filled with 3 of God's Spirit.

Isaiah 11:1-3 "And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD; And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:"

Before the Messaih (Jesus Christ) came, nobody was filled with all Seven Spirits of God. In the old testament times, the Spirit of God rests on people and used them for mighty works.

Daniel 12:1-4 "But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased."

The phrase "knowledge shall be increased" means that God is going to cause the increase, 

THIS MONTH OF MARCH IS THE MONTH OF KNOWLEDGE

Every Child of God has received the fullness of the Spirit (Seven Spirits of God). In this month, there's going to be a manifestation of this particular Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is going to cause knowledge to increase and you're going to be open to receive this increased knowledge.

Proverbs 8:10, 10:14 "Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold."

God is telling you that knowledge is more important than choice gold. 

Proverbs 18:15, 19:2 "The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge."

This is knowledge that can be applied for life; that can cause progress and improve one's life.

There are a lot of people that have useless knowledge that can't help them in life. That the soul be without knowledge is not good.

Proverbs 23:3-5 "Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat. Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven."

Knowledge is what you'd need to get from the outside. The other virtues are from within you. So acquire knowledge; learn something new this month.

2 Peter 1:5 "And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;"

There are three basic kinds of knowledge we are introduced to in the New Testament - Sonesis, Ginosko and Epignosis.

Colossians 3:10 talks about Epignosis. This knowledge relates with God; the more you know Him, the more you're like Him.

2 Peter 1:2-3 "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him) that hath called us to glory and virtue:"

You want more grace in your life, more peace manifested in your life; it's not by prayer or fasting, it is by knowledge (Epignosis) of God and of Jesus.

The word of God comes to build your life, to increase your knowledge. That's why it's important for you not to despise the gatherings of the brethren.



## Pastor Biodun Lawal..~1672

If you want to be successful this year and achieve your projections:

1. Disallow anger. You cannot flourish with anger. There are no angels of anger but there are demons of anger.  Anger is demonic. 

2. Never live in fear. Fear leads to failure. Eliminate fear. No shaking!

3. Be conscious that you have the mind of Christ. Talk to yourself "I am excellent, I do excellent things."

4. Be excited about new challenges. Give yourself new targets and be excited about them. Everything you want to achieve this year is outside your comfort zone. Get out of your comfort zone. The good in your hand is what is preventing the BEST to come. Make new things happen this year. 

5. Always have regards for people. If you don't have regards for people, you cannot flourish. Respect people. I tell people humility always brings unexplainable promotions. This year, people are your harvest. Love people. 

6. Always think about souls because it is our business. It is the church's business. If you neglect souls, you cannot flourish. 

7. Be Kingdom of God conscious. Don't forget who you are and where you come from. Let your prosperity be felt in the kingdom. 

Glory hallelujah



## SO PRECIOUS!~1722

(You're Special To God) ~ Pastor Chris

You're made in God's image and likeness; don't look down on yourself.

"But you are God's chosen and special people. You are a group of royal priests and a holy nation. God has brought you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (1 Peter 2:9 CEV).

When some people pray, they say things like: "We're nothing in thy sight, O God" or "We're but trash before thee, O Lord." They think it's a show of humility and respect for God when they talk this way. They don't realise they're devaluing themselves. The reason they talk like this is because they're ignorant of what the scriptures say about them. I would to God they knew just how special and precious they are to God.

You shouldn't make the mistake of thinking or talking like them, because as a Christian, you're born of God (John 1:12). Besides, God created you in His image and likeness (Genesis 1:27). This means you look exactly like Him and you have His nature in you. When a dog gives birth, it reproduces a dog and not a monkey. It's the same with God. He only gives birth to His kind, and you're His kind because He gave birth to you!

So, refuse to think like those who believe it's proud to call yourself a child of God. Be bold to declare that you're God's special possession, for indeed you are! You're His specially-crafted masterpiece, called by His Name, and created in His image and likeness. You're a peculiar treasure and precious to God. Be conscious of this truth and walk in the light of it.



## Global Day of Prayer Day 3
30 March 2020~1778

Pastor Chris Teaching

We are dealing with the nearness of the coming of the Lord, and it's important that we understand this. There is a lot of ignorance in the church today about the coming of the Lord. People are not conscious about this. Having doubts about this? You don't need to look far. As a Christian, it's important that you prepare yourself for the coming of the Lord. We are very close.

The future of the nations is spoken of in the bible. What is currently happening is not a surprise. It's important to know what the future holds for whatever country you may be living in. It's time to take Christianity seriously. What's happening now is one of the signs of the coming of the Lord.

1 John 2:18 KJV
Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.

Antichrist means two things:

1. Anti-Christ, meaning against Christ
2. Instead of Christ or in place of Christ

In the writings of John the Apostle, particularly the Book of Revelation, you will begin to see the manifestations of the antichrist. Remember, he is a person. When you study the books of Daniel and Ezekiel, the Word tells us about this man and what he would do. There are various descriptions about him (a horn, etc). The spirit that works with him has been here before. The things he does are not entirely new.

Examples are: the government, economy and religion. Those are the things the antichrist will use to control the world. This is not something new. Think about this: when you look at history, you will see the kind of power people we have voted for have. In the bible, we see that nations will give the antichrist their authority, just like citizens give to someone they vote for to make him or her a president.

Furthermore, we see from scriptures that Satan will give that same antichrist power too. Nations will submit themselves to the antichrist. Have you every thought it would come to a point where streets are clean like they are now? If you go through history, this is something that has been happening over and over again. When such things happened, friends metamorphosed into enemies. Social distancing? Well, it has been there before, it just has a new reason, which is "so you don't infect others." There is always a name for enemies.

These things are not new, they are just happening at different levels. There has been a lot of evil and killings before. The difference might be that there were visible people who were responsible before, but now it is an invisible person behind the killing now. Although the killer is invisible, there are various key players now. Thank God we know how to deal with these kind of situations.

We don't have to be bothered about the antichrist because he cannot show up now. Why not now? Because it's not his time. Although it's not his time, Satan would still like to have the antichrist show up now. He would definitely like to see these things happen now. Regardless of his efforts, they will still fail now because it's not his time.

There are forefronts to what the enemy is planning. Look at what's happening now. The world has never had an opportunity to bring in negative policies like now. We know how to deal with these kind of issues. When we pray, things happpen.

Daniel 9:24 KJV
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.

When is Jesus coming back? At the end of the church age, which is 2000 years. Something to keep in mind: 1 week is 7 years because it has 7 days, and each day (in this case) is 1 year.

Ezekiel 37:11-14 KJV
Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts. Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God ; Behold,



## O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am the Lord , when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken it, and performed it, saith the Lord.~1779

Hosea 6:1-2 KJV
Come, and let us return unto the Lord : for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord : his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

James 5:7 KJV
Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

Jesus is coming back after 2 days, which is 2000 years from the day he ascended, and on the 3rd day, with is 3000th year, He is coming to reign on earth, and we will be with Him. So we are within the 2000 years, and we are living at the tail end or last days of the 2000 years.

2 Thessalonians 2:3-7 KJV
Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.

One of the titles of the antichrist is son of perdition. Now, the antichrist cannot show up now because it's not his time. The power fire of Christians is just too much.

1 Thessalonians 4:13-17 KJV
Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed about those who sleep in death, so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope. For we believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him. According to the Lord’s word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.

1 Corinthians 15:51-56 KJV
Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.

In a twinkling of an eye, we will disappear. That's how fast it will be. Until we go, there won't be one world religion, government, etc. Until we leave, the antichrist won't show up.

John 16:33 KJV
These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.

## -PRAYING FOR LOST SOULS~1781

When you have a friend or loved one whom you've discern is being held bondage by satan from receiving the Gospel, cast the devil out. You say, "I break the power of the devil over his mind, over his life, and I claim his salvation, and call it done in Jesus's Name" I declare that he would come to the Lord! I release ministering spirits to go forth and guide his path unto salvation.

Even after Satan's influence is broken, its up to an individual to make up his mind to serve the Lord. The part that involves the individual's will requires persistent intercession. If you are going to influence a man's will, you can't just do it by the prayer of faith, it has to be by the prayer of intercession.

PRAYER
Even now, I pray for lost souls around the world, that the message of salvation will shine through their hearts, as they receive and embrace the righteousness of Christ in the Gospel, in Jesus's Name, Amen.

## My Notes~1790

Day 5 ~ (Pastor Chris)


What is going on right now is beyond the Covid-19. Its something more sinister

We must be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.

In the days of Esther, everything looked good and fine. But there was a man who was friends with the king. 
The Jewish people were at that time in some form of bondage, but enjoyed some form of liberty in a strange land. 
Sometimes, you enjoy liberty but forget you are in a strange place that is not home. 
Like every Christian today, the bible says we are in a journey. We are pilgrims and strangers in the earth. 
While we are here, we must remember our purpose.
There's a reason why we are here, and it is for a time.
We don't belong in this system. 

The Jewish people were at ease and everything looked good, until Hamaan just didn't like a certain Jewish man that he often met when he went to visit the king (Mordecai). So he decided it would be too disrespectful to go after just the one man. 
Through his influence, He got the King to sign his decree. 

Its amazing how much wickedness one person could execute. 

The news got to the Jews, and they fasted, prayed and called to the God of heaven for deliverance. And God heard their prayer and delivered them from the hand of wicked Hamaan.

These things have happened again and again. 
There are places where Christianity is completely outlawed or forbidden. You find that those countries used to have many churches before. You ask 'what happened'? And often, there are no answers because they hadn't asked. 
God would never orchestrate such a thing (anything that would forbid the gospel). Now such places people hide to talk about Jesus. 

WHAT HAPPENED???
The Christians at that time in that nation were no watching. They didn't do what Jesus said. 

If the Jews in Shushan had no fasted and prayed, they would have also been destroyed. 

The Christians in Jerusalem as well. If they had not prayed like they did, Peter would have been killed like James was killed. 

Thank God for this time you are at home. Don't worry about the virus. God is just giving us TIME to pray. Had this not happened, we wouldn't have known all the evil works that had been going on. They think they have us on lockdown, but NO, they have given us the opportunity to hear God and pray. This is not time for wasting. It is time for prayer because your LIBERTY IS AT STAKE. YOUR PERSONAL LIFE AND FREEDOM IS AT STAKE. You are at that time when you will determine whether you will go to heaven or go to hell. 
There is DANGER that's why we are praying and fasting. We are not ignorant. 

That's why we must PRAY 

Pray against the works of evil and the HATRED OF CHRISTIANS that has been brewing and seems to be climaxing in many places now. 

In the last few months, they have been talking about antisemitism (the hatred of Jews). Anytime you hear anything about antisemitism, just know the hatred of Christians is close by. 

All these happening is just a cloak to cover the real plans of the adversary. 

That's why we must pray because IT'S NOT TIME!!!

Daniel referred to the abomination of desolation. Jesus also referred to it.
2 people entered the temple and desecrated the temple by offering a pig to act like the Antichrist. But when Jesus came, he made them know that this 'phase 1' that the devil tried to play was not it. 

Our fasting continues. By Friday, we will know if we will continue. But this thing....WE WILL DESTROY IT. 

Where do Viruses come from? Scientists don't know because they don't exist in Nature. They are not living things. They don't reproduce, they only multiply inside their host. 
They were not always there. 
Anything that doesn't exist in nature is MAN MADE. 
The worrisome thing for a lot of people is that they are expecting the academia to ask and answer such questions while they live in fear. 

If viruses are man made, where did this latest one come from? And why does it resemble the one that had come before??

Don't let anyone deceive you. Go online and check for yourself. 
Those who are against this evil having their websites and pages c

Your Love world Special
Season 2, Phase 3, Day 1

Opening Prayer session led by Pastor Lanre Alabi.

Reverend Chris Oyakhilome

Pastor Sings 'He is Lord, He is Lord. He is Risen from the dead, He is Lord. Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord' repeatedly.
'Thou art worthy oh Lord, to receive Glory honor and power. For thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure, They are and were created".

Welcome to today's program. 
The Lord is gracious and kind. He loves us and cares about us. The scriptures show us that. He is for us, not against us. All He's ever wanted to do was to bless us; To show us his goodness, his loving kindness.

I don't know if you have had the opportunity to join our media week. Its a program organized by Kingschat and Ceflix. Amazing program. Enlightening and empowering. 
We also had the Love world Extra; a 4 hour power packed program with amazing  ministers all over the world praying and sharing with us. 

I can tell you that its better to be known as a great prayer than a great preacher, because it is more honorable to minister to God than to minister to Men.

I'll give you a little bit of follow-up of what we have enjoyed in the past two days by tomorrow. 


We've been on the subject "The Mystery of Christ". 
When I started sharing with you several weeks ago on the problems of the current crisis around the world, it wasn't to get the masses to do something about it. From the scripture. I know that The masses have always been deceived. I was addressing Gods people to be wise, act on Gods word and be fearless in facing this deception.
Deception had always been the hallmark of Satan's commerce. It's what he traffics in. He trades in it. 

E.g. the Spanish flu advertised... Do we have real Data about it? What we have seen is that information is leaked for a certain purpose. And people don't ask the right questions. We share with them from the bible, and they ask foolish questions.. Just like in the days of Jesus. 
They were angry with Jesus when he spoke the truth. .
The religious leaders were the chief deceivers..who accused Jesus of deception. They knew how to use their money for whatever they wanted. They bribed Judas with money to deceive Jesus. 
They bribed the roman soldiers to lie that the disciples stole Jesus' body. Then, the media of their day carried the FAKE NEWS about it. They were master deceivers. 

The Roman leaders: Gov. Felix was called a Greedy man, by Josephus. 
He left Paul in Prison just to please the Jewish leaders. He wanted Paul to bribe Him to release him. 
The leaders condemned Jesus to death and the masses supported them. 

The judgement of God is well deserved of those who will suffer it. Became they love to be deceived;  They have no time to look into reality. 

There are children of salvation and those of foolishness. Children of foolishness hate truth when they hear it. But if you have a desire for God, he will guide you even if you start out blindly and act foolishly. Some how, He will tug at your heart and get your attention

I showed you researches on how that there are health challenges with 3G and 4G... And then I showed you researches to show you how dangerous the 5G would be. 
Already there are people who wake up with headaches ,dizziness and sometimes Nausea because they keep their phone by their pillow while they sleep.

I don't care if they call say we are practicing medicine without licence.

If you sometimes wake up with those symptoms, try turning off your WiFi and keeping your phone a few metres away from you and see the results.
Some smart meters around you may need to be relocated. 
Try this for 5 days and see. 

There are lots of people who tested this, and their headaches went. (Instead of casting out headaches all the time)

I'm in the healing ministry. I'm concerned about people and I want them to be well. 
E.g. I told you about water. Its important to drinking water rather than soft drinks. 

Anyway, I'm just talking g about Truth; how easy it is, and how easy it is to Miss it. 


To proceed with where we



## losed down.~1791

YouTube, etc. 
It is a war that has been declared by anyone who is against covid19. 

Bill Gates said we will eventually have some digital certificates to know who has been vaccinated against corona virus. An invisible "quantum dot tattoo" used to Identify vaccinated kids. 
Its actually a microchip. 
Isn't this the Mark of the beast?
 When the microchip was tested, the team did not allow TV cameras in that year at Davos. 

Now they have included these digital vaccinations into their 2020 SDGs. They want to start with the poorest countries like countries in Africa. 

The 3 major thing they are working on;
1. One world Govt.
2. One world economy.
3. One world Religion.

They are trying to centralize everything.

This mark (microchip/digital ID) they want to put on people is not just a mark. It is an intelligent mark. The Bible says if anyone receives that mark, he is completely doomed. There is no forgiveness, or anything. He would have no place with God. It is the mark of a man. 

There's a reason for it. 
Through that mark, you can be controlled. They can control your thoughts. 

The Nations that were destroyed in the old testament (e.g. Canaanites) were destroyed because they were no longer normal human beings. Fallen angels had slept with them, and as such were descendants of those beings. They we're corrupted races. Their thoughts were thoughts of devils. They were full of wickedness. 

The devil is trying to push his agenda before the rapture of the church that's why we must say NO. We must pray. Don't assume another person is praying. 
When this happens, there is no reversal... That's why we have to Fight it. 

Now they are saying "if you don't get this vaccine, you're going to die and you will affect other people". Then they will begin to round up the Christians who say they don't want the vaccine, and treat them the way the Nazis treated Jews. Terrible.

 The Rapture of the church is the first thing that we should be expecting right now the church has only "2 days" to be in this world.

Matt 24: 32-34. A generation is about a hundred years according to scripture.
The fig tree is symbolic of the nation of Israel. 
When it's branch is yet tender, you know that summer is near. 
V29... 
Jesus was talking about things that would happen in the last days after the tribulation. He was giving them the SIGN of his coming. 
The elect spoken about isn't referring to Christians. 
Jump to Amos 8:1-2. Refers to a basket of Summer fruit. What does it mean?
It means the gathering. 
He is saying  he has another harvest. He won't be with them again. He leaves them.

Back to Matt 24:32-33 This just shows the timing. 

The relationship between the fig tree and the summer fruit is THE GATHERING OF THE FRUIT. This is the period where God is with the Gentiles, gathering himself a people. 
V34: this refers to the generation where the fig tree has it's tender branch 


From 1948, Israel became a nation. Start counting the generation from there. Take a 100 years from there. This exactly also coincides with the '2 days' spoken of. 
During this 100 years from when Israel came back as a nation is when the Rapture, the middle East peace treaty, the Russian allied invasion of Isreal, the one world govt, economy and religion, the broken treaty and the great tribulation will take place

WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. 
The nearest sign we have is the gathering of Israel as a nation in 1948. Now we are in Very critical time. 
Any thing you want to do for God, do it now!!!!

But we won't allow them to carry out the things which should happen after the rapture Now.

Proverbs 10: 5. Summer is gathering time. 

THE GATHERING IS THE RAPTURE.
Isreal is tender currently. They are still looking for help, because they know they are surrounded by enemies. 

2 Thess 2:1. that's the rapture. 
V2
There is a difference between the rapture of the church, and the day of Christ.
It refers to the beginning of the millennial reign that starts with Judgement. 

1 These 4:16. This is what will soon happen. 
1 Cor 15:51.  
We will be changed/transformed. 
The world



## Some highlights from yesterday's broadcast with our man of God.~1795

🖍The antichrist will make a treaty and restore peace in the Middle East.
🖍He will be celebrated as a hero
🖍 Russia will reject his rule and spring a surprise attack on Israel.
🖍 God will deliver Israel and Russia will be subdued.
🖍The antichrist will then have total control of the world for three and half years
 🖍 We should be expecting rapture.
🖍 Count 100 years from 1948, the year Israel became a nation.
🖍 Within this period:
🛑 Rapture will happen 
🛑 The second coming will happen
🛑The invasion of Israel by Russian allies will happen.
🛑 This is the time to do all you want to do for the Lord.
🛑 We are in critical time



## FORWARDED FROM OUR HIGHLY ESTEEMED MOST REV~1802

Important Guidelines & Directives on April 2020 Communion Service

Dear Esteemed Leader,

Warm greetings of peace and love to you, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Welcome to the beautiful Month of April, marking the beginning of the 2nd quarter in this great year; Our Year Of Perfection.

As you are well aware, the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic crisis, that has brought about an upsurge of the social distancing regulations as a means of containing the viral spread; has so far resulted in unpleasant restriction to mass movements and all forms of social gatherings; and in some cases, a total lockdown situation altogether; affecting many cities and nations of the world.

This situation has also inadvertently impacted upon our usual gatherings for worship services of various kinds in most of our churches globally. Thanks be to God that this has been largely combated by our fervent intercessory prayers in the past few days; and also by the use of our highly diversified virtual platforms to execute our regular meetings, services and programs; and all with recorded great outcomes achieved online.

However, in view of these recent developments, it is so pertinent that we work ahead, with regards to making a contingency plans for effective execution and participation in the upcoming Global Communion by all our brethren in the churches; especially in regions that have been affected to the extent of a total lockdown.

To ensure this, Our Man of God, Rev Dr Chris Oyakhilome DSc DD, has given direction, requiring  that all our pastors do the following immediately:

1. Initiate sensitization of the brethren on how important it is to make all efforts to actually participate in the Global Communion Service in these crucial times; even whilst at home.

2. Educate the brethren on the available channels for viewing the communion service, particularly on our various LoveWorld Networks; so they are not disadvantaged; in the event that they cannot achieve online connections where they are at this time.

3. Work with the brethren to carefully identify and determine possible and available options in their homes that can be used as alternatives to the standard communion elements. Examples include short biscuits or bread (in place of the communion bread) and fruit, non-alcoholic juice or wine (in place of the cup). It is important to communicate this clearly to them; ensuring they retain the sacredness of this sacrament as taught us in the scriptures. Clearly please emphasize that It is communion and not a meal!
The drink should be taken from a cup and not a can, bottle or carton.

4. Encourage them to use available platforms provided during the service to ensure they give their offerings 

5. In addition, you will recall that our Man of God would be ministering to the sick and also pronouncing the blessing during this special global service. It is therefore our responsibility, as pastors, to also use this opportunity to inspire all the brethren to reach out to their family members and many others in their world; helping them to connect to this timely service with our Man of God.

This will surely enable many who are sick, broken, afraid or distressed around the world at this time, to become partakers with us in grace and true inner peace; as we receive the guidance and blessings of the Spirit for the Month of April.

We look forward to unprecedented testimonies; as we align ourselves to these very important directives.

Thank you and God bless you abundantly.

## ‼PASTOR ELUCIDATES US ON THE NEW WORLD ORDER AGENDA‼~1813

You wanna know what's going on in the world? . 

This is what the groups that are interested in the new world order are up to, to put vaccine in your body containing a digital ID, by which you as a human being can be controlled, you seize to be yourself.

To achieve the vaccination, they are using 2 things:

1. They created a pandemic (Covic19) in order to create fear and panic.

2. They use internet of things (IOT), and created 5G (people can easily embrace it), which causes health issues, but you wouldn't know cause they made you love the high internet speed.

Both strategies lead to achieving their initial plan, vaccination with digital ID. 

If these groups were not hiding anything,......

1. They forced everyone to stay indoors (aka quarantine/lockdown), but they have people busy installing 5G Poles .

2. Why do they get angry when others express opposite views?. 

They are taking down their websites and posts. E.g 1. Youtube deleted many videos expossing this conspiracy, 1 by former Vodafone boss. E.g 2. Facebook deleted post by Brazil president exposing their plans.



## SEVEN DAYS OF GLOBAL FASTING AND PRAYING. DAY 2, MARCH 29, 2020.~1817

Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.

Luke 22:52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?

This was at the arrest of Jesus, they had come to pick him up. They wanted to get Him and one of His disciples betrayed Him. They came with weapons to arrest Him so Jesus said to them, "is it a rubber you came to arrest with all of these weapons?"

Verse 53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

Verse 53 (NLT) Why didn’t you arrest me in the Temple? I was there every day. But this is your moment, the time when the power of darkness reigns.

THIS IS THE TIME OF THE POWER OF DARKNESS.
Jesus understood that it wasn't just the people. He was not looking at the soldiers, the chief priests, the elders, and all those who came to arrest Him, He was looking beyond them. He said this is your moment, this is your hour, this is the time of the power of darkness. He knew who was behind it. He knew that it was not His hour but their hour. It was the moment where the power of darkness is at work. Jesus knew that it is the will of the father for Him to lay down His life. He said I lay down my life of my own will. 

John 10:18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.

The Bible says they arrested Him. Jesus had power. He could do anything. He is the son of God but He let them arrest Him. Why? He says this is their hour. This is their moment. He knew it. And when it was not time for something, Jesus also knew. He didn't just let something happened because He couldn't do anything about it. No. 

There is another thing I would like you to notice about the power of darkness. 

Acts 26:15-18 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. 16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; 17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, 18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.

Jesus says to Paul, I am delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles that l am sending you to, to open their eyes, that means that they have been in spiritual darkness and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God. These people were under the power of Satan and they didnt know it. So Jesus sent Paul to preach the gospel to them, to turn them from darkness to light and front the power of Satan unto God. That they may receive remission of sins. What Jesus is saying here is that remission of sins is now available. What men have to do now is to receive remission for sins. 

In the book of Colossians, Paul's says something again in connection with this. He talks about the prayer he was praying for God's people in Colossi. 

Col 1:12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: 13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

If this is true for the chritians in Colossi, then it is true for every christian because this is not about the location but about what Jesus Christ accomplished for the new creation, for the man that is in Christ Jesus. He says God has translated us from the power of darkness into the kingdom of His dear son. Notice the tenses again; who hath delivered us and not He will deliver us. 

When Jesus spoke to Paul, He said I want you to go turn them from darkness to light. He didn't say go pray for



## My Notes:~1831

Day 1, Week 2 ~ Pastor Chris

Dan 8:23-25 NIV. 
When they FEEL SECURE, He will destroy many.

Jesus called Satan the Father of lies and a Murderer. He is the very epitome of deception. 
The power that the Antichrist wields is the power of Satan. He will lie and murder in deceit. 

We are seeing this type of manifestation going on and we can't just close our eyes and say it is ordinary. No! We've got to stop the devil in his tracks. 

He WILL DO ALL THOSE THINGS anyway, but it shouldn't be now.
We need to continue to pray till we have the consciousness that it is all done. We can't stop halfway. 
We can't be like the king who struck only 3 times and stopped. It is better to overdo it and paralyze the power of the enemy. 

You are in Christ Jesus, and because you are in Christ, remember that Greater is he that is In you than he that is In the world. 
So many still need to come to christ. We must prepare for the massive harvest that must take place before the rapture.

Pray for the nations of the world and the leaders for BOLDNESS to do what is right for their countries.

We have to look at Patterns set in the word of God.
It is never too much to pray.
Take responsibility.
Whenever the Isrealites had a problem, everyone gathered including the children

God listens to even children and hears their voice when they pray.

We are praying that things happen inline with God's perfect will.
The Parable of the wheat and tares: while men slept, the enemy sowed tares. 
Don't be found sleeping (not being spiritually alert)

This year 2020 was announced as the year of perfection and alignment. Bringing things to God's perfect order and timing. 
The month of March, God told us it was the month of Knowledge.

We were so busy with God's work, not noticing what the one world Govt people were doing. Thank God that so much knowledge has come to us on satanic works that have been happening. 
That's the reason we are fasting and praying. We know we can't just be quiet of let things carry on. 

They are those who think 'how can the whole world be deceived?'.
Remember Y2K. 
All the governments of the nations were spending billions of dollars in preparation. 
There was FEAR of what was going to happen. Everyday, analysts were on TV talking about all the things that needed to be done. 
They never told us the truth that it was just a SMALL ADJUSTMENT that needed to be made in the date.

Guess what? Nothing HAPPENED.... and no one apologized or explained why nothing happened. Everything just went on as though all that propaganda never took place. 
Why? Nations and governments were deceived.

Regarding this covid-19: People should get TREATED and not be left to die. 

Sean Hannaty of Fox news gave a news report a day ago to call on Gov. Cuoma to stop preventing people from getting chloroquine treatment. He actually challenged the governor. 
Many people have been successfully treated with the same drugs. The drugs have been tested and proven .
So, the idea that it is incurable till a vaccine comes is UNREALISTIC. 

NOT EVERYBODY LIKES TO HEAR the truth. Some want the situation to remain like this, which is very unfair.

We are not crying WOLF where there is not. 
There are clandestine plans to keep things this way so that they become what they call 'the new normal'. There are lies that would be given... E.g. some scientists are now publishing that the earth is no longer shaking because of the lock down. If it is so good, why won't they suggest that we all remain on lockdown?
That's their strategy....

If you live in the UK, visit . Help them reverse the Corona virus bill that was passed last week. HC Bill122... Go read and study it intelligently (Forced detention and isolation, lockdown powers will prevent protests etc.... Just read the horrible things being signed into law). You would think this was China. 

Right now, they need 200,000 signatures to reverse that bill Urgently!
They rushed through it and passed the bill... WHILE MEN SLEPT.

If this is happening with US HERE, what will happen to this world when we are gone. 

We ar

Week 2. Day 2~1838

PST. T.T. Edun:

Psalm 2:1-11
Why do the Heathen rage?
V4: He that sits in the Heavens shall laugh.

Proverbs 19:21 KJV, NIV

Prov.19.21 - There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

It doesn't matter what anyone is trying to concoct or how they are trying to change seasons and times... We are praying. Whatever they are imagining is a vain thing.

We will pray for leaders of municipalities. Some times the plans of God are opposed by mayor's office cities..but we are declaring that their plans will not prevail. 

We are cutting down the influence of 'online influencers'. We cut off their power. Jesus is the greatest influencer. 
Any one that exalts themselves against the power of God, we cut off their influence. 

In scripture, in the time of Elijah, God told him he had 400 prophets who had not bowed themselves to baal. 
There are people in this world who are in support with our view points. We will pray for them to speak up, emboldened. People with voices in the realm of medicine, banking, etc... They are emboldened to speak up and cause the counsel of God to be established in the land in Jesus name. 

Pastor Chris

We started today's session in prayers and we will have some more time of prayer. 
The Lord never asked us to pray in vain. 
He told us to pray, because he planned to answer. 

Sometimes, we tend to leave things about our lives to other people because we think they know better so they will do what is necessary..just like children. Little kids trust their parents and leave their decision making to the parents. 
Every Adult was once a child, so it's in each one of us to trust. 
As a child, you trusted your parents to make decisions. And when they made decisions about things you liked e.g. Sweets, games, candy... They could withhold them, and even if you cried, you had to submit to them. 

As adults, when you've recognized a certain authority, you tend to leave decision making to them. 
All over the world, we left decision making to the Government..the state. 
And that's not a bad thing. 
After all, governments of nation's are generally people who are part of the country. They are one with the people...so there is some measure of trust that is good. 

What we are saying today is not so much a direliction of duty by trusted govts... But if there is anyway to describe what's going on right now...it's a STATE CAPTURE. 
Because these countries are not being run right now by their governments. Sad to say. 
It helps us to understand even better what the Bible says about the nations giving their power and authority unto the beast. (In Revelations)
We can see it so easily.

E.g. the lock down of the cities and countries was not the plan of the countries. No parliament sat down together to discuss a lockdown. It just came out of a play book. 

We pray guided with Information because God always wants us to be specific when we make requests 

Interesting...in October 2019, there was a simulation titled EVENT201... A simulation of what is happening right now. How could they have been so accurate? In that simulation, certain people in government and industries were brought in...like a board meeting... To see how they would react if an actual pandemic was imminent. 
It's interesting because if the organizers of the event. 

Check centre for John Hopkins health security website. Read the information for yourself. 
(Bill and Melinda gates were a part of this)
How could they be so ACCURATE???
The accuracy is suspect, knowing they are not prophets that give revelation. 
This video was shown in October last year and a few months later, it goes everywhere. 

The organizers of the event and the ones to be questioned. 

The idea is STATE CAPTURE because even if the governments of the nations are not aware, they are currently being told what to do... BY WHO??. That's why it has become really dangerous.
Every nation needs to do THEIR OWN RESEARCH.

Get your local associations to do their research and ask questions .
The WHO is more than. 70%



## My Notes.
Day 4, Week 2~1852

Pastor Chris.

Today we will look at some questions that some have sent. 
If you've been watching the programs since last week, there are several questions that have already been answered.
Just in case you didn't understand it, if we have touched on it previously, we will try to touch on it again tonight. 

1. Q: Dear Pastor Chris.... Where was Satan and his demons during the days of Noah when God destroyed the whole world with the flood? Why didn't God destroy Satan and his demons since he is responsible for all the evil in the world?

Ans: The flood dealt with the physical world as it was known then. 
There is a time set when the devil will be destroyed. God is orderly and when that time comes, Satan will be destroyed. 

Q: You discussed the second coming of the Lord. What can I do to get myself ready for the first flight?

A: first, a person must be born again. Then. You must live for Jesus Christ and be found constantly growing unto Maturity. Study the word, go to church, fellowship withe holy ghost. You must also be marked as a Christian,  Winning souls. 

God has given man choice. People will not just be given the mark... They will RECEIVE the mark of the beast. Wickedness and evil is a choice. People choose to yield to wicked nudgings of the devil 
Gal 5:19- speaks of the works of the flesh. Those who yield to the works of the flesh will not inherit the kingdom of God. .
Getting raptured is an access we received as an inheritance as long as we walk by the spirit. If we walk in the spirit, we won't yield to the flesh. The same life in the vine, is the same life in the branch. So, naturally you should produce the fruit of the spirit. Gal 5: 16-24
Its just to make a decision. 
Start from your mouth so that your life will follow it.  It brings it to your consciousness. 
Say 'I walk in the spirit'.
Train yourself to not go in the wrong direction
There could be wrong desires, but don't let them lead you.
You have learned Christ in a particular way. Follow that way which you have learnt in Christ. 
The devil won't be finally destroyed until everyone has been given THE CHOICE to make Jesus their Lord. 

Q: Could you please explain your opinion on 5G. 

A: video playback from yesterday. (Kindly refer to notes of yesterday if you can't stream)
You have to understand how things work in the system. E.g. imagine the pharmaceutical industry comes up with a drug ad they say to a country 'we have this drug for this disease', then the Govt represented by the regulators would review the product and decide how they will use it in their environment. They would subject it to tests and research before they say 'it would work.. We want it in our country'.
On the other hand, they could after testing say 'this isn't good for us'.
In Nigeria, some years ago, the DG of NAFDAC, said she found out that some of the drugs that were coming into the country were not acceptable. The regulators did not accept the drugs, and yet it came in, so she had to investigate. She then took actions against those who were importing those drugs. 

Same way, our research has yielded tremendous results. In looking through what the regulators in the USA/UK/EU... And what independent researchers (scientists and doctors) who were concerned about health had to say. These independent experts provided their own papers to these regulators and demanded to see what research they had seen before attempting to roll the 5G. Strangely NONE of the regulators provided any independent research to support their action. 
These guys then presented their documents and requested that the Government should put out a moratorium on the roll out until the regulators can prove that it is not harmful to health.

Pastor is not just a minister of the gospel but. Into healing... So no matter how enthusiastic we are about the 5G because of its benefits, we would put health first. 
Pastor just got concerned that our regulators didn't do their research on it. 
We just want that if there are health risks, THEY SHOULD BE FIXED before it is implemented. 
It will be dumb to



## Global Prayer and Fasting
Day 5, Week 2.~1858

Pastor Chris

Its a very special time in Gods kingdom, and only through the spirit can we discern the times. We are in a special season both in God's kingdom and in the world. 
Things are shifting but not in the direction that Satan was planning. 

I showed you a clip from February 2nd communion service, we will watch it again to help you get some important messages to help you understand what's going on in the spirit. Things are happening in the spirit and we are very much involved. 

Remember when the year began, through the spirit, we declared a prayer chain (pray-a-thon 2020). We started first week in January in different groups all over the world . and we coordinated the exercise to have 15 min sessions of prayer each, throughout the day and night. 
God never intervenes in this world without people. 

When we started, we probably didn't know the implications. But we prayed for ministers, and nations and Gods people because changes were about to take place in the spirit. In the earth, changes were brewing. But God always needs his children to effect his own work.
Daniel, having being in exile with other Israelites, through the writings if Jeremiah the prophet, he found out 70 years were determined for them to be in that captivity. He could see things weren't changing, So he went into prayer and fasting so that  things would fall in line with Gods timing.

Timing is important. 

When Jesus came and carried out his ministry in Israel, he wept over Jerusalem and he said they didn't know the TIME of their visitation. The Lord they were waiting for had come to them but they didn't know.
Not many understand how the kingdom of God works. Life is not all about the things you want from God... Money, a house, a job. Life is far beyond that.
People are the same irrespective of their condition.
The poor and the rich are exactly the same unless there's a transformation in their heart.

The difference in circumstance is that when he was poor, he didn't have the resources to carry out the evil that was in his heart. Money is an amplifier of character. Whatever you would have been you will be.
God wants a change in your heart. Except there is a change in your heart, you will also carry out the evil things in your heart

That's why God puts his kingdom and his love first in your heart. Then from your heart, it will flow out to others. If you don't have it in your heart, you can't give it to others.

We are rounding this phase of the fast. Tomorrow we begin a phase of praise and worship. Because, the wicked and evil spirit that was responsible for the evil work around the world...I can tell you WE HAVE BROUGHT HIM DOWN. WE HAVE DESTROYED HIS SEAT.

This thing was never about human beings. Human beings can be used. Whatever role anybody played, good or bad, they probably didn't know. 

Eph 6:10-12 we fight against wicked spirits in the heavenly realms. 
This is what has been happening. It is US that do the wrestling. The Bible tells us what we have to confront. 
2 Cor 10: 3-5
Though we live through our physical bodies, the warfare we are engaged in, is not physical. 

In the book of Judges. Several kings made war with Israel, in the days of Jabin. The captain of his host had allied forces, but the Prophetess Deborah said to Barak, God says 'I will pull Sisera and his armies into the valley and deliver him into your hands'.
And something amazing happened..
They invaded Israel...
The Bible tells us, the Kings fought... WHAT KINGS?
KJV Judges 5:19-
This fight was in the heavenlies, while the one on the ground was going on. The real fight in the heavenlies determined what happened on ground. 

The ground became marshy, torrential rains came down from heaven, everyone died save for Sisera who escaped and a woman killed. 
Life is spiritual... That's why we needed to fast and pray.
Satan doesn't really care about what is happening in the world. 
Nothing satisfies him. 
You can't give him ANY CHANCE. 

THE kingdom of God is like a man saw a treasure in a field, and Bought the whole field just for it. T



## My Notes
Day 6, Week 2~1862

Pastor Chris:
Today we are going to worship and praise in prayers and songs. 

Psalm 33:1-22..  Praise is comely for the upright. 

Worship (Eben)
At the Centre of it all.
Jesus how I love you
God all by yourself
Shepherd of my soul
Prince of Peace (Worthy is the lamb that was slain)

Prayer session: Esteemed Pastor T.T Edun

Worship: 
Sovereign God (Eniola)
More than the world (Joe Praise)

Prayer session: Esteemed Pastor Deola Philips

Pastor Chris:
It's important that whenever any major thing happens in your life, consult the word of God. Never use your own understanding. He tells us 'lean not to your own understanding'. Consult the word for guidance. The Lord gives us wisdom. 
When there's a major crisis in the world, don't look at things the way others do. You are not of this world. See with the eyes of the spirit, then you would know the type of response you should have.
All these years, no matter what country or city you're in, that you have had liberty to worship God and praise him in a church... To attend crusades, beautiful meetings... How do you think they came about?
They came through a deep struggle; prayers, faith, determination, passion of other men and women.
So we inherited liberty to worship God, to gather and serve him in the great congregations and sing his praise. 
Those who fought to make this happen, even died doing so
The Christianity that we have today, didn't come on a platter of Gold. .not only did Jesus give everything and sacrifice himself for us, I'm talking of those who communicated his message to us down through the years. 
Read church history and find out what the church went through. How did this message of Jesus Christ get to you? It got to you through the blood, sweat, tears and passion of other men and women because they believed it with all their heart and nothing was going to stop them from giving it to the next generation...the same faith that they received. 

It takes spiritual dullness to not know what is going on in the spirit. To think that there was no problem... It was just about a virus...
No major crisis takes place in the world without spiritual undertone. Don't deceive yourself.

2 Chronicles 20: 1- 
Jehoshaphat was the King of Judah at the time. 
When he heard the news, he called for fasting and prayers for help from the Lord. 
(That's why we have been consulting the biggest and the greatest- GOD HIMSELF)
God gave us the liberty to worship him and freedom to gather and we can sense that some want to take it away from us. So we began to pray and call on God. 
V15-25
Praise is fitting.
We give the Lord praise for his Mercy endures forever 
The scriptures cannot be broken and it's before the Lord that we rejoice and give praise. The whole Earth...all the nations..belong to God. Power belongs to Him.
He hears and answers prayer. 
We prayed... He heard and the enemy was discomfited. 

Remember the prince of Persia... The devil appoints princes over nations. But God also has his own princes. 
The prince who the devil placed in charge of this has been brought down. He is unable to carry out his work. He and all the princes that worked with him. ... And He can't rise again till we are done. His work has been utterly shattered. 
The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. The whole world belongs to Jesus Christ. 
That's why we are praising God. For he alone is worthy of praise and adoration. 
He alone is God. 
The faithful God. 
The only true God. There's none but Him. 

Worship session: Eben
We worship your name.
Without Borders.

Tomorrow we fast for the final day.



## Global Easter Service:
Day 7, Week 2. 
My Notes~1866

Pastor Chris:
The Jesus we talk about is alive. 
You heard the words of the angels when they spoke to the women and said 'He is not here. He is risen as he said'.

The angel asked ' why do you seek the living among the dead'?.

At Easter time, we celebrate the death, burial and resurrection of  our Lord Jesus. Because that's when it happened. So, every year we celebrate it. 
At this time, I want us to remember many of God's people around the world who are persecuted for their faith in Jesus Christ. 

You know we are in a very special period. Just yesterday in Kansas, there was a judgement given forbidding churches in that state from meeting because of the covid-19. 
The issue is the threat that came from the judgement. That if anyone went to church, he could be given a Jail term of One year or more.
That should say something. 
If the Governor and those with her are thinking about jailing someone for going to church for a term of at least one year.... What does that tell you about what they think about going to church post covid-19. This means they are don't plan for churches to meet .
But we are not ignorant of the devil's devices. .
That case was not necessary but they wanted a place to start. The legislators were even ready to settle out of court, but the Governor knew she could get a judgement on her side because of how the court is constituted. 
She took it to the state supreme court and got the judgement. 
That judgement will become a reference for other states...but in the name of Jesus, that case will be squashed. It will not survive. It is only for a time.

The devil wants to take advantage of this situation. Let us not sleep as do others. 

Where is the true church? It's times like this that prove  and when you discover the true church. 
Who thinks that this is good? Vs who is seeing with the eyes of the spirit? That's how you know. Its not difficult.

Those without the true spirit of Christ are never persecuted. Often they would be on the same side as the perpetrators, so they become collaborators.

Today, we will pray for those being persecuted. 
Today ends a phase of the fast, so we will still celebrate our victories. 

Isaiah 62:1-6-7
We are not dealing with Israel or Jerusalem physically. We are looking at it spiritually. 

Years ago, as a teenager, I would pray with these scriptures for the church of Jesus Christ around the world. This is so important. What we are seeing today is a reminder of many things that the Lord has told us in his word. 

From this Wednesday, all pastors and ministers will fast and pray for the churches of Christ around the world and for ministers of the gospel around the world for 7 days. 
The bible talks about the apostasy that's coming and the great falling away of the faith. So we need to fast and pray. 

Pray for Gods people. 
Pray for Gods church..
Nothing will dampen their faith.
They will be strengthened and encouraged by this message of resurrection. 
Nothing will weaken them.

There are some people who have never heard of the Rapture of the church. 
Today we will discuss it from a certain perspective. 

Someone said they heard the Rapture is a Hoax. All they read in the Bible was about Jesus coming again. 
We have a lot of Christians today who really never studied the bible. They just use the search Engine.
You will not find the word 'Rapture' in any verse. 

1 Cor 15:51-
Paul is writing to the Corinthian church. Most don't understand this because its a mystery: divine revelations and esoteric revelations that Paul brought to the church. 
In the days of Jesus in the earth, the disciples knew nothing about the gentiles coming into Christ. In all the discussions that Jesus had with them, they didn't have a clear understanding that it would happen. There were many things that Jesus didn't talk about. He said 'I have many things to tell you but you can't receive them now, but when the Holy spirit of truth comes, he will teach you all things'.
He said he would build his Church but the disciples thought it was. Jewish church. To



## My Notes
Phase 3, Thursday eve, Day 2~1885

Pastor Chris:

I would like to encourage all ministers of the gospel to give half an hour in every day to join our prayer chain during this phase of the fasting. Please indicate online. 

Q&A Session.

What we are discussing in the book of Revelation is so important. Apart from when certain references are made in the book of Revelation, its very rare to have someone take you through the book of Revelation. 
I'm doing this now because this is even more urgent. We are speeding much closer to the coming of the lord.

Q: What is Judgement day? When will it take place? Will it be after the saints return to the earth? Who will be Judged?

A: Its a day of reckoning of activities and you will be given your just reward. 
The judgement of sinners will be because of what they didn't do (not accepting the Lord Jesus).

Revelation 20:7-13
It takes place after the millennial reign of Christ, after Satan is loosed. 

While we are here on earth living for the Lord, there are different Judgements. God tells us  if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged. He tells us to examine ourselves if we are in the faith. He expects us to judge ourselves and get in line. Jesus was Judged for the world and you believed him, so you accepted his Judgement on your behalf... So there is no Judgement for you. But that presupposes that you walk in the light. 
The Christians have 2 phases of Judgement.
1. The Judgement seat of Christ- We are before the Lord and he determines our rewards. We are all going to be praised but some more than others. 
He will also judge our motives. If our works stand the test of fire, we would be rewarded ..if not, we suffer loss. 
2. The Judgement of Sinners: We will be with the Lord Judging all the sinners. We will be sitting on thrones along with Jesus.
We will also judge angels.  And when we are done, all those whose names are not in the book of life will be cast into the lake of fire. 

Q:  will the earth be the same countries during the 1000 years? Will we recognize ourselves after the rapture?
What will the elect be doing on earth in the 1000 years?

A: We will be reigning together with Christ as kings on earth.
The earth will be the same. Same countries. Etc.
We will recognize ourselves after the rapture. 

Q: Is there a specific number of people that will make the first flight? 

A: God knows everything and is very organized but since it is not revealed, we leave that to him.

Q: why did Jesus tell Nicodemus to be born again when he had not died and risen? 

A: Jesus will not require us to do something that is not possible for us to do. 
As at when Jesus was here, no one could receive eternal life because he had not yet resurrected. 
John 3:3. He was letting the man know about the kingdom of God, not instructing him.

Q: Please explain further on how to present ourselves a living sacrifice unto God.

A: 
What do you exist for? Set your affections on things above. We no longer live for ourselves. 2 Cor 5:14. 
Our thoughts and actions must align with the word of God and our purposes must align with God. Even Jesus when praying wanted the cup to pass over him, but ended by saying 'let your will be done'. Same way we have the mind of Christ and not a will of our own.

Q: I'm having challenges in the Love walk especially in relating with my husband. I find it difficult not to answer back to him. I feel it will prevent me from joining the first flight. 

A: Roms 12:1 (MSG). Consecrate everything that has to do with you to the lord. Do EVERYTHING  in the name of the Lord. 
Renew your mind, take on the language of God and answer properly. Hold yourself in. Eph 4 shows several things we should do. It gives amazing latitude to the ability of the spirit filled Christian to do the right thing. 
While we are on earth we are being trained on the eternal principles of faith hope and love. This is a phase of that training... To imbibe the principle of loving her husband. 
She should also listen to messages/the word of God. Give the word attention. It will help you mold your character. You



## PASTOR T. T EDUN~1888

One of my favourite activities is a habit that Pastor Chris sowed and nurtured in us (CEC Members) in our formative years. 
Till this day, I find myself doing it regularly

This habit is reading and studying bible characters.

There's so much to 
1. Enjoy 
2. Learn 
3. Pray
4. Emulate 
Whenever I study a bible character

For example, Samson was such a feelings ruled person. 
He always always did whatever he felt like doing.

He didn't have principles. 
And he exemplifies the gifted and talented person who is ruled by his feelings. 
Attractions. Sex. Hunger. Whatever he felt like, he did it. 
I read about Samson in my 20s. I learned that talent without discipline will not produce success. 
Discipline involves setting rules for yourself and doing the rules even when no one is watching.

Many prophecies have been wrecked by the lack of character ie fruit of the spirit.

Make your bed.
Clean your room.
Brush your teeth. 
Wear clean clothes only.
Wear fresh clothes only.
Wear clean underwear even though only can see them.
Wear clean bras only.
Wash your bra.
Wear clean singlets/vests.
Wear clean underpants. 
Wear fresh underpants. 
Wear clean socks.
Wear fresh socks.
Clean your wig. 
Change your hairstyle b4 it begins to itch you.
Stop scratching your head with a comb. Wash it.
Stop slapping your head.

Do things not because you feel like it. Do things because they're what should be done

Don't stop because you're tired.
Only stop because it's finished. 
Be done because it's done.

Little disciplines like dressing your bed when you wake up.
Cleaning your room. 
Cleaning your bathroom everyday. 
Washing your underwear daily. 

Little disciplines like these will make you consistent in the ensuring that big deals are done

Big deals like praying. 
Reading your bible. 
Avoiding lazy people etc

Many people don't realise the importance of praying daily. In tongues. At least a cumulative total of 30 minutes daily. May 2 sessions of 15 minutes each. 
Disciplined consistent speaking in tongues.

Long ago I noticed that the greater number of world changers in scriptures were singles.

Jacob 
Joseph 
David 
Daniel 
Paul 

Of course, our Lord Himself, Jesus the Christ

It make me think marriage is wrong but it made me realise that marriage wasn't and isn't a step up in levels. 

Marriage is only a different kind of living that must not distract or extinguish my world changing vision and life

Samson was meant to change his world but a zest for sex; an unbridled desire for sex curtailed his life

Samson was blind by choice before he became blind by force.

Romans 8:5
For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.

Romans 8:6
For to be CARNALLY MINDED is DEATH; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace

Romans 8:7
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

Romans 8:8
So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

What is it to be CARNALLY minded?

To understand it, you have to understand the meaning of carnal. 
It means relating to the physical feelings and needs of the body

So be carnally minded means to prioritise the physical feelings and needs of the body.

Note that it's the physical feelings b4 the physicalneeds. 
Every thing begins with feelings. 
Hunger. Crying. Sex. Inferiority etc it begins with feelings.

The carnal mind prioritises the satisfaction of these feelings above all else.

That was Samson.

Note the scriptures say this mind is an enemy of God. 
Why would you, a born again tongues talking inspired saint, choose or yield to be an enemy of God?
How does that happen?

The carnally minded saint cannot be subject to the law of God. 
Which law?
The law of life.

Romans 8:2

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from death and the law of sin

So the carnally minded saint, though he/she has eternal life, shall die

What's the way forward?
We must live our lives in the way that Samson never did.

Colossians 3:5

## My Notes
Phase 3, Friday Evening, Day 3~1890

Pastor Chris:
The book of Revelations is a complex but very interesting book. This is an opportunity to understand it. 

Q&A:

Q:  1Thess 4:16 talks about the sound of the trumpet. Will it be audible to believers or everyone? Will we hear it by Faith?

A: It will be Audible to Christians. Its for those who will be caught up and those who are dead in Christ. Our lives as believers is by Faith, so it will be by faith. You  trust that when it sounds you will hear it because the word of God told you so. Faith comes by hearing. 
John 17:14-15. Jesus was specifically praying for the disciples here. Not the church. 
For the Rapture, Jesus is coming for us.

Q: For one to be on earth you need a human body. When we return after the tribulation, will we have new bodies or the ones we had from birth?

A: We will have a glorified body. Our bodies will be changed. 1 Cor 15:51-52.

Q: what will happen on the day we are raptured? 

A: That day is not going to be such a beautiful day for a lot of people. For some it is a blessing; for others it is a curse. Any christian who is left behind is simply because he wasn't for the Lord but for himself. Period. 
Its one way or the other. 
Anyone left behind will have to go through the tribulation. 
Luke 21: 31-36.

Q: what kind of body is the glorified body? When we come back for the millennial reign, Will it be with angelic bodies without feelings?

A: A glorified body is a celestial body...its the same like Jesus has now. The bible says when we see Jesus we shall be like him. 
The terrestrial body is limited to this earth. It relates to our 3 dimensional world. 
The glorified body has come into the power and glory of the kingdom of God and has the capacity to function in the heavenlies. It goes beyond the terrestrial atmosphere.
Jesus walked through the walls. He ate with the disciples. Jesus Body when he died was covered with clothing material... But he folded the clothes when he ressurected...Yet the disciples saw him DRESSED. he didn't go to his house to get clothes. When Mary saw him, he was going to the Father to present his blood but he was in a body. When he came back to meet his disciples in Galilee, they touched him. They felt his glorified body. 

REVELATIONS CONT'D

We got to the 6th seal yesterday. 

Dan 11:45
The Antichrist breaks his treaty and moves into the temple by force.

Rev 6:12-17. (The result of the 6th seal)
Prior to this 6th seal some things happened
The 144k Jews, the Sun Clothed woman and the 2 witnesses come into play at the second 3 and half years. 

Pls note that some parts in the book are not in Chronological order. 

Chapter 7:1. This is right after the 3rd seal (Chapter 7 is not chronologically after chapter 6. It is a parenthetical narrative)
The 3rd seal was the black horse. Inflation and destruction of plants. 
7v1-3 is what was causing it. 
V3: who are these servants of God which suddenly emerge?
(When you are born again, once you receive the holy spirit. You are sealed by the Holy Ghost).
V4- 8  - 144,000 were sealed from the 12 tribes if Israel. They are carrying out ministry preaching to the Jews. 
When fierce persecution begins, they are taken away. 
V9-15, 14:1-6. The 144k were raptured to heaven
More souls are saved on earth as preaching intensifies. 
14: 14-16 (this period is close to the end of the second 3 and half years. The tribulation saints get raptured here). This is the reaping of the saints/multitudes seen in Chapter 7:9. It is not a sickle of Judgement.
James 5:7-8. Rev 7: 9-14.
There's a huge difference between these ones and the souls which were under the altar without robes. These are resurrected  and translated souls.
Rev 14:17-19
Jesus had the 1st sickle. 
An Angel has the second sickle. He has power over fire. This is different.
This is very close to the end of the three and half Years. That's the period that some of the most devastating things will happen on this earth.

Chap 8: 1
The Seventh Seal
There was silence in heaven for half an hour. 
Is it figurative? (Note the consistency with a pr



## My Notes
Phase 3, Saturday Evening, Day 4~1894

Pastor Chris:
God's grace is at work in this house, in this church. Satan will not lord it over us. He will not determine how and when we worship. HE WILL NOT. 
The virus has expired!
If they let the people go out and enjoy simple sunshine, you will see it. 
When we are through with this week that we are into, there are certain things that will begin to happen. Thosd things are just waiting for us to conclude this week. 

The Lord Jesus gave us all authority over demons to cast them out and cure diseases. And we decree cleansing into every nation.  Cleansing by the Holy ghost of the virus. We cleanse the air of this evil pollution. We destroy it's works and it's effects in the name of Jesus Christ. 

If you suffered some symptoms in your body, DON'T FEAR. The symptoms are gone from you in the name of Jesus. 
Christ has given us Dominion over all things. 
These things are not natural . They are not the works of God either. But Jesus gave us power...and we have to use that power. Infact, we are using it right now. 

When Jesus confronted the demons in a man that was possessed, they spoke to Jesus 'we know who you are. Have you come to torment us before the time?'.
They made a legal plea. Trying to stop the Master. 
That's what they do. They like moving before their time. Like now, we are seeing the manifestation of the ANTICHRIST spirit. It is not difficult to see his works. 

Today, we will study from chapter 13 and see what the Bible says about the ANTICHRIST. 
We have to be wise, with the wisdom of God. The wisdom of men is foolishness before God. Christ is made to us wisdom from God. 

When Pilate and Herod spoke to Jesus asking 'are you a king?' Pilate felt he had the power to release Jesus or condemn him to death.
Jesus response was amazing. He was cool, calm and quiet. 
He said 'you don't have any power over me at all. The father gave me power to lay my life down and take it up again'.
To think that this Jesus was God manifested to us in flesh....he knew what was in Pilate, in Herod ...but yet he was quiet. 

REVELATIONS CONTD

RECAP OF YESTERDAY..
Yesterday, we talked about the 144k Jews, the sun clothed woman and the 2 witnesses. 

From chapter 10 to 11:14 is all a parenthetical discussion. It is not chronologically contiguous with chapter 9. It's like a side talk. 

A complex area is the 6th seal because when it is open, it actually is the end of the tribulation period. What happens from then on is severe Judgement. 
God's wrath is poured out on the earth. From then on, the people cannot repent. The more the Judgement, the more they hated God. By then, all God's preachers and saints are gone. 

E.g. the Armageddon begins from the 5th trumpet and it's not a one week fight. That period will be full of wars. The Antichrist, even though he would be in the world, he wouldn't really be ruling everyone like that. He would have some opposition and infact, that would be the reason for the war. 

Revelation 12:1-6
This was a sign/symbolic. 
Red dragon: Satan
Woman: Israel
Male child: Christ (Jesus and his church)
 Satan wanted to destroy the church but he couldn't. (Parenthetical narrative).
V9-12 : Satan has no more place in the heavenlies. He is cast out though He used to function as the prince of the power of the air. 

What happens in the earth has a lot to do with what happens in the heavenlies.

Don't forget, early in the 1st 3 and half years, there was a war with Russia against Israel (the farthest North from Jerusalem).

Matt 24:15
When the Antichrist breaks the treaty and moves to Jerusalem, 

REV 12: 13-16.
While persecuting the Jews, it seems like they get some sympathy from others. The earth helped the woman by swallowing up the flood. This makes Satan angry and he makes war with the remnant of her seed. 
So much is going on at the same time... Religious, governmental, etc
Dan 11:40-..? The Antichrist moves to Jerusalem. 
Don't forget. . those attacked earlier still have claims to Jerusalem.
The king of the south: Egypt.
The king of the North: Russia
The Antichrist has



## My Notes
Phase 3, Sunday Evening,Day 5~1898

We are still in a period of deep prayer and fasting for Ministers of the gospel. 

Jesus taught us to pray and have results. 
In every crisis of life, we must always apply what we are taught in the word,And the ministry of the Holy spirit. And only through the word and the ministry of the holy Spirit can we know what's from God and what's not from him.
Sometimes we are even more direct in our prayer cos there are times when you pray that the Holy spirit directs your heart about things to deal with. 

Remember in the Bible when there was an insurection in Israel in the time of David. It happened that it was his son, Absalom that stirred up this insurection against him. David was praying hoping for God to intervene... And every day he learnt about some new group that had joined the other side... He was not moved...until he heard of one man who was related to be the wisest man in Israel. When that man spoke, his word was taken as though it was God's word even though he was not a prophet. And that man, Ahitophel joined Absalom. David felt it so deeply. So, David prayed and said 'Oh God, turn the counsel of Ahitophel into foolishness'. And God heard his prayer.b
Sometimes, we might be in a situation where those we relied upon would actually be on the other side.

In recent history, there was a Dr. Death in UK, USA and Australia.... (Not Dr. Kivokian) whose patients were mysteriously killed. Think about it....when your own doctor is the killer. 
We cannot forget such realities. 
That's why I still maintain that every nation should carry out his own research. E.g. U.K has decided to fund their own vaccine research by themselves.

Every other nation can be that smart.
Why would any other country rely on a vaccine coming from somewhere else and not have it's own regulators look into it. 
We need to also have a debate about vaccines. 
Science is discovery that is continually evolving. It must not be relegated to the choices of certain people. It is absolutely wrong for the WHO or any other body to hold nations to random by their own decisions. 

There are many doctors and scientists that DO NOT AGREE that vaccines are even helpful. 
Research historical records. 

Everyone is free to come up with something that can be tested to work. 

E.g. The Hydroxychloroquine and Zithromycin which some said will work was opposed by others who are saying we should wait for 18 months for their vaccine to be perfected. How can a nation just be WAITING ...for what? You may just be waiting for those whose desire is population reduction. It doesn't make sense.

Most Pharmaceutical companies are just in a race to make more money than others. How do they get it? The more sick people there are, the more money they make. 
Just like the media that says 'we don't make good news ..we only report good news'.

At this point, it's not about parties .. it is about asking yourself serious questions not about getting others to be happy with you. 

Now people are saying the virus 'escaped' from a lab... How? Anyway, the president of the USA is carrying out investigations on the $3.7m grant sent to a lab in Wuhan China in 2015. 
MORE WILL BE REVEALED SOON.


REVELATIONS CONTD
We seem to have forgotten  that Since the early church, there has been persecution of Christians. You will be shocked. It's almost 2000 years since then.
Read up about the Christian Matyrs who were killed for standing their ground for Christ. Some were burned at the stake. Some were beheaded. Some we're used for games... christians were brought out and fed to Lions. Some were buried alive. These were gruesome. 
But many don't know where the church has come from.
They were not just persecuted, but they were violently killed for their faith in Jesus Christ. Fellow men commanded their death.
That spirit has not left the world. 
Some think it's a distant thing... No it's not. 
Even before Covid-19, some Christians were placed in concentration camps... Laos, Eritrea...they may even be worse than North Korea but we won't know.
Christians have been reported to



## ng to a set time...not because it's a 2020 in the Gregorian calendar, but because it is a set time in the spirit. Serve God with Joy. Let nothing discourage you. You are doing the best Job in the world...serving Jesus.)~1979

🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

There is a collusion in the spirit and we only win.
The wicked shall bow at the gates of the righteous... And that is where are right now.
There are people who had no clue. They didn't even know what Satan's work was. 
But I knew, because the spirit's witness. 
But when you are ignorant, your information only comes from the media. You believe that all you see is all there is. 

Ephesians 6:14-16
Your Faith is important! Your faith is a shield. 
There are fiery darts, but with your faith, you will be able to quench them. 
V17-18

Observe again in verse 12 where he gives you the hierarchy of spirits. 

Colossians 1:16
He is writing to the Colossians using another terminology
Thrones
Dominicans
Principalities
Powers.
Here, he is not giving it to us in Order... Because he says 'whether'. 

Ephesians 1: 19- 21 Far above...principality, power, MIGHT (ability), Dominion... 
Here, he is not dealing with rank.
Power and Might means... Authority and the power behind that authority. (Exousia and Dunamis)

Why is this so important?

Because it helps you understand what goes on around you, in your life...city, country.. And around the world .
You know how to use what God has given to you and how to use it. 

The lowest Ranking of demons in their structure is Legion.. They  are 'heads of legions'... 
They head legions of demons 
(Ref Mark 5:8-13... This was his name, title and rank. The man had One major spirit with demons that were subject to him living in the man. Imagine the demons entered into 2,000 swine)
A legion is in thousands. 

Next to Legions is the Principalities: These control local authorities and institutions. 
In Ranking, They are first in the order.
Satan is interested in Human organizations. That's his business in the earth. While you are organizing people he is organizing his own structure. And there are more demons than humans. 

Next to Principalities, are POWERS; This Rank control Federal authorities, powerful NGOs that have the capacity of nations, very powerful cults, Nations.. 
It could be financial might or military might that they have (that's what Paul was talking about). They have the authority and the wherewithal to wreak havoc. 
When you are listening to any government authority...always listen beyond him or her to the spirit behind him
(Remember when the Rulers asked Jesus 'By what authority do you do these things?)

2 Chronicles 18:18-
2 kings wanted to go to war. 
They decided to consult with the prophet whether to go or not to. One wasn't really interested because he already had prophets around him who serve the appetites of men. (There are some prophets that like people of power ... Not necessarily false prophets). 
Now after these political prophets finished. king Jehoshaphat was still not satisfied and asked for the prophet that the king didn't like....

This prophet was called and broke forth into a prophetic revelation (like a sign with a clear message)
V18- 21
It showed that God wanted the fall of King Ahab. 
There was a spirit that was to lead Ahab into that War so that he would fall and there would be a change in the Kingship. 
In the realm of the spirit, Ahab was not discerning. He didn't know what was pushing him. He made consultation with the prophets (it can be political leaders. Friends. Cabinet). 
If a lying spirit could do that....how much more men who have no discernment. 

(So many men would say, I spoke to experts, etc... Just so as to feel good about a decision even though in their hearts they know the decision is wrong. 
NGOs are very powerful and could lead nations to destruction.)
( E.g. Revelations 17:3.
Leaders would give their power to the Antichrist because they can.)

Next Level:
Rulers of Darkness: Dominions that function behind the scenes. 
These control the deep state. 
They control profession cults. Industry cults. 
You could be in an indust

Phase 5, Tuesday, Day 1~2005

Pastor Chris:

I'd like to welcome you to today's program. I'm sure so far you've been blessed with the music, prayers and ambience of the spirit that you have been brought into at this moment. 

So much for us to look into in this phase of our series of programs and I'd like to let you know that we are doing these things as the spirit if God is inspiring, Leading and guiding us. 
The world belongs to Jesus Christ. 
I look at what's happening in our world today with Faith and with concern
Faith in Gods word; Faith for the continually victorious life irrespective of circumstances.. But deep concern for those who are ignorant of truth.
You look at the bible and there so much information on the price of ignorance. 

There's a lot of knowledge today in science and technology in comparison with the past, not in comparison to our potentials. Man has not yet risen to the best of his potential.
That's why its troubling when a scientist says his suggestion is the only way and there are no alternatives. 
Its an insult to the dignity of man 

A lot of what is happening is not science and lot of scientists are speaking up around the world.
E.g. I said the Lockdown is not science...now a lot of scientists and virologists have spoken up to say that the lockdown is not science. 

Stunning that everything we knew became like we never went to school. 
Now reports have come from several countries to say that the Lockdown didn't really achieve any real results from it. (Director of the FDA. In the USA).
It would be good for politicians. But we are dealing with saving lives....and those steps didn't save lives. Intact, they put lives at risk. This is the truth.

At the beginning of this whole quagmire, I did say it was time to VET THE TESTING.
Whoever said that the test kits were accurate when the virus was still under study?
Now several countries have cried out that something was wrong with their test kits.

(E.g..Spain seeks refund corona virus kits after replacement kits prove faulty). 

What is this idea that countries that were never supposed to have the virus are proving positive.. Isn't someone thinking?

Recently, Tanzania president sent animal samples... A goat, a sheep and pawpaw tested positive for the virus. Proof for him that the tests were a fraud. 

Its time to think!!!

I told you about state capture. This is so important because it is through politics of generosity. 
If you want to know if a state or country is under threat of state capture, find out 'who are the sponsors of its centres for disease control'? 
If it is not control solely by the country, then it is already a victim of state capture. 
He who pays the Piper dictates the tune.
After financing such countries, they would be empowered by law to run the country and dictate to them..

I read to you, the modus operandi of the Antichrist, how through peace, generosity and nice speeches would creep into the lives of people and then destroy many. 
When they believe they are secure, destruction comes.

How can those who have an ideology for population reduction produce vaccines to save your lives?
Think about it!
Isn't it clear?
They have stated clearly that the way to reduce population is through vaccination.
1. To reduce fertility
2. Through death.
HEARTLESSNESS!!!

When you hear people died and they are not close to you, it feels like numbers. It doesn't get to you. To make us hardened to this, we are not supposed to see the dead. They are to be buried by God knows whom.
These new bills and laws provided through the centres for disease control need to be properly studied before they are passed. 
And you will see many things that completely rob you of your rights as a human person.

Make sure you read the Bills. 
Some are horrible! That anybody would consider passing them to law....
Some countries have passed them and their lawmakers never read them.
Now they have sold their children and generations. 

This is state capture through politics of generosity.   Where we bow to those who seem to be giving us money or helping



## Your Love world
Phase 5, Wednesday,, Day 2~2010

Pastor Chris

Welcome to today's program..

Now there are several questions from many of you around the world.
I'll read 2 or 3 which *I will not answer immediately because the answers to these questions will come to you while we teach in the next few days.* 

Q: Is the Lake of Fire a real lake or is it symbolic.? 
A: It is real. Why its called a lake is because it's in the midst of other heavenly bodies that have nothing to do with it. Like a body of water...but its all fire inside. Its different from Hell. 

Q: Will a Gay that's a Christian and endorse Gods work be raptured?
Q:  What role will Africa play in the ministry (period) of the Antichrist?

I want to bring your mind to The questions the disciples of Jesus asked him.

Matt 24:1-3
When shall these things be?
What shall be the sign of thy coming?
What shall be the sign of the end of the age?

These are 3 different questions which will be happening at 3 different times in 3 different places. That's why in explaining these signs of the end times, I took you through different books. You would have known the coming of the Lord won't have happened 10 or 50years ago if you were studying the Bible.

Jesus actually described clearly what the signs will be. That's why I took you through these details to show you how close it is. I showed from the gospels and other parts of the Bible so that you'll see how definite Jesus was. There are other teachings that'll help you see the times and seasons and they show you how close His coming is, so that you know how to plan your life. 

I want to show you an old video of a man by name Pastor Carl Sanders who is responsible for the creation and design of a microchip. He was not a Christian when he created it and now he's a Christian but he's spent the rest of his life warning Christians not to take the mark of the beast.

(Video playout).

They would like to put the Chip in the head or in the hand... Think about that. 
In the last verse that talked about the grevious sore that could not be healed... It will be on the people who would take the mark of the beast 
This was confirmed by the scientist about the effect of the lithium in the body. 

Remember this is the guy responsible for designing the microchip
Tell me he doesn't know what he is saying. 
And this was 20 years ago...
Now think what has happened since then. 
The micro chip was said to be the most remarkable invention in the past 20 years. 
He has explained the connectivity with the body and the signals outside.

We ere not trying to stop those things from happening. They are going to happen. But we have to prepare Gods people and ensure that things happen in the earth according to Gods timing and season...(that's part of our calling and why we pray and intercede).
The things will happen but we have to warn and prepare Gods people. 
Noah warned people in his time but a lot of people didn't believe him. Only his family did. 
God didn't change his plans because only 8 people believed. He still destroyed the whole world save for the 8 and the animals they put inside the ark.

Everywhere you go today in this world, there is a sign.. The destruction of the world with water is evident everywhere. Every scientific evidence shows that it happened. All experiments have shown it and can determine the time when it happened. 
Archeologists also found remains of the ark that was built by Noah....where the Bible said it would be. 

Don't deceive yourself and think these things are just seasonal talks. They are reality.

Revelations 1-3 are preparing you for Chapter 4 onwards. 

Revelations 1:
John was in the island of Patmos. It was an island close to the location of the 7 churches. 
Patmos is currently a part of Greece.

That's where John was, banished to a prison there at the time of great persecution... and he received this Revelations there. God told him what to write. 

Vs10: The lords day was the day of the resurrection because the Lord resurrected on Sunday Morning.

Be careful of spiritualizing things if they are not meant to be spiritua



## u see the individuals as persons, the one million congregation means Nothing to God.~2013

We can be so big and so known and have BIG things to do that individual lives are not important to us. 
Only the large crowds and large platforms..
When Jesus sees that...he sees Ephesus!!!

And if you don't repent, he will remove the candlestick out of its place. 

What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his soul? 

When you become very big and you are so protected by security paraphernalia.. One could be in such a need and we would get insensitive to know what to attend to and what to ignore. But Jesus was not like that. He heard the cry of individuals. 
Would you be sensitive to the cry of that one individual that's difficult to see?

These are things that must come through your mind and ask the lord to show you those things you need to address.
Ask for a heart of love and where there is no person you don't love, where you value individuals  and give attention to the high and the lowly... The one gorgeously dressed and the one who looks ragged. 
Its up to you.
You would like the lord to think well of you .

Pray about your current condition and the guidance of the spirit in your life, for your pastors and your churches. 
Pray even for those who despitefully use you and persecute you.

Pray now.

Phase 5, Thursday, Day 3~2015

Pastor Chris

Welcome to today's program
The ministry of the holy spirit is indispensable and we thank God for the power of his word. The effect of truth in our spirits. 
We were created by God, by his word, and his word is truth.
Truth has an eternal effect on our spirits because that's our source.
And that's why falsehood. Deception, lies and lying destroy the human spirit. Lying is not consistent with your nature. You were created by truth.
You can live in truth and whenever you live in truth, you are triumphant, your spirit glows. You win. Because truth will always make you prevail. 
Truth will make you free. 
Man was created by God to be free. You cannot be bound. Truth is his true nature.
Think about that and its stern effect of success, Victory, health in your life.

 Daniel 7:24-25
(We have reviewed this area several times during this period)
That 'another that shall arise' is the beast, the Antichrist. 

But then, look at verse 25.

Not only will he have the intention to do this, he will have the power to do it. He will proceed to do it for a specific period ... During the great tribulation...for three and half years... AND THAT TIME HAS NOT COME. 

This is not the first time that Satan has made an attempt to take over the world but during the time, he will have power even over the saints, to do whatever he wants to do.
But he has a short time and he wants to start it ahead. And if we let him. He will do it.
Look through history, you will see he has done this several times before .

So we need to understand these things and walk in the light and wisdom of God and power of the Holy spirit enforce the will of the father in the name of Jesus.

"He shall wear out the saints of the Most High."
Why is that important?

What is means is that He will afflict the saints, harass them constantly.
So much evil till you get used to seeing it. 

This is Satan's Modus operandi. Its his strategy and way of doing things. 

2 Peter 2:6-7
Lot was the nephew of Abraham and he was vexed daily in seeing and hearing. 
We are in a certain situation right now...and what the devil wants is for us to adjust to a 'new normal' from him instead of saying NO WAY! 
He wants to be the one to determine how we live and how we worship. 
You can only serve God by his instruction. 

Cains offering was rejected because he brought an offering according to what he chose not according to what God asked them for (a burnt offering). 

It matters HOW we serve God. Don't get used to some new normal that Satan wants to put into your life. This is an attempt at the destruction of the church by Satan.
Learn to pray. Use what God has taught you. His word.. And you have to be persistent in your faith. 

From Monday 11th to 13th, we will have a global fasting and prayer all over the world. Old and young alike. (Tell as many of Gods people as you know).

While we have been achieving a lot in the spirit, there are 3 things I want to bring to your mind. (Prayer points)

1. Restraining the power of man to control this world with evil and violence. (Man has power. Make no mistakes about it). We have dealt with Satanic forces, but man as a being. Also has a capacity for evil especially after being under the influence of Satan, He would have acquired a nature of wickedness. .
2. To regain our rights as God has given us.... And those rights are consistent with the Bill of rights (which certain people don't want to recognize). They have been signed to by most nations of the world and are easy to understand that human beings have rights.
3. Fast and pray against the decrees of darkness to force us to live in the world of the beast before his time. (An environment, government or system, created by the Antichrist ahead of its time)

Listen!!! THIS MIGHT BE THE ONLY CHANCE TO MAKE THIS DIFFERENCE

Remember when there was a Decree in the days of Daniel, that every one must, for 30 days, only pray to the Nebuchadnezzar,  The King and not any other God.

And the Bible tells us that the officials who came together to plan this thi



## Your Love world
Phase 5, Friday Day 4~2022

Pastor Chris

Welcome to today's program.

The word of God is life. The word is truth.
And God's grace is manifested through his word.

I'm thinking about what's written for us in Ephesians 6:10. (A portion that we have reviewed again and again during this period)

He tells us to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. 

We are trusting in HIS MIGHT.

v11
He didn't say to stand against the power of the devil. 
It's about his WILES. 
This is so instructive. 
We must not overlook the importance of the information that God gives us here. 

He is talking about the strategies and deceits.
Satan's power is in DECEPTION.

Yesterday, when we talked about the church in Pergamos. I think I should take you back there, in Revelations 2:14.
The doctrine of Balaam:

Balaam was a prophet that was hired (because he loved the wages of unrighteous) by Balak the king of Moab, to curse Israel so he could defeat them. 

Some of you might know something about spiritual curses... it's like casting a spell on someone, that causes evil harassment in that persons life until he falls or fails. Something terrible happens to that one on whom that curse is placed. 

Every time Balaam opened his mouth to curse Israel, a blessing came out. 

Well, Balaam taught Balak what to do (that's the doctrine of Balaam).

He told Balak, 'you can't defeat  these people. They're going to be strong and their  God is going to help them against you.'

Balaam taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel. 
He said ...."the strategy is!;  you would cause them to sin against their God and their God would punish them. That's the only way".

That's how come they got Israel to mix up with the women of moab. They caused them to eat things offered unto idols and  to commit fornication with them.

God was angry with them for what they did and  sent a plague that wiped out 23,000 people. Think about that. That was the strategy.

The enemy could not defeat them as long as they were walking in righteousness.
I can tell you, it's the same thing with us; 
Satan has no power over us.
His power is in DECEPTION.
How much can the devil deceive you? How much deception can he place in your path?
How much are you ready for Satan to deceive you?
That would be your destruction
Remember the words of Jesus to us again and again.
'Be not deceived'
'Let no man deceive you". 

Ephesians 6:11
Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the deception/strategems of the Devil. 

V12:  a lot of times Human beings who are being used by the devil don't know that they are being used by the devil.

V 13-14.
The whole armor of God. 
Notice as we read. 
The kind of armor that He tells you to put on will tell you what kind of weapons the enemy has.

Loins girded with TRUTH: 
Did you ever hear somebody say 'I felt something in the pit of my stomach"?
When fear hits, that's where you feel it. 
But, if you've got truth at your loins.
it doesn't matter what they are trying to say, nothing shocks you.
His truth shall be thy sheild and buckler. 

But when you don't know truth, you get into a panic mode when something happens. 
But God says let your loins be gird about with truth. 
The word of God is truth.
The more of God's word you know the more truth you have.
Do you know the truth?

Someone can bring you some news, but what is Truth?

Truth is even beyond fact. It is reality. 
Fact is the way it appears 
Truth is what it really is.

E.g. what is the real color of these flowers that you see? Orange? Red? 
Whatever color you choose, it's not the real color. It's the color that is there with respect to the kind of light that falls on it. 
So the question is 'what is the true color'?
You can only know when the true light shines on it. 

And In this world, there is no true light. 
The Bible says the word of God is the true light.
Meaning, in this world, You will never know the real color of things.

Only Gods word is the true light. 
That's why Heaven is going to be so beautiful because you will see lights and colors



## Daniel 6: 1-~2040

There were 3 presidents; Daniel was 1 of them. The other 2 ganged up with the other princes against Daniel. 

They proposed a 30 day test. Look at the punishment in comparison to the offence. (To be thrown into the den of lions for praying to another God but the king).
It's about man's inhumanity to man.

A lady was beaten up by lock down officials recently for coming out to look for food for her little children. She was bleeding from being beaten mercilessly...The punishment was worse than the offence.

V8--9. A lot of times, political take decisions without knowing what's behind it. They don't ask the right questions. 

V10. If you were in Daniel's position, WHAT WOULD YOU DO???
Even if he tried to stop the policy, he would have been outvoted. 
He did what he knew to do... TO PRAY!!!
He didn't panic. He prayed. 

V11-15
I feel sorry for those in political offices or the army..and you are required to do something that is not right. What do you do? You've got to do what is right. 
You might lose your Job, but you have your conscience. 
If you join the others to do what is wrong, one day you will lose that Job. You entered one day and you will come out one day...cos there were others before you.
There is a God who takes actions. He knows how and when to do it.

In a certain country, where they felt they didn't have full control over the law enforcement, they gathered all the young rascals in the area and empowered them to whip people who were not obeying the Law ..
This is the exact modus operandi of the Antichrist.

In some countries, criminals are being released to 'prevent them from getting the virus'... Space was created  and they were being replaced by harmless citizens who were caught outside their homes. Why??? You can see it was never about protecting people from the virus!

In a country, some media houses were caught STAGING THE NEWS. all the shots of hospitals being overwhelmed because of the virus were a fraud. 

V15-16
The King in Daniel's day didn't know that this law would affect Daniel. He was displeased with himself.  But he was trapped by his own decree. 

(Read the rest of the story about Daniel's Deliverance... V22- end)

There is another story that's exactly like this. 
Matthew 14:1-
It's  got to do with Herod the King, and John the Baptist. 
Herod had tried to take his brother's wife, and John had told him it was wrong publicly. So John was arrested. 

V8-13
3 things to note here..
1. The king was sorry but had to do it because he made an oath (Just like King Darius was sorry).

How many people in public office have taken action against the church, their own brothers and sisters?

2. John was killed. He was not delivered. 

3. John's disciples told Jesus...and Jesus went away from there. 

Matthew 24:15-20
Jesus talks about what will happen in the great tribulation. 
What the devil has planned for the church at that time is to stir up trouble. AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME OF THE TRIBULATION.
The devil wants to frustrate the preaching of the Gospel and stop men from receiving salvation. 

For us as God's people, there are corrective measures we need to make. 
But aside from them, we were doing a lot of good things, but not watching.

V21
Tribulation such as the world has ever known
That is so much trouble!!! Affliction! Persecution! Anguish! Distress! With perplexity!
That will happen in the future, but Satan would like to give the church some of it right now...and by doing so, you find the gospel is frustrated. 

We have something we can use. We are not helpless. 
2 Cor 10:3-4
It doesn't matter how strong or huge Satan's citadel is. Our weapons are mighty through God. By the power of the Holy Spirit. 

Acts 16:25-26.. The Bible tells us how they used those weapons. 

What man cannot do, God can do!!!
These 3 days of prayer will cause changes!

The spirit of God is with us! We are engaged in a warfare and this is Satan's altar Versus God's altar.
We are either going to get our churches back, and our rights to preach the gospel, or we lose it forever!

## Global Prayer and Fasting, Day 3~2054

Pastor Chris

Welcome to today's program
Jesus Christ is Lord
He is greater than all and the whole Earth belongs to him.
All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. 

We have a very loaded program for you today. 
This is the 3rd day of our our 3 day fasting and prayer.

During this session tonight, we will pray and I will show you how we will pray 
We will use everything God has taught and There is NO CHANCE OF LOSING.

I have searched my Bible back and forth and I don't find any chance of what is going on right now around the world to succeed. It will not succeed!!!

Pastor Benny will be sharing with us something powerful which we really need at this hour. 

Pastor Benny Hinn

The presence of the Lord is very evident right now..and I want to talk to everyone about the importance of loving Jesus with all our heart.
I've been telling Jesus 'Give me a love I've never known or had for you'.
That's my heart cry. 

We love him because he first loved us. 
When we know his love for is it inflames our love for him.
Romans, Paul wrote.. for I know that nothing shall be able to separate us from the Love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
This love was displayed on the cross. So powerful was this love described in Psalm 22. 

Today we hear about people struggling mentally. People are afraid of the future. Their hearts failing them. 
But here's what the word tells us. 

Hebrews 12:1-3.
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith...

Here we have the secret of staying strong in the Lord that nothing can affect us. 

The only way that we are going to endure is to look ahead. Jesus looked ahead and saw the church. 

Psalm 22:1-3a
When you see his love for you, it will inflame your love for him and will burn away everything from our lives that should not belong there. 

Lately, I have gotten so deep into the scripture because I know how short our time is on earth. 
I read Joshua, and how Rahab spoke to the 2 spies about all they had heard about Israel and how their God brought them out of Egypt and divided the red Sea, etc .....I said 'Lord, I am so glad you are my God'. 
Oh the privilege we have to know him. 
God almighty does not forgive sin. He forgives the dinner. Sin had to be judged and destroyed. Jesus took upon him our sin. Sin was judged on the cross. 

Psalm 22:2
 Here you see the agony of Calvary.
V3: "....God's holiness is manifested at the cross. How hateful must sin be to God for him to punish it to the utmost when it was upon his son..."

God's full wrath was displayed when Jesus took our sin.
God turned his eyes away from.his own son who took the punishment.
What kind of love is that? The love of God. 

Now when you fall in love with him as you get to know him and his love.... you think about the love Paul described for the Lord....
Phil 3: 3-7
V7-10 that is a love so active, so inflamed. To give up everything he had known about his life was unimportant to Paul. He wanted to gain the knowledge of the Lord. 
Friends, family, everything... He counted as loss. 
We can't love Jesus with all our heart if we count other things. 
The heart belongs only to Jesus... No one else. 

V10, 13-14: Any one who loves Him will have this same cry. 
The things that are behind are easy to give up.
It's time to let go of people, family members, things of this life that are not adding to your life spiritually. Let the Lord have priority....Just Jesus!!!

When you Love the Lord, it's so easy to say No to the world and the flesh. To obey the word of God. 'come out from among them and be ye separate'.
Some find it difficult to leave family and friends.

3 years ago, God told me 'stop watching Network TV' and I have had so much peace. 

When that fire begins to burn within you, it burns everything out of you and Jesus becomes EVERYTHING. 

Psalm 22:6-19
Jesus endured the hostilities of men upon himself on the cross. Roman soldiers compassed him. His blood was shed. His face and body so marred.
V22-25 He made this declaration in the midst of that agony.
He



## at Satan had planned for the world by the power of the spirit.~2058

Let us see how this story ends...
Isaiah 10: 27
The devil cannot stand the anointing of God in the church. 
The Yoke shall be destroyed BECAUSE Of the anointing. 
For the power of God to come into operation, you have to recognize/acknowledge it. 
Something is happening in the realm of the spirit.  

"For the works of God shall be noised abroad. 
The works of men are made as nothing".

I told you in December that in 2020 there would be a collision of the advanced work of man with the work of God. 
And we got to this crisis point...
Like when the ark of God was captured and brought into the temple of Dagon. The philistines rejoiced... But  Dagon fell before the Ark TWICE. 

The devil has been unmasked and he has lost.
This church of the Lord Jesus Christ is the same church that the great apostles of the Lord were in, with the same HOLY GHOST and the same word of God. 
Hallelujah!!!!

The best news on earth is to know that the Lord's coming is near. We will leave here suddenly..and we won't have time to tell anybody Good bye. 
We are getting ready for that. 

If you love Jesus with all your heart, you will never go to Hell. 
You prove your love for him by doing his word. 
Beyond Hell is the Joy of Heaven.
The Joy of the Father's heart is the best of all. 

Psalm 149:6 -9
This is talking about the saints of God. 
We must praise God like never before. 
Everyday SING PRAISES TO GOD for the next few days. 
Our honor is to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of Iron.

PST. Benny
Abraham looked for a city whose builder and maker is God...
What Pastor Chris has been doing for days now is preparing you for the coming of the Lord..
These are the last minutes of the last days.
We are going to see the Lord. 
Our eyes shall behold him. 

With all that is happening around us, the heavenly realities are getting closer and closer. 

The world is getting panicky because of the virus, killer hornets, dead volcanoes coming active...the Bible already told us about these things but Look UP, because your redemption draws nigh. 

We need to start crying out from our inner being 'Even so, come Lord Jesus'.Global Prayer and Fasting, Day 3

Week 2: Day 9~2076

CULTIVATING A SPIRIT OF PRAYER
Pastor Chris Oyakhilome D.Sc, DD

There is a spirit of prayer and when I say a spirit of prayer, I am not describing necessarily a certain 'angel' or 'spirit' whose name is called prayer. That's not what I am saying! But it means when the Holy Spirit of God brings an overwhelming atmosphere and influence of prayer into your life. And what happens is you breath prayer. And when He does it, sometimes, it stays on you for months. It can stay on you for a year, even more. You just experience the spirit of prayer that rests on you and influences you over a period of time.

Now, does it happen when He chooses or is there anything we can do about it? Emphatically, yes! It's not just when He chooses to. No! It's when you invite by desire, that spirit of prayer. You invite by desire.
He said 'He will give to drink to a thirsty soul.' If you are thirsty, He will give to you to drink. So when you are thirsty for God like this, and you begin that fellowship of prayer, it won't be long before you discover the spirit of prayer. He'll bring that atmosphere into your life. He'll bring that influence into your life. You'll find that you are constantly praying, every now and then, he draws your heart into his thinking, into his motivation, into His plans and purposes. So He expresses Himself through you in prayer. How important that is!

And during the period that the Holy Ghost does this in you and through you, you'll know that you know that you know that something is about to be birthed; something is about to come out, to happen. So invite that spirit of prayer. You invite him by a strong desire, and by plunging yourself into Him as it were. It doesn't happen by you saying, 'LORD, I invite you.' You invite Him by your strong desire. If you want Him, He'll be found of you. That's what it means when He says, 'If you seek Him with all your heart, He will be found of you [Jeremiah 29:13]. It doesn't mean He is missing. It doesn't mean you are looking for Him somewhere. When you seek God, it's talking about a desire, a strong desire for God. A strong desire for His presence. A strong desire to have that fellowship with Him. A strong desire for His word. A strong desire for His influence in your life.

And the thing is; if you don't have it, you can't transfer it. You see it? And it's important that those who are around us have a hunger for God. We impact others with what we have. So every leader, every true leader must have it. You must cultivate it. It doesn't come by itself. You've got to cultivate it. The thing is, always His part to come to you. He'll stir you! He'll stir your minds and that's what He's even doing now. He'll stir your minds towards it but whether or not you are going to invite Him with your strong desire for Him is your responsibility. He'll always call your attention because He loves us and He wants us. He'll always call your attention. That's what He desires and He knows that's what you desire and all you have to do is act accordingly. It's the doing part that's left now. The doing part!

You know, there are some people who say, 'Well, the problem I have is that I am very lazy to pray.' That has got nothing to do with being strong or lazy to pray. It's a matter of a burden. If you have something that disturbs you, you'll pray. When you really want something, you'll pray.

Ever seen someone who is really tired.. so tired is unwiling to stand or move while you're talking to him to get up but won't because he's tired. .. and while you're talking, somebody shouts 'fire', and he jumps up even though he is tired. How could he do that? It's the desire to live. He doesn't want to die. He wants to live.

Let's talk about living spiritually. Imagine you have someone in a house with fire; you know you can save that one from fire. You rush to save his life. I'm sure you would want to do that, right? Why? Because life is important to us. You want to save him from dying. You'll do anything to get in and save him, bring him out of that place. That's the way we ought to be. B

## LEARN TO STIR THE POWER OF GOD WHICH IS IN YOU.~2139

Elisha the man of God so highly anointed died of sickness, Why didn't he use his anointing to get rid of the sickness. He had a very strong  anointing so much that when he died, the power in His BONES RAISED THE DEAD.

God proved to us that even though Elisha died of sickness the power did not fail, but it was Elisha who didn't apply the power in his own health.

## THERE’RE HIGHER PURPOSES OF PRAYER.~2362

There’re higher purposes of prayer. One of them is fellowshipping with the Father through the Spirit. 

Another higher purpose of prayer is the privilege to exercise our authority in Christ. There, you take your place of authority and cause things to happen within the ambits of the power given to you by Christ Jesus. 

Thirdly, prayer helps us to activate and walk in the consciousness of the divine presence. 

Fourthly, through prayer, we enforce the will of the Father in the earth.

Prayer is also the exercise of the human spirit.



## Your Love world Specials~2385

Season 2, Phase 3, Day 5

Opening Prayer session led by Pastor Emeka Ezeh.

Reverend Chris Oyakhilome

Pastor leads worship "You are beautiful beyond  description"

Welcome to today's program.

So much has been happening in the last we days. Thank God for all the beautiful things. 

A couple of days ago, we showed you a video of a certain doctor among certain doctors speaking about the availability of a cure for Covid 19.
So there's really a cure. 
And not only a cure, its also a preventative. Meaning that the same drug could prevent you from being infected by the virus as well as cure you.

There are lots of Doctors around the world who are boldly speaking out about the same thing.
Those who don't want you to know about it are also using it. 

Those of you in Africa should be wise and smart and know that you are on the agenda. 
Even if they gave it to everyone else they wouldn't want to give you because they believe your population is too much. 
Meanwhile, black people are still one eight if the population of the world (a minority). So why do they want you out? Because you are too smart. 

Already the colonial masters gave you a bad enough education; Just enough to make you subservient.

These things have only  thrived with the help of traitors. Which I call, a Trojan Horse. That's what helped apartheid: Snitches!
So it helped these colonies to remain under the power of those who kept them subdued a long time. 

Why can't Africa be allowed to produce their own medication and vaccines?
How many years should you be waiting for someone to help you?
It is shame and failure on the part of the leaders if vaccines need to be imported to help you. 
You need to come up with yours.

Isn't it a shame that leaders in Africa have to travel abroad for medical checkup?
You should be ashamed. You should have grown up. So what are all the universities we built for? Its about time we started thinking. 

And look at the brain drain. They take our best brains to Europe and America and now China and you don't care.
What kind of leadership that doesn't have a vision? We need leaders that have a brain, a mind.

As a young kid in the university, I made up my kind that I'd never go abroad to beg. And I never did. 

When will Africa put away childish things? Africa is old enough. 
At this time, every country in Africa that is still calling for help from other countries is a shame.

Why are you borrowing money from nations that don't have it?. They are only borrowing you money that they took from you. Wake up!!!

Secondly, there are those who think that TRUMP, the POTUS is hated by many Americans. He is not hated. They don't hate Trump. They hate those that he seems to support. So the real ones they hate are you who are Christians. Its got nothing to do with Christians. 
Before he started giving his voice to support Christians and Israel, he was a friend of the Left. 
If you are a Christian better know that. 
They hate YOU. 
And he seems to protect YOU, That's the problem. 
If he were to switch today and be against the church, they would love him.
The deep state doesn't care about the parties. 
(The party should not be called Democrats. Its a misnorma).

And its not their fault that they hate you. Satan is pushing them to hate you. If you don't believe this, it means you don't believe God or the scriptures. 

Today, I want to see how far we can go with our subject.

Matthew 2:1-
V3: they were troubled? That was the deep state. Hero's was troubled because his office was in trouble. He realized that he couldn't pass his throne to whomever he wished. 
Herod was troubled as all the deep state is troubled right now all over the world. And rightly so!
V4-5
The chief priests and scribes knew where Christ should be born. 
(All the scribes in the medical world and government world. All know the cure for Covid 19).
They quoted the scriptures. They knew the answer. Didn't they know that Christ was the solution to all their problems? 
They were quoting the Prophet. They knew!!!
This would be the solution... And they hated him for it

## QUESTION:~2407

Is listening to worldly Music a Sin?

PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME:
Well, all music has a message. No matter what music you are listening to, if it is music it has got a message. Even if you are just listening to some instrumental, it’s got a message.

Music goes to your spirit because music comes really from the realm of the spirit. So, it always sends a message consciously or unconsciously into your spirit; sooner or later you would go in the direction of that message that you’ve been listening to. So, that’s where the danger is, if you keep listening to the carnal music that has gotten the wrong message, after a while you will act in that direction.

Just remember there is a message behind every music, so it matters what message you are sending down to your spirit because you are going to become sooner or later the character of the message you have been listening to.

So make a choice! That’s why we tell Christians to be careful what music you are listening to. Listen to God’s kind of music only.

## Your Love world Specials
Season 2, Phase 4, Day 3~2428

Opening Prayer session by the Esteemed Pastor T.T. Edun

Rev Chris Oyakhilome

I want to welcome you to today's very special program. I always remember those last words of John Wesley where he said 'The best of all is God with us'. That's the most important place to be. Where God is. 
And his precious scriptures given to us that have been proved again and again to be truth.
When we study the word, we know the mind of God;  we have direction. No guess work. No ambiguity. Its clear. 
And he gave us his Holy spirit to help us understand the word. 

He said to Joshua "as I was with Moses, I will be with thee...". How important that is.
There are just something's nobody can teach you. how do you teach someone how God talks to you?

"I will not fail you or forsake you. Be strong and very courageous". And I kept it from that day to this day.  

Gods word is dependable.

It matters what you are listening to. You have to understand that we are in a warfare, whether you know or are conscious of it or not. 

Jesus taught his disciples that Satan was a real person; that demons were real and not a myth. He proved it by casting out demons. He addressed them. The response proved that he was talking to real personalities. When he said 'Come out of him thou unclean spirit'.. The man was restored. 
The spirit spoke back to Jesus. Proving Jesus was actually talking to a real spirit.

Jesus rebuked a deaf spirit (it makes somebody not to hear..... Because everything can hear God/the spirit of God).

I said to a deaf-mute (born deaf). I said 'now in the name of Jesus you'll Start hearing me' and he hears. 
That spirit has got to be real that caused the deafness because I didn't call for any healing or such. 

They heard me because I was using the authority of the name of Jesus. 

Gods word is real. You can depend on it. In the spirit realm, words are very important.

We are in a warfare and you have to understand it. You win or lose in the spirit realm before you see the result in the earth. 

Several of the proponents of the one world government and one world economy actually belong to several cults. They have to.
These cults are known. They come by different nice names. Those at the Junior level don't know that they are in a satanic organization. And they offer sacrifices to demons. 

You would not know because they wear nice suits, etc...but they offer sacrifices in the spirit.

Years ago, they used to do these secretly, but now they are big public organizations which head hunt young intelligent people and many join them innocently. You attend their conferences, excited to be with them etc. But as long as you are in the Junior level. You don't know what they do. And a lot don't even care. 
Some of the brands that you love so much and love to identify with... Until they offer sacrifices to demons before the sale, they don't go out. Its after they sacrifice they disseminate. 

There are some successful people in the world who tell you that they owe their success to Lucifer. 

For those that join such cults, the higher you go, the more dedicated you become. Your soul is involved. You realize you are now part of something you cannot come out of. 

Imagine, people like this are in political office. A lot of them belong in these cults. They are so bound, they don't know how to come out. 

I tell you this because SATAN'S SIDE IS A LOSING SIDE. YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW IT. All he's out for is destruction.

(Quotes by Richard Gardner on New world Order. April 1974 issue. CFR Journal. Page 558)
He said they will erode national sovereignty piece by piece. 
The Plan is there. 
This has been their best opportunity yet. 
Its a time where they have so many world leaders under their umbrella. 
They brought a lot of them into their club. For some it was with negotiation, intimidation or elimination. That's what they've done to several of them making them cave in. 

Those governments that refused to lockdown or do masks, their economies are doing well.
But for the rest who were just waiting for the media (who ar

Season 2, Phase 4, Day 4~2434

20:8:2020

Rev. Chris Oyakhilome

I want to welcome you to today's program. 
Oh glory Hallelujah!

I want to read a couple of verses to you. 

John 1:4. 
He is talking about the word. 
I want you to remember that John was telling us a story of the word. 
So you see the use of the past tense. He's telling is what the word was before he became flesh. (V14)

The word was in the beginning, and was with God before he became flesh. 
V5: It says' and the light shines in darkness'.. (Present tense)
The word 'Comprehend' means to seize, attain, overcome (katalambano)
The darkness could not understand, or comprehend the mystery of light and still hasn't. 
No matter the thickness of the darkness, it cannot advance against the light. Its impossible. 
Even if the light is small, the darkness cannot overpower it. 

The light has never stopped shining. 
The darkness couldn't take a hold of the light.

When Jesus said 'You are the light of the world, He knew what he was talking about. You need to come to the realization of who you are in Christ. 

The prayer that we lead you in praying here, is just to initiate... Cos we are just teaching you. But that not all the praying that you have to do.

For what we are up against, you are going to have to give more time to prayer beyond what we pray here. 

Some of you would like to hope that Elijah just commanded that there would be no rain... But he did more than that.

James 5:15-16.
V16 is best rendered in the AMPC version.
The earnest, heartfelt, continued... There us a persistence. 
Jesus taught us about persistence in prayer. 
Jesus prayed in the Garden for an hour. 
The bible showed us so.
He persisted because he understood the stakes. He understood that it was about the future of generations and about eternity for those who had gone by. 

It makes tremendous power available. When you now know that the power is available then you speak...you prophesy. 

V17- 18: Elijah was just like us in our everyday walk. 
He prayer earnestly. 
How He prayed the first time is how he prayed the second time. 
The Bible shows us how he prayed the second time. 
He fell on his knees and prayed with his head between his knees. .
This is actually the shortened form of what he did. 

This teaches us about persistence in prayer. 

V18-
The heaven responded and the earth produced result.

Elijah asked Ahab the king of Israel to get all of the prophets of Baal together and being them to the sacrifice. He said 'If Baal is God, then follow him'... In his prayer he said 'oh God, let these people know that I do this at thy word'.

This means that when he prayed about the rains, he was guided by the Lord ..not by some selfish purpose.

I'm concerned that when we lead you in prayer here, you may just take off and think 'we have prayed'.. But, its not enough for this kind of thing.

There is a certain type of preparation that is necessary for some kind of things 
The kind of impact you want to make in the spirit, will be determined by the seriousness that you put into it by prayer. 

When we leave here, Give more time to prayer. We can't do all that we need to do on screen. 

Plan a prayer schedule. Especially ministers of the gospel. The stakes are very high.

The Antichrist will only be given three and half years and will do extraordinary things. Jesus said that except those days are shortened no flesh will be saved. 

Doesn't that tell us that we can also do so much good in the same space of time?
We can shake this world in the next three and half years.
Jesus isn't going to snatch us away because we are losing. 
Jesus is coming for a victorious church. 

Jesus ministry was for only 3 years. Probably with about a week or two extra.
When he started his ministry; few days after... Right from the baptism, It was the passover (the first passover in the ministry of Jesus). John 1&2

Then John 6: we see the second passover. 
The Chapter 11'12'13: it was the 3rd passover by which Jesus was crucified. 
That's 3 years...not three and half years. 

Some people have been asking



## ds wasn't prayer. They were thinking of where to hide. Their foundation wasn't deep.~2436

Paul said we will give ourselves to the ministry of the word and prayer. 

Most ministries just have kindergartners. Their foundation isn't deep. 
But Jesus has prayed for you that your faith fail not and by Gods spirit you are going to be so strong, so tough in the name of Jesus. 


John 1:9 ESV
The darkness could not overcome the light 

Ephesians 2:6.- Joint Seating with Christ! That's amazing!!!
He raised us with him from the dead and has enthroned us with him. 

Romans 5:17... 
To reign.. Means TO KING. 
Death 'Kinged' by one. 
We shall also 'King' in life by One Jesus Christ. 

If God is going to effect a change, you have to do something that is not consistent with the status quo. 

When you say 'God I want to have a different leadership'. Leaders are a character of the character or the nation. So what you do is to start praying for the nation. 

The change is possible but you would have to going into supplication for all men. 
But we are too distracted by many things, then Satan comes in and robs us of many things. You wonder why there is so much corruption. 

Even Jesus walked away from the temple and said he wouldn't return until they said 'blessed be the name of the Lord'. 

Eph 2:1-2, 1 Cor 2:12
There is a spirit of the world,.. Its the same spirit at work in the children of disobedience (UNBELIEF).
This word describes something that is very similar with the spirit of the Antichrist 

2 Thess 2:7 AMP
Rebellion against divine authority. 
Apethia: It is a defiant opposition to Gods word. 
Eph 2:2.. The children of "Apethia"/ Unbelief.
They just find themselves hating the things of God. 
They just hate Christians. 

Who are you to like or not like? What do you think you are? You have the guts to dislike someone?
Maybe when you realize that you are not so big, you are just one in Many, you will be thankful that you have a name. .Someone was responsible for your being where you are. Who do you think you are? The earlier you humble yourself the better. Repent!!!

Children of rebellion! Defiance! 
These forces work in such people 

1 Cor 2: 6-8 (AMP)
Those political leaders didn't have divine wisdom. 
THE LEADERS AND RULERS OF THIS AGE ARE BEING BROUGHT TO NOTHING AND ARE DOOMED TO PASS AWAY. 
That's very instructive. 

Eph 6:12. These are not human beings. 
We are in this world, but right over this world is a kingdom of darkness which super impose on the rulers of this world.

That's why we need to intercede for the leaders of this world. 
God is not a killer. He is not destructive. 
These destructive things that they have done, they were moved by Satan.

Luke 22:53
For example, at the arrest of Jesus, he know that the power of darkness was behind it. 

Colossians 1:12-13
You are either under the power of darkness or in the kingdom of Gods dear son..by being born again and transferred. 

2 Cor 4:3-4
When you preach the gospel there are some that don't understand because the god of this world has blinded their minds. (Satan/the Prince of this world).

How are you going to exercise dominion over these forces?

2 Cor 10:3-4
We don't war after the flesh even though we have a physical body. 
He isn't calling us the foot soldiers. We are those in the strategizing area. We are using unseen weapons. The launch pad of unseen Weapons is words. 
And the angels of God and the spirit of God takes those words and use them.

The weapons are mighty THROUGH GOD to the pulling down of fortresses. 

He is thinking here about what happened at Jericho. 
They uttered words. Shouted the praise of God, and the walls fell down flat. 

The red sea was split wide open with a blast of Gods nostrils. 

Paul and Silas sand praises to God and there was an earthquake in the prison.

God is able to do exceeding abundant above All that we ask or think according to the power that works in us. 

V5: (AMP) he speaks metaphorically.
EVERY high thing that sets itself up against the knowledge of God...
We have weapons to destroy their fortresses/their security/Where



## Your Love world Specials
Season 2, Phase 4, Day 6~2443

Opening Prayers by the Esteemed Pastor Emeka Eze. 

Rev. Chris Oyakhilome

Song: HOW GREAT THOU ART. 

Welcome to today's very special session. 
I've got some things to share with you.

Yesterday I shared some thoughts with you in connection with our very important ministry as saints of God.
Everyone of us that's born again is a priest of God. That is in fulfilment of Gods plan for the ages. 

1 Peter 2: 9
Royal priesthood means "King priests". That's very important. 
He didn't say its a promise. When you were born again you were born into this order. 
Remember, Jesus came into this world according to the order of Melchizedek the King Priest, Not Levi or Aaron. 

If you don't know what God says about you, you will never rise to your responsibility, and you will be blamed for not doing it. Ignorance is not an excuse. 
People are destroyed for lack of knowledge. 

Revelation 1:4-6
He has made us Kings and priests unto God. 
When we talk about reigning in union with Christ, therefore being on the earth reigning with Him, we are performing our kingly role. 

Some think we were saved and waiting for an escape from the earth but God gave us the name of Jesus to live by in the earth. 
And that name is the greatest and highest name in Heaven, earth and Hell. 
The name commands the greatest respect. 
That's what the Bible says. 
Use that name in your life. 
God said we should use that name everyday; we should cast out devils in that name. 

In my university days, students and lecturers were in cults, terrorizing the place. The small Christians groups couldn't grow. 
At that time, I would say 'where is the foundation stone of the school'?
In the night Time, I and my friends would get there and lay our hands there and break the influence and authority of cultists over the young people and the school.

Eventually we set up the biggest campus fellowship on that campus till this day. 
(I have advanced beyond doing this now. Demons can hear you from anywhere)

In some locations it was more intense. We did what I just told you but it was not enough. 
The night we arrived the Juju people were set (the Pastor was so scared. He didn't come out to meet us).
We were on the road doing our work preparing for the crusade the next day... Then we heard sounds from the other side coming in our direction... While we walked towards them.
One of the indigenes told us that they had a town festival which a lot of town members participated willingly in. 

When people are held hostage to demons against their will, its easy to loose them. 
But when the WILLINGLY serve Demons, you advance Into the next level which is supplication. 

(I don't know how to run in fear. You have to come to a place in your life where your fears vanish. We can't allow fear control us)

These guys were advancing towards us. So I told my guys 'Just speak in tongues and speak as loud as you can'. That was to help drown out fear.

As they advanced towards us, they stopped their drumming and singing, filed to one side and let us pass. As we passed we shouted HALLELUJAH!

We have to realize that we have authority. 

Colossians 4: 12
Epaphras was laboring fervently (Agonizomai). The first synonym there is to fight. 
In praying to God, What work is there? It was his idea, so why would it require you to fight?
(1Tim 6:12 (Fight there is the same word "AGONIZOMAI")

EPAPHRAS was not fighting the Holy ghost or Jesus in prayer. Who was he fighting?
Col 2:1. Conflict= Fight
1 Tim. 6:12 
Who was Paul fighting?
What is this conflict about?

Remember, the weapons of our warfare are not carnal. 

A lot of people emphasize the metaphorical part... But it more than that. There are real strongholds in the spirit realm. 

In English you can say 'I struggled with this, or I wrestled..or I fought'.

Same way in Greek, it could be Agonizomai, or Stratea

1. Who are the adversaries?
2. What are the weapons?
This will inform how to use them. 

Ephesians 6:10. 
V11: He emphasises how to protect yourself against the missiles of the adversary and who they a



## SEPTEMBER COMMUNION SERVICE 2020 ~ SEPTEMBER IS THE MONTH OF WISDOM~2465

The Lord is gracious and kind. You’d love the message for the month of September.
 September is the Month of Wisdom.
I don’t think we ever had a message like this. It’s a amazing what the Spirit has in store for us. Remarkable. When I received the message I began to say, wisdom rules my heart, wisdom rules my life, family, the world. Wisdom rules the nations.
So remember, wisdom rules and its ruling through you.

Did you know, some years ago I was teaching you about Godly wisdom. Did you know that there also three kinds of ungodly wisdom.
Quickly let me show it to you.
The Bible tells us about Worldly wisdom, Fleshly or Sensual wisdom and then, there is devilish wisdom.


 Worldly Wisdom.
1 Cor 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, like wearing of masks. It never leads anyone to success. There is a wisdom in the world, like wearing of mask, that is foolishness unto God. So the wisdom of this world will not lead anyone to success because it is worldly.
Let me give you the next one.
 Fleshly wisdom.
2 Corinthians 1:12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward. It says we are not walking in fleshly wisdom. Don’t walk in fleshly wisdom.
 Devilish wisdom.
2 These 2:8-10 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: 9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. This is talking about the anti-Christ. With this kind of wisdom, satan misleads. In the book of 1 Kings 22, we have a story about a demon that went into the mouth of several prophets as a lying spirit and they gave counsel to mislead the king to war and it was for the kings destruction. That’s a devilish wisdom, where a man doesn’t know that the counsel he is receiving is from the devil.
Here’s one verse of scripture that puts all of them together. James 3: 11-12 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? 12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. 13 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.

So there’s a godly wisdom. This month, this amazing wisdom of God will function in your life. Did you know that God gave Solomon, Phronesis and Sophia and Phronesis is described as the wisdom of the righteousness or the wisdom of the just. This month, walk in excellent wisdom. Colossians 4:5 talks about us walking in wisdom. So, you say I walk in wisdom. Christ is made unto me wisdom and I walk in it. There are levels of wisdom, so walk in excellent wisdom. In Ephesians 5:15, we are admonished to walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise.

So this month, wisdom rules and if you let wisdom rule, you will walk in absolute prosperity and health. We are Victors in Christ Jesus. We are winning and reigning. Hallelujah!



## FAMILY PRAYERS ARE VERY IMPORTANT.~2475

Don’t be too busy to pray with your spouse, husband’s make out time to pray with your wives, call the children, call everyone out for prayers don’t relent in prayer as a family. You will achieve lots when you pray with your family. Family prayers can not be overemphasized. Let God be first in your family.

SEPTEMBER THE MONTH OF WISDOM.

## Attending church is walking in the wisdom of God~2496

.

WHY YOU MUST GO TO CHURCH?

1. God said so Hebrews 10:25

2. Jesus did, showing us a pattern.  Luke 4:16

3. It is the vehicle by which you function  in the body of Christ.
 
4.The church is the pillar and ground of truth(1 Timothy 3:15)

5. The church is a place of fellowship  with other Christians.  Proverbs 27:17
1 Corinthians 15:33

## DON'T ALLOW BAD THOUGHTS.~2503

Learn to think good thoughts because your mind is the door to your spirit. If you let the wrong thoughts go through your mind they'll enter through your spirit and they will corrupt the quality of your personality. So don't let the wrong thoughts enter your spirit.

Don't let your mind stray and think on just every and any kind of thoughts. If the thoughts are coming to you and they don't line up with the Word of God let them go, otherwise they will destroy the purity of your soul. 

Only allow thoughts which are right, pure and lovely, and admirable. Excellent thoughts and worthy of praise.  4:8

Pastor Chris Oyakhilome DSc,DD.

## WORDS ARE SPIRITS.~2603

Every word that you ever spoke is alive somewhere in the realm of the spirit, they don't die.

Your life as it is today is the image of what you created years ago. 

And your life in the next few years is what you create now with your words. Your words determines how your life should go.

The most important thing in your life is your WORDS. 

Your words will decide the quality of your life on earth, your relationship with God, your relationship with human beings and where you go eternally heaven or hell.

The Integrity of the Word.



## IPPC 2020 DAY 1 - MONDAY,  NOVEMBER 16, 2020

MORNING SESSION~2631

TOPIC 1: THE PASTOR AS A MSTER SOUL WINNER by Pastor Moses

Get the tape MASTER SOUL WINNER

1. JESUS was personally involved in soul winning
2. Jesus motivated His team to win souls. You cannot motivate anyone to win souls if you are not soul winner.

Luke 19:10
For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.

SEEK: Means search till you find.

Luke 5:32
I have not come to arouse and invite and call the righteous, butthe erring ones (those not free from sin) to repentance [to change their minds for the better and heartily to amend their ways, with abhorrence of their past sins].

John 1:35-41

Jn 1:33 — Jn 1:35
And I did not know Him nor recognize Him, but He Who sent me to baptizein (with) water said to me, Upon Him Whom you shall see the Spirit descend and remain, that One is He Who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.
And I have seen [that happen—I actually did see it] and my testimony is that this is the Son of God!
Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,


Jn 1:33 — Jn 1:38
And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples; And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God! And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus. Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?


Jesus started the conversation.


Jn 4:21 — Jn 4:30
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.

John 4:34
Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.

You must be personally involved in soul winning as a pastor. You can win someone working with you.

If you don't understand the vision, it cannot drive you.

Then there is the example of Paul in terms of the preaching the gospel.

There are times you have to break protocol to win souls to Christ.


THREE IMPORTANT REASONS YOU MUST WIN SOULS: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 2020 ROR ARTICLE
• REASON 1: You faith in the Lord Jesus.
• Soul winning is the proof of your faith in the Lord Jesus.

Romans 1:16
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

Revelation 21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

• REASON 2: Proves your love for Jesus and his soon return.

John 14:15
THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH
"If you love me, show it by doing what I've told you.

Love can be seen. If you are not winning souls, can you make heaven.

Jn 15:1 — Jn 15:2
​ I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 2. Every bra



## The New World Order - Prayer, Ministry and Protagonism - Pastor Lanre Alabi.~2635

Pastor Chris helped us, through these Your Loveworld Specials to understand the forces behind the pandemic and fiasco and how to use prayers to stop the advancement of the evil one. We need to do so in prayer, ministry and protagonism. It's knowledge to put to work to bring the new world order.

It begins with prayer... Many always to pray and not faint... Pray without ceasing. No vacation. Our adversary takes no vacation. Our prayers releases our weapon without ceasing. 

There's a way we have to pray... First of all, prayers, intercessions and supplications with thanksgiving....

Godliness and honesty. We establish it by prayer. In our ministry, we have various platforms. Apply ourselves and mobilise our members. Our brethren are not here. Have we mobilised them to pray. 

It's a new level. There's an urgency. 100% mobilisation. No fractions. We establish momentum when we pray together. Take oury prayer programmes seriously.

The global day of prayer. Get all our brethren involved. We're reaching 5 billion people. Let your catchments be part of it. By all means possible. It must include those in your catchments. The New World order depends on you. It's from your location. We're pushing out from here. No wastage heritages around you. 

1 Timothy 1:12

Colossians 1:4 

Fulfil your ministry. It's God given. It's god assignment with eternal reward. It's got to assume the seriousness. God knows the details. Learn it. 

2 Corinthians 5:18

Do your members know. There's a purpose for your new creation. It's a ministry of reconciliation. Something that mustn't fail. It happens in the market place of life. It must take up a new level of seriousness. Wake up. Don't be at ease. So much to be done. 

Being to people's mind the awareness of God. Bring His fragrance everywhere. Into the equation. The story of the journey to Lagos... The accident... How he led two of them to Christ. Should they from me go to hell? Ministry, being God into the matter. 

You're in office all the time. Carry out ministry. It is by the spirit. We have to be conscious. All we do is by the spirit. No room for mistakes. The time is short. We've got to win the souls and they remain. Win and retain all. 

Share the truth and the structures. Seven steps into soul winning. Perfecting soul winning. What are they.

Win them
Understand the message
Explain the message
Lead them to salvation
Introduce them to church
Structures-water baptism, cell, foundation School
Leadership

That's what Pastor told us. We have to all do it. Get the results of the ministry.

Protagonism
Be in your prayer ministry in your field. Taking a leading position with a prize in view. There are antagonists. You've got to have a militancy attitude. Forcefully advancing our course. Pushing forward and breaking barriers.... Visiting  40 prisons in the country. Never done before. We don't preach religion. This is life. How can you be comfortable for five years with man made policy. There must be a disagreement. Something have to change. 

It's has to be done. Soldier or civilian? As a soldier, you've got to follow instructions. Follow your zonal pastors, go and get the results and the testimonies. We don't have civilians. Use the willing. They must not be the oldest. When are you coming back? That's not a question... He's a soldier... The demand goes beyond civilian affairs. 

Never allow opportunities to waste. Take leading position. Nothing you do for God can put you in a disadvantage position. Why are we so few here? How the 75 members that can labour effectively for results. Raise and train them how to get results. Soldiers with real life weapons. That which every joint supplies. 

This is prayer, ministry and protagonism... Getting ready for the rapture.

Let's pray now...

## IPPC DAY 6 MORNING SESSION PART 2

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRAYER

BY PST. LINDA OKOCHA~2643

RESPONSIBILITY means the state or fact of being responsible,accountable 
Pastor defined RESPONSIBILITY As the right response to the ability of God in you.

Luke 18:1 KJV
And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

Acts 12:1-5 KJV
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. [2] And he killed James the brother of John with the sword. [3] And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.) [4] And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people. [5] Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.

Matthew 28:18-19 KJV
And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. [19] Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:
God has given us the Authority to use his name, we must use what we've got to use what we have. When we ask in the name of Jesus, we are heard. Maintain, stand in prayers. 

Mark 16:17 KJV
And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;
Through prayers  supplications  intercession, giving of thanks, we can change anything. 
If you don't do anything,  God won't 
Function in His name, change things

Take Action!
God hasgiven us delegated power/Authority to effect changes. 

God doesn't like it when his children weep over situations  he has given them power over.
Everytime we use the name of Jesus we are heard in heaven. 

God’s will ia for us to use the name of Jesus and ask in faith believing.
We must maintain and take our stand in prayers. 
We must take the responsibility of prayers.

It's our responsibility to take action s when we hear that any unpleasant thing is happening in the world, We are God’s Voice Like Nehemiah did, He took Action and brought restoration. 
John 11:33-43

1 John 5:14-15 KJV
And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us: [15] And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him

James 1:6 KJV
But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.

Nehemiah 1:1-4 KJV
The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, 
[2] That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
 [3] And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.
 [4] And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven.
The God of heaven hears and answers prayers. 
When God moves you to pray about something, Act Immediately!

Every Nation  belongs to Jesus.
The Word of God is the only solution to the problems of the world.

3- Consider that you're living for the Lord. Make Him your focus in all things.

Prayer is for the edification and education of your spirit.

## Global day of Prayer
1st December, 2020~2663

Rev. Dr. Chris Oyakhilome

Song: 
Through it all x2
I've learned to trust in Jesus, I've learned to trust in God.
Through it all x2
I've learned to depend on his word. 

I want to welcome you to our global day of prayer. 
It's so important that we pray. Jesus said men ought always to pray and not faint/give up. 

Acts 6:4
The Bible shows us 2 vital things that God expects us to do. 
We want to know why the apostles were so successful. They were refered to as the men who turned the world upside down.

"But we will give ourselves continually to prayer and the ministry of the word".

Not just once a week..but continually.
Through prayer, we superimpose God's will and plan. We direct the course of the Nations. 

Prayer is our way of not just communicating with the father but of speaking his word. 
Now that is issuing decrees. It's a special kind of prayer. You have to determine what should happen. 

The Lord has graciously called us for this time. It is not a surprise. We are prepared for this time. God knew what was coming and he prepared us years ago and we are ready to meet the challenges of the times and to win. 

And I told you that 2020 was to be the year of perfection; alignment.
They are those who thought it had to do with their personal life...but it affects every aspect. Our role is to bring the Nations back to alignment with God's plans and purposes. 

Isaiah 61: 1-2
2b. Jesus stopped at 2a. 
He was coming for the acceptable year of our Lord. .the year of vengeance would be later. And the day of the church would be in between the two times. 

3-4: Those that he called trees of Righteousness (us), we are the planting of the Lord. We build the old wastes and repair the cities. 
We have come to office. .we are setting things right and bringing the Nations to alignment by the spirit. 

We are in the centre of God's will and timing. 

When you look at the prophetic messages given to us concerning all that God will do from the visions of Daniel, the prophecies of Zechariah, Ezekiel, the writings of John... You will see that in the church age, no earthly nation is given global power or authority...and no nation on Earth is given power over the church. 
They have their work cut out for them until the church.
Even Rome had to fade away. 
Took a little while because the baby church was just coming up.
As long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a servant though he is Lord of All.... Until the time of maturity.
As the church matured, the church brought down the powers of Rome that had become so evil and destructive. 
Study your history 

During the church age, the name of Jesus Christ is the name with all authority in heaven, Earth and under the earth 

Every other power that enforces it's will on the Nations of the world is subject to the name of Jesus. 
As long as government and leaders function within the ambits of God's judgement, it's fine. 
The church is the watchman.

We also know when powers come into office by some crooked means. We know when it is not our heavenly father that is constituting some authority When it's not right, we are not supposed to keep quiet. 
We are to use the power in the name of Jesus to correct it. 
The earth is full of the goodness of God. 
If people are not seeing that goodness, it must be for a reason. 
It's our responsibility to show it. 
If the governments intimidate people, line up the deep state and intimidate the poor, then we can't be quiet. We must do something about it. 

1 Tim 2:1-2
Why do we have to pray this way? To make sure the the Nations and leaders are under the influence of God's power for their good. 
He asked us to pray because the Nations of men and their leaders often stray away and God needs us to bring them back to the right direction. 

V3-4: You can see God's purpose. 
We can't just sit by and say 'whatever will be, will be'.
If God has everything in his control, he wouldn't tell us to pray. 
He gave us the different types of prayer to pray for all men. 
We can't just close our eyes and hope. 
He told us to pray.

## THE REVELATION OF THE WORD IN YOU~2685

Pastor Chris

Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you (1 Peter 1:23-25).

Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you (1 Peter 1:23-25).


 
The Bible says we’re the epistles of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:2); in other words, your very life is a message; it’s the manifestation of God’s Word, because you’re born of the Word of God; that makes you an offspring of the Word. Every living thing reproduces after its kind and you’re born of the same living Word that became flesh and dwelt amongst us. This means you’re also the Word of God in flesh.

2 Corinthians 3:2-3 says, “Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.” You’ve been manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ. This is the revelation of true Christianity!

True Christianity is the out-working of the Word in you. When you talk, it’s the Word; when you act, it’s the Word. We read that we’re manifestly declared to be the epistles of Christ, known and read of all men. Meaning that, as the world look at us, they literally can read the Word of God. No wonder we’re the effulgence of His glory, the manifestation of His righteousness. When you show up, Christ shows up, for as He is, so are you in this world (1 John 4:17).



## 1 John 5:19~2709

NIV, AMP
HOW CAN THEY HELP THEMSELVES??
Only one who has power to control that evil one can save them.

Ephesians 2:1-3
NIV, AMP.

1THESS 5:2-5
KJV, 
We are not of the darkness or of the night. We are children of Light/the day!

Why are we taking a stand?
I showed you several things from the bible from the books of Revelations, Daniel, etc. About the timings of God. 

John 7:25-26-30
Jesus came to the temple grounds during the feast. They were not expecting to see him because they knew they wanted to kill him. 
But he was teaching openly. 
They wanted to seize him but they were restrained because HIS HOUR WAS NOT YET COME. 

John 8:20
As long as his hour was not yet come, they could not take him
He was living in the purposes of God and he stood his ground. 
He knew that he had power to lay down his life because he had authority from the Father to do so. 
He declared it, and principalities and powers understood those powerful words from Jesus. 

In the spirit, understanding timing matters. 
Timing is everything. 
It is an important asset...but it is more than an asset. 
What time are you living in??

Matthew 8:28-29
These demon possessed men challenged Jesus. They knew there was a future planned for them in Hell but they tried to stand against Jesus concerning their rights, after they as demons had denies people of their rights. 

People who like to deny people of their rights, always like to claim rights. 

The kind of control which these people are doing today is only permitted by God in his word during the second half of the tribulation. 


Therefore we issue an injunction against these demon spirits causing the lockdowns, to cease their operations in Jesus name.

Luke 22:52-53
Jesus was unruffled when they came to arrest him. He understood the forces behind the arrest activities. He knew that it was their hour. He didn't stop them. He had to lay down his life. He identified who was responsible for this. 

We have to identify who is responsible for these works and the timing.

This is WRONG TIMING. It can't hold!!!

Mark 16:17-
We cast out devils in the name of Jesus!!!!
V18: DO YOU BELIEVE THIS???

Those who don't believe are those looking for how to protect themselves from something deadly. 
How can you protect yourself from the sign that is supposed to follow you?..

Its not something you pray about. He is letting others know how to know who you are. They will be watching. 
If you don't put your faith to work and live as a christian, when are you going to do it?

It is a contradiction when you say that a church should put a sign of protection against disease. 

Jude 1:3
Have the same faith the Peter, Paul etc had. Earnestly contend for that faith. Don't be substandard.

If you are a minister of God, there are necessary credentials. What else are you going to show?

Mark 16:18
When you lay hands on the sick, they recover. We should be laying hands on sick people, not running away and socially distancing ourselves away from them. Its a contradiction of our faith. Will you just sit down and accept it? When the son of man comes, will he find faith in the earth? What life do you want to live? 

James 4:7
The devil will flee if you stand up to him God knows him. God knows that he can't stand against you. All you have to do is resist him
 

1 Peter 5:8
Be sober... Be vigilant!
Resist the devil.. Steadfast in the faith. He will flee. Stand your ground. Don't depend on your flesh. It will fail you. 
If you digest thenwird of God, you will react the way that the word will prompt you and by the Holy ghost. 

Eph 4;27-
Don't give the devil an opportunity. 
Don't give him any place in your city and country.


We are going to pray right now. We exercise authority over evil spirits that has been controlling leaders of countries. Moving them against their own people over this falsehood that they cannot prove. 
Come against this fear that creates unstable societies and governments. 

We give no place to devil in the nations of the world. We forbid this state capture. 

Prayer sessions.

## January The Month of Celebration!!!~2728





## Pastor James Payne:~2906

Joel said 'Blow the trumpet the Zion. for the Lord and he comes quickly'.
The Lord is coming. A lot of people are not prepared but you can get prepared by doing what I did 52 years ago. Jesus loves you as much as he loves me or pastor Chris. Just lift your hands and say Jesus, I need you in my life. 

We are going to see the Latter rain of God in these last days. There will be a mighty harvest. And there will be an exchange of wealth to the believers. 

Pastor Dan Willis:
I am excited. The word that Pastor Benny is going to bring... The anointing is thick up in here. 

God is preparing us to be seers. A seer is a perceiver of hidden truths. God is bringing the church back to be seers. We see what God is about to do, and it is mind blowing. 

Pastor Ose Oyakhilome:
This year is our year of preparation and we are preparing. Those 4 points you gave us are burning in my heart. He is coming soon and there is no more time to waste. 
With all the great things that the patriarchs did... We are on the last lap. The anointing of Gods spirit will so stir us up this week to preach the gospel and give towards the gospel. Gods people are not going to be begging. We are going to be seeding the gospel. 
A crowd of witnesses will be cheering us on. There is no stopping us. Every day, minute and second, we are ready to meet the Lord. 

Dr. Mike Smalley:.
We have Minutes left to reach millions. Thank God for the urgency God has put in your heart to see the church prepare.
We have the greatest responsibility and the greatest privilege to preach the gospel to the ends of the earth.

There is going to be a grace on every speaker this week. As we release our seed, God is going to get in covenant with it. 
2 Cor 5:18. This is going to be our year. The wealth of the wicked is being laid up for the Just. 



Bishop Clarence McClendon

The final exodus Project: There is a departure that is about to happen. 
Even people who don't know the Lord Jesus are recognizing that the things happening in the earth are beyond the natural realm. 

I have been pondering about the book of Exodus and the children of Israel. 
What God did through Moses with the children of Israel in Egypt was prophesied 400 years before to Abraham.

God wants his people everywhere to know and understand that they are in his hand. Nothing that is going on around you is ordained to cut you. In fact, God is prepared to show you off and one who cannot be touched.
The answers you need have already been set aside. 
'I am the Lord who makes a difference. I have ordained on the season to make you different and show you off. I will make a difference between you and anyone who does not believe in me'. Says the Lord. 

God put you and I in Christ in the earth so that he would favor us and not explain to anybody.

God put Moses in the rock, so that he could be good to him and to cause all his goodness to pass before him. 

In spite of your failures and flaws, God is allowing his goodness to pass before you because you are in the Flawless one.

Exodus 3:12-

God was speaking to Moses, giving him the responsibility and authority to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt. 
The entire objective of God for this operation was to have a people serve and worship him.

V 13- this was indicative that the people of Israel didn't know who God was. 

V14: God was saying I will demonstrate to you who I am. I will show you different dimensions of my character and personality. He fills in the blanks to I AM.

V15: notice how God is referring to him "the God of your Fathers.."

V: 17-18
After you get them together and get them to have a sense of who I am, THEN, you go to Pharaoh.. and then he identifies Himself as the God of the Hebrews.

V20: God calls what he is going to do WONDERS. He does not call them plagues. When they begin to manifest.  One mans plagues becomes another mans wonders.

(No matter what the CDC says, We are not in the time of the plague, but in the time of wonders)

V21.



## Genesis 15:13~2907

This is 400 years before God calls Moses to deliver the children of Israel from the bondage of Pharaoh. 
V14: God, through the scripture, calls what he did in Egypt, JUDGEMENT. 


GOD is working a preordained, preordered, premeditated plan. Nothing that is happening is happening without his plan. He is moving the nations like pieces on a chess board to show himself strong on behalf of his people. 

One of the significance of the Exodus Project is Missed..
God is introducing himself to a people who belong to him by Covenant but do not really know him.
He is at the same time introducing himself to a people who don't belong to him and don't know him (Egypt).

Exodus 1:5,6
The Children of Israel came into Egypt through Joseph and kept multiplying until a Pharaoh who did not know about Joseph(that the sustenance of Egypt was because of a covenant person/people)

The only reason the earth has not been destroyed is because we are still here.

The story of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is carried out by Oral tradition because there was no written scripture. 
The only way the power and goodness of God was passed from generation to generation was orally.. But the people grew faster than the story could be told. 

Just like the United states.. The people feel like the belong to God even Though they don't know God. 

God is dealing with a generation of people who belong to him but they don't know his character, nature, judgement, grace..

Now they have gotten to a place where not only do they not know him, but they are questioning his existence. 

Now God has to step in, so that they understand that He still has a people. 

There are nations that are living like there is no God. 

God is long suffering and tolerant. Your rejection of him, he will even endure..but when you begin to live like HE IS NOT, then he steps in and show them I AM.

God says 'You can live and function like I am not, but I am about to show you that I am'.


Time for the Exodus; the divine release. 


There are times when God will tell us to do things, and our believing is what he is after, but its not going to produce the result we are after immediately.
We then think that we missed God.. But No we didn't. He is waiting for an appointed time. 

What God told you about your ministry, home and business, is about to manifest!
The promise God made you that you have not seen the full fruition of, is about to come to pass. 

God told the Israelites.. 'I am the God of Abraham Issac and Jacob' meaning, you don't know me, but your Father's did. 

The days of Gods generals, the R W Sham Bach's, are here again, but in greater intensity.

Even Pharaoh's resistance was a part of Gods divine Plan. Because God needed the Egyptians to also Know who he was. 

Exodus 3:20
God is never after the destruction of people. But when a people nation and society live as if he is NOT, then he must manifest himself. 

The presence of God drawing near brings Light to the children of light and darkness to the children of darkness.

Each time Pharaoh said No, another wonder Hit.
God manifests.

If you read in Deuteronomy 27,28... About the curses (to have the disregard of). The curse of the Lord is not God doing something, but it is  God 'NOT doing something'.
E.g. God not protecting like he used to because he took a step back. 
Things that should have been over, stay longer than they should. 

(People are wondering why the virus is clinging to America, while other nations are opening up.)

God didn't want to punish Egypt 10 times. But when things begin to manifest, they don't manifest all at once.. Between each one, he was giving the space to repent. 

The last thing that manifests before the earth is GROSS DARKNESS. 

Exodus 8:
The first 3 wonders that hit are interesting...God makes no mention of making a difference between his people and everybody else.

V21-22
But from the 4th plague, God makes a mention of this separation. 

No matter what Strain comes next, or what they say is coming next, God has already made the difference.



## 2 Cor 4:3-4~2916

- Their minds are blinded. The devil stops them from getting the gospel. That's why we must do something about them because by themselves, They cannot find out the truth. 

Ephesians 4:18,17 How hopeless they are! This is one of the most painful things to read about those who don't know Jesus Christ. 

Ephesians 2:4-5
God loved us even before we came to him. 
We are raised together with Christ. 
We are not struggling trying to make things happen. We are seated together with Christ.
That's what God sees. 
He sees us only in Christ Jesus, with all of the glory. 

V7: in several translations, they don't just get it. 
This is the ages following the sitting of Christ. (Its not referring to the millennium)
He shows the exceeding riches of his grace towards us IN CHRIST JESUS. This is happening in the earth. 

(Eph 3:20- Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus.... In all ages. Throughout all generations of the ages; An endless era) the church age is just the beginning of those series of ages because, The church is not the bride of Christ. It is the body. 
So, the church starts out this thing. 
The only period we have that is exclusive to us is this 2000 years. That's why we cannot fail. We cannot lose. We can't blow this opportunity. 

We will see David, Solomon, etc... But we will all be reigning. This is the only time kept for the church.
After this time, is the full bride. 

He told us exactly what to do in situations like these. 
At the beginning of this Fiasco, I told you we will use everything that God will teach us. 
There is no stopping us. We win only. 

Read your bible about all the amazing things reserved for those who overcome. Let not your heart be troubled. 

The few people that were filled with spirit in the old a testament didn't have the fullness of the spirit: the seven spirits of God, like we have.
How can you let that pass by and not do what he called you to do?

Make up your mind what you are going to do in the house of God. 

Winning souls around the world is our responsibility. Not even the angels can do it. He called us to do it. And he said 'I am with you till the end of the age' ... It is not a promise but a declaration of truth 

Say 'Father you are with me. I am a success today and full of strength today because you are with me'.

He is inside us. Inseparably one with us!
Our God is not confused. We are not trying to empower him. 
Some people say when we praise, God is gingered up. Who do you think he is???

Bishop James Payne

There is an atmosphere that's been created today by the word of God for the supernatural. 
As we pray for people on the phone over their seed, the Holyghost begins to come on them. 

There is 5,065,000 minutes in a year and each moment can be a moment for a miracle to happen. 
You must plant the right seed at the right time. 

As Noah offered sacrifice to the Lord, God smelled the fragrance of those sacrifice and it caused him to respond. He said he would not destroy the world by water again.

In every harvest, there is another seed. 
We can decide to eat that seed to feed our need or we can sow that seed to meet our need. 

Its only seeds that are sown that multiply.
God activated the the seed for activation. 
Seed doesn't know anything about who is in the white house, or a fake pandemic. It only knows that of somebody will sow me, I will multiply.

The earth is anointed for activation when you sow your seed in the natural. 
When you give your funds/seed... It has no personality but the personality that you give it. It is a tool to reach people with the gospel of Jesus Christ 

Jesus gave 7 parables about seedtime and harvest.
Economics are a science of creation, supply, demand and replenishing.

In America, foreign countries that are anti-god have purchased 30million acres of farmland and put farmers out of Jobs. 

But as long as you have seed and earth you can survive. Jesus didn't teach Economics he taught seedonomics

The seed in your hand doesn't know your color or education.. All it knows is 'if someone sows me, I'm going to multiply'



## Your seed predicts your Future.~2918

Bishop McClendon
We are in a season of miracles. 

God speaks to you through his prophets. 

The devil will never tell you to sow into Loveworld. 

"An uncommon seed creates an uncommon harvest".. Bishop Payne. 

God multiplies seed sown. Not seed in your pocket or in your bank account. 

The moment you sow a seed, you are qualified for more seed.



## Isaiah 59:14 NIV~2925

V15 Look at the media today. Even those who stand for truth become victims. 
V16 Who is his arm? The Messiah (Gods right arm).
How does the Messiah accomplish this today? Through us; the executors of his will.

V17-20: This is remarkable. 
V 17- He was to intervene in a situation as an intercessor. 
Righteousness as a breast plate and Salvation..

Isa 11:4
Notice Isaiah's poetry and dichotomy of sentences. 
'The rod of his mouth', 'the breath of his lips'.
V5: He is dealing with truth and conscience. 

We have to understand that we have a Job to do here and we have to be serious about it like it matters. The day of playing church is over. There is a real warfare. 
Can we just act like it doesn't matter?
Except that we would act, the situation will persist and continue until the tribulation. 
There is no determination in the scriptures of what should happen between now and the tribulation. He left it to us to determine. 

Whatever will happen in the church throughout the Gentile age, God is silent...and gives us the understanding that that is the period of the church when they must live in the name of Jesus and reign in life. 

This goes on until the rapture of the church. So, if during this period we allow Satan to have a field day... But, That's not going to happen. The Holy ghost is leading us. 

1 Tim 1:18-
All the gear given to us for this warfare are offensive, only 2 are defensive.

How do you approach prophecy? You hold them by faith. Without Faith, the prophecy will not work. 
Prophecies are uttered by faith. 

V19: Faith and a good conscience...(Refer to Isa 11:5)

Ephesians 6:12
These are the ones that run the course of this world. They control men's minds. Whisper thoughts to their minds. Control media. Control the narratives 
They understood the modus operandi of Satan that's why they passed fear all around the world.
There is no good in them.
They have no restraint for evil. 

V13-14 (as seen in Isaiah)
V15- How beautiful are the feet of those that publish peace. Speeding the gospel of Christ.

V16: There are many who talk down the message of faith because they are ignorant. 
Its so important. 
Faith is a shield. 
Your Faith is a shield.
The word of God is dependable. No assumption. 
With your faith, YOU SHALL BE ABLE.
With that Faith you can Neutralize and Put out all the fiery darts of the wicked. 

When you Operate Faith, it is a shield. 
The more of Gods word you hear, the more you increase your faith.
The more you put it to work; The more you strengthen it. 

Look what happened to the whole world. They panicked in fear. 
Even Regulators in UK were mad at you if you said anything against covid on air. Its such a shame. They lost their right to speak. 
Why? Because they want fear to continue in the land. 

Look at the media. 
They send messages to everyone to 'Stay safe'.
Have we come this far to be paralyzed?

Refuse to speak that kind of language as a child of God.

The devil tries to prevent you from hearing the message of faith and to focus on the news so that you will not have Faith. 

Faith comes by hearing the word of God. If you want faith in Government, then listen to Government. But they will mislead you and fail you. 
Put not your trust in Man, but God.

Luke 22: 51-53
These guys came to arrest Jesus at Night. Injustice! They framed him at night!
Same way they do today.
V53- this is your hour and the power of darkness. 
Jesus understood that the power of darkness was at work. 

Jesus had 6 trials within a few hours. .he was arrested at night and by 9am in the morning he was already crucified. (Like hastened impeachment). And none of them could convict him.
Jesus didn't blaspheme. But he was quiet. 
He was put on the cross for six hours and he died.

He understood what was behind his arrest...but he understood his purpose. He came to give his life as a sacrifice. He laid down his life of his own free will. 

Remember when He asked them who they came to arrest and he said 'I am he' they fell under the power. He was in command of the situation.



## Genesis 1:3-4~2929

God actually defines light. It's good. 
It sounds elementary. 
It was a defining of what is good and what is evil. 

Why? Because when sons of darkness are in control, they will call what is good evil and what is darkness light. 

God is raising us to define it. 

God is raising a generation of kids who will stand tall for the gospel. 

God is doing a defining by himself. .he is giving preachers boldness. He is anointing his sons and daughters so that even if people don't agree with you, they will not be able to Ignore you. 

Some of you have been quietly praying and doing what God said, God is about to put you in the place where your unbelieving and condescending friends and loved ones will ask you 'what are you doing?'

Gen 1:4
Rebellion presupposes knowledge. This generation is not rebellious. They are ignorant. They do not know light from darkness because the church has been too silent.

God divided the light from darkness 

There is about to be a great division and distinction between those who are actually listening to the spirit and those who are just lifting their hands in church.

When you hear of God dividing, its a signal of a harvest. 

Matthew 13:24-30
While the church was unconscious, the enemy sowed tares. 
Wheat and tares look exactly alike until harvest time when fruit is supposed to be produced. 
Right now there are tares in pulpits.
V29
The dividing is not your Job.  You just be salt and light. (Don't waste your time trying to expose tare preachers)
The lines that are being drawn in church are a signal that we are in the time of the greatest harvest.

V30,37-39
Jesus explains the parable himself. 
What's the difference between Church children and Kingdom 
church children can only live it out in church.
But kingdom children can be placed anywhere, government,  CEOs of banks etc...and they will not bow!!!

V39- The reapers are the angels. 

The harvest is surely coming in because it is the end of the age. 

God is going to start rooting out things that have trapped people in religion.

V43- The righteous will shine. This isn't something to happen in heaven. We don't need to shine in heaven. We glow on earth. 

Genesis 1:
A divine decree:
It has always been important for Gods people to declare Gods word. 
In this hour, it is this thing that will make a difference. It will cause things that a divinely purposed to manifest for you...and not your neighbor. 
You must sow seeds in 2 worlds in order to see the harvests decreed.
Financial/material seeds in the material world and word seeds in the spirit world.. 

The sower sowed the word!!!!

Gen 1:5
God CALLED the light Day. It wasn't Day until he said it was Day.
He called it by divine Decree.

You've got to name it!

When he called the light, Day and the Dark, Night..the sun moon and stars had not yet been created. (1V16-18)
The days and nights of God were not originally determined by sunrises and sunsets... Not by exterior elements but by divine decree. 

No one can tell you that this isn't the hour for you. 
You must say in the earth what God has said in heaven.
God has given us the power with our money seed and word seed to change darkness to light. 

Job 22:28.

Your night is shifting today! Light has been released. 
The seed that you sow in the ground and the word that you sow in the spirit is going to shift something for you. 

God has defined you as the son of the day and not the night.

## FEBRUARY 2021 ~ MONTH OF GRACE~3138

RECOGNIZE AND CELEBRATE GRACE ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME

"But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble" (James 4:6)

When God promotes you, He increases His grace on your life. With that increased grace, you're able to accomplish much more. Grace gives you greater ability and opens doors for you. But something very important about grace that you must be conscious of is that it craves recognition.

You might have noticed that the name, "Grace" is most commonly answered by ladies. It sort of explains something about grace: it's ladylike; something alluring. A beautiful lady likes to be recognized; she dresses adorably because she likes to be acknowledged. That's really how grace is. If you fail to recognize grace, it'll cringe; it'll withdraw and cease to function.

It's part of the reason some Christians aren't seeing the manifestation of grace in their lives as they should. Learn to celebrate grace. Consciously acknowledge that you're full of grace, surrounded with divine favour everywhere, and every day. You'll be amazed at the increased blessings and manifestations of the Spirit you'll experience in your life.

Remember, the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of grace; so, in celebrating grace, you're celebrating Him. Therefore, He'll keep manifesting Himself---His beauty and glory---in your life. Suddenly, you find that you're being called and chosen for jobs, blessings, promotions and positions you didn't even qualify for. Even people who profess not to like you will be doing good things for you. That's the power of grace.

Even now, God's grace is increased in your life, causing His glory to be revealed in all that you do, ushering you into your next level of greatness and promotion. Receive it. Celebrate it. Affirm it. Glory to God!

## March The Month of Change!!!~3692





## PRAYER: YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE ADVERSE SITUATIONS!~3921

Never stop praying, especially for others. stay alert and keep praying for God's people (EPHESIANS 6:18 CEV).

Someone once said that, "the only  ingredient for evil to prevail is for a good men to do nothing". This statement is indeed true, especially because alot of Christians try to make God responsible for what is actually their responsibility. They make such statements like, "If God didn't want that thing to happen, why did He let it happened?". The authority to change things on earth has been delegated to us. We have the responsibility of changing things, and one of the ways we do this is through prayer. 

The Bible give us an example of the consequences of not taking up our responsibility. Herod had arrested James, the brother of John. Probably the brethren were thinking "Herod doesn't know the anointing on brother James, he'll be out of there in no time". They did nothing. Suddenly, someone rushed in with the news: "Brother James has been killed!" James was no ordinary disciple; he  was one of the three closest disciple to Jesus. While they were still wandering- "Jesus, why didn't you do something?" another bad news came, "Peter has been arrested". By this time the disciples knew they had to do something! The Bible says, "Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church onto God for him". (Acts 12:5); and as they prayed, Peter was miraculously set free by an angel (Acts 12:7). Oh!! If only they had responded by praying earlier, James wouldn't  have been killed.

Learn to take up your responsibility of prayer. You don't have to wait for evil to strike home before you learn to pray and make change  in the Name of Jesus. Remember that God has given us the dominion and the authority to alter the course of events   in the earth. Its your responsibility, not HIS! Hallelujah!

## GLOBAL DAY OF PRAYER
26th March, 2021~4048

Rev. Dr. Chris Oyakhilome

🎶To thee we ascribe Glory.
To thee we ascribe Honor
To thee we ascribe
Power and majesty
Holy is the Lord🎶


🎶 King of Kings and Lord of lords.
I magnify your majesty.
Worthy worthy are you Lord
You are high and lifted up

All of my days will I praise your holy name
My heart's desire
Is to sing this song to you.

Glory to God x2
Worthy, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain🎶

🎶Heaven and Earth adore you🎶

🎶You're my desire, nothing else matters🎶

🎶Lord I praise you because of who you are🎶


🎶with my voice lifted up...🎶


I welcome you to today's program.
A short while ago you were watching a documentary on several prophecies and things that have happened in our world from last year 2020 till our presence time. 

A year ago, 27th March 2020, Pastor Benny Hinn and I led a global prayer meeting because we realized what was going on in the world. Nations had been seized. Gripped with fear. Families and governments were afraid.
Some government elders called it an unknown enemy.

Well, at the time we called for that prayer program, ministers of God and God's people joined us all over the world in their millions. So many joined us... Including groups that didn't talk to each other. But there was a unity of spirit that we all experienced on March 27 2020.

Because we prayed, the spirit of God guided us into strategies and prayers.
Not many expected that churches would open again. Many thought churches would be a thing of the past in 2020/2021. Well, it didn't happen 

The Lord graciously gave us a platform to communicate with you all around the world (3.5bn people) It was an introduction of things to come. 
These were all signs of the coming of the Lord.

In September, 200 million people (from what we would normally have 3000), connected for our healing program. 

I know what this means because I have held large programs. I understand numbers. But when you have 200 million participating, that's extraordinary. 

In December, same program, 1.6bn people participated. 

From March, at different time, we had series and every week we had 1.8-2.5bn people participating.

Then this March 12th-14th, we had 3.4bn, next day, 3.9bn, Sunday night 4.1bn people all around the world connected. With thousands of healing centres all around the world. 

When Satan thought he was locking people down in their homes, God was locking them in and causing them to listen to Pastor Chris. 
Because Jesus Christ is the chief strategist. You can't beat him, and because of that, you can't beat us.

With what is happening, God is fully in charge. 

Jesus instructed us to not only pray 27th March, but to go on with the global praying and we have done it every quarter. 

The beautiful part of praying is not that we prayed but that God answers us. Because he answers us, prayer has meaning and significance.

Even before we pray, he knows our hearts, but he wants us to voice our faith. Faith is our instrument in the spiritual.

I told you ahead of time what this was all about. It's sad that there are still many who are spiritually naive. 

The future is in the hands of our Heavenly father, not in the hands of Satan. 

He sent us in the name of Jesus and the power of the spirit to put things in order the way things should be. 

As God's children, we must recognize that prayer is important.
This meeting is to inaugurate the series of prayers we will be having in the next 24 hours. 

Make sure you are a part of it. Catch no less than 15minutes, 4 times in the 24 hours. From now till Saturday night. 

When we do this, we will have set the world in the position it should be by the power of the spirit. 
Satan has his plans. If we let him, he will destroy many lives. 

When covid19 started, I told you that the numbers they said were going to die would not happen, because we were going to pray about it. 

They had filled whole stadia with hospital beds. They expected the streets to be littered with dead bodies. They had awkward smiles on their faces when they said it.

## MAINTAINING FOCUS IN PRAYER~5028

For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful (1 CORINTHIANS 14:14)

Focusing your mind, emotions and entire faculties on what you’re praying about is very important, and praying in the Spirit is a great advantage in this regard. When you pray in the Spirit, your spirit prays; your mind is unfruitful (1 Corinthians 14:14).

 Therefore, it’s important that you yield yourself to the Spirit by giving Him your mind—paying attention to Him as you pray. That way, you’ll be in sync with Him; His visions, promptings, ideas and thoughts will be clear to you. Praying in the Spirit gets you synchronized with God’s will, His purpose, and timing. ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSc, DD.




MAINTAINING FOCUS IN PRAYER (Part 2)

For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful (1 CORINTHIANS 14:14)

One vital element of effective prayer is focusing your mind on what you’re praying about. Imagine that someone is praying for the salvation of souls in a particular region of the world. He’s interceding that, through the preaching and teaching of the Word, God’s righteousness would prevail in the towns, hinterlands, and cities without hindrance. 

While at it, his mind wanders away, and he’s thinking about some nice cars, houses or a meeting he’s scheduled with a friend. His prayer would hardly be effective that way, and this happens to a lot of people. In prayer, arrest your mind; channel your thoughts and emotions in the direction of the Spirit, and you’ll receive the ministrations of the Holy Spirit. ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC, DD.



## Pastor TT Edun: 

TIMES and SEASONS~5039

Years ago. I think it's close to 25 odd years now. I had a one on one conversation with Pastor Chris. He told me to be conscious of times and seasons in my life because God said that as long as the earth remains, seasons will remain

He said that many people are not conscious of times and seasons. 

Timing. 
There's a right time to do the right thing. 

The right thing at the wrong time is wrong. 

There's never a right time to do the wrong thing.

Then he told me this: The right time for some people to get married has passed. They were too busy judging potential spouses using the wrong standards that they missed the season.

According to Pastor, some people say: I will never marry a teacher. I will never marry a teacher. Suppose its God's perfect plan for you to marry a teacher. And you end up marrying a doctor because that's who you have always desired (God is supposed to give you the desire of your heart, right?). No matter how long the marriage or how many children you have, you have "jonsed". Or missed it.

Pastor said to me: God always planned to have a king for Israel. Years before, Jacob had prophesied the kingship to Judah. But the elders of Israel missed the timing and went for Saul. 

Saul was the tallest man in Israel. Head and shoulders above everyone else. But he wasn't God's timing. Yet, God anointed him as king. But when Goliath came a-calling, Saul's anointing was no match for Goliath's boasting. 

David was smaller in size, status and anointing than Saul. But David had one thing going for him. Character.

There are important things to work on now:

1. Knowing God's timing and seasons and aligning yourself to it.

2. Understanding that God will give you the desires of your heart can be read in 2 ways:

i. God will give you what you desire (more popular interpretation)

ii. God will give you what you SHOULD desire (less known interpretation)

3. The wisdom of God. In choosing a spouse, people grow. David began as a shepherd boy. Jacob was a fugitive. Daniel was a captive slave. Joseph was a convict. Rahab was a prostitute. Ruth was a widow.
God's destiny is not written on the forehead. 

4. Don't disqualify people because of a history they can't change. Rahab. Moses. Matthew. 

5. Be wise. Don't be ruled by what attracts you. Some dangerous people were very attractive. Saul. Absalom. Eliab. 
Then again, some of the best people were very attractive. David. Daniel. Joseph. 

Don't use your head. Follow God's Word. Absalom's head (hair) was his downfall.

Build your spirit's sensitivity. 

But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as doth a canker: 

O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.

God bless you.

Highly Esteemed Pastor Christine Davidson-Ekeh

THE END TIME CELL LEADER.

We have been given a mandate and it will be achieved in the name of Jesus.

Who is an End time Cell Leader?

He is a fountain

The spirit of God talks to us in pictures. 

John 4:14
The fountain has to spring up.
That is why some cell leaders say, they started little but they spread. 
There cannot be deal cells. 
As long as people are thirsty, the fountain must keep flowing. 
In a desert, when you see an oasis, life gathers around that place.

The end time cell leader is a light.
We are the light of the world.
Matthew 5:14
There is a reason why you need to know this... Because you need to shine.
Light defines, directs. 

V14
The end time cell leader is not a village or a house on a street. He is a city. 
You are elevated. 
You have 5, 10, 15 people, You are a city.
Pastor has been Talking to us about the Life of the saints.
Become every description that God calls you. 
A city is a place that has houses in it. You will have a lot of cells under you.
Check the definition of a city.


V15:
You are on an elevation. 
We are light. We show light to every other person. You are the light in that street.

This message is a ministration of grace and capacity.

God does not make statements without giving commensurate capacity. 
You are a fountain
You are the light
You are a city. 

The end time celle leader is a tree.
A tree of righteousness.
You are to reproduce yourself in fruits.
You can get 12 souls every month. 

When you go to war, you need things to fight with. 
You can bear different kinds of fruit according to scripture.


The end time cell leader is a House. 
Jesus met a man filled with demons who said He had legions of demons inside him.

You carry your members inside you. 
How many can you keep in your spirit. 
It is no longer about your catchment area or who your group pastor is.
How many can you keep?
You are kept in Pastor. 
You house people's spirits. 
Jesus said "of all you gave to me, I have not lost one, save the son of perdition".

Activate the house, the members will come. 
When you stir up the house, they start coming. 

WARS: WIN AND RETAIN SOULS. 
We are keeping souls. 
We need to war with proven spiritual principles. 

The end time cell leader is a Temple:
Know ye not that....
Worship is going on continuously and consistently.
Create your own worship atmosphere.
Carry the atmosphere of heaven every where you go. 
Keep bringing forth words that will bring people into your cell.

We are the branches. We endlessly win souls.

Do not be hurtful when you are given a target to win 1000 people to christ. If you don't see people, talk to trees. They will talk to Human beings. 
Keep talking. Don't stop talking. 
You are supernatural.
Call things that be not as though they were. 


We see 6 billion. 
We prophecy 6 billion.
And 6 billion we have
 
People are storehouses 
Cities have storehouses.
Your city is full of cells. 

Spiritual things are repeatable. 
If it happened in Lagos, it can happen everywhere. It is a reality.


The end time cell leader is a NATION.
Isaiah 60:22.
A little one shall become a thousand. 

Because he said it, I believe it, I have endorsed it, and it has become a reality. 

Every single word about you in scripture must be fulfilled. 
Your pulpit is the church.
We will work this scripture and finish it. 
Pray it. Believe it. Confess it until it come to you. That's how to work scripture 

Your inspiration will secure for you everything you want.
The end time cell leader is an inspired cell leader 

You can't serve God without passion.
Elijah was passionate.
Your passion must be seen and felt. 


Spirits are dissolvable.
You will weaken it with prayers and prophecy. 
Anything you don't want, root it out. Don't complain. 
Unknown Gun men? Root them out!!!

The end time cell leader reproduces himself in others
It is not a difficult task. 
Just let them follow you 
You must feed their faith.
Their faith must continually be strengthened.

Highly Esteemed Pastor Joy Amenkhienan

THE PRAYER LIFE OF A CELL LEADER.

Revelations 1: 6
Before you became a cell leader, you were not only a king, but a priest 
You are first a christian before you became a cell leader. 

6 billion!
You can't see it, unless God gives you those eyes to see. 

Listening to our man of God, you cannot but have results in your life. 

As a cell leader you must have a prayer life. Not prayer times or prayer sessions. 

When you wake up in the morning, what do you do?
When you are praying, are you just thinking about your members?

When you live out the word of God, you will be an example to all those around you 

Refer back to the cell ministry manual.

As we pray, we have answers and that deepens your Joy. 

Intercessory prayers
(The place of prayers in soul winning)

The cell leader is the engine room or labor room of the church.
Soul winning is forcibly removing people from the kingdom of Satan and moving them into the kingdom of God. 
Mark 3:27
2 Cor 4:3-4
There is a god of this world who has blinded the mind of those in this world. 

If the devil has blinded them, how will you unfold their eyes? Through prayer.
Once you are a prayerful cell leader, you will see souls in men.

When you are a prayerful person, you will not look at your city the way it is. 
Satan is the god of this world, but in the place of prayer, you bind him.

Everything else we do as leaders is hinged on prayers. If you were not raised praying, you won't know what to do to keep your members. 

Ephesians 6:12
It is a sway. While you are fighting for the soups of men, the devil is also fighting. 
When we received the holy spirit, we received the ability to effect changes. 

Have you taken that stand?
Have you taken that place?
You can start from the street where your cell meeting is; is everyone born again there yet?

If you are a praying person, your words don't fall to the ground. 

The life of a cell leader is not just gathering people. There is work. 
If you win 1000 people, it's 1000 troubles but are you ready for it?

There are different types of prayers. 
1 Tim 2:1-2
Look beyond 2,3,4, 5
Pastor Ruth started out as a cell; now she is a zonal pastor. 

Intercede: One who stands in the gap between man and God in prayers. 

How do you know the people in your street or catchment want to be saved?
There are people who don't like church 
But in the place of prayer, we can change that.

Psalm 2:8 KJV, AMP.
The cell leadership is an agenda of raising a workforce for the whole world. 
Through the cell, you are being raised. 
What you learn now, you will use for many years to come. 

God is instructing us. He said ASK.
If you win 500 people and you don't have a place to keep them, they will go away. 
But in prayer you receive grace for that location.
You have to learn to grow, groom and nurture your members through prayers. 

Do you realize that as a cell leader, God has given you authority over your members? God gives you grace to ensure your members are established in the faith. 

You are praying not particularly because there is a problem, but pray and you will find yourself changing things in the spirit. 

As a cell leader, think of spreading and growing beyond where you are.

In the place of prayers, the holy ghost is working. Angels are working hard. 

Mighty things become easy when you are a prayerful leader. 

Pray for your members. Anyone you are not seeing, call their names.
Do you know the authority you have in the spirit over the souls of men?
 
All your members are connected to your spiritually. They cannot go astray. In the place of prayers you keep them.
As a leader, you don't have needs anymore. 
The call over rides your needs.
The prayer life of a cell leader is the prayer of the work God called you to do. 

When you become a cell leader over people, it's all encompassing. 
It's not about someone that didn't come to cell. 
Every cell member is a prospective pastor. There is no chance to let anyone stray.



## Reference to the Pauline Prayers.~5128

Ephesians 1:15-19
They were doing well, but he was still praying for them.

Philippians 1:9
Imagine that you pray this prayer for your brethren and their love now increases; they know the right things to do. They approve only excellent things. 

Pray this prayer pattern. 
When you pray this way, you can now expect this..

Colossians 1:9
Imagine every member having wisdom and spiritual understanding. 

If you can contemplate it, you can pray it. 

Ephesians 3:14
If you can focus on what God called you to do, every other thing will be taken care of. 
Imagine everyone being strengthened with might in their inner man.
The counseling will reduce. 
They won't need something external to strengthen them.

Galatians 4:19
The work of a cell leader is actually the work of a pastor. You are actually rehearsing pastoring.
The actual work starts when they have come in.
It's rewarding when you see those you prayed for, begin to see some things .

When you pray and travail for them, you will see the results. 
Is it really labor?
It's only for a short time. 
The result is so rewarding...like birthing a baby.

When you raised someone and tomorrow he is doing so much, the labor is no more labor. You celebrate.

Practice praying at 5am, midnight, etc. 

When you pray, you know that in the spirit you have addressed things. 

Prayer is no more work. It is exciting.

Pastor has many materials for us.

You are a priest in Ministry.

Our Work and Walk of Faith in Christ Jesus

Heb 11:1-2
Our history empowers our destiny. The man of God has given birth to us and his message has built us. Walking in the Lord; staying in the Lord. Walking in the vision.
Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.
The tensile nature of faith- STRONG FAITH
The centurion had GREAT FAITH, he believed in the word of Jesus.
The disciples on the boat, with Jesus had LITTLE  faith.
Abraham in Romans 4 didn't have WEAK faith for he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief.
Our walk of faith is a reflection of our faithfulness.
2 Tim 2:2-3
Your committment to and with the vision makes you a part of it. 
2 Corin 5:7
Faith is the response of the human spirit to God's Word. My response to God's Word produces faith; the ability to do. 
Heb 11:1-6
Consistency is involved in works of faith.
The consistency of the message. Letting you know you were born in a right place. I am a native of the right place. 
Ministry is a walk of faith.
WORKS OF FAITH
I am the product of the message.
I am the FOURTH MAN.
Our songs are consistent with the word of God and with the life of the saints.
AGELESSNESS
FEARLESSNESS
DEATHLESSNESS
WANTLESSNESS
In the responsibility is your provision. 
Think EXPANSION!
1 Corin 3:9-10
STAY IN THE MESSAGE
When you stay in the message, your prayer becomes effective.
WHO ARE YOU WALKING WITH?
Stay with the materials of our Ministry. 
NO DIFFICULT SOILS; Speak to it.

 CELLS WITHOUT LIMITS

Mark 16:15
Preach the gospel to EVERY CREATURE...
No limit. 

In the bible you see that word coming up many times "EVERY".

JESUS told his disciples, It is important that I go, because I don't go, the comforter cannot come. 

Jesus functioned in a human body and could only preach in a few places. But the Holy Spirit is unlimited. 
He is capable of being in everybody in every place at the same time in his fullness. 
The Devil is not the Holy spirits mate at all. 
The holy spirit is limitless and he is our advantage.

Limitation is nothing but a mindset. 
Ephesians 3:20
The power is in us already.

The ability of God is not contestable. The scope of his ability: exceeding, abundantly, above....

How big is your thinking?
The limit is how much you can think.
That power is in me right now. 
I have that power. 

See AMPC version. 
"Infinitely beyond our highest prayers, desires. ..."

As a cell limit, especially in the end time, there are no limitations.

2 Cor 10:3-5
This is not a cliché.
This is truly war. If you identify who is at war, it tells you what you have to do.
Pastor told us from the beginning, this was all planned against the church.
So many Christian's are still sitting on the sidelines asking questions. 
Brother, sister...wake up 
This is a war between the forces of light and the forces of darkness.

There is no neutral ground at all.

We are not dealing with human weapons. We are dealing with things that are spiritual and mental reasonings.

There are spiritual strategies. Higher things that we use to Confound the things that men use. 

The scripture says "men will be allergic to God". These are the kind of guys we are dealing with.

It's important to serve God with your spirit.
All things are possible to him that believes. 
It is possible for you to achieve anything.
You are able to do anything.

If we were able to bring in 1billion people out of the 5bn we have reached across the internet, how many PCFs will be need?
We would need at least 2.5m PCF leaders with 400 members each.

This means that at this point, everybody seated here should be a PCF leader. 

You can't believe with your mind. You believe with your mind. 
Believe in yourself, the message and the ministry. 

A cell must operate without limits 
At this point there must be no legalism.. 
We must affect our environment and effect ministry objectives. 

Philip was a Deacon, but when he went to Samaria, he though outside the box. He forgot his title, He saw his assignment. 
The title follows the assignment.
He was later on related to as "Philip the evangelist". 

A cell leader must begin his mission with the end in mind. 
You must see yourself as the church in that place.

Stop the mentality of "I don't want to be a Pastor". So what do you want to do?
In your office you want to make presentation, in church you want to be quiet?
We have passed that time.

As the one in that area, you must be ready. You must be able to see 6bn and your share of the 6bn in your catchment area. 
You must take advantage of every ministry platform, and even innovate because there are no limits. 

Who told you that you cannot have new bible study classes every week?

There are no limits. 
Go and Explode!
Go and take over!
Go and be all that you can be!

He paid for the whole world.
People without the holy spirit are planning to put a needle into everybody.
We too must have a deliberate plan to put the Holy Ghost into everybody. 

Don't be legalistic. 
No limits. 
Have a different mindset. 
Don't be territorial. If someone comes to a part of your catchment which hasn't been reached, it's not a problem.
We work together 

The time is short. The grace is much. 
We have to move.

A limit is a restriction on the size of something permissible or possible.
To stop something from going beyond a particular point. 

For us, there is no limit. 

1. The time is short. 
2. The work is great. 
This is the last hour. 
3. Every hand is required. 
Nobody can sit on the fence or be a spectat

CHRISTIANIZING YOUR ENVIRONMENT USING MINISTRY MATERIALS 

Over the years, the cell ministry has proven to be an effective tool given to our Man of God for consistent soul winning and soul development.

The cell leaders have been described as our foot soldiers spreading the message to every nation of the world. 

We have a message that works; that is producing the desired results in every nation of the world.

We are going to look at how to do more with our ministry materials.


CHRISTIANIZING your ENVIRONMENT means capturing your world for Jesus CHRIST using our ministry materials.

Ministry materials are the messages of our Man of God packaged in different formats to reach everyone. (Audio, video, books, hard and soft copies).
We want to make the message accessible to everyone.

Habakkuk 2:14.
This is your calling as a cell leader. Filling your environment with the knowledge of the glory of God.
We are depositing the truth to our environment.
In a world where there are so many voices, we are bringing the message of truth. 

This message has equipped each one of us for who we are today and it has been delivered into our hands to distribute.

Because it is different formats, there are no borders. No limitations.

We have the message that is going into china. Cells are going to come up in china. The man of God has said it, and it is going to be so in Jesus name. 

Our message is a message for this end time. It is for everyone. No one will be overlooked anymore. 
We will be flooding their environment.
It is not the enemy coming like a flood.. we are the ones coming in as a flood. 

Every locality, city, home, community of practice is carried along....as the waters cover the sea.

Ephesians 3:8-9
You are called to make all men see. 
The manifold wisdom of God is being made known by us through the ministry materials.
We are ordained for this 

Matt 24:14
You will fill your catchment with your doctrine in the name of Jesus. 
Our message is a message of power, hope, glory, beauty, excellence, dominion, Health, abundance and Life.  

You are depositing power, hope, glory, beauty, excellence, dominion, Health, Abundance and Life as you spread the materials.

You must first be a user of the message. You can't give what you don't have. 

We have PCDL where we have hundred of Pastors . materials packaged for your use on the go.

Next level, you distribute it in your catchment area. 
Do more with the ministry materials. 
Distribute through your cell. Take oversight of this responsibility.
Take many more steps. Take giant strides in doing this. 
Don't have an outreach without distributing ministry materials.

Go to the Hospitals as a cell. Order the materials in bulk and take them to the hospital. It is a message of Health.


NO OUTREACH WITHOUT MINISTRY MATERIALS.

Introduce people to the PCDL and help them download. 

Have an organized media group in your cell. They will help people sign up and download. 
Direct Teens attention to something more constructive.

Publicize our Loveworld TV app. They can receive inspiration from our Man of God 24/7.


The mandate now is 6 billion people at least 
As a cell leader, how many people are you planning to affect from this number?

What will you do with Ministry materials?
How will you engage people without the message?

Use the Rhapsody of Realities. 
As a cell, when are you going to do your first 1 million copies?

This is our mindset now!

The kingdom of God suffereth violence and only the violent take it by force. 
Keep pushing .

How many more translations will you sponsor as a cell?

How many healing centres will your cell be hosting for this forthcoming healing streams with our man of God?

The more healing centres we have, the more we reach out world. The more we paralyze sickness in your catchment. 
Your catchment must be delivered to our Man of God. 

As you saturate our environment with the word of God, it will be said that So mightily grew the word of God in..... And prevailed.

THE REWARD CONSCIOUS CELL LEADER

It's important to be reward conscious. Yes, we are compelled by our love for Jesus Christ but He told us something in Revelation 22:12

The time is closer than ever before. 
He said "I come quickly".
He actually wants to come quickly so that we can get our reward quickly.
He expects us to look forward to the reward. 

Jesus always brought our attention time and again to the fact that there is a reward for our service. 

This reward inspires a certain quality of work 

You are not rewarded for being a christian. Why? Salvation is a free gift with many benefits and effects (eternal life, fellowship, righteousness..). But you are rewarded for the work that you do. 

The reward will be based on the quality of work that you did.
The work has to be done according to the instructions of the one giving the work. 
There is an order and specification of what needs to be done. 

1. 
The inspiration of the reward makes you resolute. 

Hebrews 12:2. KJV, MSG.
Because of the reward, Jesus endured to the end. 
He could put up with anything along the way because of the reward ahead. He knew the glory that would follow. Luke 9:51 MSG

Whatever hardship we may be enduring, the reward of our service should be more than enough to propel us and keep us on. 
1 Peter 1:11.

What have you made up your mind for? What have you gathered up courage for to do after ICLC?

As a cell leader, make up your mind to do things to provoke your Pastors. 

The grace has been increased, and it is not for smaller works. 
Be greatly inspired by the reward you will receive from the Lord. 

Hebs 11:24 MSG. AMPC.
Moses anticipated the payoff. He looked to the reward. 

Let the reward inspire you. 

2.
The inspiration of the reward makes you serve according to due order so you don't lose the reward. 

1 Cor 9: 24-
You've got to be intentional and specific. 
what are you reaching? Who are you engaging?
V 27- Because of the reward you should be able to sacrifice. You don't have to be coerced to give up the pleasures and comforts that are comfortably yours. 

Don't shadow box. It's good to know that at the end of it all, Paul said "I have fought a good fight."

If you love his appearing, you will work like you do 


There is a general mission for the whole world, but there is a specific mission for you.

Are you going to grow your cell to a thousand?
Are you a global cell leader?.
All borders have been canceled. 


3.
The inspiration for reward makes you work harder. 
It makes you put in more. 
1 Cor 15:10
A man who is laboring abundantly than others is looking for a more abundant reward. 

Jesus said 'occupy till I come'. What  going to take?

4. 
The inspiration of the reward makes you to finish the work.
No unfinished work.
Partial work means partial reward. 

There are things that make you lose your reward. 
2 John 1:8

I don't want to lose anything. You want a perfect reward in full. 

Revelations 3:1-5. The church in Sardis was rebuked for not completing the work. He said their work was not perfect...

They thought they could get away with it but the Lord observed. 
He knows what you can do. 
They may clap for you that your cell hit 500, but He knows that you could have hit 1000.

It was only that church that He told that he wouldn't confess them before his Father.

No unfinished work.

The inspiration makes you go all out to finish the work 

Paul finished the work.
It is possible to finish and complete it. 

Between now and IPPC what would you have needed to complete?
Don't leave the work for this week for next week.

Psalm 2:8
Do you know the devil was trying to steal your possession last year?
Do you know what Population reduction means?
Jesus bought the whole field because of the treasure. 
The holy spirit was poured on the whole earth. 
Then someone said they want to reduce population by whatever percent.

Highly Esteemed Pastor Biodun Lawal~5170

A MILITANT CELL LEADER.  

when you understand the time and season we are living in, you would understand the mind of God for this season.

God has changed the kind of song he is singing in this season. 
In 2021, they are songs of war. 
Angels are preparing
Heaven is preparing for something.
God's plan has changed. Because the end of all things is at hand. 

Exodus 15: 1-3
V3 Moses didn't know this part of God until he saw what happened to Pharaoh.

We are in war time. 
We have to be awakened to that fact. 

Numbers 21:13- 14
God has a book of war. Where the warriors are recorded. Every act of God, every action. The Lord is involved in wars.
In 2021, there are things written in that book that must be carried out. 

We have found ourselves in a season and generation like this where they want to silence anything that has to do with God. 
God has written in his book of wars, that there will be a general and a crowd of soldiers . 

MILITANT: showing bold forcefulness in the pursuit of a goal.
A feeling of displaying the eagerness to fight 
(Every cell leader must be a fighter). 

Showing a desire or willingness to achieve something.
A protagonist who is excessively devoted to a cause. 

3 areas of Ministry to focus. 

1. Prayers
2. Ministry
3. Protagonist

These 3 areas of war. 

If we are going to reach 6 billion people we can't do the same things we used to do when reaching 100 members'. 

We will devote our time to excessive prayers. 
Until you pray, God will not show you the plan. 
God commissions you and shows you the road map in the place of prayers. 

When pastor said we are taking down China. I took it and prayed for 5 hours after the meeting. 

(When you sleep you lose money. )

When we close this camp, you go to another meeting. 
All night praying till you take that vision and condition your spirit. . suddenly his thoughts become your thoughts. 
We war with prophecy. 
We go back and take actions in the spirit .

China is taken
 It cannot be reversed. 
 Churches are springing up boldly and openly. 

This is a place of decision. The holy Ghost is here so strong. 

A MILITANT cell leader hears the word from the Commander and goes to pray while others are sleeping. 


We have work to do. We cannot afford to sleep..
If as a cell leader, you have a meeting, that night don't sleep.


A MILITANT cell leader is a champion for a cause.
He is an advocate for a cause. 
He takes the lead a d fights for a cause. 

Some of us after the session, still go somewhere to pray.... because.. There is a blessing that must go with you. 

1 Chronicles 12: 1-
These were good fighters. You are not a helper of the war if you lose the war. 
Faith and faithfulness must go together. 
You cannot be faithful and unfruitful. 

Every cell leader must not just be kingdom minded but war minded. 

We are good fighters. 

A MILITANT cell leader steps out ahead of others. He doesn't need too many people to achieve results. He one can make things happen. He is ready to step beyond the line. 

When a nation goes to war.
1. There are those who don't know a war is going on.
2. There are those aware of the war but are not participating.
3. There are those involved. 

The man of God has announced there is a war going. He has said 6bn people. What's your stake?

I am going for 6bn ROR

Those involved in the war must do something 

Exodus 13:18 MSG.
The Israelites left Egypt in Military formation. 
This was the mindset Moses gave the people. 

1. 
2 Tim 2:1-2
A MILITANT cell leader is a super spreader and defender of the vision. 

2.  
A MILITANT cell leader initiates strategic actions got growth and expansion. 

3. 
A MILITANT cell leader does not get involved fighting in the wrong wars. 
2 Chro 35:20.

The devil's strategy is not to stop you from war but to get you in the wrong war. 
(Fighting for your Job, family , etc)

4.
A MILITANT cell leader understands the place of strategic relationship



## ICLC 2021 DAY 3

President's Session 
Saturday Afternoon.~5172

Rev Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DD

🎶 the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty. 
He will save, he will rejoice over thee with Joy.

He will rest in his love
He will rest in his love
He will Joy over thee with singing. (DC)🎶
Zeph 3:17

Doesn't that tell you how God lives singing?
Wonderful.

We are going to look at a few things.
Today is Saturday.
And in a short while, following this, we will be having an awards segment. 
We will be looking at 2 years under review. 

From the messages you've been. Listening to since Thursday, I'm sure you've gained a lot already. You are going to use the word for your life. 
Use it first for yourself then those who hear you. 
Use it to encourage, edify, inform yourself. To inspire you. Build your life on it and help others do the same. 

Our ministry to others can be far more successful if we recognize our primary ministry to God. 
You have to have your ministry to God. That's a priority. 
Then your ministry to others will be fruitful and successful.
Without a ministry to God, your ministry to others will have less value and after a while, will be quenched. 

So, your ministry to God is a primary importance. 
Never put your ministry to others ahead of your ministry to God. Many have done that in their lives and ministries and it didn't work out quite well. 
Some even at the end of their ministry didn't know what was the problem because they were not taught. 

In our ministry to others, we find 3 important things that we talked about before. 

We see how they used 3 things to make the impact that they made. 

These 3 elements:
1. The spirit
2. The word
3. The Name.

These Three they used in ministering to others. 
The spirit gave the power. 
The word gave/was the message. 
The Name gave the authority.

That's the way they ministered to their world.
If you had the power, message and authority, you made the impact. 
Yes!
But if you want to have sustained impact and not fall by the wayside like some did. 

Even in the bible there were names given to us that didn't do so well. Some even went back into the world like Demas. 
But you want to be successful, sustain it and to have ever increasing faith, grace, knowledge, love, vision, ministry and glory, then you've got to do this other one that is priority. 

THE MINISTRY OF THE SANCTUARY.

Oh how important it is. 
Look at the old Tabernacle of Moses and how it was arranged. 
If you take a look at this drawing...(vertical representation of the Tabernacle)
He told Moses to have the outer court: the brazen altar of brass where sacrifices were made and the priests washed their hands. , Before they entered the Tabernacle, The Holy place. 

When Jesus died, the way into the Most Holy place was torn in two. The operation of the most holy place on earth ceased. 
The Aaronic priesthood had moved to Jesus.
Matthew 27:50-51
Hebrews 7:12-16, 22-28
Hebrews 8:1-5
Hebrews 9:24

When the high priest on earth entered into the holy place, it was for the people. So also Jesus did for us. 

We are not going to deal with the ministry of the high priest because Jesus is doing that in Heaven 


In the Holy Place, you observe 
The table of showbread
The candlestick/lampstands/menorah
The Altar of Incense (just before the veil)

These were the three articles of furniture in the holy place.

Let's start with the Menorah.
A candle stick with 6 branches. 3 on either side. 
When the priests lit the lamps, you would have 7 lamps. 

Exodus 25:31-32
If you go into your Bible in Revelations 4:5.
7 lamps of fire burning, which are the 7 spirits of God. 
The presence of the spirit. 
These 7 candles burning from one Candle stick. 

Immediately distinguish between the candle stick with 7 lamps burning and 7 candlesticks. 

Rev 1:12-  Here there are 7 golden candlesticks. 
V 13- 20 "In the midst of the 7 candlesticks"

The 7 candlesticks were the seven churches. 


In the sanctuary, there was the lampstand/menorah.



## WORDS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH....~5175

Rev Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DD

One of the areas that Satan would like to take advantage of you is your health. 

First thing you need to recognize and consider seriously about your health is that 
1. the word of God is pure medicine.
It is true. 
Meditation on the word in no small measure in keeping your health sound. 

Meditate on the word like someone that's taking drugs. 
Take this very seriously. 
Don't wait for trouble to strike before looking for where to meditate. 
.meditate on the word regularly. 

2. Be sensitive to the holy spirit about what you take and what you don't take. 
When you come to an age of maturity, your feeding goes beyond what you like or what you don't like 
People who eat based in what they like are babes. 
Princes who know their stuff don't eat for every making. They eat for strength. 
Eat for the purpose of what the food does in you. 
You become wise about food.
What you like or don't like became a thing of choice at a certain point in your life. If you are sensitive to the spirit you start knowing what to eat and what not to think. 
You will not be committed to eating carelessly because you are growing in wisdom.
Be sensitive to the Holy spirit because he wants to guide you about your health. 

Don't let others use Google guide you about what to eat and what not to eat. 
Allow the holy spirit to guide you.

It's very easy for him to lead you. Once you are willing he will lead you 

3. Give up those things that you try to use in keeping yourself awake or in trying to sleep. 

You will sleep and wake up when you want to. 
Don't depend on things to help you sleep or to keep you awake. They are not very good for you. 
As a man of the spirit, start practicing how not to put yourself into the hands of men. 

By the time doctors and Nurses have to be taking care of you, you can't make decisions. You don't want to get there. 
God can take care of your health if you cooperate with him.

Use the word. The wisdom of the word is important. The sensitivity of the spirit is important. You don't need anything to stay awake or sleep. 

If you speak in tongues, you will go to sleep. 
Don't look at your device if watch TV if you want to sleep.

For all Pastors, remember that you are serving the Lord Christ. 
Never look to man for the finances you need. 
Sometimes, you may be tempted to be expectant from man. But don't allow that temptation trick you.  Don't fall into that temptation 
Don't look at your congregation to size your income.
There is no proof in the word that the money you need must come from your Congregation.

When they give what they are able to give, between you and God, He can give you what you need.

Never allow yourself to rely on men for your finances. It's a deception. When they give it's for their blessing. You have the word of blessing in your mouth.
Don't find yourself expecting from certain individuals. 
If you expect from God he will perform a miracle.
Really, to God it is not a miracle. 
He is not a worker of miracles. He is sitting. All his works are completed. 

We exercise our faith on the word and out the word to work.
His work is already in our spirits and we exercise that work living by the spirit. 
When you want more money, look to the word 
Don't look at faces. Or else you will be discouraged. 
What is inside you? What can your father cause to come out from inside you? Don't look at the congregation. 
Sometimes surprise your congregation.
It's not everything you tell them to raise money for.
Then, they believe more in your ministry.

This second part of the year, you can surpass your dream. 
Look beyond faces. Look beyond men.
Sow your seeds for the purpose of doing something to your own faith. 
"My faith will produce results in the name of Jesus".

If a giving Congregation A, pastored by Pastor A, and a Pastor B, with a lacking Congregation B. 
If you swap the pastors, the results will also swap. 
Because it was not the people. It was his ability to create wealth within them.

It's something that you have to learn very quickly.

As you leave here, there is a new empowerment, 
there is a new power, 
there is a new Strength, 
there is a new unction, 
there is a new Grace.
Take my Word, take my presence to regions beyond, to where nobody is.

You don't need  to be there, but you can  speak it from where you are.
Speak to the airwaves in those cities. Speak to the radio stations in those cities, that tye programs go on there and it shall come to pass 
What you say shall come to pass.

You are the Light of the world you cannot be hidden,
You're the city on the hill, you cannot be hidden. 
Your words are in top of every authority.
The Mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established on all other mountains.
I said it is the last days. So speak, see with the eyes of the faith, see with the eyes of the spirit and speak. 
Your words cannot be quenched, your words cannot be stopped.

Nobody can stop you
No border can stop you.
No authority can stop you.
No law can stop you.
Even when they promulgate the laws, ignore them. Go ahead, the mountains are fallen down flat
The walls of Jericho came down flat and these walls will come down flat.
My Word has not changed
The devil was defeated before, it has not changed.
His defeat is still on, 
It has not changed.
He is defeated
His words are fallen down flat.
So says the Spirit of God.

## Global Day of Prayer
June 25th~5271

Rev. Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DD

I want to welcome you to the Global day of prayer
And we give praise to God for the opportunity that he's given us to serve him in these closing days of the church age. 

The documentary that you just saw is to remind you of many things that we talked about before and how our world has been affected with so many changes. 

2 Tim 3: 1 (AMP, TLB)
Difficult days. Perilous times. This will happen in the last days. 
It will be very difficult to be a Christian.

To be a Christian you have to know and live by the word. How can you live by the word that you don't know? How can that happen?

Thank God that we have a chance to pray all around the world. And this prayer day is round the clock from now to Saturday evening. 
By the 24th hour we start the closing session. 
We have many ministers of the gospel who will be leading us in prayer and sharing with us. Pastor Benny Hinn will be with us Tonight as well as the closing session.

Make up your mind that you're going to give attention to prayer. 
Men ought always to pray and not faint. 

I told you that covid19 was man-made. I told you about Wuhan china. I told you about Americans involvement. And I was 100% right. 

We have found out that the very man who was told to help flatten the curve was the very same person who paid for it to be manufactured. 
The virus didn't escape from the lab but was planned to seem so.

The man who did it was not alone. His emails have come out. 
He acknowledged in his emails that masks don't work and don't stop the virus from spreading. 
His plan was to spread the virus.

The various Governments that insist on masks are not doing so because it stops the spread, but because it is a symbol of control. 
Look at Israel; as soon as the leftist government came in, they reversed the mask mandate to ensure people go back to using it. 

God did not give them the power, so they can't have it.
Think about the destruction, havoc and deaths that these sycophants caused throughout the world. Livelihoods completely decimated. They had no pity. 
The reset that was designed by the world economic forum. 
They all knew that the vaccine was not a vaccine. 
You just heard the CEO of Moberna call it the software of life. 

Many who took the vaccine have become magnetic in the place where they took the Jab. 

(Video of a man who's body lights up at the Jab spot)

It's insane for sure. Think about that. Is that what you want?
I told you they want to turn humans into devices. 
I told you about IOT (internet of things). It was about you all the time; to make you a controllable device. 

Once it is introduced into your body, they can't take it out. That's the trouble. they have said so themselves. 
I told you, it was the platform for the mark of the beast. 

When you took the vaccine, you though you were only going to take one. Now they said you need several. And that every year you need another Jab.

Right now, it's on the left hand... just relax, very soon they are going to move it to the right hand. 

This is the preparation of the mark of the beast. Human control.
Right from the early 1800s, scientists have been warning about Vaccines and their future use. 

There are those who get upset against those labeled as "antivaxxers". 
But there is no scientific proof that vaccines work. 

There is actually more prof of harms from vaccines. They have been a hoax from the beginning and that's why these sycophants through it found a way to control human beings. 
The same people who champion population reduction; how can they produce vaccines to save your life?

There are simple truths that we have to remind ourselves. God has given us wisdom. Many times they don't want us to think. 
They hate people who can think. 

They had said that the claim that it came of a lab was a conspiracy theory...but now they know it is not. 

Then think about it: The vaccine doesn't stop the virus from spreading. It gives no immunity
Cannot stop the spread.



## GLOBAL DAY OF PRAYER
DAY 2~5280

Rev Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DD

I'd like to welcome you to this final session of the global prayer day.

The most important part of prayer is God answering. If he didn't answer then prayer would be useless. 
Prayer was God's idea. 
If prayer was our idea, then we would struggle to get his response. 

Yesterday we talked about a lot of things with respect to COVID-19 band it's attendant problems. 

Several months ago, it was almost a taboo. You were not allowed to talk about it publicly like I did. We were censored by several media houses. 
They didn't want us to talk about it or 5G, etc

The reason they didn't want us to talk about the was because that was were their fraud was. 
On certain occasions we were censored. 

More and more it's becoming common knowledge around the world that something terrible happened orchestrated that was caused by those who were profering solution.

Covid was the reason why we started praying in the first place, so I'd like to address it. 

Covid was never a pandemic. The WHO lied. They didn't tell the truth and they knew it.

When information first came out that the spot were people got the Jab was becoming magnetic, fake media sponsored fact checkers to deny. Some CDC claimed that it wasn't true. 
Some of them eventually took out their posts cos they couldn't explain it. 

Yesterday, I showed you a video of a man whose body was lighting up a bulb from a man who took the vaccine. Some were getting connected to Bluetooth...

(Videos on magnetic spots)

This was no vaccine. I told you from the beginning.

There is a retired police officer who carried out a thorough investigation on this. I will just let his video speak. He raised a lot of questions that governments need to answer. 
Listen carefully and observe how far he had to go to get the attention of government on the terrible things that are happening. 

Listen to the documents that he reads from and the efforts that he made. He points at several things that we raised.

E.g. if this was a pandemic where are the people that died? Where have they been buried?
They have all been lying. 

(Video playout of police officer who conducted research in the UK... "The PCR tests were a terrorist attack against us".)

(Menstrual irregularities, blood clots, miscarriages, infertility, heart inflammation and liver issues will be the side effects of the current covid vaccine. The PCR tests are contaminated with Hydrogel and Lithium. All PCR kits are made in China)



Interesting! You can understand the great detail to which the gentleman went to gather information, raise the right questions to the right people... And I hope you take that seriously.
These are questions we have raised and I am glad that this gentleman has the documents to substantiate his resources and contacts.

In the light of what you just heard...
There was no pandemic
They created the virus
They posted figures that were lies 
The PCR tests were a fraud. Purposely contaminated. 
So what's happening with people who are getting tested for Covid?

The man who made the test kit made it clear that it was never for diagnosis.
It doesn't diagnose covid 19. 

Remember, what got us into this praying was Covid19, so I must address the issue.

Where are the dead bodies?
It's a lie and the perpetrators must be brought to book.

Between March and now, so many revelations have come out.... including the guy the created the virus, who no longer can hide and they are calling for his resignation.

He was hired to help flatten the curve, but h was the brain behind it.
It was like asking a thief to help you find what was stolen. It will never be found.
His emails have been posted. If you look at them, it's a shame what he did. 




Before we go into praying today, I need to put in perspective of prayer in the New testament and prayer in the old testament.




5 important things to recognize in your prayer.



## Daily Juice~5294

There's no challenge you face that is greater than you. The world cannot place a limit on you; don't place a limit on yourself. Challenges will come but how you respond to them defines your character and the quality of your personality. Remember, life will not wait for you, decide what you want and go for it. You can never grow above the level of your thought life; watch the depth of your thoughts, for as you think so are you. The world around us takes up the properties of our thoughts and words. Through our thoughts and words, we can influence how the world around us takes form. Don't let other people bring you down. Sometimes, some people need to leave your life for some things to start happening. The energy you surround yourself with determines the happenings in your life. Learn how to be independent of circumstances.



## Daily Juice~5300

Activity is not synonymous to progress and productivity. Simplify your life. Your daily routines are the deciding factors of your future. Too many people see too much, hear too much and consider too many things, and too many things easily get their attention. Their priorities have been wrongly placed and it is slowly eating them up. We must simplify our lives or we are going to lose terribly. You cannot go far if you are easily distracted by people and things that have nothing to do with your goal. No negative emotion is worth holding on to when you consider what it is doing to you. Countless people today are making themselves sick over things that don't count because they let things get to them. The only person who can make you act in an unloving way is you. Only you can decide how you act.



## Daily Juice~5303

Don't just get obsessed with yourself and with your goals; God cannot go far with a man who only thinks of himself. Show interest in the lives of others; it'll bring joy to yours! Our society overflows with critics and fault finders. People quickly point out what you are doing wrong, but relatively few take the time to point out anything you are doing right. Never mind, but don't live life like that. Everyone you meet needs some sorts of encouragement. Learn to appreciate and build people up rather than condemn and tear them down. God puts people in our lives on purpose so we can help them become not what we want them to be but what He wants them to be. You have a lot to offer. Your life has significance and you can make a difference. There is something in you for the betterment of someone else. You are an answer to the cry of millions because everyone you touch has the potential of touching someone else. When people come around us, they should leave better off than they were previously.



## Daily Juice~5339

Complaining is a vain way of explaining pain without gaining relief. Keep complains distances away from you. We need to see with new eyes. When you get a different vantage point, it changes your perspective. It allows you to see things you should have seen a long time ago. The possibilities in our lives change when our perspective changes. Our lives are built by a series of thoughts, much as bricks are used to build a house. If your thoughts are inferior, your life will be inferior; but if your thoughts are lofty and honourable, you are laying the foundation to live accordingly. There is creativity in your DNA. Don't put yourself in a box. Nothing limits achievement like small thinking— nothing expands possibilities like thinking outside of the box. Surpass your limit. Subject your thoughts to God's thoughts because you will never have more or go farther or accomplish greater things than your thoughts will allow you.



## Daily Juice~5352

Give yourself order to be focused. God is setting you up for something greater. The enemy thinks he's using the challenges to hold you back. The truth is, all things are working together for your good to push you forward. God doesn't counter attack the works of the devil, what He does is that He brings out good out of it. It's Satan that sees God doing something great and He counter attacks with bad but never mind, keep doing the Word. Remember, God didn't bring light into darkness, rather He brought out light from the darkness. Keep your head up high. God gives His hardest battles to His strongest soldiers. Don't allow the challenges of life make you think less of yourself. An arrow can only be shot by pulling it backward. When life seems to be dragging you "back" with challenges, it means it's going to launch you into something greater. All thing work together for good...not just good things...ALL THINGS!



## Daily Juice~5356

Every atmosphere has a voice, and it echoes the voice of its occupants. You create your own atmosphere for the sake of your destiny with words. Frame your life with God's word; you can't have a life that is different from your words. Whatever we have today is a function of our present revelation. Growth starts from within. Until your excuses give way to your strong desire for a change, change is not in view. It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark; you don't prepare for war in the time of war. Stop running around and leaving your life to chance. You can't wish your desires into reality. Do an appraisal on your life and find what is working and enhance it and also what is not working and change your strategy! Put a demand on yourself. Success is not accidental, success is more than principles, true success is spiritual. Life is beyond the intelligence of a man, life is spiritual. Ignorance is very costly; It's too risky not to know some things.



## Daily Juice~5360

Your obedience is a proof of your humility. Sometimes, when God wants to bless someone, He brings a person into his life, and also, when God wants to protect you, He removes a person from your life. Your reaction to a man of God determines God's reaction to you. Unwillingness to submit deprives God of the authorization to protect. God will not advance His instructions beyond your last act of disobedience. Remember, anything you do in an attempt to please God will not go unrewarded.



## Daily Juice~5370

Enjoy your own life without comparing it with that of others. Life is like an exam. Many people fail because they try to copy others, not realizing everyone has a different question paper. The easiest thing to be in the world is you, and the most difficult thing to be is what other people want you to be. Don't waste the opportunity given you to live someone's life. You have a unique contribution to make to the world. No one else can make your contribution for you. You possess a one-of-a-kind combination of potentials, passions, divine skills; there is something you bring to your work that no one else could. If you relinquish that power living someone else's dream, then your purpose and dream will never see the light of day. If we become a copy of what people want us to be, then we won't have the joy that only comes from the fulfillment of our divine purpose.



## Daily Juice~5396

You can't function with an expired or old mind and get into a new phase of your life. Get new information, new attitudes that will give birth to new actions. You are the architect of your life. Take charge of your life and your ultimate success depends on the choices you make. Stop wasting time on unimportant things. Where your attention goes, your time goes and where your time goes, your life goes. Keep track of your time. Bring order into your life; great things are never birthed from a disordered life. Stop pressing rewind on things that need to be deleted from your life. Project yourself forward! You can't do big things if you are easily distracted. Distractions destroy actions. Starve your distractions, feed your focus. Your results are the product of either your personal focus or distractions. Stop getting distracted by things that have nothing to do with your goals.



## Daily Juice~5405

God does not answer selfish prayers! Why do you want what you are asking for? Sometimes God's answer to our prayer is as much in the nature of the asker as in the asking. The heart attitude behind your prayer interests God much more than the actual words you say. That you got what you wanted does not necessarily mean it came from God or that God is pleased with it. If you'll spend quality time with God, your desires will synchronize with His desires, and you'll not have issues trying to find out what He desires, because His desires will become one with your desires.



## Daily Juice~5420

Discouragement is one of the devil's favourite tool to use against you. Refuse to be discouraged by what you're going through. Be patient; your time is coming. What God is giving you requires preparation, focus, commitment and patience. He's not about preparing the blessing for you, the blessing is already there but rather, He is preparing you for the blessing. Refuse to compare your life to anyone else's or let the successes of others discourage you, rather be inspired by the successes or testimonies of others. But remember, that others are succeeding does not mean you're failing. You have not come this far to settle for less or to give up now; you are God's best! Don't allow the happening around you, a few setbacks get inside you and weigh you down or the hate slow you down. You may be feeling tired or discouraged but remember, you are not a feeling. Stay the course; your testimony is coming; it's closer than imagined.



## Daily Juice~5426

What's your thoughts gathering to your life? It's often said, mind your language, but we need to also mind our minds! The health of your mind heavily influences the quality of your decisions and your ability to maintain focus and invariably determines the quality of your personality. The mind is not a “Thing”. The mind is an activity, an image-maker, a creator and the mind operates by law. Whatever is impressed upon the mind must be expressed. Whatever you think about, you bring about. Be choosy and picky what you give your mind to. Never think about what you don't want; refuse to entertain ideas you don't want showing up in the canvass of your life. Don't sit around gossiping, whining, complaining and griping like other people; put it out of your life. We can't be thinking like we used to and expect to live a different kind of life.



## Daily Juice~5436

The secret for change is by the word, because if the word gets into you, it becomes a God and a force in you that creates an atmosphere around your life and gives your life divine direction and acceleration! The success of a man is not by accident. Your life is built by what you expose it to. The training you expose and give your mind and body to is what they respond to. However, the training of your spirit is of utmost importance. Give yourself training through the Spirit to the word.  The word will teach you how and what to think.



## Daily Juice~5451

The ability to be successful and peaceful starts with your attitude. Never be fearful of the future. You are the one who carries the touch of Light for yourself and many others. Think and feel blessed and loved, it'll create and attract an aura of blessings around you! To think you will fail is a misconception. Release and detach yourself from every person, every circumstance, every condition, and every situation that no longer serves a divine purpose in your life. Life is in phases and seasons, and certain phases and seasons must come to an end. Don't force to stay a season or phase that should go. You can create a new season, filled with purposeful thoughts and divine activities.



## Daily Juice~5471

Your life has been fashioned and planned by God for good. There's no desire in your heart that God has not already fulfilled. Your challenge isn't new to God! Stop over thinking and quit making up problems that don't exist. Grace is something God did for you prior to you having a need for it. God extended His grace to you before you even existed. Before the problem came into existence, God had created the solution. Every good thing is in the now of your life and you are in the now of every good thing. All of God's blessings are in your life. Align and synchronize your thoughts and words with this. Your voice is the activation code. Voice your miracles; don't wait for them to happen first. If you believe in God, believe in miracles. To believe in God and not expect a miracle is a contradiction and a misnomer. Everyday, there's favour assigned for you; look out for it and you will find it. Your thoughts release signals and affect things around you and also attract those things that are consistent with it. Discipline your mind to make things happen in your direction.



## Daily Juice~5477

Time doesn’t heal emotional pain, you need to learn how to let go. If you look up to others for joy and happiness, you may never find it. You deserve to be happy and have a life you are excited about. Part of the reason for the way people turn out differently has to do with the values they develop for their lives and the way they see life and respond to life. Nobody will make you happy until you 're happy with yourself first. If you don't like yourself, you can't make a success out of yourself and you can't like someone else because you can't give what you don't have. You can still be happy during the process of achieving something. God never attached your joy to something or someone; your joy is in Him. Happiness is a choice not a result. Deal with worries before they deal with your happiness. Refuse to allow circumstances steal your joy!



## Daily Juice~5482

You are God's product; He sponsors no flops. Believe in yourself and have faith in the ability He has given to you.  Understanding who are and your uniqueness makes you outstanding on this earth. Accept yourself, value yourself, forgive yourself, love yourself, improve yourself and be a wise master to yourself. There's no one better; you are the best of you! To wish you were someone is a waste of the divine skill and ability you were made with. Quit trying to be someone else- you are beautiful, unique and endowed! Never let the fear of what other people think stop you from being you. God doesn't want a second-rate version of you, He wants a first-rate version of what He has created you to be. Project yourself forward. You can do better than you think. God has already empowered you; you are excellent than you think. Remember, the image you place on yourself is proportionate to your success in life.



## Daily Juice~5493

The minute you realize your worth, you shift your energy to attract new people who respect your worth. It starts with you first. None was born to wake up every day to impress you. Don't look for happiness in another; you don't need the approval of another to be happy. Find happiness in yourself. Life is not about the quantity of friends you have. It is about the quality of friends you have. It's not about who's real to your face; It's about who stays loyal behind your back!



## Daily Juice~5506

Why put your happiness in the hands of someone. Don't live a frustrated life just because someone whom you think doesn't like you. Enjoy your life. If you don't enjoy yourself, no one will enjoy you. Learn to appreciate and be happy about Yourself! Stay focused. We often get sidetracked because we are worrying too much about whose watching, what they are thinking and what's being said. Opinions are not results! People can assume all they want but they will never be able to predict your next winning move. Only you can determine that!



## Daily Juice~5547

Don't be a giant that is being intimidated by a dwarf! We, too often over-emphasize challenges and over estimate things only in physical terms and we forget who we are in Christ and the Greater One in us. Life is spiritual. We don't engage in spiritual matters with physical weaponry. In the eyes of God, in the realm of the spirit, David was the giant and Goliath was a dwarf. Physically, Goliath was about twice as tall as David, but David was far bigger on the inside than Goliath was on the outside, and that's what really counts. It doesn't not matter what's happening on the outside or how the challenge looks on the outside, what matters is, when you recognize who you are and the Greater One on the inside, you'll find you are a giant who has long been intimidated by dwarfs!



## Daily Juice~5560

Don't let your habits become handcuffs. Anger will cost you more than you realize. A quick temper will pull you back and short circuit your destiny if you don't do anything about it. Quit saying and attributing it as your weakness. Get this- In Christ, there's no weakness. If you are distressed by someone or anything external, you have given it the power to influence you, and the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to change at any moment. Don't destroy yourself by allowing negative people add  dirts and debris to your character and purpose. Focus on God's purpose for your life. Purpose is an essential element of you. It's the reason you are on earth at this particular time. Your very existence is wired and wrapped up in the things you are here to fulfill.



## Daily Juice~5600

Don't let your habits become handcuffs. Anger will cost you more than you realize. A quick temper will pull you back and short circuit your destiny if you don't do anything about it. Quit saying and attributing it as your weakness. Get this- In Christ, there's no weakness. If you are distressed by someone or anything external, you have given it the power to influence you, and the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to change at any moment. Don't destroy yourself by allowing negative people add  dirts and debris to your character and purpose. Focus on God's purpose for your life. Purpose is an essential element of you. It's the reason you are on earth at this particular time. Your very existence is wired and wrapped up in the things you are here to fulfill.



## Daily Juice~5611

The fact that you are going through some challenges doesn't necessarily mean you've done something wrong. Don't allow the circumstances of life deceive you about God's love for you. Stop living in regret, it's not over yet; worrying does not produce miracles. Don't look down on yourself because of what you may be going through. The most amazing things in life tend to happen right at the moment you're about to give up; just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, it became a butterfly. It's never too late to be who God has designed you to be. As long as you keep waking up in the morning, is proof positive that God isn't through with you yet. You may not be able to control every situation and its outcome but you can control your attitude and how you respond to it. We are each the master of our own reality; life is what you make of it! Always remember that your present situation is not your final destination; your best is yet to come! Don’t give up because things are difficult; push yourself more! One bad chapter doesn't mean your story is over. Sometimes, things get worst before they get better.



## Daily Juice~5634

When God looks at you, He sees things that others do not see and ignore. Lighten up, laugh more, and don't get so worked up about things. There is so much inside you, and you have what it takes to make the most out of life! You are an embodiment of potentials and opportunities. Don't wait for life to make things happen for you, with your words, take yourself to the next level of your life by making things happen. Stop wishing you looked like someone else or wishing people like you as much as they liked someone else. That will only make you unhappy, and especially unhappy with yourself. Accept no one's definition of your life if it's inconsistent with God's definition of you; define yourself through God's word. The pen that writes your life's story must be held in your hands, particularly in your mouth. Refuse to be intimidated by life's challenges, no matter how tough they are, they'll bow to your destiny.



## Daily Juice~5683

Don't drift through life aimlessly; be intentional about your life and track your progress. Your success or failure is hidden in your daily routine. Your daily routines are deciding your future. Nothing changes until what you do daily changes. Our future is formed through our daily routines. Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant. What you are doing daily determines the direction your life is going. Nothing will ever dominate your life unless it happens daily. There are several distractions that life offers you but you have a responsibility for yourself to remain focused. The battle of life is for your mind; the battle of your mind is for focus. A disorganized person cannot make any meaningful progress. Being more focused, ordered and organized would do you a lot more good than you could realize. When life gets blurred, don't quit, adjust your focus and set your sail. Never gaze at something that does not belong to your future because it might come to your world.



## Daily Juice~5695

Whatever takes a hold of your mind takes a hold of your life. Turn your attention away from the challenges of life unto God and praise God amidst the challenges for praise is warfare. Think towards God, don't make your challenges your focus; It's a distraction. Refuse to be dominated by it. Remember, whatever your predominant focus is, that is what you permit to exit in your life. What you focus on grows and energy flows in that direction.



## Daily Juice~5721

Don't put yourself in a box because of people. Love yourself as God loves you not as people love you. Never seek your importance or worth through the standards of the world or through the eyes of others. You don't need the approval of others to be happy or depend on compliments to feel good about yourself. If you see yourself through the eyes of those who don't value you, you'll have inferior thoughts about yourself, and if your thoughts about yourself are inferior, your life will go in that direction. The truth is, you'll never rise above the image you have of yourself in your mind. Remember, you cannot grow above your thought level about yourself; if by chance you do, life will bring you back to the level of your thoughts about yourself.



## Daily Juice~5739

Having a kind heart in a cruel world does not mean weakness, it shows courage. Don't allow what your eyes see change what your heart believes. Stop attributing your problems to other people and your environment. The environment is not the limit, your belief system is. You don't need to blow off another's candle, for it won't make yours shine brighter. Don't feel unimportant and insecure when someone else does something remarkable. There's something unique only you can do, do it and make the world a better place! There's a beautiful world inside of you. Look inward and superimpose that world into your world with the You in you.



## Daily Juice~5742

You may pray wrongly but you cannot praise wrongly. If you knew what happens in the spirit when you praise God, you would praise Him everyday. Carve out time each day and lavishly praise God. Don't allow circumstances or situations make you forget this. These words that are coming to you aren't just for today, they are for a brighter future. If God wants to do something for an individual or a people, He sends His word. Words are connectors. Words do not only connect you  with other people, words also connect you with God. Words are your bridge between the spiritual and physical realms. Be grateful to God for the words coming to you. By predestination, you were born to hear these words; they are part of your destiny. He had already planned before the existence of time that you would hear these words because they are not unplanned. They are already preprogrammed by God to produce success in you and for you.

We can become so obsessed with our goals and the things we want to accomplish for God that we neglect our fellowship with Him. He takes your relationship with Him topmost, meaning, He is more interested in your walk with Him than in what you do for Him. Remember, success before the eyes of men does not necessarily mean success with God. When people draw back or get too busy to have fellowship with God, they fail in whatever God has assigned for them to do, it's only a matter of time.



## Daily Juice~5860

Every possibility you are praying for is already within and around you. You attract it by honour through discernment. Honour must be an integral part of your life, if not, life may be difficult for you. Honour is a weapon; it's not only the sword that wins. You cannot attract what you despise. What you respect, you'll attract. Anyone who gives honour will undoubtedly be honoured, and honour is the seed for longevity. When you are being forced or reprimanded to honour those whom God has placed over you, then there's a problem. There are some challenges that may not go no matter how long you pray until you begin to honour those whom God has placed over you. There are opportunities that wouldn't be opened by prayers but by honour.



## Daily Juice~5867

Many times, we pray, fast and bind demons when the real problem is just our attitude. Your gifts may take you to places but your lack of character will pull you down. Work on your character and attitude towards life and how you relate with people. Sometimes, the answer you seek is in someone else. We see people go through challenges for some protracted period of time, and it appears nothing seems to be changing. Check your attitude. As important as prayer is, you cannot get by prayer what you should get by character and service. Remember, a prayer that doesn't change you from within is a waste of time.



## Daily Juice~5878

Your life has a purpose and a meaning. You are a unique part in a divine plan, but you can't litter negativity everywhere and then wonder why you've got the kind of life you have. The secret to a transformed life is what goes on in your mind. The everyday quality of your life depends on you. The creation of your life is in your hands. Your thinking is your character, your talking is your life. Principles and beliefs that you consciously and unconsciously hold and live by determine the course of your life. If your principles are given to you by this world's system, the activities in your life will be coloured by the world's system. Let your principles and beliefs come from the Master's Manual, and with it, you screen the things that come to your mind and out of your mouth.



## Daily Juice~5883

Your situation didn't meet God unawares. After you have prayed, live as an answer to your prayer; be the answer to your prayer. Quit giving the situation all that attention and don't give it the power it doesn't have. There are certain things that will not change unless you change; outgrow that challenge. Be careful who you go to and where you go to for help. Your help is in the Lord! Never take your eyes away from God. Anything that takes your eyes away from God is an impending disaster. It's not every open door that is for you, some open doors are traps.



## Daily Juice~5923

Given our present-day situations, we have the choice of how we are going to respond. Society can’t make us respond a particular way. Our circumstances can’t make us have behavioral problems. It’s our choice. When God created us, He gave us the ability to choose. Just as we have the ability to choose eternal life or death, we have the ability to choose to praise God in all situations. If you let people's perception of you dictate your behaviour, you'll never praise God and you'll not grow as a person. Refuse to allow someone's opinion of you drag you into a pit of unhappiness that you refuse to praise God. God gave us choice. He doesn’t force the choice on us, and Satan cannot force us into any decision. It’s our choice. Life is not a product of circumstances but a product of decisions! God's instruction is our choice because His instruction is our life. Choose to praise the Lord for praise is an expression of faith. You can fix that situation with praise.



## Daily Juice~5940

God cares about those whom you associate with. Take a look at your friends, that's what you're going to be like in a few years. If your friends are winners, givers, focused, if they have a spirit of excellence, integrity, motivated, positive, then those good qualities will rob off on you. When you are with them, you are investing your time wisely, they'll make you better. But if you hang out with people that are undisciplined, unmotivated, not going anywhere, saucy and sloppy. Let me give you some great advice; find some new friends. You cannot become who God created you to be hanging out with them. They may be good persons but your destiny is too great, your assignment is too important, your time is too valuable to let them drive you down. Some people, the only thing that's keeping them from attaining a new level in their destiny is wrong friendships.



## Daily Juice~5963

Your challenges don't bring glory to God. God doesn't use the tools of the devil to teach His children a lesson; He teaches and trains His children with His Word. If God loves you enough to send His only Son to die for you, then doesn't He love you enough to bring about His will in your life if you would cooperate with Him? You may know some things about God, but if you really knew God's love for you, you wouldn't doubt Him so easily or question His willingness to help you. He couldn't be discredited so easily if you really understood how much He cared for you. Most times, our human relationships are imperfect, so they aren't a perfect parallel to God's relationship with us. He wants us to be assured that we can trust Him to act in our best interest no matter what the situation is. Get to know God so well for yourself that no one, circumstance or situation can talk you out of God's goodness towards you.



## Daily Juice~5968

People will not always appreciate the good that you do but will put you down for the one mistake you make. Human love is fickle. Rise above their criticisms and stay strong. Don't amplify that one thing. Neither let their compliments get to your head nor their criticisms get to your heart. When you allow what someone says or does to upset you, you are allowing that person to control you. Don't hate them; hate is only misdirected energy; it gets you nowhere. And note, maturity is when someone dislikes you but you still pray for them to succeed.



## Daily Juice~5973

The difference between seasons in a man's life is simply an instruction. As you move forward in life, you may have to change your circle of friends. Not everyone around you is interested in seeing you improve. Be picky about the energy you surround yourself with. You can never outgrow those you surround yourself with. You owe yourself that much. If you run around with 9 losers, pretty soon you'll be the 10th loser. You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. Leave that circle! If you don't let go the wrong people, you'll never meet the right people. Sometimes, we can outgrow a friendship. It was good at one time but now, you are running at a different pace. It's a new season of your life. It's healthy for seasons to change. It doesn't mean they are bad but you ve outgrown the friendship. You cannot spend as much time with them like you used to and become all you were created to be. Appreciate the people that have helped you, always honour them but recognize when their part in your story is over.



## Daily Juice~5986

God packaged some unique things in you for the betterment of the world—use them. Refuse to go through life like you never came. Don't just exist; make a mark and live a life of impact! Next time when you think of beautiful things, don't forget to count yourself in. Never allow yourself to be defined by someone's inability to see your worth. You 're a person of destiny, talented and creative. You're equipped for this life and designed for a purpose! Discover it because therein lies your fulfilment. The understanding of you is the foundation of living an outstanding life but you can't understand you without first understanding Your source-God!



## Daily Juice~5990

It is not what others call you that ultimately determines your life, it is what you call yourself that holds the most power in your life and also determines the course of your life. The universe is alive! The universe is at your command. It is waiting for you to command it with your thoughts and words. Arrange circumstances in your favour with words. Our lives go where our words go. Our words are seeds, and our lives are the harvest and character of the seeds of words we've sown over the years. Since you have to eat your words, you might as well sow sweet seeds. Put a premium on words and make investment in words, and you would yield not only sweet dividends of your words, but also a glorious reality and future.



## Daily Juice~5996

Life is not about being better than someone else. It's about being better than you used to be, discovering who you truly are and fulfilling God's purpose for your life. Always focus on being better today than you were yesterday. You may be the only person left who believes in you, and it's enough. It takes just one star to pierce a universe of darkness. Never give up. Focus on making yourself better, not on thinking that you are better than someone else. Contentment is natural wealth, luxury is artificial poverty. We have different backgrounds, different arrangements of occurrence and life experiences. Don't trip when you see others doing better than you. Yours is coming. If you don't behave as you believe, you will end by believing as you behave. The definition of success remains unique and subjective to each person's path of life in accordance to what God has designed him to do. One of the greatest tragedies in life is to lose your own sense of self and accept the version of you that is expected by everyone else.



## Daily Juice~6003

It isn't what you have or don't have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about. Your happiness is your responsibility; you don't need the approval of anyone or circumstances to be happy. You were designed to be joyful. Make a decision today not to be defined by your past or by your mistake. If something is wrong, fix it if you can; but if you can't, train yourself not to worry; worry never fixes anything. Worrying is down payment of a debt you never had! Your secret is in your joy and laughter. If you let people's opinion of you dictate your mood, you'll never grow as a person and you'll live as a slave to the thinking of others. Remember, if you want to please everybody, you will have to compromise your happiness. Anyone is sure to have some haters, but that don't count, live your life joyfully.



## Daily Juice~6018

The only part of you that hurts when you're given the truth is the part that lives on lies. It doesn't matter the financial challenge you might be going through, it won't make God to tell you not to pay your tithe. Stop complaining, If you don't respond to God according to His blessings in your life, you may not experience that kind of miracle again in your life and you may not have consistent miracles like you want it. God has set down His principles and will, but they are set in motion by us.



## Daily Juice~6024

No matter how you pray, if you have a perverse mind, you can't make progress. Your life can never be greater than the function of your thinking pattern. Your mind is a necessary tool for your transformation. For the christian not to prosper, there's a problem because he is designed to prosper. And the problem is not with God, the problem is not with the devil, the problem is with his thinking. Until the Word of God gains the ascendancy over your thinking, you'll become sense ruled. The more you expose yourself to God's Word, the more like the Word you become. Our life is like the lamp, it shines brighter and brighter everyday. To have a good life, you must invest in God's Word.



## Daily Juice~6035

Every new day with God brings the dawn of new and better possibilities. All good things find their beginning in Him, and without Him, nothing good exists. And He wants to express those good things through you. Your degree is not your life. Reinvent yourself constantly before you become obsolete. You are no under obligation to remain the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even a day ago. You are here to create yourself continuously. Your intelligence cannot be measured by grades. Develop your skills; your skills are more valuable than your grades. Don't be limited by your degree or certificate. Get God's certification of you in His Word and make a success out of your life.



## Daily Juice~6039

It doesn't matter what the situation looks like, what matters is what you see. Don't allow yourself to be shaped into the wrong mold. Thinking precedes manifestation. Your life is departmentalized and every area has a self-image. That image dictates how you respond emotionally and physically to every situation in life. Your emotions are determined by your thoughts and perceptions. You may try to hide your true feelings, and you may hide them very well for a time. But eventually, your true thoughts and emotions will surface and your actions will reflect those thoughts. No one can consistently perform differently from the way they think — the picture they have of themselves at that time and in that situation is what truly counts, because that's what will either bring them out or keep them still in that situation.



## Daily Juice~6048

Sometimes the things you least want to hear about will help you the most. Being busy is not a measure of productivity; don't let people rush you with their timelines. The greatest value of our lives comes from what we do with our time, and the only time we really have control over is the current moment. There are no “overnight” successes, only people whose preparation met God-given opportunity. While the opportunities and favour in our lives come from the Lord, the preparation is up to us. It's not how early you wake up or how late you stay up. It's what you are doing with your time when you are up that matters.



## Daily Juice~6056

Holding grudges is like growing a garden of thorns in your heart. There's nothing more poisonous and disgusting than working in malice and bitterness. If you are like that, you are cutting yourself off from grace, creating an inroad for the devil in your life and exposed to the negativities of life. Remember, being gifted doesn't make one more spiritual than the other. You may be gifted but it is the grace of God that matters. Never find your delight in someone else's misfortune; It's one of the characteristics of witchcraft. There are some who are praying that you have a problem and you come to them for solutions. Never mind, God doesn't answer such prayers and such will never happen to you. Learn to walk in love and peace with other people, train yourself in it. What someone has said about you cannot affect you unless you allow it.



## Daily Juice~6066

Don't merely use words to describe your situation; use words to change your situation. Perharps, you have had people and circumstances write negative, destructive words on you. Now, those words have taken roots and they are setting the limits for you. Unfortunately, because you ve heard such words for so long, they have seeped down into you and given you a particularly self-image. There's nothing to worry about, but remember, the only way you can change the effects of those words and create a new and improved self-image is by speaking faith-filled words consistently over your life with your mouth. The best cleanser, eraser, converter and game changer you can ever find is God's Word.



## Daily Juice~6080

Some look around and feel like they missed out on the talents and abilities they see in others. In one way or another, many people go through life feeling like they are a mistake—so they just struggle and try to cope the best they can. The Lord’s plan for your life is far better than that. You aren’t a mistake. You didn’t miss out on the talents you need to accomplish God’s will. You don’t have to struggle through life, bouncing from one crisis to the next. He said your life is from glory to glory, not from problem to problem. God has a purpose for you. He created you for a reason. You have a specific purpose in life and God wants you to discover that purpose.



## Daily Juice~6104

Never make your success or happiness dependent on an attachment to any person, place or thing. Most people are seeking for happiness outside of themselves. That's a fundamental mistake. You are a fountain of joy, and happiness emanates from you! Happiness is who you are, and it comes from the way you think. Do not give your past the power to define your future. By referring to previous challenges and using them as reasons for not getting on with your life today, you are assigning responsibility to the past for why you can't be successful or happy in the present. Remember, managing perceptions is as important as delivering reality.



## Daily Juice~6114

Rejoice in who you are--the person God made you--and stop worrying about trying to be somebody you were not created to be! Be comfortable with the person God made you to be. God did not grace you to compare and compete with others. He gave you the grace to be who He has called you to be. Sometimes, we spend so much time and energy comparing and competing with others, and we miss out on our own paths to our God-given destinies. Don't get distracted and lose focus by comparing yourself to others. Run your own race. You can be inspired by others, you can be challenged to rise higher. But don't condemn yourself if someone else does better at one thing or another. Some people are stronger in certain areas, but we all have our strength. Discover yours, be the best of you and bless your world with it.



## Daily Juice~6131

As you learn about what will help you to make progress in life, it's equally important to know what could hinder or slow you down. Sometimes, the weight you have to lose isn't on your body but on your mind. Anger, resentment and jealousy don't change the hearts of others- it only changes yours. Never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback, even if he deserves it. Don't allow his anger become your anger. The most important places to keep clean and tidy are your heart and mind. Refuse to allow resentment, bitterness, unforgiveness, anger, cynicism find expressions in you and through you. Unforgiveness is like holding the door open for the devil; It's like drinking poison and hoping it would hurt someone else. To be unforgiving is to allow circumstances rob you of your joy in life. Forgiving others isn’t so much about the one who offended you; it’s about your own life; it’s for your benefit not theirs.



## Daily Juice~6157

You can't expect to draw people into your life who are kind, loving, confident and generous if you are thinking and acting in cruel, weak, and selfish ways. You must put forth what you want to attract. Many have insulted and turned away people that were divinely placed on their path and orchestrated to help them fulfill their destiny. Build good relationships with others. We are in a partnership with all other human beings, not a contest to be judged better than others and worse than others. Treat people with respect and courtesy. You can easily measure the character of a man by the way he treats and talks to others.



## Daily Juice~6191

Don't equate your self-worth with how well you do things in life. You aren't what you do. If you know who you are, it'll change what you do. You are a person of divine value and worthwhile- not because anybody else says so but because God says so, and you accept it and decide to live as such. You have a sense of purpose. A sense of purpose is not something that you find outside; it's something that you are on the inside. To get the deeper meaning of your life, you can't find it in the opinions or beliefs of others if it's inconsistent with the Creator's description of you. One of the highest things you can do for yourself is to be independent of the opinions of others. When you become easily swayed by what anybody else thinks of you, what you are saying is: People's opinion of me is more important than God's description of me.



## Daily Juice~6198

The best medicine for the body is the Word of God. Learn to frequently speak words of health over your body. Too often, people want to live in good health, yet with their words, thoughts and actions, they are doing just the opposite. Understand that your faith will work in either direction, positively or negatively. Consciously and unconsciously, we prepare for the wrong things when we imagine the wrong things. What your mind envision, you attract. Quit putting your faith in the wrong things, and start agreeing with what God says about you. Be an example; let your joy, your health, your peace and progress be an inspiration to others.



## Daily Juice~6202

Sometimes, we don't know the spiritual significance of our choices, words and actions. They functionally determine the course of our lives. You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. The power is in your daily routine. Motivation may get you started; habit is what keeps you going. Your life today is essentially the sum of your habits. How in-shape or out of shape you are is as a result of your habits; how successful or unsuccessful you are and you will be- a result of your habits! What you repeatedly do ultimately forms the person you are, the things you believe, and the personality that you portray. Sustitute and replace old demeaning habit with a new and better habit. Old habits won't open new doors. Start with an incredible small habit - make it so easy that you can't say no. Increase your habit in very small ways because success is a few simple disciplines, practiced every day; while failure is simply a few indiscipline, repeated every day.



## Daily Juice~6206

Self-talk reflects your innermost feelings. You can't litter negativity everywhere with your thoughts and then wonder why you've got the kind of life you have! Do not think that what your thoughts dwell upon is of no matter. Your thoughts are making you. There's no scarcity of opportunity, there's only a scarcity of resolve to make it happen. You need to learn how  to create a match between what it is you desire, and the thoughts and words you are choosing to attract those desires.



## Daily Juice~6210

The possibilities in our lives change when our perspective changes. A man sees in the world what he carries in his heart. The essence of your living is to affect lives positively; don't allow envy sap your joy and destroy your life. Don't find yourself fighting the blessing of God in a man's life through envy. That someone else is succeeding doesn't mean you are failing. Unhappiness over the blessings and achievements of others or discontent aroused by another's fortune if unchecked affects one's spiritual, physical and emotional well-being. It gradually leads to a destructive and remorseful way of life. Saul's envy towards David's achievements and even plotted severally to eliminate him accelerated his downfall.



## Daily Juice~6226

Depression doesn't come from what's going on in your life. It comes from your thoughts about what's going on in your life. People get depressed and discouraged because they are caught up in the world. They dwell on things they should not be thinking about or they do not recognize the priority that God should have in their life. Irrespective of the challenges or circumstances, you can choose your response. How you live your life is totally up to you. It's not dependent on your circumstances. It's dependent on your choices. Arrange your thoughts so that you choose happiness each and everyday. You don't need anybody's help or consent to be happy. You have what you need to be happy.



## Daily Juice~6230

The secret to a transformed life is what goes on in your mind. What makes one rich is not what the bank account has in it but what the mind has in it and investing in. You will always see whatever it is you prepare your mind to see. What is behind your eyes holds more power than what is in front of them. You don’t see things the way they are, you see and interprete things the way your mind is; for as you think, so are you! Your thought life is always the foundation of your success or failure not the circumstances sorrounding you. You own your mind, your mind doesn't own you. You can control the thoughts your mind dwell upon, for your expectation creates your experiences.



## Daily Juice~6242

Despite your best efforts, people are going to be hurt when it's time for them to be hurt. Hurting people hurt others. How you make others feel about themselves says a lot about you. Remember, you can never rise any above your love walk. Faith works by love. Be careful what you say, you can say something hurtful in ten seconds but ten years later, the wounds are still there. Words are free, it's how you use them that may cost you.



## Daily Juice~6247

Every situation has three dimensions; Your views, People's views and the Truth. Success goes with the one who follows the Truth. Don't waste your valuable time with people that are not adding to your growth! If you are to enhance your future, you must do something about the present because a future that's not connected to the present does not exist. God will not put a dream in your heart if He had not already given you everything you need to fulfill it! You will never change what you tolerate!The life in front of you is far more important than the life behind you! Be a trail blazer and create new paths for your life. Stop focusing on what happened and start focusing on what's going to move you forward.



## Daily Juice~6251

Those who make excuses don't make progress. Your future is being created by what you're doing. You are unique and different from everyone, stop comparing yourself with others. Your path is different, and you were given this life because you are strong enough to live it. Don't lose hope! You are stronger than whatever you are facing right now! The power behind taking responsibility for your actions lies in putting an end to negative thought patterns. Don't dwell on what went wrong or focus on whom to blame; never sacrifice who you are for what you want. Don't waste time building roadblocks to your success; yesterday doesn’t define you, but let it prepare you for what is ahead. Your life is what you make of it! You can't think like a slave and live like a king.



## Daily Juice~6276

Poor quality seed produces a poor quality harvest. An excellent harvest comes from excellent seed. Don't give poor quality seed. Cars have been given that needed repair, clothing that was old and torn, and appliances that didn’t work. Why give someone else your headaches? Mountains are to be removed into the sea, not into someone else’s backyard. Would you like someone else’s problems? Why then would they want yours? What you sow, you reap. How would you like a hundredfold return on the junk you’ve sown? Wouldn’t it be better to receive a great harvest of good quality things back into your life? Repair what you’re about to give, and make it a gift of quality. Bring it up to a standard that would bless you if someone gave it into your life. It’s good to give what you would just as well use. It can then be a blessing in the life of the one you’re giving it to, just as it would be in yours.



## Daily Juice~6288

The work of God is perfect! You are God's work; the product of His wisdom. When people pursue an identity apart from God, it leads to confusion and frustration. The more you step into the perfect you that God created you to be, the more fulfilling and beautiful your life would be.Your belief about yourself is the most telling factor in determining your level of success and happiness. Self-esteem comes from the self that God created you to be, not from acquisitions and approval. It's not what is available or unavailable that determines your level of success and happiness; it's what you convince yourself is true. It's what you imagine yourself to be; the image you have of yourself.



## Daily Juice~6293

Stop focusing on what you do not have, and take stock of all that you do have. The state of your life is nothing more than a reflection of the state of your mind. Shift your consciousness to an appreciation for all you are and all that you are blessed to have. Remember, what you think expands. If your thoughts are centered on what you are not getting in your life, then what you are not getting by definition, will have to expand. Every single condition in your life can be improved if you stop complaining. When you complain too much, you carry an air of defeat around you that is very difficult to remove.



## Daily Juice~6302

Don't allow the approval, applause and attention of others destroy you. Remain humble and grateful for all of your accomplishments, and know that the Greater One is always at work in you. Know that success is your nature and as such, you bring success into all you do. You are a child of God; you are entitled to a life filled with joy, love and blessings. Tie your joy to who you are and what you have in Christ and not to people or things. Don't see what you have achieved yesterday with the same pleasure eyes you used to see it when it was done by you. Look forward and do better than you did yesterday!



## Daily Juice~6307

You are the prophet of your life! What you allow into your life through your mind and mouth are among the most important decisions you will ever make. By what you allow to occupy your mind and mouth, you can either bless your life to great heights of success or send it orbiting into arenas of failure, sadness and discontentment. Our lives go in the direction of our most dominant thoughts and words.



## Daily Juice~6332

You will never have more, go further or accomplish greater things than your thoughts allow you. There is a direct correlation between the quality of our thoughts and the quality of our lives. You are the architect and building contractor of your future. Use your thoughts as an architect uses a blueprint. If you do not take control of your inner thoughts, you will become a slave to your outer circumstances. You won't be driving your life; challenges and circumstances will.



## Daily Juice~6358

The world is full of people who want change in their circumstances, but only few recognise that change begins on the inside of them. The dominant experience of your life is a reflection of the way you are thinking on the inside. Instead of looking for a change to take place externally in everybody and everything else around you, the first thing you need to do is recognize that change begins on the inside of you. This occurs according to the knowledge that you have of God.



## Daily Juice~6374

Don't just get obsessed with yourself and with your goals; God cannot go far with a man who thinks only of himself.
Our society overflows with critics, cynics and fault finders. Many people quickly point out what you are doing wrong, but relatively few take the time to point out anything you are doing right. Never mind, but don't live life like that. Everyone you meet needs some sorts of encouragement. Learn to appreciate and build people up rather than condemn and tear them down. God puts people in our lives on purpose so we can help them become not what we want them to be but He wants them to be. You have a lot to offer. Your life has significance and you can make a difference. There is something in you for the betterment of someone else. Everyone you touch has the potential of touching someone else. When people come around us, they should leave better off than they were previously.



## Daily Juice~6380

It's a new day! Flame the fire you have within you. There's no challenge that comes to you that you are not greater than. Regardless of what life throws at you, you have the capability to overcome it, but until you take responsibility, nothing happens. The choice is always yours. Remember, life has its responsibility of distracting you but you have the responsibility of remaining focus! Most people fail because of broken focus. You are responsible for how you act no matter how you feel. Maturity is when you come to terms with the realization that your life today is the harvest of the seeds you planted sometime back. Take ownership of your life, and discipline your habitual thoughts, words and actions to line up with God's destiny for you.



## Daily Juice~6405

Never pride yourself in your ability to subdue, shout at or dominate others; rather, learn to use your authority over yourself. Conquer yourself! That’s when you really win: when you say to yourself, “I’m going to do the right thing and say the right thing only,” and keep at it. When your words and actions are under your charge, consciously subjected to God’s Word, then you’re ready for true success. Refuse to give vent or expression to satanic manifestations such as anger, hatred, bitterness, jealousy and envy. Controlling your temper is better than being a hero who captures a city.



## Daily Juice~6420

The eyes see what the mind believes and comprehends; the eyes see what the mind is prepared for. It matters what you 're looking at, for the earth is filled with the goodness of the Lord. Your focus determines your reality. Some people have found themselves being distracted by too many things. They 're distracted by the state of the economy and several happenings around them. They can't accomplish much in life that way. When you 're a man or woman of purpose, you 're not perturbed by the happenings in the world because you know you belong to a divine order; you 're not of this world and its order. Nothing in, and of this world can place a limit on you or cause you to be disadvantaged, because you won before you came and you were a success you started out.



## Daily Juice~6425

You are not living a life you didn't plan for; you either planned for it consciously or unconsciously. It's not accidental. Be intentional about your life. Ignorance is not an excuse. Don't give yourself to the wrong side of life. What you make of your life is your responsibility. Many people may be responsible for your success, but you are solely responsible for your failure. Not every single problem is a direct result of the devil. However, if your overall life is spiraling downward, if nothing ever works and problems are all you seem to experience, then you should stop and consider that perhaps your thinking pattern may need some work and adjustment.



## Daily Juice~6445

Picture yourself already living a successful life. Anything that keeps you from growing is not worth defending. Your limits to success are defined by the agreement you've made about what's possible. Change that agreement and you can dissolve all these limits. Self-worth cannot be verified by others. You're worthy to be successful. If you depend on others for your value, it is "other-worth." You can be successful, you can let the best in you come out. You can be the best of you and live an extraordinary life. Refuse to let anybody demean you. You are God's best.



## Daily Juice~6462

The way you see yourself and see life affects the way you live, it controls the decisions you make and the things that happen with you and around you. You are the perfection of God's creation; the expression of divine excellence. There's nothing wrong with you. Your life is full of beauty and excellence, because you 're created in the image and likeness of God. You look like God and function like Him. If God wants to look at Himself, He looks at you because you're His image, His mirror! You're not the angry, unhappy, frustrated person that your mind or Satan tries to depict you to be. Be happy about you and about life. Life was given to us to learn, express, help, enjoy and live. If your life is always stressful, unenjoyable and miserable, you are focusing on the wrong things. Then, you 've disrespected the life given to you and the purpose for your creation.



## Daily Juice~6477

Refuse to major your time on the minors of life. Don't wait for extraordinary opportunities, seize common occasions and make them extraordinary; for either you run your day or your day runs you. One of the greatest gifts you can give someone is your time because when you give your time, you 're giving a portion of your life. The way you spend your time defines who you are and your future. Be picky and selective with whom and with what you invest your time in; wasted time is worst than wasted money. Spend your time wisely and maximize it. Stop procrastinating and make your life useful.



## Daily Juice~6509

Whatever you're currently asking God to give you, has already been provided. Getting what you need in this life isn't a matter of asking God, and then waiting on Him to give. God has already given. The truth is that God met all your needs long before you encounter them. Before you were born, God had already provided everything you will ever need. A lot of prayer time is wrongly spent trying to force God into doing something. Comprehending what you have in the spirit will give you a totally different perspective on receiving from God. As you believe, your faith makes what God has provided become a physical reality.



## Daily Juice~6519

Your time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you can't get more time. Until you value your time, you don't value yourself! If you don't value your time, you won't do anything worthwhile. Don't just prioritize what's on your schedule but most importantly, schedule your priorities. Spend more time on what's important, so you would prepare ahead of situations and wouldn't have to spend more time on what's urgent and less time on what's important.



## Daily Juice~6528

If you let fate dictate your life, thinking it's God's will, you will make a lot of wrong decisions. You can’t just let circumstances move and control you. God doesn’t move you around like a pawn. Many think God is sovereign and whatever His will is comes to pass, but that isn’t how it works. God is sovereign, in the sense that He has Supreme power and is Master of all things, seen and unseen. But He doesn’t control your life neither does He force His will to come to pass in your life. What is established in your life is your responsible not God's.



## Daily Juice~6534

You can never outgrow the company you surround yourself with. You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. Leave that circle! If you run around with 9 losers, pretty soon you'll be the 10th loser. As you move forward in life, you may have to change your circle of friends. Not everyone around you is needed at the next phase of your life and some may not be interested in seeing you improve. You owe yourself that much. Be picky about the energy you surround yourself with because the company you keep determines what accompany you.



## Daily Juice~6539

If you can't be yourself, you are nobody. Did you also know there are people who live fake lives? There are those who try to be others until they lose themselves in the process. There is nothing as interesting as being you. If you always think you need to be someone else you will never get to a level of knowing yourself and discovering your potential and uniqueness. One of the worst things to do with time is comparing yourself to others; you don't know what God has called them to do. Run your own race! Sometimes, our minds talk more than our mouth. Your life is a reflection of what you hold inside you. Focus on the gifts and talents God gave you and don’t be envious of the blessings He gave others. Quit comparing yourself with others. You also have your unique strength that none has, look within and build on it.

You also have your unique strength that none has, look within and build on it.



## Daily Juice~6604

You can control your attitude and how you respond to situations. We are each the master of our own reality; life is what you make of it! Always remember that your present situation is not your final destination; your best is yet to come! Don’t give up because things are difficult; push yourself more! One bad chapter doesn't mean your story is over. Don't look down on yourself because of what you might be going through at the moment. What you are going through is not a statement that you are finished. Regardless of what your circumstances or problems are, you're never more than one word from God away from a miracle. The Lord knows exactly where you are and how to get you to where you're supposed to be. All you need is just the slightest instruction; a word from God!



## Daily Juice~6608

It's the blessing of the Lord that makes one rich not one's strugglings. God only asks you to give what He wants you to have more of. Poverty can't stay when God is being glorified by your giving. God would not break His principles because you are crying. God does not respond to pain, He responds to faith. If you would want to see God, follow Him in His Word, by His Word and through His Word! Every opportunity you have to give to God is His way of setting you up for greater blessings. What your giving does for you is far greater than the thing you are giving for; it causes something unseen to be transmitted into your life, and as you believe in it, it produces results in all you do and follows you everywhere you go. Remember, your giving connects you and everything that concerns you with God's Spirit and gives you results that aren't only for today, but for tomorrow and for all time.



## Daily Juice~6613

Don't allow your wounds to turn you into a person you are not! Rise above that pain and your past! Never let mistakes define who you are; only you can choose who you are, and what you become! You are stronger than your past! You are not a product of your circumstances; you are a product of your decisions! What if everything you are going through is preparing you for what you asked for. Don’t be too hard on yourself when you make a mistake. It’s much more effective to be handled with love. Telling the self off is a terrible habit, it subtly shapes a nature of sorrow in you.



## Daily Juice~6617

Realizing money from what you are doing is no full proof you are doing what is right and fulfillling your purpose. Money is only a reward for work done whether good or bad. Life is not all about money. Fulfulling one's purpose is not all about money. Look at the amount of peace and fulfillment you derive from it. Your purpose pre-existed you. What was formed before you were formed was your purpose. Now, He formed you in line with your purpose. Meaning, you came to fit in the purpose God has already formed. The plan for your life was already set before you were formed. Now, the starting point of fulfilling one's purpose is set in motion when the creature meets with the Creator.



## Daily Juice~6620

You can create a new season of your life through new set of attitudes. Don't always look for who is wrong before looking for what is wrong. Apologizing doesn't mean you are weak, right or wrong. It just means you value your relationship more than your ego! Don't blow off another's candle for it won't make yours shine brighter. Why feel unimportant and insecure when someone else does something remarkable. Refuse to allow comparison steal your joy or make envy and jealousy ruin your day. Every moment spent envying another person is a moment spent living outside of your life's purpose. Why should someone else's  joy and success become your sadness? Their success will not limit yours. There's something unique only you can do, do it and make the world a better place.



## Daily Juice~6653

Do not allow yourself to be affected by the adverse and negative thoughts of those around you. Thought is a force- a manifestation of energy- having a magnet-like power of attraction. That's why God gave us His word. God's words are God's thoughts clothed in vocabulary. We attract to us the thoughts of others of the same order of thought. The man who thinks success will be apt to get into tune with the minds of others thinking likewise, and they will help him, and he them. The man who allows his mind to dwell constantly upon thoughts of failure brings himself into close touch with the minds of other "failure" people, and each will tend to pull the other down still more.



## Daily Juice~6659

Throughout life, the two most futile emotions are guilt for what has been done and guilt for what might be done. Not one tiny slice of that guilt will do anything to change anything in the past. Forgiveness is one of the most powerful things you can do for yourself. If you can't learn to forgive yourself, you may never achieve true success in your life. Being relaxed and at peace with yourself affects your performance in everything you do. The more you extend kindness to yourself, the more it will become your automatic response to others. You have a God-given right to be successful. In your Creator's eye, no one on this planet is any better than you. Don't assign responsibility to the past for why you can't be successful or happy in the present.



## Daily Juice~6685

Anything that makes God absolutely responsible for everything in your life is irresponsibility not Christianity. The devil is not the problem either! Take charge and responsibility for your life. God would not do for you what He has designed you do yourself. God puts laws and principles into being -You are responsible for putting them into action and motion in your life! Some people are like an old TV. They need to be corrected a few times before they get the picture. Don't be angry and heady when corrected, always remember; you are blessed and privileged to have someone to correct you.



## Daily Juice~6692

Often, the difference between acting on God’s Word and doing our own thing isn’t in the action itself, but in our heart attitude. Sometimes, the most important issue for all of us is our love for the Lord. Everything else revolves around this issue. It’s easy to get so busy serving the Lord that we don’t have any time to fellowship with Him. Ultimately, this leads to emptiness, frustration, ineffectiveness. He places our fellowship with Him far above everything we do for Him. Remember, life begins not in your relationship with people or in what you do for God, but in your relationship with God. In your relationship with God, it then overflows in your relationship with people and in what you do for God.



## Daily Juice~6696

Your testimonies are the résumé for your next miracle. It would do you good to review and declare God's goodness to you on a regular basis- simply thinking about the victories in your life, the unexpected favours, or the times when you knew that God intervened in your circumstances keeps you in the atmosphere of the miraculous. Too often, we remember what we should forget- the hurts, disappointments, failures- and forget what we should remember- the time that God made a way for you when it looked as though there was no way. Take time to remember your victories and celebrate what God has done in your life. If you will get the awareness of God's goodness down inside of you, it'll birth other miracles in your life.



## Daily Juice~6717

Understand that there's no such things as coincidence when your life is directed by God. God is good and He is the giver of all good things. When something good happens to you, be sensitive, recognise the work of God and learn to ascribe the glory to Him and praise Him for it. Sometimes we take these things for granted. Some don't even realize it was God at work in their lives. Some are complaining, waiting for the "big breaks." Remember, life is a series of daily little miracles that when recognised and appreciated produce the "big breaks."



## Daily Juice~6739

Rise above the deceptions and temptations of the world. Your words are the vehicle that'll move you from point A to point B. Words can be like X-rays if you use them properly-- they'll go through anything. Quit trying to be someone else. Compete with who you were yesterday. Never allow critics or those who aren't doing anything stop you or slow you down from doing what God has asked you to do. Other people may be doing great things like you but the assignment God has given you is unique to you. Fulfill it! Don't let comparison steal your joy. Stop letting envy, jealousy and insecurity ruin the beauty of your life! The world is like a stage with men and women. Everyone has his/her role in the script of life; both the good and the bad act out their roles. Don't try to act another person's role. Look for your role in the script and act yours.



## Daily Juice~6743

Whether you succeed or fail doesn't depend on others as much as it depends on you. Your life is truly what you make of it. Many people may be responsible for your success but you are responsible for your failure. There's so much inside you, and you have what it takes to make the most out of life. You are unique and possess unusual endowment. Within you is the divine capacity to attract and manifest all that you'd ever need or desire. Blaming circumstances or someone because of a situation or a misfortune is responding to a lie from the pit of hell. When you realize that no one can dictate your destiny but You and God, you will live a new kind of life. Don't waste your precious time blaming someone for any challenge or misfortune in your life. Whether someone wronged you or not, God will restore your wasted years. He will restore the years in fruitful measures. Even if you 've made mistakes, relax. God has just started a new thing, to turn those mistakes for development and miracles. You can forget those losses and the hurts. Start afresh. Don't make your life dull and put yourself in a vacuum. Don't wallow in ignorance, self-pity and enjoy it.



## Daily Juice~6747

One person and God can form a majority. Your mind is a necessary tool for your transformation. Some people believe they live in lack because they are unfortunate, not realizing that their belief systems are rooted in scarcity thinking. You must put forth what you want to attract. Act as though what you want to manifest is already a reality. Eliminate thoughts of conditions, limitations, or the possibilty of it not manifesting.



## Daily Juice~6763

Keep your life in the right perspective. Every one of us has something even right now to be happy about: our health, our jobs, our businesses, our families, a previous miracle or an opportunity. Don't manufacture unhappiness; if you complain, you'll remain, but a grateful heart is a happy heart and a magnet for a miracle. Happiness and unhappiness is based on perspective. Be cognizant of the fact that the more you attach your value to those things outside yourself, the more you give those things the power to control you. No one can depress you. No one can make you anxious. No one can hurt your feelings other than what you allow inside. Monitor your inner dialogue and match your thoughts and words to what you intend to achieve.



## Daily Juice~6774

Use words to beautify your life and set your life on course. The words you speak today is a shelter for your tomorrow. The fruits you're harvesting today were planted as a seed by your mouth yesterday. Words are powerful. Words affect your destiny. One day of murmuring and complaining has the power to set you back for a year. That’s a 1-to-365-days ratio. Therefore, you can’t afford to release negative words because the spirit realm takes every word uttered from man as a command and mandate. It does not discriminate between a jest, a joke, a desire, an order, or a decree. This is how powerful the spoken word is. Everything in the universe has to adjust itself to bring to you the harvests of your words. Words released into the atmosphere do not disappear and dissipate. They have no geographical limitations. Words have power, presence, and future implications. They create a magnetic force that pulls the manifestation of what we speak. They are suspended and incubated in the realm of the spirit awaiting the correct time and optimum condition for manifestation.



## Daily Juice~6779

You were created and "re-gened" to be successful and to leave your mark on this generation. Protect yourself; don't give a high position to anyone who talks you down and talks down what you are doing. Don't give high position to those who scoff and scorners in your life. If you don't set things right, they will poison your spirit, Impede your progress and poison your dream. The words of those that sorround you have an effect on your dream and on your life. Everyone cannot be on your team. Don't choke your life and dream with unnecessary people; anyone that is not in your direction is a distraction. Guard the dream God has given to you. Certain things may not happen in your life except certain people leave your life and you cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a great life.



## Daily Juice~6786

Life's tests are often repeated when failed and the lesson never goes away until it teaches us what we need to know. Failure is not a compulsory encounter we must face in life but many people get to orchestrate theirs. You need to understand your kind of person; therein lies your uniqueness and success. Your success story begins from within! You have been engineered for success from birth! Failure is not a gift from God but a result of our decisions, actions and  inactions.



## Daily Juice~6796

Remember, God does not consult your past to determine your future. You are not your failure, and you are not a failure. Failure is an event not a person. Just because you couldn't do something yesterday doesn't mean you can't achieve it. Refuse to embody your mistakes and label yourself as a "failure" or carry your mistakes around with you. Instead, place them under your feet and use them as a stepping stone to arise above it. Your value or God's love for you doesn't decrease because you made a mistake; you are not your mistake. Be awaken to these truths and let go of all the negative individuals and thoughts in your life that just drag you down; don't let the mistake ruin the beauty you were born with; be better than you were yesterday. Take responsibility for your own happiness, never put it in the hands of people or circumstances.



## Daily Juice~6802

Don't allow the circumstances of life deceive you about God's unconditional love for you. Your past experiences may have made you the way you are, but you don't have to remain and stay that way. God delights in you and in your prosperity, and He's more willing for you to be successful than you could ever be. He loves you more than you love yourself. The dominant experience of your life is a reflection of the way you are thinking on the inside. Instead of looking for a change to take place externally in everybody and everything else around you, the first thing you need to do is recognize that change begins on the inside of you. This occurs according to the knowledge that you have of God.



## Daily Juice~6812

Don't just be occupied with continuing the status quo that you miss opportunities that will change your life. Anything that keeps you from growing is not worth defending. Fear of failure becomes fear of success for those who never try anything new. The qualities of creativity and genius are within you, awaiting your decision to match up with the power of action. Every thought that you have impacts you. By shifting in the middle of a weakening thought to one that strengthens, you raise your energy vibration and strengthen yourself, and it influences everything around you.



## Daily Juice~6818

Don't let circumstances or the enemy take you on a useless journey. Before you ever make a move, see if that has the potential of producing divine results. You own your mind, your mind doesn't own you; don't allow it to keep drifting into anxious thoughts over the challenges of life. Whenever you feel stressed or worried, pull yourself away and meditate on God's Word. Instead of allowing stress and worry to get to you, train your heart and mind to see how God sees the situation. The bigger God becomes in your heart, the smaller the challenges become and inconsequential in the presence of God.



## Daily Juice~6822

God created us with emotions. Emotions were created to be good and we are to enjoy these emotions. They're one of the spices of life. At the same time, even though emotions are intended to be good and God gave them to us to be enjoyed, many people find their emotions out of control. Instead of controlling their emotions, their emotions are controlling them. Though emotions were intended to be a positive thing, they can also be the very thing that drive people into all kinds of problems. You control your emotions. You do not have to explode with anger whenever someone else decides to behave in an angry or vindictive way. Some have lost great opportunities out of anger.



## Daily Juice~6830

Your worth in life is not a function of your environment or human opinions, but a divine arrangement and value. You have a unique gift to offer this world. You are of an inestimable value than you could ever imagine, made with all of God's divine skills. Stop being defined by what society or others think of you. Don't let any anyone dull your sparkle. There's a beautiful world inside of you, let it out. There's so much light within you to light up someone's world. Don't be in this world just to balance the ecosystem or to complete the square. Be the type of energy no matter where you go or what you do, you always add value to the spaces and lives around.



## Daily Juice~6856

Your thought is a contributory factor to the miracle you desire. Don't be lazy in your thought life; consistently talk yourself up! Give your thoughts what to dwell upon through words. If you want to know how and where you are going to be five years from now, listen to your words- you are prophesying your future. You may be going through a storm but don't let the storm get into you. Understand that until you get to the place of peace, God can't really work in your life like He wants to, because God works where there is an attitude of faith and expectancy, not attitudes of worry, unbelief and discouragement. Remember, miracles go to where they are expected not necessarily where they are needed.



## Daily Juice~6879

Sometimes we become so caught up in our goals and so focused on the end result that we miss the miracles all along the way. Take time to enjoy your life's journey. Enjoy the different personalities and things God has put in your life. Don't let yourself become so focused and driven, so busy with what you have to do each day, that you miss the "goodies" along the way. Start enjoying the different things God has put in your life. Appreciate and enjoy the great things He has placed in your life. Seeds of discouragement cannot take root in a grateful heart. Change your approach and you'll still achieve your goals, and your life will be so much more fulfilled.



## Daily Juice~6886

Don't compare your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 20. You are God's best! There's a sense of destiny in your life because you are God's idea, His dream! God values you, He is not mad at you, and the price He has paid for you is the proof of your worth. If you don't challenge yourself, you will never realize what you can achieve. Don't be afraid; welcome change and believe in yourself. Believe and rejoice in who you are- the person God made you- and don't worry about trying to be somebody you were not created to be. Don't speak negative of yourself to please anybody.



## Daily Juice~6892

Don't make the challenges of life become your identity. Challenges in life are inevitable, and they are for your promotion but being defeated is optional and a choice. When you talk about your challenges to everyone, you perpetuate the memory of them. It positions you as a victim and delays any efforts of quick recovery. Talk magnifies things. The wise never discuss their challenges with someone incapable of solving them. Your chosen confidant should be competent and discreet. Nobody associates with losers and victims. When Job lost everything, everyone avoided him. It was only when God doubled his blessings that others returned to participate in his life by giving him gifts. Harness your mouth.



## Daily Juice~6909

When you know that you are greatly blessed, highly favored, and deeply loved by God, you don’t have to depend on others or self-efforts to feel good about yourself. You didn't show up by accident, you are a person of destiny. Don't get accustomed to living less, doing less and being less to the point that you eventually sit back and accept it. There's something beautiful and unique about you. Stop acting small, you are greater than your present environment or situation; everything that goes into making you a success is inside you. Work on being not just on having, because success is not to be pursued, it is to be attracted by the person you become.



## Daily Juice~6913

Your life is whatever you permit your mind to magnify. You deserve to be happy and have a life you are excited about. Part of the reason for the way people turn out differently has to do with the values they develop for their lives and the way they see life and respond to life. Nobody will make you happy until you 're happy with yourself first. If you don't like yourself, you can't make a success out of yourself and you can't like someone else because you can't give what you don't have. You can still be happy during the process of achieving something. God never attached your joy to something or someone; your joy is in Him. Happiness is a choice not a result. Deal with worries before they deal with your happiness. Refuse to allow circumstances steal your joy! Bad memories will play, but because the memory comes up doesn't mean you have to watch it; change the channel. Don't waste time looking on memories that hurt. Treat yourself well, nobody can make you happy like you.



## Daily Juice~6929

Some people often abandon the very things that brought them to the top. When Saul was little in his own eyes, the Lord promoted him. In his success, he abandoned dependency on God. Solomon did the same thing. He started out in great humility and sought only to be faithful to God, but his success corrupted him. This is also what happened to David. David had reached a point of success where he had to fight his own battles. He had others who would do it for him, and he stayed back. This left him free to wander, which is exactly what he did and met Bathsheba. Hard times aren’t the true test of what’s inside a person. Everyone seeks the Lord when their backs are against the wall. Life’s greatest test is success. Make fellowship with the Lord your first priority—in both good and challenging times!



## Daily Juice~6942

Worrying is blasphemy against God's promises. A grateful heart is a magnet for a miracle. When you thank the Lord for His blessings in your life, you are attributing them to Him, thus distinguishing Him from all others. The result is, He blesses you even more and reveals Himself to you in a greater way. Get a moment aside to thank Him. Remember that you are like a magnet, attracting everything to you through your thoughts and words. It is impossible to bring more into your life if you are feeling ungrateful about your life and what you have. When you give thanks as though you already have received what you want, you are emitting a powerful signal to the universe. Gratitude is absolutely one of the ways and a conduit to bring more into your life. Be thankful!



## Daily Juice~6955

Make up your mind to be grateful to God. Don't allow people or circumstances change your mind. Keep it set on being thankful. It's not what happens to you or what you have or don't have that is important; it's how your mind is arranged and the choices you make. Know what to ignore and express your joy. Be thankful for what you have. Your life is someone else's prayer point and miracle. Someone somewhere is grateful for half of what you have.



## Daily Juice~6959

Most people are often bothered by what others think about them. Of course, the Lord didn't create us to be rejected. Therefore, no one likes to be rejected. We all want to be accepted, but what someone else thinks about you shouldn't determine what you think about yourself! What other people think about us is not the important thing; it's what we think about ourselves that control us. God's acceptance of you should matter more to you than the acceptance of men.



## Daily Juice~6968

Those who follow the crowd usually get lost in it. How you spend your time is how you spend your life bits by bits. So don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. We tend to forget how precious our time  is and the moments we actually have. Don’t live a life that one day you will regret. Don’t live someone else’s life and then one day look back and realize it was all a waste. Live your own life! Go on your own exciting journey!



## Daily Juice~6989

You can put God's great plan for your life in reverse. Sometimes people are not missing it in knowing what the Word of God says, they are not missing it in believing and confessing the word, but they are missing it by not walking in love. If we are to live in line with God's Word, we must not only be a faith child of a faith God, but we must be a love child of a love God. Your spiritual growth is measured by your love walk, for faith works by love, and God is love. Let God's essence within you flow out like a stream as you relate with others in love.



## Daily Juice~6995

Everyone you meet needs some sorts of encouragement. Learn to appreciate and build people up rather than tear them down. God puts people in our lives on purpose, so we can help them become not what we want them to be, but what He wants them to be. When people come around us, they should leave better than they were previously. Don't just get obsessed with yourself and your goals; God cannot go far with a man who uses his faith to think only of himself and his needs. Remember, God is love and faith works by love.



## Daily Juice~6999

The most important part of your life is the ability to use words. No man is ever better and greater than his words. No spirit is permitted to work on behalf of humanity in the absence of the Word. The most beautiful natural gift from God to man is the gift of words, the ability to speak and make words. You 're what you say. Your life is the summation of the words that come out of you. You have to speak your choice of life to live it. Whatever you want out of life is no longer in the hands of God, it's in your hands, particularly in your mouth.



## Daily Juice~7006

You are made and fitted for life. There's no challenge that comes to you that is greater than you. Excessive talking about a challenge prolongs the challenge, because the more you talk about it, it forms an image in you that you behold, and according to the law of the spirit, as you behold, you become. The poor, widows and orphans around you are your opportunity and advantage for a change. Don't take undue advantage of them but rather be a blessing to them. Your giving will build up a memorial before God.



## Daily Juice~7011

Sometimes, we think that our net worth to God—the only thing we really have to offer Him—is our service. That’s not entirely true. God longs for us personally, not just what we can give Him, not just what we can do for Him. He wants our affection, that we desire and love and worship Him. Everything we do should be an overflow of our personal relationship with Him. We are able to lead only to the extent that we follow Him. As much as we long to serve Him, we may find it all too easy to become caught up in spending our entire time doing work for the Lord and neglecting our fellowship with the Lord. We are called human BEINGS not human DOINGS. God prefers that we BE with Him before we DO for Him.



## Daily Juice~7026

A person who causes you to react controls you. A person who compels you to think and consider doing differently influences you. Refuse to harbour unforgiveness towards anyone. Don't allow bitterness gets even a toehold on you. Satan uses such things as an inroad against you. Don't allow such rent a space in your heart or mind except God. Like it or not, there's a spiritual battle raging for your heart and mind. When we talk negatively about someone, we can hurt their feelings or even loose demonic activities against them and against ourselves. There's much more to life than just this physical, natural, surface level. Spiritual activities are constantly taking place. Whether or not the person you're speaking evil about ever knows it, you'll be affected. Venting anger, frustration, resentment, or unforgiveness affects you whether it affects anyone else or not.



## Daily Juice~7031

When a door is slapped shut at you, don't stand there twiddling your fingers begging and crying. Remember, what you acquire through begging will have to be sustained by begging. Refuse to let rejection define you. It's not what happens to you, but how you react that matters. Don't ruin today's happiness with mourning tomorrow. Don't settle for being an option; become a priority! Why put your happiness on hold because of a situation or someone? Refuse to allow your happiness to be dependent on the reactions of other people. Rise above the reactions of others towards you and refuse to be a slave to the thinkings of other people.



## Daily Juice~7035

The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think. You don't need the approval of someone or a situation to be happy. The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of everything, they just make the most of everything that comes their way. Many problems that people suffer are their behaviours and attitudes towards people and situations. Sometimes, overcoming a challenge is as simple as changing the way you think about it. Don't let the sadness of your past and the fear of your future ruin the happiness of your present; for if you want something new, you have to stop doing something old! Old habits won't open new doors. If you’re going to go forward in life, you must quit looking backward. Don't let your past poison your future. Don’t let your setbacks become your identity. A great future doesn't require a great past. God hasn't brought you this far to leave you now.



## Daily Juice~7043

The most wasted day is one of worrying without laughter! Laughing is and will always be the best form of therapy. No problem is powerful enough to defeat you. Your current situation does not mean your final destination. Feed your faith and your fears will starve to death. Stop worrying! Worrying is using your imagination to create things you don't want. God is bigger than what you're worrying about. Learn how to enjoy where you are on the way to where you're going. Don't give up because things got hard. Don't let the challenges of life put off your smiles. Sometimes things get worse before they get better.



## Daily Juice~7048

Be the reason someone believes in the goodness of people. Life is like an echo; whatever we send out invariably comes back to us. Never regret being a good person to the wrong people. Your behaviour says everything about you, and their behaviour says enough about them. Trust the power of good over evil. Being good doesn't mean being weak. There are more people who are afraid of evil than they have respect for good. Evil doesn't have as much power than good. A little glimpse of light drives away darkness. Good is greater, stronger and more powerful than evil. If you want to know what a man's like, look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.



## Daily Juice~7067

Don't let people poison your heart. If those you hang out with are fault finders, critics and busybodies, that company will poison you. Such atmosphere will keep you from fulfilling your destiny. They want to know all the details and latest information about someone else, not so they can pray about it, not so they can help the person but to gossip and be judgmental. Such people, most likely they're already talking about you. If they'll talk about other people when they're not there, they'll talk about you when you're not there. God doesn't promote a backbiter, a gossip, or someone sowing discord. If you have an issue with someone, there's a love way to go about it, not behind his or her back. You may not agree with everything. You may have things you don't understand, but don't be a gossip!



## Daily Juice~7076

As you prepare for the coming year, don't drift through life aimlessly; track your life. All those things that fill your mind hold the keys to your reality. Your life cannot be any different from the quality of your thoughts. We must become good stewards of our minds because everything that enters it whether positive or negative has an effect on us. There are two prime times of the day in which our minds are more open to creativity and absorbing information. Our minds function at their best early in the morning and late at night. Plants seeds in the fields of your mind which will produce the kind of harvest you expect. This exercise every morning will start off your day on a good note. That's why prayer and affirmations are very important. At night, repeat the process. Let the last thing you program into your mind and what comes out of mouth be something that will beautify and advance your life.



## Daily Juice~7083

You were born with a spark of divinity; born with the abilities and potentialities of divinity. It's up to you to fan that spark of divinity in you. Too frequently, we become overly concerned with the "outer" packaging, gifts and externalities of life. We get too concerned with the position, the job, the finances, the cars, the clothes that we lose sight of life itself. You see, above all these packaging, you are the living expression of life itself- the greatest gift! You are the gift that should be cherished the most! You are the living expression of the power of divine creativity. Don't allow thin, cheap gifts and externalities becloud and camouflage the real you as well as your divine creativity. Once you discover the you in you, your life will take up a whole new meaning.



## Daily Juice~7105

Just because God does not respond or react immediately to certain issues or circumstances the way we expect, does not reduce His power, sovereignty or love. It's only our perception that's flawed, not His power, sovereignty or love. Let's not make the mistake of thinking like the Israelites that God has become a man as stated in Psalms 50:21. Let's not make our thoughts of God become human, and expect God to think like us, act like us. Nothing can be more dishonouring or degrading to the concept of God's Almightiness. Most likely, that change or miracle you want, He has already done it but waiting for you to pull it out from within you and collect it.



## Daily Juice~7114

Ignorance is the root of misfortune. Don't adjust your theology to fit your challenges. God has never made a piece of junk. He has never made an inferior person. We all have something that God wants to accomplish through us, but most of us are ignorant of this. God wants to do absolutely miraculous things in everyone's life. God can only flow through you to the degree that you believe. You are the only one who can limit what God wants to do in your life. Do you know that, chances are, you are limiting God? Most of us limit God in one way or another. There are many things that can hinder or limit what God wants to do in our lives. One area in which we can limit God is through our wrong beliefs. Our lives go the way of our thoughts. The way we think directs the course of our lives.



## Daily Juice~7146

Our very experience is derived from the activities that exist in our minds. There’s always more with God! We serve a limitless God. There is nothing that is unobtainable in the spiritual realm. The only limit on God is the end of our faith—that is, where we stop using our faith. It’s God’s time to take the limits off! God wants you to have much more than the exact answer of your prayers. Raise your consciousness level. Enlarge! Expand! Raise the bar! Expand your vision! We are not fear-people. We are faith-people. Trust God and believe His Word! The Word is constant. God is not a man. Go beyond what is normal, usual, expected, or necessary. If you’re going to receive like you’ve never received, you must sow like you’ve never sown. You can never receive less by sowing more. With God, there’s always more!



## Daily Juice~7153

Purposely challenge yourself; real living truly begins at the end of your comfort zone. Progress isn't accidental, it is not possible without a change, and those who cannot change their way of thinking cannot change their lives. Living a healthier or happier life is more than losing weight, it's about losing and changing the mindset and habits that got you there in the first place. You cannot change your character until you change your friends! Your circle determines the happenings in your life. Remember, you cannot change what you are unwilling to confront. And whatever it is you want to change with revealed truths, is always at your will.



## Daily Juice~7160

Your uniqueness is your greatest value. Don't let social media or friends put you into worrying. Remember, worrying will not change anything but could make things worse. Your peace is more important than driving yourself crazy trying to understand why something happened the way it did. Be grateful that certain things didn't work out. Sometimes, you don't even know what you are being protected from or where you are being guided to in the midst of that problem. The people in your life should be a source of reducing stress, not causing more of it. Don't let people pull you into their storm, pull them into your peace.



## Daily Juice~7165

Your life is what you make of it. You can't get out of life what you 've not put into it. Every circumstance in life is a result of a choice- consciously or unconsciously and every choice is the result of a thought. Your thoughts provide the fuel for your words, and your words provide the fuel for your world. Be intentional about your life. Being more focused, ordered and organised would do you a lot more good than you could ever realize. When life gets blurry, don't quit, adjust your focus and set your sail. If you don't change, change will create you into something else. When you are not rooted and grounded in God's word, people's opinions become your choices, decisions and lines of action, and that's the wrong road to trail.



## Daily Juice~7168

God doesn't send bad things our way. It's not by chance or fate. There's a real enemy out there that we must learn to deal with. Life is spiritual. Some don't recognize the role that the spirit realm plays in what occurs in our daily lives. We just tend to look at things as being normal and natural but the devil is busy influencing people and circumstances everyday. There's an intense battle being waged all round us each and everyday. We need to know the spiritual significance of our choices, words, and actions. The devil can't control you outside of your will. He can't influence you without your cooperation and consent. The Greater One lives in you! Refuse to fear.Your fear is your cooperation. However, your lack of awareness and understanding of the battle only works to his advantage. You can resist the devil and he will flee from you. Your passivity and lack of resistance doesn't mean that the battle isn't raging. It just simply means you aren't winning.



## Daily Juice~7184

Everything created by words responds to words. Make your words work for you, not against you. All you are, experience, and ultimately achieve can be traced back to how you have made use of these two simple yet vastly powerful tools- your words and thoughts. The power of the spoken word is one of life's greatest mysteries. All you will ever be or accomplish hinges on how you choose to govern what comes out of your mouth. By what you allow to occupy your mind and mouth, you can bless your life to great heights of success or send it into arena of failure, sadness and discontentment. Saturate your clouds with faith-filled words.



## Daily Juice~7191

What you compromise to keep will sooner or later cost you. Raise your commitment level to your growth, development and to your future. Strangers don't enter into your bedroom-- meaning, you choose where people get to in your life. Your life today is a picture of your association. Friendship isn't based on proximity or longevity. It's based on value added principles. Each friendship is an ingredient that changes the equation of your life for good or for bad. You can never sharpen an iron with a wood or plastic; Iron sharpens iron. Intention doesn't change anything, action does! It's to change and translate intention into reality.



## Daily Juice~7199

When chances are one in a million, be that 'one'. There will always be someone who can't see your worth. Make sure that person isn't you. There are no traffic jams on the extra mile. The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you are made of, not the circumstances. Take personal responsibility for yourself. There's a 100% returns of dividends for investing in yourself. Be a first-rate version of yourself, not a second-rate version of someone else. Stop comparing yourself, especially on social media. Everyone has a story, focus on yours! You must have control of the authorship of your life. The pen that writes your life's story must be held in your hands. Accept no one's definition of your life if it's inconsistent with God's definition of you in His Word.



## Daily Juice~7203

Be careful what you say, you can say something hurtful in ten seconds but ten years later, the wounds are still there. Words are free, it's how you use them that may cost you! People will say negative things about you- you can choose to let it define you, confine you, outshine you or you choose to move on and leave it behind you. No matter what is said, what you tell yourself is what really counts. Don't let negative and toxic people rent space in your mind! What you tell yourself everyday through your inner thoughts and words will either lift you up or tear you down. Your words are the photographs of your future.



## Daily Juice~7214

Your condition is not unique. We worry too much when we live our lives based on other people's timing. Run your own race with its timing. Sometimes, what we call "it's late" is just trying to play into other people's timing and expectations of us, and that puts us into worrying. That someone else is succeeding doesn't mean you are failing. Life is so much brighter when you focus on what truly matters. Don't start your day with the broken pieces of yesterday. No matter what's happening, don't allow it affect your inner climate; choose to be happy. Stop looking for reasons to be unhappy and don't make up problems that don't exist. The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it. What you behold, you empower! Your focus determimes your reality. Find something positive in your life and celebrate it. A negative mind will always struggle to see a positive outcome. If you realize how powerful your thoughts are, you would never give room to negative thoughts. When life gives you a hundred reasons to cry, show life you have a thousand reasons to smile and start appreciating all the blessings in your life.



## Daily Juice~7232

Keep your life in the right perspective; everyone of us has something even right now to be happy about. None was born to wake up everyday to impress you. Think happy thoughts; centre your mind on things that God has made available for you in Christ. Stop focusing your mind on things that make you sad. It's a choice you must make. Your life depends more on you than you may realize. God never promised us that others will make us happy, but He said we should make others happy. If you want to be happy, you have to be happy on purpose. You have to set the tone at the start of each day. If you leave your mind neutral, the negative thoughts will start to come by default. Don't allow anything or anyone sap your joy. Remember, your strength is linked to your joy.



## Daily Juice~7253

It is not just what you do for your children but what you've taught them to do for themselves that will make them successful. Your children need your presence more than your presents. Children are great imitators, so give them something great to imitate! They must be taught how to think, what to think and how to talk. The greatest investment you can ever have is in your children. Your children are your greatest heritage! Only in the safe environment of warm acceptance and trusted confidentiality will children open up and share their deepest hurts, needs and mistakes with you. And whatever is shared with you should be handled in love and wisdom.



## Daily Juice~7257

There's nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, happier, or smarter. Everything is within you. Don't strive for the approval of others or depend on compliments from others to feel good about yourself. Learn to love yourself, not as men love you but as God loves you. How feel about yourself will have a tremendous impact on the person you become, because you will probably speak, act and react as the person you think you are. The truth is, you will never rise above the image you have of yourself in your mind. You cannot grow above your thought-level; if by chance you do, life will bring you back to the level of your thoughts.



## Daily Juice~7261

Before you were born, you existed in God’s mind. He knew this world would need you at this time. He planned you with a special purpose that no one but you could fulfill. It's your road and yours alone. Others may walk in with you but no one can walk in for you! Whatever you are experiencing right now, don't allow it hinder what you are expecting. The world cannot place a limit on you, don't place a limit on yourself. Nothing of value is bigger than you. If it can be bought with money, then you are bigger than it. Never let life's circumstances define who you are. Refuse to settle for less because you have no other alternatives available. Behind every strong person is a story that gave them no choice.



## Daily Juice~7268

In the world we live in today, prayer should essentially be an integral part of our daily lives. Not to pray is to believe in luck or leave your life to chance, and things don't change by chance. Prayer is not a negation; it is a positive force. The purposes and possibilities of God in our lives are birthed in the place of prayer. Don't consider earthly limitations but rather consider the abilities of God. But none can really enjoy a continuous flow of the miraculous in his or her life with an unrenewed mind. God is able to do exceedingly, abundantly above all that we ask or THINK. It means God also answers your thinking. If you are praying and your thinking is wrong, your thinking cancels the prayer. A prayer that does not change you cannot change the situation.



## Daily Juice~7289

Don't feel guilty for things you were unable to accomplish last year. Use your words to project yourself forward. Until you understand the power embedded in words, you may use words against yourself instead for yourself. Your words are your tools to pull into the present the future you have planned for. Where you are now is just a reflection of your past thoughts and words. Our lives go where our mouth goes. What we continually say will find a way of getting to us. Until we say it, heaven has nothing to work with for us. Our life today is the character of our words. Even if we don't say anything, something will still happen, but what will happen would be what we don't like. Be careful not to become ensnared by your own words. Remember, truth does not depend upon you to believe it to be true.



## Daily Juice~7296

As the word of God takes up residence in us, there's no boundary to its divine ability to transform the way we see ourselves, the way we see things and the way we see our world. Using God's word, develop a new set of mental pattern. An old mind would not produce a new result. People who resist change will be impediments to progress. If we are doing anything this year the way we did it last year, we're obsolete, and most likely produce the same result. Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Surround yourself with people that are going to lift you higher. You cannot get healed in the same environment where you got sick.



## Daily Juice~7301

There is no sense in punishing your future for the mistakes of your past. God does not keep a record of wrongs. Forgive yourself, grow from it, and then let it go. You carry so much love in your heart, give some to yourself. Everyone in your life are meant to be in your journey but not all of them are meant to stay till the end. Moments become memories and people become lessons. Your circle is supposed to be proud of you, not jealous of you. Whether it's people, thoughts or habits; you need to get rid of some things to make room for the better. Your life is a result of the choices you make, if you don't like your life and the way it's going, start making better choices. Wherever you are, bloom with grace. One day you're going to look back on all the progress you've made and be so glad that you didn't give up.



## Daily Juice~7318

Silence the voice of negativity. Take charge of your temper, regulate your thoughts and govern your tongue with the word or they will keep you down. There is a fountain of wealth and wisdom inside you; develop what you have within you. You are more than this! You are capable of much more. You are stronger than than whatever you are facing right now. Your dreams and aspirations can still come alive. God will not put a dream in your heart if He had not already given you everything you need to fulfill it. Don't lose hope; don't give up! That challenge is tied to a testimony and someone needs your testimony to be inspired. The lifting power is in what you say amidst the situation. It doesn't matter where you live on the outside, what matters is where you live on the inside. Whatever will affect your life must come from your heart. The future is completely open, and we are writing it moment to moment through our thoughts and words.



## Daily Juice~7332

You can tell more about a person by what he says about others than you can by what others say about him. Always lift people up: leadership is not a position, it's a responsibility. Your good deeds, care and love may seem invisible, but they leave a trail that is imprinted on the hearts of others forever. Sometimes, we give up our comfort to comfort others, don't give up. Never stop just because someone doesn't give you the credit or someone else even takes the credit. In the realm of the spirit, a reward or blessing does not miss its direction. In helping others, we invariably help ourselves, for whatever good we send out comes back to us, and God's reward is far greater than any award or recognition you could ever get. Don't seek to please men; do all things with only one goal in mind: to please the Lord Jesus Christ and be a success for Him.



## Daily Juice~7353

Your life begins to change the day you come to terms that God truly loves you. It's not enough to know God loves everyone. You need to know and believe that He loves you, yes you! Let these words warm and anchor your heart in His grace, especially when you fail. No one can love you more than the way God loves you. God does not only love you, He likes you. And there's a big difference in that. The longer you live in the past, the less present and future you have to enjoy. You are rare, and there's value in all rarity; therefore, you are valuable to God and to the world. God does not condemn you when you fault or go wrong. Don't pay attention to the voice of shame, condemnation and accusation. Look away from your circumstances and keep your gaze on His love for you. This will not only impact you positively but will also gloriously impact the activities in your life.



## Daily Juice~7361

Don't allow the bad experiences of your life prevent you from believing and accepting God's love for you. God's love is not proportional to your performance; it's not performance based, it's unconditional. The Lord is kinder and gentler in His dealings with us. God's kind of love never fails, even when we do, His love is unconditional. Since we didn't do anything to earn it in the first place, we couldn't do anything for Him to withdraw His love from us. Those who think the Lord is put out with them every time they do something wrong will be put out with others who do wrong to them. We give to others out of what we receive. What you are full of is what comes out. Having a short fuse and being unkind towards others is a sure sign that you aren't full of God's love for you. Kindness is one of the distinqishing characteristics of God's love for us.



## Daily Juice~7368

God doesn't bless us because we 're good, He blesses us because He is good! Don't struggle to impress God; there's nothing you would do that would make God love you more or love you less. He already loved you beyond your wildest imagination. He loved you before you ever knew Him. There's no need to feel condemned. God is already as pleased with you as He could ever be! According to the scriptures, He's given us everything. But if you 're looking at circumstances, and thinking like an ordinary person, you'll be thinking of how to pray in such a way that He'll be "convinced" to grant whatever it is you 're asking for. How much more can you convince someone to give you anything who already gave you everything, including the kingdom, what more do you want? He's a King, and He raises kings not beggers! He doesn't want you crawling, begging Him. Take your place!



## Daily Juice~7375

Some believe that God moves in our lives only when we are worthy and do everything just right. We've tied His ability to our goodness. That way, we've wrongly conditioned His blessings to our goodness. It is not so; God is good! He has nothing but good things in store for you. Don't allow your mistakes define you, you are not your mistake. God already provided forgiveness for that mistake even before the thought of it. You may not be pleased with yourself but God is not angry with you and He is not in a bad mood because of you. If you would get a picture of how much God truly loves you, you would fall head over heels in love with Him and you would experience a whole new joy and peace in your fellowship with Him that you've never had before.



## Daily Juice~7384

Remember this, just because someone stays in your heart doesn't mean they will stay in your life too. Don't put your happiness on hold because of someone or something. You were made with all of God's divine skills. Take a moment to appreciate how awesome you are- Yes, You are! There's something unique and beautiful about you. Next time when you think of beautiful things, don't forget to count yourself in. Never allow yourself to be defined by someone's inability to see your worth. You 're a person of destiny, gifted and creative. You're equipped for this life and designed for a purpose. 'Make’ your life. Don’t just live it. Make it beautiful, sweet, enjoyable, remarkable. God has given you the characteristics that attract love and affection. Someone who doesn't like you doesn't know you, and never be angry with someone who doesn't like you. The only reason why he doesn't like you is because he doesn't know you. The day he gets to know you, he would like you, because you are loveable.



## Daily Juice~7434

You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you. If you don't program your life with God's word, life and people will program you wrongly. It is essential that you become extremely vigilant about what enters your mind daily. What you hear affects how you think and what you believe. If you want to have life-affirming thoughts—thoughts of success, peace, joy and progress—then fill your ears with words that will produce these things in your life. Make it a habit to examine what your thoughts are chasing after and your words are gathering to you. Confession is a major problem in the world, and it's a major advantage in life for the one who knows how to use it. Remember, the world within not only colours the world without, but it is also its blueprint. Be intentional about what you hear, how you think, and what you speak, for you are setting the stage for the reality you will experience.



## Daily Juice~7456

Don't fear failure- Fear being in the exact same place next year as you are today. By the consistency of seasons, tides, and solar orbits, we experience that God is a God of order. We can bring order to our lives. Until you decide to reverse the perpetual cycle of disorder, you will continue to experience cycles of defeat, sadness and failure. Intentionally harness your time and energy. To bring order to your life requires the ability to prioritize. It requires the discipline to discern what is distracting you and what is improving you. Time spent  is a cost and you must be mindful of the benefit you are exchanging for the cost. Effective time management requires getting God's heart on what is worth investing time in versus what we should not be spending or even wasting time on. God doesn't flow in an atmosphere of disorder. Order increases the activities of the Spirit in one's life but without order, you will easily be distracted with the cares and concerns of this life so that you cannot still your mind to hear God's voice, tune in to divine frequencies and inspiration. Unless you give yourself the discipline to bring order and discipline into your life, your life will make no meaningful progress.



## Daily Juice~7481

One of the worst things to do with time is comparing yourself with others; you don't know what God has called them to do. Consider that not only do comparison attracts negative thoughts and emotions which sap our joy and peace, they also undermine our health. Run your own race. A cow eats grass and gets fat but if dog eats grass, it will grow slim and probably die. Sometimes, our minds talk more than our mouth. Your life is a reflection of what you hold inside you. Focus on the gifts and talents God gave you and don’t be envious of the blessings He gave others. If a rose smells better than tomatoes, It doesn't mean the rose can make a better stew. Quit comparing yourself with others. You also have your unique strength that none has, look for it and build on it.



## Daily Juice~7488

What someone thinks about you does not have a bearing on your worth. You are the expression and the product of God. The only one who can decide your worth is God, but you are the one who needs to decide to think and act that way. You probably wouldn’t worry about what people think of you if you could know how seldom they do. You can't make a success of your life if you dislike yourself or think less of yourself. Love who you are; love yourself. Live in peace with who you are; don't become something else because of the world's standards or symbols of success. That someone does not respect and value you does not reduce your worth and value. Not everyone will understand you and that's fine, because the only one who needs to understand you is you. Get to Know Yourself. The greatest discovery you will ever undertake is the discovery of coming to terms with who you are in Christ.



## Daily Juice~7498

Don't allow people's social media status puts you into worrying or dull your shine. Stop giving attention to the wrong people; coins always make sound, but the currency notes are always silent. Your thinking is abstract but the result of your thinking is tangible. Success is the effect generated by right thinking and right actions. Success and failure are not accidents but consequences. Remember, when you make a choice, you also invariably choose the consequences of that choice. Everything counts; there is no neutrality. Success is a planned outcome, not an accident. Success in life is not based on need but on seed. If you want to know what you sowed in the past, look around you and see what you are reaping today. The moment you accept the truth and responsibility that choices and consequences are inseparable, you recognize that you are the pilot of all your choices, decisions and actions. When you are anchored in the reality of this responsibility, you are far more likely to act in ways that will not later become causes of regret, frustration or embarrassments.



## Daily Juice~7551

Take a lesson from David and accept responsibility when you are wrong. Stop making excuses and blaming others like Saul. A victim dodges responsibility and blames others and circumstances for his mistakes or failures, but a victor accepts responsibility and changes things. Regardless of what's been done to you, it's the way you respond to it that makes you the way you are.



## Daily Juice~7557

There's a huge amount of freedom that comes to you when you take nothing personally. Irrespective of the situation, you have the ability to choose your reactions. Your life begins to change the day you take responsibility for your own personal life. Life doesn't give us purpose, we give life purpose. The way you think about yourself determines your reality. You are not being hurt by the way people think about you. Many of those people are a reflection of how you think about yourself. Your thoughts and words are transmitted like a short-wave radio signal. They send messages out on a specific frequency and are transmitted back to you as experience or occurrence in your life. Your thoughts create something like a magnetic field around you which attracts the people, activities and experiences in your life. You can literally change the direction of your life by changing the content of your thoughts.



## Daily Juice~7598

Don't allow the devil, people or situation get your attention off of what God has told you to do. Don't fail your destiny; you are connected to many destinies. You are the custodian of the dreams of many people. You were created and "re-gened" to be successful and to leave your mark on this generation. Protect yourself; don't give a high position to anyone who talks you down and talks down what you are doing. Don't give high position to those who scoff and scorners in your life. If you don't set things right, they will poison your spirit, Impede your progress and poison your dream. The words of those that sorround you have an effect on your dream and on your life. Everyone cannot be on your team. Don't choke your life and dream with unnecessary people; anyone that is not in your direction is a distraction. Guard the dream God has given to you. Certain things may not happen in your life except certain people leave your life and you cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a great life.



## Daily Juice~7608

Don't change yourself to win someone's heart. You know yourself better than anyone else, yet you crumble at the words of someone who hasn't even lived a second of your life. Focus on your own voice, it's the only one that matters! Stay true and you'll find someone who likes you for being you. Learn to be happy about you. A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with certain set of attitudes. Never tone your personality and dilute yourself in order to make people feel comfortable around you. We don't meet people by accident. There's always a reason; a lesson or a blessing.



## Daily Juice~7633

If someone talks you down, talk yourself up! Don't let other people bring you down. Don't be afraid to be who you are; if there are people who won't accept you, then let them go. If you don't challenge yourself, you will never realize what you can achieve. Learn how to be independent of people and situations; in the end, you need to be there for yourself. Challenges will come but how you respond to them defines your character and the quality of your personality. Remember, life will not wait for you, decide what you want and go for it. You can never grow above the level of your thought life; watch the depth of your thoughts, for as you think so are you. The world around us takes up the properties of our thoughts and words. Through our thoughts and words, we can influence how the world around us takes form.



## Daily Juice~7704

When someone treats you like you're just one of many options, help them narrow their choice by removing yourself from the equation. It's not pride - it's self respect. Don't give part-time people a full-time position in your life. Know your value and what you have to offer, and never settle for anything less than what you deserve. Let them misunderstand you. Let them gossip you. Their opinions aren't your reality. God's word is your reality. You stay kind, committed to love, and free in your authenticity. No matter what they do or say, don't doubt your worth or the greatness of your purpose. Just keep shining like you do. The measure of the success of a product is the fulfillment of its purpose. Don't be afraid of your future, it's a settled reality, but be afraid of losing the people that have been programmed by God for you to reach and bless. Refuse to allow the circumstances of life or your challenges change your purpose and become your focus. Don't waste your time and life on things and desires that have no bearing with your future.



## Daily Juice~7743

No act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted. Kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are truly endless. No kind action ever stops with itself. The tongue has no bones, but is strong enough to cause strife, hatred and war. Just one bad thing can make a big hole in someone’s heart, and you need more than a thousand good things to fill that hole again. Kind words do not cost much, yet they will accomplish so much. Never belittle the difference you can make in the lives of others. You may never know when a moment of few sincere words of appreciation can have an impact on a life. You don't rise by putting others down; you rise by lifting others. Never look down on anyone unless you are helping him/ her up. People 're going through internal conflicts, don't add to it, be a helping hand. Love, kindness and the good we do for others are never wasted, invariably, we do them for ourselves! Never let someone's bad behaviour stops your good behaviour!



## Daily Juice~7756

You don't have to disrespect and insult others simply to hold your own ground. If you do, that shows how shaky your own position is. Your prevailing thought or mood determines that which is to be drawn toward you - The man who allows his mind to dwell constantly upon thoughts of failure brings himself into close touch with the minds of "failure" people, and each will tend to pull the other down still more. You are today setting into motion thought currents which will in time attract toward you thoughts, people and conditions in harmony with the predominant note of your thought. Your thought will mingle with that of others of like nature and mind, and you will be attracted toward each other, and will surely come together with a common purpose sooner or later, unless one or the other of you should change the current of his thoughts. Remember, life is not the result of chance. Whatever you 're thinking about becomes the reality you 're projecting.



## Daily Juice~7791

There are over 7 billion people in the world. You have a unique gift to offer this world. You are of an inestimable value than you could ever imagine, made with all of God's divine skills. Your worth in life is not a function of your environment or human opinions, but a divine arrangement and value. Stop being defined by what society or others think of you. Don't let any anyone dull your sparkle. There's a beautiful world inside of you, let it out. There's so much light within you to light up someone's world. Don't be in this world just to balance the ecosystem or to complete the square. Be the type of energy that no matter where you go or what you do, you always add value to the spaces and lives around you.



## Daily Juice~7803

Learn to live above circumstances, rise above criticism, don't sink down to the oppostion's level. They are not worth losing your peace over; you are bigger than any challenge that may come your way. Understand that God works best where there is an attitude of faith, peace and expectancy, not an attitude of worrying and strife. Don't let people pull you into a strife and fight and get you you all upset and gossiping. Don't get involved in a fight you shouldn't be in. There is only one fight you should be in- it's called the good fight of faith. You can't make anyone do what is right consistently, only God can as he or she yields his or her will to God! You might as well enjoy your life while God is in the process of changing things in the lives of people around you as you change your perception about them. Don't just use your faith to try to get rid of all your challenges, use your faith to remain calm and peaceful amidst the challenges.



## Daily Juice~7895

Your situation is not unique. Give attention to God's word. You are transformed not by struggling or hustling. You are transformed through the renewing of your mind. Remember that nothing is final. Everything can and will change. You are a shining example of God's goodness and love. If you find yourself constantly trying to prove your worth to someone, you have already forgotten your value. There's more to you than meets the eyes. Refuse to live beneath your potential. Take off the limiting belief that has taken root in your mind. Learn to cultivate possibility thinking. Don't put yourself in a box because of a situation or someone. Nothing limits accomplishment like small thinking and nothing expands possibilities like thinking outside of the box. The possibilities in your life change when your perspective changes.



## Daily Juice~7929

Raise your commitment level to your growth, development and to your future. Other peoples opinion of you, whether it's good or bad, should not be grounds in which you base your self worth. Your value is inherent within you. What matters the most is whether you know you are worthy. Don't compare your progress level with that of others. It is futile to curse or concoct negative schemes against those whom the Lord had blessed. The Lord had blessed you big time. You 're a blessed blessing! Make up your mind to be a blessing to others. If you bless people, you will be lifted. This is because your promotion is in promoting others. You 're a greater success as you help others to succeed.



## Daily Juice~7937

Life originates and comes from your spirit, not from your flesh or your mind. What is fulfilled in your life is your responsibility. For some people, suffering is a gift, not from God but because of their attitudes. Arrange circumstances in your favour. Celebrate your victories; don't wait for them to happen first. Live in the future of your dreams. Stay in the atmosphere of joy. There's a strong connection between praise and victories. Praise has something to do with victories. If you only knew what happens in the spirit when you rejoice, you would rejoice evermore. One of the quickest ways to activate the ministry of the Spirit and the miraculous in your life is through songs. Singing is a spiritual thing! Your praise attracts the attention of angels to work on your behalf. Praising God isn't optional; praise affects every area of our lives. Praise God irrespective of the situation or how you feel. Feelings are scam. Refuse to let your life be dependent on how you feel or let your feelings be a God to you that you now live your life to the limits of your natural senses.



## Daily Juice~7976

Staying closed-minded only causes you to chew on the same religious beliefs over and over again. Your past experiences may have made you the way you are but you don't have to remain and stay that way. Being open-minded introduces you to a whole new world that brings in the kingdom in ways you have never seen before. Your value doesn't decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth; celebrate your uniqueness. Let go of all the negative individuals and thoughts in your life that just drag you down; don't let insecurity ruin the beauty you were born with; be better than you were yesterday. You will always act like the sort of person you consciously and consistently conceive yourself to be!



## Daily Juice~7984

Inner rest is just as important as outer rest. Your physical body can rest, but if your mind never rests, if you live worried, fighting everything you don't like, you're going to be worn out and it's going to drain your joy and take your energy. You can't live a happy life with sad thoughts. Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy for this moment. The most important thing is to enjoy your life - to be happy - it's all that matters. Happiness is a choice. Enjoy what you look like. Enjoy life and enjoy You. Happiness isn't just about getting all you want, it's enjoying all you have. Relax your mind! A lot of the stress we deal with are just our thoughts and perception about a situation. God made you to be happy. If you're not happy, you are not fulfilling the purpose for this creation. He created you to be happy.



## Daily Juice~8014

Being challenged in life is inevitable but being defeated is optional. You are the architect of your life. You cannot change what you cannot confront. Your fear is 100% dependent on you for its survival. Starve your fear; feed your faith. Life is as easy or as hard as you think it is; the greatest obstacles are the barriers your mind creates, and you cannot rise higher than your thoughts or mindset; if you think down, you will go down. If you think up, you will go up. You'll always travel in the direction of your thoughts. Never stop your faith-filled confessions, they affects your mind, and for surely, your words will follow you.



## Daily Juice~8022

The difference between your today and tomorrow is what you do with your time today. Life today is the seed of another. No one day is the same as another. The value placed on time is the value we've placed on our lives. Life is made up of millions of moments. Everyday is important and valuable. Realise that each passing moment is the most important moment. What you do with each gives birth to the other. It's not what others do to us or even our mistakes that hurt us the most; it's our response to it. Chasing after the poisonous snake that bites us will only drive the poison through the entire system. It's far better to take measures immediately to get the poison out, so it has no power over the next moment. Our response to circumstances affects the quality of the next moment.



## Daily Juice~8029

If you are not in the process of becoming the person you want to be, you are automatically engaged in becoming the person you don't want to be. Invest in your mind until you can stay calm under any circumstance. God has designed you to create success and abundance in every sphere you influence. Let go of the limiting belief. Whatever your predominant focus is, that is what you permit to exist in your life. Focus on God's Word and not on the present circumstances. Some focus on the negative, and that's they live in a cycle of negativity. Choose your focus. Train your mind to focus on God's Word. Bring your thoughts into divine alignment with God's will. Whatever is going wrong in your life could be as a result of your focus. If you don't like it, change your focus!



## Daily Juice~8038

God does not compare your life to that of your brother, sister, parents or friends. He compares your life to Christ and His Word. That is the standard. Do not judge or gauge other people's spiritual progress. When you're different, sometimes you don't see the millions of people who accept you for what you are. All you notice is the person who doesn't. Recognizing the gift in another does not diminish your own. We all  have  our eons to evolve, and although we're all fruits on the same tree, we do not all ripen at the same time. Don’t compare your chapter 1 to someone else’s chapter 20. But you must challenge yourself, If you don't challenge yourself, you will never realize what you can do.



## Daily Juice~8052

The type of person you are is usually reflected in your business. To improve your business, first improve yourself. Your life only gets better when you get better. You will never have a greater or lesser dominion than that over yourself. The height of a man's success is gauged by his self-mastery; the depth of his failure by his self-abandonment. He who cannot establish dominion over himself will have no dominion over others. No one can ever put you out or count you out of the game of life, except yourself. If you’re out of the game of life, it’s only because you counted yourself out. No one in life has the power to put you out of the game, except yourself. And once you understand who you are and your identity in God, life will no longer be a game for you, but a constant unveiling of progress and success.



## Daily Juice~8065

Well-being can’t be measured by money or traded in markets, It’s about the beauty of our hearts and minds and the quality of our personality. Arrange your mind so that you choose happiness each and every day. Whatever challenges you may face, whatever circumstances are weighing you down, you can choose your response. How you live your life is totally up to you. It’s not dependent on your circumstances. It’s dependent on your choices. Don't tie your happiness to things or people. You don't need to be accepted by others, most importantly, God has accepted you, then you need to accept yourself! Most people are as happy as they’ve decided to be. Worrying is like sitting in a rocking chair. It gives you something to do, but it doesn't get you anywhere. You may have some not too pleasant circumstances, but don't let that change your mind. Keep it set on being joyful. It's not what happens to you or what you have or don't have that is important; it's how your mind is arranged and the choices you make.



## Daily Juice~8092

Believe in the gift resident in you. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. God has given you special abilities and your own potential. Never let self-doubt hold you captive. You are worthy of all that you dream of and hope for. The difference between two people who can sing is the price paid to develop their gifts, the quality to which such development is aimed at and the way they choose to carry themselves and market their gifts. It is only a gift that is discovered, developed and deployed effectively that makes its bearer to stand before kings. What is worth celebrating is worth training for. Don't just find your gifts, develop them. And don't just develop them, use them for the purposes of God and the benefits of humanity and see how far God will take you.



## Daily Juice~8100

Life responds more to you through your attitudes than through your prayers. To work one's attitude towards life and people is one of the best things one can do for one's self. No matter what is happening, don't allow it affect your inner climate. Choose to live as a victor not as a victim. Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens. Remember, what would ultimately bring down a man going to high places in life is not really the enemies that are waiting for him there, but the attitudes that followed him there.



## Daily Juice~8107

You don't have to dim your light so that others can shine brighter; shine and be different, they'll come to the brightness of your rising. All you see is not all there is. Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are. Be comfortable with who you are, the uniqueness is on you. You don't need to be someone else. God knows what to do with you to lift you up. Your situation didn't meet God unawares. You failed does not mean God has left you. But one thing you must not do after God has lifted you, raised you and promoted you is, never become promoted away from God and His house that God and His house now become small in your eyes.



## Daily Juice~8112

Always remember that your present situation is not your final destination; your best is yet to come! Don’t give up because things are difficult; push yourself more! One bad chapter doesn't mean your story is over. Don't look down on yourself because of what you might be going through at the moment. What you are going through is not a statement that you are finished. Regardless of what your circumstances or problems are, you're never more than one word from God away from a miracle. The Lord knows exactly where you are and how to get you to where you're supposed to be. All you need is just the slightest instruction; a word from God!



## Daily Juice~8135

Ask yourself, if what you did yesterday and what you'll do today get you closer or in the direction of where you want to be tomorrow. Tomorrow's results are the seeds of today's decision. Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go or what you can accomplish but your decision to look within and take advantage of what you 've got on the inside for a change. Success is not by chance. No one rolls into success by chance. Give no room for excuses. Stop blaming the past, circumstances and others; your life is in your hands. It's not about knowing what to do, but doing what you know. Knowledge that is passive does no good to you unless it is applied! Take responsibility for your life. Be focused or you'll be left behind, for your life is what you make of it. Determination today in the right direction leads to success tomorrow. Remember, life is a gift and it offers us the privilege, opportunity and responsibility to live to the fullest. Live by choice, not by chance.



## Daily Juice~8144

Do not let another day go by where your dedication to other people's opinions is greater than your dedication to your own identity in Christ. You have in you the gene and capability to excel. Don't use failure to convince yourself that you can never succeed. Your situations and failures do not define you, you define what is the failure and you control how you act in your situations. When a man is prey to his emotions, he is not his own master. You have to free your mind from the thought that you are not good enough, you have to free your mind from the slavery of doubt. Doubt and fear kill more dreams than failure ever will. People are slaves to things they do not like just because they think they can't make it without the presence of those things. If no one has ever made it big in your family, it does not mean it is written on the wall that you will not make it.



## Daily Juice~8152

If you focus on who you are not, you will lose focus on who you are. Your life has a beautiful blueprint from God's Word. If you always think you need to be someone else you will never get to a level of knowing yourself and discovering your potential. You will always find someone better than you at something but you will never find anyone better than you at being you. There is nothing as interesting as being you. There are others who try to be others until they lose themselves in the process. You are a unique seed! The power of a seed is not in its size but in the quality of its product. Remember, the fruits come from the seed. Good things come from within, the seed germinates from within. For growth to be realized, it has to be from within you. If you are looking for greatness outside there, then you are looking at the wrong direction. When you discover the greatness inside of you, it will attract the greatness outside.



## Daily Juice~8170

Time is a treasure. Until you value yourself, you won't value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it. The difference from where I am to where I ought to be is time management. Time is the platform to execute purpose. Your time is more valuable than your money; you can get more money, but you can't get more time. Don't just prioritize what's on your schedule but most importantly, schedule your priorities. Refuse to major on the "minors" of life. Be picky and selective with whom and with what you invest your time in; wasted time is worst than wasted money. Your future is decided by what you choose to do with your time.



## Daily Juice~8179

You lay the foundation for your success through your prayer life. Success does not come from what you do occasionally. It comes from what you do consistently. Your daily routines are deciding your future. Nothing changes until what you do daily changes. Our future is formed through our daily routines. Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant. What you are doing daily determines the direction your life is going. Nothing will ever dominate your life unless it happens daily. There are several distractions that life offers you but you have a responsibility for yourself to remain focused. The battle of life is for your mind; the battle of your mind is for focus.



## Daily Juice~8209

Life is beyond the intelligence of a man. Put a demand on yourself. Success is not accidental, it is more than principles. True success is spiritual, and you are the key factor to the advancement of your life. Every atmosphere has a voice, and it echoes the voice of its occupants. You create your own atmosphere for the sake of your destiny with words. Frame your life with God's Word; you can't have a life that is different from your words. Until your excuses give way to your strong desire for a change, change is not in view. Stop running around and leaving your life to chance. You can't wish your desires into reality. Do an appraisal on your life, and find what is working and enhance it, and also what is not working, and change your strategy!



## Daily Juice~8215

There's something in you more precious than what others have said about you. Don't let anyone throw you away. You are not a junk; your worth in life is a product of your Source - God. When God looks at you, He sees things that others do not see and ignore. Lighten up, laugh more, and don't get so worked up about things. There is so much inside you, and you have what it takes to make the most out of life! Don’t be discouraged by your current circumstances. I know things may sometimes appear bleak, dismal and perhaps even devastating, but it isn't over yet. This is a divine appointment, it's not coincidence or by chance that you are reading this now, and I believe God is saying this to you: “Don’t give up. It isn't over yet!" Sometimes, things get worst before they get better. I tell you this to give you hope, faith and love. You're not alone out there. You may not be able to control other people, situation or circumstances, but you can control what is going on inside of you.



## Daily Juice~8220

You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete. The thoughts in your mind affect your outer world. Replace your thoughts with God's thoughts. God's thoughts towards you are the best thoughts for you. Reach up for the key out - what would you do with your mind and mouth? Your mind is the drawing room for tomorrow's circumstance, while your mouth is the vehicle and steering of your life. Whatever happens in your mind will happen in your life. Our lives today is the character of our words. Whatever takes a hold of your mind takes a hold of your life. The possibilities in our lives change when our thinking pattern changes. Remember, you cannot grow above your thought level; if by chance you do, life will bring you back to the level of your thoughts.



## Daily Juice~8237

Not everyone will celebrate your victories and successes. The more successful you are, the more criticism you'll encounter. Sadly, for some, your success will evoke their critical spirit and jealousy rather than appreciation and compliments. They would rather be comfortable that you stayed in the same level with them or even less. Never mind and never take it personally. Many times, it's not even about you, even though it may be directed towards you. It's something on the inside of the critical person that lashes out at others, and unless they deal with it, it's going to keep them from rising higher. Your attitude towards someone's greatness or success is a proof of your humility. Remember, the attitude you create determines the atmosphere of your life. One important thing you've got to do is to learn to celebrate other people's success. If you get jealous and critical, your attitude will trap you where you are.



## Daily Juice~8255

No matter what happens to you, your attitude belongs to you. Your attitude is your choice and responsibility. The more you know who you are, the less you let things and people upset you. Don't allow someone else's attitude make your life miserable. Those who try to criticize and speak ill of you are expecting you to be angry and be in a fight mode, conquer them with your peace. Hold yourself in; you have self-restraint, don't fight back, maintain your inner climate. The less you respond to negative people, the more peaceful your life will become. We would enjoy life a lot more if we get good at knowing what to ignore and what to focus on. You may miss out on God's best for you while being distracted by things that don't matter. Remember, your attitude is your responsibility!



## Daily Juice~8292

To sustain life, breathing in is just as important as breathing out. Similarly, giving is just as important as receiving. Sometimes, there are opportunities that would come to us, not because of our talents or gifts but because of our giving. True riches are not measured by what we own, but by what we give. Giving is tasking the present to fill up your future. The seed that leaves your hands never leaves your life; it enters your future and it multiplies. Every time God wants to meet with a man, there's always an exchange; He calls for what the man has. When you ask God for a miracle, there's always an instruction. Consider giving to advance God's kingdom, it enhances your heavenly bank account. Who knows you better? The teller at the bank or the recording angel of the bank of heaven? Everytime we give to the Lord, we re laying up treasures in heaven and increasing our heavenly account, making deposit for eternity, thereby increasing our balance. And just like an earthly account, we make withdrawals.



## Daily Juice~8296

Don't allow life's circumstances define who you are and make you discredit yourself. You are an amazing, wonderful masterpiece of God. Never put down yourself to please anyone. If you keep doing that, it won't do you any good. Some are more focused on their flaws and mistakes and forget the beauty they were born with. Beauty is not in how tall or slim you are or how perfect you look. Beauty is in being who God made you to be with confidence. Irrespective of how you are, take what you have and make a sucess out of your life. God made you as you are on purpose. He gave you your looks, height, your personality on purpose. You are the best of you! Nothing about you is by accident. God calls you His masterpiece. You are special; there's nothing ordinary about you. Rather than being down on yourself and discrediting who you are and focusing on all your mistakes. I wonder what would happen if you focus on the masterpiece God has created you to be and declare, "I am excellent". "I am amazing". "I am valuable". "I am blessed". "I am favoured". The goodnews is when you talk like this consistently, whatever follows the "I am" will eventually follow you.



## Daily Juice~8308

Smile, you don't own all the problems in the world. Keep the smile of a victor on your face all the time. Worrying people are never successful for long. In fact, when they are successful in anything, it is short lived. The measure of the strength of a man is the way he bears up under challenges. Never be bullied into silence; never allow yourself to be made a victim or a slave to the society. Do not allow fear hold you in its paralyzing grip. So many people can be responsible for your success; but you are responsible for your failure. It doesn't matter what others are doing, what matters is what you are doing! Your life will never be truly yours if you constantly care about what others think. A man who wants to lead the orchestra must turn his back on the crowd. Be alive to your responsibility.



## Daily Juice~8325

Lights may be turned off everywhere; but no one can turn off the light that is in you, except yourself. The understanding of you is the foundation of living an outstanding life. It's not what is outside, but what is inside that takes one to the top. Form follows thought, and the shape of your life is a product of that thought. Structure your time so you can structure your thoughts, for they provide the structure for your life. Don't let anyone who has done nothing stop you and make you belittle the dreams in your heart. God wouldn't have put a dream in your heart if He had not already given you everything you would need to fulfill it. If you would doubt anything, doubt your doubt, not yourself, God nor His word. Refuse to allow the pressures and challenges of life dictate and becloud your thinking or allow yourself to be defined by someone's inability to see your worth.



## Daily Juice~8332

If you don't enjoy your life, sorrow, sadness, suffering, fear, shame and guilt will take preeminence over your life. Relax your mind and enjoy your life. A lot of the stress we deal with are just thoughts. Do not think that what your thoughts dwell upon is of no matter. Your thoughts are gathering things to you. Remember that stress doesn't come from what's going on in your life. It comes from your thoughts about what's going on in your life. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life. Don't use the circumstances of life to judge God's love for you because He has already proved His love by the death of His Son. The challenge may not go away when you pray and when it doesn't go away, it simply means God knows that He has trained you enough to face it and win!



## Daily Juice~8456

Sometimes, people may dislike you not because you did something wrong but because you're fulfilling God's purpose for your life. Don't take it personal. Sorround yourself with people whose definition of you is not based on your history or past, but based on your identity and destiny in Christ. The words of those that sorround you have an effect on your dream and on your life. Everyone cannot be on your team. Don't choke your life and dream with unnecessary people. Every friendship has an impact on your life; positively or negatively. Certain things may not happen in your life except certain people leave your life, and you cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life.

Your problem is not bigger than God! God is who He is, regardless of our opinion. Doubting God doesn't diminish who He is. When we focus our hearts on the Lord through praising Him, God looks bigger than any problem. However, when we focus on our problems, it appears bigger. Our minds enlarge whatever or whomever we focus our attention on and decrease what we neglect. Of course, God is greater in size, extent, and effect than any problem we face, regardless of what we do. It's not a matter of who God is that determines our victory or defeat. It's our perception of who He is that controls our experiences. God is always the same for all of us, but different people receive different results because of how big or small they perceive Him to be. Focus your mind on Him. Let God be big in you and all your challenges will shrink and fade away.

Stop thinking life is against you, but rather, start thinking all things are working together for your good! Our inner personality makes our point of view towards life, which either elevates us or brings us down. Remember, the world within not only colours the world without, but it is also its blueprint. The way we see life shapes our lives. If you don't make the time on creating the life you want, you would eventually be forced to spend a lot of time dealing with a life you don't want. Having better education does not necessarily mean that someone is better than you. School rewards people for their memory, life rewards people for their creativity and ability to solve problems. One day, what will save may not be the things you learnt in schools but the values you've learnt outside a classroom. There is a big gap between school skills and life skills. It's time to live life at a new level; It's either you magnify your excuses or you magnify your skills.



## Daily Juice~8490

Things will be thrown at you daily, but what matters is how you respond. Don't give your mind permission to get disturbed. A disturbed mind is easily influenced. This will cost you your peace and joy, and if the devil succeeds in touching your joy, he's got you. Learn to maintain your peace by freeing yourself from attachments or the wrongs done to you. The heaviest thing you can carry is a grudge; let go and don't keep hurting yourself. We alter our lives by altering our attitudes. The more you celebrate the life God has given you, the more there is in life for you to celebrate. Happiness is not the absence of challenges but the divine peace that knows that all things work together for your good. Not just good tnings...ÀLL things.



## Daily Juice~8496

What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals. This world should be happy you came. Don't be too quick to condemn and tear people down. God puts people in our lives on purpose so we can help them become not what we want them to be but what He wants them to be. You have a lot to offer. Your life has significance and you can make a difference. There is something in you for the betterment of someone else. You are an answer to the cry of millions, because everyone you touch has the potential of touching someone else. When people come around us, they should leave better off than they were previously. Don't just get obsessed with yourself and with your goals; God cannot go far with a man who thinks only of himself.



## Daily Juice~8520

True riches are not measured by what we own but by what we give! Never let life's circumstances define who you are. Material accomplishments will soon be forgotten, the only thing that lasts is the investment we make in the lives of others. A man who lives only for himself cannot see afar off and will later or sooner be irrelevant in the scheme of things. The magnetism of your kindness will far outlast the memory of your genius. Make up your mind to be a blessing to others. If you bless people, you'll always be lifted. This is because your promotion is in promoting others. You're a greater success as you help others to succeed.



## Daily Juice~8559

You may experience tremendous social, financial and family success and achievements through simple application of the Laws of Life as set forth in the Bible. But without the experience of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, you will always sense a vast void and loneliness, an awareness that “something is missing in my life.” Job promotion, financial empire building and social acceptance will heighten and accentuate the emptiness rather than fill it. God has not created a world He would not be needed in. Real success in life begins in Christ!



## Daily Juice~8603

Anything permitted increases. Don't allow your past to enslave or imprison you. Your past does not have to destroy or keep you from your future. Make your dreams bigger than your past. God does not live in your past, He is in the now of your life. He doesn't consult your past to determine your future. Changes are always proportionate to our knowledge. Remember, when you want something you have never had, you must do something you have never done.



## Daily Juice~8611

You don't have to make yourself miserable to make someone else happy or lose your joy to make someone happy. There are some no matter what you do, it won't make them happy. The issue is not you, it's about them, their internal and personal issues they have to deal with within. Pray for them. Don't be angry with them. Remember, you can't be angry with someone you pray for everyday.



## Daily Juice~8627

That you are facing a challenge doesn't necessarily mean you've done something wrong. God doesn't send bad things our way to teach us a lesson. It's not just coincidence or fate. There's a real enemy out there that we must learn to deal with. Life is spiritual; don't be ignorant. Your ignorance will only make you a prey or victim to the onslaught of the devil. God's Word reveals that we are not wrestling against flesh and blood, but against demonic powers. Our fight isn't against people, but the spiritual forces influencing them. However, most of us simply don't recognize the role that the spirit realm plays in what occurs in our lives. We think it's just human and natural, but the devil is busy influencing people and circumstances everyday. Be alive to the realm of the spirit and take charge.



## Daily Juice~8672

You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one. Forget what hurt you in the past, but never forget what you've learnt from it. There's more for you in the future but don't make the same mistake. Don't allow the sadness of your past and the fear of your future ruin the miracle and happiness of the moment. Starve your past; your future can be better than your past, and you have the power to make it so. If you live in fear of the future because of what happened to you in the past, you'll end up losing what you have in the present. You may not be able to control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.



## Daily Juice~8682

Life has its responsibility to distract you, but you have the responsibility to yourself to remain focused. Don't make things your focus, make Him your focus. There is a time to be left alone with God. You need to be left alone sometimes. Until you are left alone with God, there are some experiences you may not have. God doesn’t want you to neglect your cares but He doesn't want your cares to have you and take His place. He wants to help you take care of your cares. He needs your attention; because He knows whatever dominates your mind has become your master. Your life is whatever you permit your mind to magnify, and which will become your reality.



## Daily Juice~8692

There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it. Stop letting insecurity ruin you. Nothing holds you back more than your own thinking pattern. You'll always travel in the direction of your thoughts. Stop worrying, for it doesn't take away tomorrow's trouble, it only takes away today's peace. No amount of guilt can change the past, and no amount of worrying can change the future. Keep calm and keep doing the Word. What you fear you empower, what you empower you attract! Sometimes, it's not the challenge that's the load that breaks you down, it's the way you're carrying it. The only time one fails is when one falls and stays down.



## Daily Juice~8717

A lazy man is not necessarily one who does nothing. It could also mean one who does many things in the wrong time. What you do with your time says a lot about you and your future. Some prefer to do whatever in their convenient time but life is not like that. Whenever convenience comes into play in the battle front, it results into hazards. You don't wait for things to happen, you make them happen. God does not understand excuses. This is because He has put in us, all it takes to fulfill our purpose on earth effectively, not because we asked for it but because we came with them.



## Daily Juice~8746

Make sure you don't start seeing yourself through the eyes of those who don't value you; know your worth even if they don't. Never seek your importance through the standards of the world. You are more than this! You are unique, lovely, loved, amazing, worthy and divine! Nothing you've done, or will ever do, can stop God from loving you and nothing that you've done is too much for the mercy of God. Don't allow  your life to be dependent on the reactions of other people towards you; refuse to be a slave to the thinkings of others. Let your conviction about yourself match up with God's destiny for you. You were made with all of God's divine skills. Take a moment to appreciate how awesome you are! Yes you are!



## Daily Juice~8796

Irrespective of the situation or what the devil does, nothing can defeat a man who has an accurate understanding of his identity in Christ. Being true to your identity in Christ is better than being a liar just to impress everyone. Your uniqueness is second to none, discover it, because therein lies your fulfilment. Be yourself; to wish you were someone else is to waste the person you are! Learn to control your emotions. The only person that can make you unhappy is you! You are the one that decides to be affected by the words and actions of others. Realize this so that the next time you experience a negative emotion, you can find the strength within yourself to overcome it.



## Daily Juice~8810

Set yourself up for success and greatness. Stop focusing on your flaws and mistakes. Circumstances set the match for the reality of the image you have in your mind. None of us has exhausted God's ability, resources, mercies and power for our lives. God is infinite. God is huge. Our lives ought to be a reflection of that. If you can look at your life and say, "Well, i went to school, i did this and that, and i earned the things i have", you have missed God. Your life should be a testimony that when people ask how you're doing what you're and why you're so blessed, you should be able to say that there's no explanation outside God. If you can point to your great education, your talent, or your ability, then you have missed God. If your life isn't supernatural, it's superficial.



## Daily Juice~8852

Many people have a tough time letting go of what lies behind. There are always focused on who hurt them or how unfairly they have been treated. You have to let go of the disappointments, failures, and let those doors totally close behind you. Step forward. Men may have given up on you, but God has not given up on you. He knows that He puts the seeds of greatness in you. The first place to start is in your thinking. A door is much smaller compared to the house, a lock is much smaller compared to the door. And a key is the smallest of all but a key can open the entire house. Just a small adjustment in your thinking pattern can bring about that required change.



## Daily Juice~8865

Oftentimes, we think forgiveness is something we do for someone else, but actually, forgiveness is something we do for ourselves. Unforgiveness creates the wrong ambience around you which creates an inroad for the devil and his activities in your life. It takes more energy to hold onto a hurt, guilt, anger, resentment than it does to forgive. When we forgive, we give peace to ourselves, and free ourselves to move on and move forward. Look at the weaknesses of others with compassion, not with accusation. It's not what they are doing or should be doing that's the issue. The issue is, your interpretation of the situation is what matters most; your chosen response to the situation is your responsibility and maturity.



## Daily Juice~8870

Holding on to anger and bitterness towards someone is like drinking a poison and expecting it to hurt someone else. Anger, resentment and jealousy don't change the heart of others-- it only changes yours. Work on your anger, hatred and bitterness issues before they take you to the wrong destination. They may seem  justifiable to you but the end is destruction. Attachment to a hurt or pain arising from a past event blocks the inflow of blessings and joy into your life and makes you a prisoner of your past. Regardless of how you have been hurt, there's that capacity in you to forgive and move on. Don't choke yourself.



## Daily Juice~8894

Don't expect to see a change if you don't create one. A new place may not give you a new life. A fresh start is not a new place, it is a new mindset, because our lives always expresses the results of our dominant thoughts. You can change environments but until you change yourself, nothing really changes. It doesn't matter where you live on the outside, what matters is where you live on the inside. You cannot be greater than what you hold inside you. Your life is a reflection of what you are on the inside. Your attitude determines who stays in your life. Stop placing blame on others for your current situation. If you let them take responsibility for your happiness or sadness, they win. You are in control of your attitude. And It's this attitude that determines who controls who- either the situation controls you or you control the situation.



## Daily Juice~8901

No one rolls into success by chance. Success and failure are not accidents but consequences. Remember, when you make a choice, you also invariably choose the consequences of that choice. Everything counts; there is no neutrality. Success is a planned outcome, not an accident. Success in life is not based on need but on seed. If you want to know what you sowed in the past, look around you and see what you are reaping today. The moment you accept the truth and responsibility that choices and consequences are inseparable, you recognize that you are the pilot of all your choices, decisions and actions. When you are anchored in the reality of this responsibility, you are far more likely to act in ways that will not later become causes of regret, frustration or embarrassment.



## Daily Juice~8906

If you knew what happens in the spirit when you praise God, you would praise Him everyday. Carve out time each day and lavishly praise God. Don't allow circumstances or situations make you forget this. These words coming to you aren't just for today, they are for a brighter future. If God wants to do something for an individual or a people, He sends His word. Words are connectors. Words do not only connect you with other people, words also connect you with God. Words are your bridge between the spiritual and physical realms. Be grateful to God for the words coming to you. By predestination, you were born to hear these words; they are part of your destiny. He had already planned before the existence of time that you would hear these words, because they are not unplanned. They were already preprogrammed by God to produce success in you and for you.



## Daily Juice~8916

Your thinking is abstract but the result of your thinking is tangible. What occupies your mind determines what eventually fills your mouth, and your life follows your mouth. Your outer world showcases all that has dominated— and at times subjugated—your inner world. It is paramount that you become the master of your thoughts. Sift your thought life. Filter out anything you don’t want to have show up in your future, and focus on what you truly desire. God wired your thoughts to have power so you would be equipped to live His kind of life here on earth.



## Daily Juice~8922

No relationship is ever a waste of your time. If it didn't bring you what you want, it taught you what you didn't want. Everyone you meet has a part to play in the story of your journey in life and while some may take a chapter, others a paragragh, and most will be no more than scribbled notes in the margins. Some people come into your life as blessings; some others as lessons. You learn something from everyone who passes through your life; some lessons are painful and some are useful but they are all priceless and for a purpose. For everything has been designed to work for your good. Appreciate everyone that has passed through and will pass through; they are a part of the ultimate plan. Lessons learnt must not be forgotten and would be needed as you don't prepare for exam during the exam, you prepare for an exam before the exam.



## Daily Juice~8968

God does not start a thing without knowing the outcome. He begins every work with the end in mind. Since He already knows the end from the beginning, He also knows everything in between. It won't take Him time to make something beautiful out of your life. He only needs your attention and availability. When the seed of God's Word is planted in our hearts, it has the potential to produce a hundred fold. But the seed doesn't determine how much is produced; the ground does. If we have so many thorns in our lives and allow the cares of this world, it chokes God's Word and limit what God can do in our lives.



## Daily Juice~8986

Don't get so upset with people or a situation that it drains your joy; why put your happiness on hold because of something or someone. Laugh at the situation because both are powerless without your reactions. No matter what others do to you; they may spite, revile or criticize you; hold yourself back from responding in pride, anger or bitterness. Hold yourself in; have self-restraint and don't fight back. Silence sometimes is a good medicine. Remember, the measure of a man's strength, value or worth isn't by the number of his friends but by the power of his enemies. The only keeper of your happiness is you; stop giving people or situation the power to control your smile and your worth.



## Daily Juice~9007

You may not be responsible for the thoughts that come to you but you are responsible for meditating on them and carrying them out. You can never make meaningful progress if you continually allow things that don't deserve your attention to often distract you and bring you down. Every morning we select what clothes to wear, but we rarely select what thoughts to wear on our minds. The quality of your thoughts will affect the quality of your life. So keep checking them. Your thoughts can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Work on yourself; for your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development. See your poor results as motivation to be better and not a shame. A mistake that makes you humble is better than an achievement that makes you arrogant.



## Daily Juice~9062

The events of your past do not reduce your potentials. How someone has treated you or what someone has said about you does not change your ability. In your life, God may have done wonders in the past, but you haven't seen anything yet. The best is yet to come! Your best days are not behind you, they are in front of you! There's so much glory and beauty inside you. Don't allow your life to become obsolete and dull. God planted His seeds of greatness inside you; refuse to make little plans for your life because of present circumstances. Keep dreaming, keep stretching yourself, planning for new projects, experiences and greater adventures with God. You were never created to reach a certain level and then stop. There's no limit for the one who takes a hold of God's word to crystalize his mind and words, shakes off complacency to stretch into the next and higher level.



## Daily Juice~9111

Sometimes, you may not see the immediate results of your seeds or services to the Lord or to others. Keep at it, there's what we call heaping into the future. What if everything you are going through is preparing you for the days ahead; don't give up. Focus on the truth, the fake will fade away. Sometimes we grow through what we go through. Your present status or situation does not matter, what matters is your present revelation. If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at will change.



## Daily Juice~9401

No matter where you came from, what school you went to or not, what talent you think you have or not, none of this matters. You have the same opportunity to improve your life and succeed as did others who succeeded. Don't distort the image of yourself because you were unable to achieve success. Success is your nature! Failure is not your identity, and giving up is never an option, that will only take you back to the place you left. No matter the amount of faith you have, if you don't put it to work, it won't work; it will do you no good. Faith is voice activated! You can tell where your life is going, because your words get there first, then your life follows your words. Remember, as soon as a declaration leaves your mouth, it has already happened.



## Daily Juice~9407

Everyone carries an atmosphere. When you stop associating yourself with the wrong people, you give the right things the opportunity to associate with you. The difference between seasons in a man's life is simply an instruction. As you move forward in life, you may have to change your circle of friends. Not everyone around you is interested in seeing you improve. Be picky about the energy you surround yourself with. You can never outgrow those you surround yourself with. You owe yourself that much. If you run around with 9 losers, pretty soon you'll be the 10th loser. You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. Leave that circle! Negative people have a problem for every solution.



## Daily Juice~9464

The law justified no one and condemned the best of us, but grace saves even the worst of us. Under the law, God demanded righteousness from man. Under grace, God provided righteousness for man in Christ Jesus. Grace is never put off by your mistakes or offended by your shortcomings. In fact, grace does its best work when sin tries to condemn you. Grace isn't earned, it's a gift. Just as you didn't qualify yourself to earn God's love, you can't disqualify yourself from the grace of God. God placed His best in you. Don't allow your mistakes stop you from fulfilling God's purpose for your life. The influence of God's word in our lives is not a luxury we can do without. It's so essential. The word of God is the seed of God. We can't bear fruit without putting God's Word in our hearts any more than a farmer can have a harvest without planting seeds. Continuing in God's Word sets you apart from the multitude of others.



## Daily Juice~9495

Life is a culmination of many small decisions. A mistake repeated more than thrice is a decision not a mistake. Refuse to associate your happiness with things or someone. You can't control someone loyalty. No matter how good you are to them, doesn't mean they'll treat you the same. Do not change your character in order to please them, do not contradict your principles to agree with them, do not pretend to please them; You have a fingerprint, live with what pleases the Lord. No matter how much they mean to you, doesn't mean they'll value you the same. You may be the only person left who believes in you, but it's enough. It takes just one star to pierce a universe of darkness. You need the right people with you, not necessarily the best people. Never beg anyone to accept you for who you are. Anything you acquire through begging will require begging to maintain it. Life is not about the quantity of friends you have. It's about the quality of friends you have. It's not about who is real to your face; it's about who stays loyal behind your back.



## Daily Juice~9592

Before you were born, you existed in God's mind. He knew this world would need you at this time. He planned you with a special purpose that no one but you could fulfill. It's your road and yours alone. Others may walk in with you but no one can walk in for you. There's only one of you in the entire world and your uniqueness is what makes you beautiful. Material accomplishment will soon be forgotten, the only thing that lasts is the investment we make in our lives and in the lives of others. Don't see your importance or value through the standards of the world. Refuse to let life's circumstances define you. You don't have to conform to society's social norms and stereotypical boxes. You don't have to feel pressured to be like anyone else. You are the best of you. You must engage in new audacity. Don't cluster or crowd your life with activities which do not have eternal value. The important things of life are very simple and also very simple to miss. Activity is not synonymous with productivity. "Uncrowd" and simplify your life.



## Daily Juice~9666

You are the CEO of your life; get involved in your destiny. Engineer your life to go in the direction of divine purpose. You are either changing the circumstances of your life and your world or the circumstances in your world are changing you! People with purpose and goals have no time for drama. They are too busy adding value to their lives and to the lives of others around them. Don't have an expired mind; every next level of your life will demand a better version of you. You have been blessed with being everything that God has destined you to be. And as you experience the joy of fulfilling your purpose, you will benefit, others will benefit, and the world will be blessed.



## Daily Juice~9675

A miracle can be birthed with just a shift in your thought pattern. Do not think what your thoughts dwell upon is of no value. Your thoughts are not only orchestrating the experiences of your life, your thoughts are also making you. All those things that fill your mind hold the keys to your reality. Remember that stress doesn't come from what's going on in your life, it comes from your thoughts about what's going on in your life. Life may give you a hundred reasons to cry, stop the tears, and show life you have a thousand and one reasons to be joyful. Don't give up! The grace that brought you to this day will take you higher no matter the state of things with you right now. There is a brighter future for you and there's testimony for you!



## Daily Juice~9680

The devil mainly attacks or affects our perspective or view of life, of ourselves and of God. His major line of attack is the picture inside you. If he can control your perspective, he will control your behaviour and action. Maturity comes when you stop making excuses and you start making changes. The devil cannot place a limit on you, don't place a limit on yourself. Stop trying to fit in when you were born to stand out. Be a voice not an echo. Life on earth is not about the number of days you live but what you fit into those days that make you live a remarkable life.



## Daily Juice~9701

We don't have to cheat on our future because of the mistakes of the past. Pray for your country. Never think that your prayer isn't making any difference; you make great impact when you pray. Therefore, continue in prayer for your country. Too many people release careless words into the atmosphere and can't figure out why certain things are happening or not happening in the country. Many a time we get to a point in the journey of our lives where we consider the challenges our country is facing and we tend towards neglecting our contribution. Our country is our country not because we had parents and grandparents who paved the way for us to be a nation, we are a part of the country because it was a divine arrangement.



## Daily Juice~9720

Don't be among the challenge we are trying to solve as a nation, rather be responsible for creating and being the change we desire. The nation doesn't only need what we have, but also who we are. The index to a person's character is how he treats other people especially those who can't offer him any good. Today, more than ever before, our value for one another must be upped, and our lives must be characterized by the willingness of each of us to share in the responsibility for upholding the common good of our nation. A man has not lived, unless we can see his footprint in time. Several men have come on stage and stepped out almost unnoticed. Yet there are men whose memories are still so fresh and pleasant. Whereas the remembrance of others generate senses of pain and sorrow. The category you choose to belong has a ripple effect on the nation.



## Daily Juice~9749

Do not let a single incident stain your view of yourself. Your consciousness of your personality, identity and inheritance affects the way you live, it controls the decisions you make and the things that happen with you and around you. Everything you need is already inside you. Don't wait for others to light your fire. You have your own matches. Harness the power of daily practice. Your life is tied to your daily practices. One of the best ways to create an effective result in the most important areas of your life is through daily practice. Create a series of daily practices that set you up for success and set your day up for greatness. Perform them with consistency. And then go out into this beautiful world of ours and shine. You were built to shine!



## Daily Juice~9756

Your life has a divine blueprint for divine agenda. Life is not subject to chance, it is subject to truths. Don't miss this principle: the power for change is in your mouth! You 're a light, the more you speak the word, the more you shine brighter and brighter but when you speak negative words, your light goes dim.



## Daily Juice~9763

Leave your anger; it does more harm to you than the person you are angry with! Most people see the worst in others- they see them through the eyes of their own anger, fear and limitation. Look for the best in others. See through the eyes of understanding. I'm not suggesting that you are naive and you don't confront reality. The Word of God is reality. Don't make their mistake their identity and impute a negative intent on them. Be patient with people, we don't all understand things the same way at the same time. And here's the payoff for you: as you seek out the good in people, not only will they show up fully for you, but you will see more good in your world. Someone may still talk about the old you because they do not have access to the new you. Hold the key. Don't give them permission to define you by your past life or mistakes. Keep it shut from toxic people. You know yourself better more than anyone else. Their labels and judgement are nothing when God knows your value and worth.



## Daily Juice~9781

The daily products of our country depends on the strength of each system in the country. The mind of a country is the sum total of all the minds in the country. A polluted mind results in a polluted action and a degraded behaviour. The people in a land are the ones that make up the totality of what the land has to offer. A place is not better than the individual minds that exist there. As individuals in our nation, the identity of our nation is derived from the identity of our persons. The change we truly seek begins with You and I. Don't allow the behaviour of others stop or destroy your good. Our lives as a nation begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.



## Daily Juice~9792

You must be intentional about your life. You can let your circumstances or feelings rule you, or you can take charge of your life from within. Anything that would change your life would have to begin from your heart. It's not outside you, stop running around. Life will only change when you become more committed to your dreams than to your comfort zone. You can imprison a man, but not an idea. Believe in something larger than yourself; dig within. Within you is the wellspring of good and greatness; and it's always ready to bubble up, if you just dig. You don't drown by falling in the water, you drown by staying there. Be ashamed to catch yourself idle doing unproductive things. Be disciplined to do what you must do. There are thousands of excuses for failure but never a good reason. Don't make this period a lifetime of feeding on your fears and irrelevant things, rather feed on His word because if the word gets into you, it becomes a God and a force in you that gives your life divine direction!



## Daily Juice~9825

No matter how wonderful, generous and kind you are, you will find someone who does not love you for reasons you do not know, so do not be upset too much, some people are just like that. Avoid being distracted by the opinions of others and wasting time on insignificant matters. Avoid seeking other people and things to fulfill you. Be one of your own sources of fulfillment so you don’t have to look outside of yourself for it. Believe you’re enough. Know your worth from God's Word not from people or the society and what you want in life and allow it to flow to you because a resemblance of what you want is already in you.



## Daily Juice~9869

Pump yourself up! Invest in your joy and in the lives of others. Someone who thinks only of himself doesn't go far. Simplify your life. Strip away all that is unimportant and unnecessary- these are the things keeping you from making remarkable progress. And then once you do your clean up, be focused. You'll be surprised at the progress you'll make. Fill yourself up with God's Word and joy that comes from within. Don't allow people and circumstances take advantage of you and make you forget this. You are the longest relationship you’ll ever have. Make sure the relationship you have with yourself and God is a healthy one.



## Daily Juice~9874

The simple things are also the most extraordinary things, that's why most people miss it. Part of the reason for the way people turn out differently has to do with the values they develop for their lives and the way they see life and respond to life. Remember, you see life the way you are not as it is. Nobody will make you happy until you 're happy with yourself first. Treat yourself well! If you don't like yourself, you can't make a success out of yourself and you can't like someone else because you can't give what you don't have. You can still be happy during the process of achieving something. Happiness is a choice not a result. Don't allow your happiness to be dependent on  circumstances or on the reactions of other people towards you; refuse to be a slave to the thinkings of others. Don't put the key to your happiness in someone else's pocket; nobody can make you happy like you.

We all came from different backgrounds and experiences. Our experiences colour the way we respond to people. Don't be divisive. One thing you'll fight against is pride. When a man is proud, he sets his own standards, sees other small, but his fall is usually very big. That you can talk doesn't mean you are intelligent. People are different; some can talk while some are quiet. More so, that you can talk very well doesn't make you more spiritual than the other. Your spirituality is in working in love and forgiveness. Refuse to allow someone make you walk in malice and bitterness.



## Daily Juice~9900

Everyday you live is a gift from God. Do not waste it worrying about the future or the regret of the past. Appreciate and Celebrate good and good will gravitate towards you. Don't put yourself into thinking or worrying mood because of the success of another. Worrying does not produce miracles. The success of one does not limit the success of another. Remember, that someone else is succeeding doesn't mean you are failing. Life is a journey and it is a series of phases. Get excited about your life because your strength is tied to your joy. Never be intimidated by possessions or things. Refuse to focus on the lesser side and lesser things of life. A man's life consists not in the abundance of things which he possesses. A man is not what he has, but who he is!



## Daily Juice~9913

Certainly, one of the distinquishing characteristics between human beings and animals is the ability to use words- to speak. This gives us creative power like God. God spoke the universe into existence. We can speak circumstances into existence by our words. Life has no middle ground. Every word you speak either releases life or death; there's no middle ground. A person who has no control over his tongue is headed for destruction. You can tell what you really believe by the words you speak. You may think your words don't matter much, but they do. Most people say what they have and they continue to have more of such situations. If you realize you don't really like the circumstances of your life, don't just change your words, change your heart and your words will follow suit. Words are the guage of your heart.



## Daily Juice~9917

Stop wasting time on unimportant things. Where your attention goes, your time goes and where your time goes, your life goes. What you allow into your life, mind and heart are among the most important decisions you will ever make. It is not up to God, it is up to you. The measure of the grace of God you enjoy and experience in your life is a byproduct of your faith. You are the prophet of your life! Your outcomes in life are often a lagging measure of your habits. Never miss a chance of speaking God's Word over your life everyday. Take charge of your life. You are responsible for your life and your success depends on the choices you make. Stop attributing your problems to other people and your environment. The environment is not the limitation, your belief system is.



## Daily Juice~9931

There are many roles you may play in life, but you know there is one role you must play: to be yourself and fulfill God's destiny for your life. Sometimes, to change your life, you may have to change your priority; excellence is not a skill, it is an attitude. Don't allow someone's opinion of you become your reality or let a bad situation turn you into what you are not. God is in the business of raising you up so that you live a life of greatness, and with the expectation that you will in turn, help to elevate others. One day, there'll be a comparison between the life that God drew up for you, the life He ordained for you, and what you eventually turned out to be; how you eventually lived. And our reward will be in line with how the life we lived measured up to the life He drew up for us. The most important  thing in life is to live in line with God's purpose.



## Daily Juice~9938

Success is predictable. Don't allow your challenges to limit you. The actions you take each day creates the result of your life. And since every action you take has been preceded by a thought, meaning, your thoughts are the ancestors of your performance, guard your mind. What you focus on really drives your reality. Remember, you will never go higher than your thinking pattern. The only person you live with all your life is yourself, so you have to reconcile with yourself first of all, because if you are in an inner conflict with yourself having a dialogue of negative thought pattern, you will never live comfortably and make a success out of yourself.



## Daily Juice~9952

Problems are not given by God to make you better. Discouragement is one of the devil's favourite tool to use against you. Refuse to be discouraged by what you're going through. Be patient; your time is coming. What God is giving you requires preparation, focus, commitment and patience. He's not about preparing the blessing for you, the blessing is already there but rather, He is preparing you for the blessing. Refuse to compare your life to anyone else's or let the successes of others discourage you, rather be inspired by the successes or testimonies of others. Remember, that others are succeeding does not mean you're failing. You have not come this far to settle for less or to give up now; you are God's best! Don't allow the happening around you, a few setbacks get inside you and weigh you down or the hate slow you down. You may be feeling tired or discouraged but remember, you are not a feeling. Stay the course; your testimony is coming; it's closer than imagined.



## Daily Juice~9990

The life you see this very moment isn't necessarily the life of your future. You might be viewing things through the eyes of your fears, limitations and false assumptions. If you are going to have a more glorious future, you must do something about the present. Behind every successful person, there's God!  Small wins matter. Track your small wins for they motivate greater accomplishments. Sometimes, we face “the tyranny of the urgent”, but ensure that the things that truly count never get sacrificed for those seemingly pressing but unimportant ones. Refuse to major in the minor things of life. Your thoughts are the prophecies of your future. While your mouth is the control room of your life. Focus on improving yourself, not on proving yourself.



## Daily Juice~10007

You don’t have to wait for everything to be perfect in your life before you become happy. You don’t have to forgo happiness until you get what you are praying for or accomplish all your goals. Don't suspend your happiness because of something or someone. Enjoy every step of the way. By an act of your will, choose to enjoy your life and enjoy You! Enjoy your family, friends and health; enjoy everything in your life. Happiness is a decision you make, not an emotion you feel. Learn how to smile and laugh. Quit being so uptight and stressed out. How do you define happiness? The more and more you learn to celebrate what you have in your life is called happiness. Happiness is celebration of blessings in your life. Don't lose focus on the good things life has to offer. The earth is filled with the goodness of God; your focus is your reality. Count your blessings, not your problems. Everyday, life is a series of tiny little miracles, notice them and thank God for it. It matters what you are looking at. You will see whatever you prepare your mind to see.



## Daily Juice~10023

It is not the things that happen to a man that cause him to fail or succeed, but what he believes about the things that happen to him. Never let the experiences of your past bring harm to your future; your future doesn't deserve the punishment. Nobody is a necessary factor for your success like you and your biggest competition is you. If you would get out of that situation, what you are going through doesn't matter, what matters is what is going through your mind and coming out of your mouth amidst the situation.



## Daily Juice~10030

Stop complaining! If you approach life complaining about what you don't have or complaining about what’s missing then you’ll be dissatisfied. Satisfaction comes from knowing that things can always be improved but at the same time appreciating what is right in your life, right now. When you complain too much, you carry an air of defeat around you that is very difficult to remove. You're even defeated before you start out anything because of the mental construction of your mind. What did David need to neutralize Goliath? Just one stone! He didn't need the armies of Israel. He carried a consciousness of the One that's with him. Don't think inadequate. Carry an air, an atmosphere of the supernatural, that's a possibility consciousness every where you go. All you have is all you need. The answer you seek is inside you, because success is inside you. Bring it forth with your words.



## Daily Juice~10037

You are the intrusion of God's purpose on the earth; the manifestation of divine purpose in motion. God planned you with a special purpose that no one but you could fulfill; It's something only you can do. Get excited about your uniqueness and live for your purpose. Refuse to allow circumstances or people determine the. direction of your life. Remember, you are not going to accidentally fulfill God's will. It doesn't happen unintentionally or by coincidence. Accomplishing the things we were created to achieve means making a deliberate effort to find, follow and fulfill God's will.



## Daily Juice~10068

Leadership is taking responsibility. It has nothing to do with title or the title on your business card or the size of your office. Leadership is not about how much money you make or the clothes you wear. Leadership is an influence. It's an attitude. It's a state of mind. And it's available to each one of us. Don’t ever see anybody as too small to counsel you when you know that they have the knowledge that can move you to your next level. Don’t ever feel too proud to learn from your subordinates. If you seek the truth to move ahead, it'll gravitate towards you. And if you ignore the truth, it'll stay far from you. It does not matter who teaches you; all that matters is that you get the knowledge you need to move ahead in life. Put your pride aside and learn from even your subordinates so that you can continue to go higher and higher. Don’t despise the wisdom you need to succeed just because it is domiciled in your subordinate.



## Daily Juice~10073

Your family is the best team you could ever have; all the elements of your happiness are already there. Enjoy your family! Don't take your family for granted. Anything good is despised by everything evil. Stop comparing your family to that of others or your love story to those you watch in movies because they 're written by scriptwriters and yours is written by God. Differences, make us all different and unique. When we talk about a great man, it's not about how much money he's got in the bank, it's not in how many people respect him. It's the quality of his influence and personality. How he affects other people's lives in the quality of their persons. Stop living to impress people; any man who provides for his family at the right time and also extends his hands of blessing to others is a success.



## Daily Juice~10087

Prepare yourself for what you are praying for. You are never too old to reinvent yourself. Don't fill your mind with garbage information with zero processing ability. The amount of people you follow on various social media platforms, what value are they adding to your personal growth? Our mind is like a garden, you choose what to plant in it. If you don't program your life with God's Word, life and social media will program you. It is essential that you become extremely vigilant about what enters your mind daily. What you hear affects how you think and what you believe. If you want to have life-affirming thoughts—thoughts of success, peace, joy and progress—then fill your ears with words that will produce these things in your life.



## Daily Juice~10091

Your life is a product of your habit. Being miserable is a habit; being happy is a habit, the choice is yours. Conquer bad habits or they will eventually conquer you. Chains of bad habits are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken. Stop it! You're the creator of your story, and your success story begins with a change from within! You're not a victim! The victim mentality dilutes your God-given potential. You are far bigger than any lifestyle and habits that are trying to pull you back. Crystallize what God has given to you. You are a genius but you need to discover your niche; you need to understand your person; therein lies your success and ultimate fulfilment. The world has a way of making room for the man whose words and actions show that he knows where he is going.



## Daily Juice~10095

Don't allow anyone to make you feel you're not good enough. Maturity is when someone dislikes you and you still pray for them to succeed. Be happy about You. Quit trying to be someone else; you are the best of you. Don't let your emotions speak for you. Have value for yourself, for if you don't have value for yourself, you can't value someone else. There's always someone watching and has hopes on you. Never give up. Refuse to settle for less just because you have no other alternatives available.



## Daily Juice~10119

Keep away from people who belittle your ambition. Don’t expect to see positive changes in your life if you surround yourself with negative people. Don’t give part-time people a full-time position in your life. If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what's their plan for you? Not Much!



## Daily Juice~10135

Don't use your energy to worry. Negative comments from others are their own fears or insecurity being projected onto you. If You allow them to get to you, doubts will throw you off your path. Your past experiences may have made you the way you are but you don't have to remain and stay that way. Remember, God does not consult your past to determine your future. You are not your failure, and you are not a failure. Failure is an event not a person. Just because you couldn't do something yesterday doesn't mean you can't achieve it. Refuse to embody your mistakes and label yourself as a "failure" or carry your mistakes around with you. Instead, place them under your feet and use them as a stepping stone to arise above it. Your value doesn't decrease because you made a mistake; you are not your mistake. Be awaken to these truths and let go of all the negative individuals and thoughts in your life that just drag you down; don't let insecurity ruin the beauty you were born with; be better than you were yesterday. Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other people's hands. Never be a victim of life; be its conqueror!



## Daily Juice~10141

The good life is for you. Choose to be a success. Become inspiring! Refuse to give up! Believe in what God made. God made you and He never made a failure. God knew you were coming and He made sufficient provisions for you! Don't let comparison and discouragement sap your joy. Refuse to allow a few setbacks discourage you. Remember, ships don't sink because of the water around them; ships sink because of the water that gets into them. Refuse to allow what's happening around you get inside you and weigh you down. Maintain your inner climate and superimpose that inner climate into the situation. You have come too far to settle for less. Discouragement is one of the tools of the enemy. Your testimony is much closer than you could imagine. Stay the course, keep doing the Word.



## Daily Juice~10153

Stop getting attention from those who dislike you. Someone's opinion of you does not have to be your reality. When you know your worth, you do not need others to confirm it. Life is not a product of circumstances, but a product of decisions. Just because a decision hurts doesn't mean it's the wrong decision. If all your decisions are emotionally based, you will be easily influenced and you can't go far. Those who use their feelings as a sure guide are terribly limited. Our feelings respond to the information it has been fed with- whether good or bad. That something feels good doesn't mean it is good and just because something feels bad doesn't mean it is bad. Use God's word to measure and line up your decisions.



## Daily Juice~10164

Don't get discouraged by the success of others. Sometimes, what you are praying to have is what someone else has in abundance. Refuse to be envious or jealous. That you notice someone has it around you is proof-positive that yours is around the corner. When you hear a testimony, the power and favour that produced that testimony is transmitted to you if you would believe and accept it. More so, when God blesses someone around you and you could hear about it, it shows He is in the neighbourhood, attract Him with your faith. But remember, you cannot attract what you despise. Life answers to us largely by our attitudes than by our prayers. Your attitude towards good things is the magnet that determines yours. The world is full of beautiful places, let your heart be one of them.



## Daily Juice~10181

The dominant experience of your life is a reflection of the way you are thinking on the inside. Instead of looking for a change to take place externally in everybody and everything else around you, the first thing you need to do is recognize that change begins on the inside of you. This occurs according to the knowledge that you have of God. This is a simple truth, but it's profound. In fact, most people miss it because it's so simple. God's Word is true! You can turn any circumstance in your life around by getting God's perspective and starting to think His thoughts and declare His Word. Once you realize the power of your tongue, you won’t just say anything. When you realize the power of your thoughts, you won’t entertain just anything. And once you realize the power of your presence, you won’t just be anywhere.



## Daily Juice~10186

Whatever is growing in the garden of your life is what you've planted or allowed to be planted. Before things can change, you must quit giving excuses and blaming anybody and everybody else for what's wrong in your life. Quit saying, "it's fate," or "bad luck" or "nothing ever works for me." Scripture reveals that as you think in your heart, that's the way you're going to be. Thoughts produce things in your life. Your thought life produces a harvest in the natural realm.



## Daily Juice~10209

How you handle your money reflects who you are. It's not the amount of money you earn that matters, it's the size of your thinking that counts. Your ideas, skills can bring money, and money is meant to bring more money. The rule is money makes money, and the money money makes, makes more money. You are the root of your financial success or failure; if you work on the root, the fruits will take care of themselves. Beware of little expenses-- a small leak will sink a great ship. A budget is telling your money where to go, instead of wondering where it went. Tell your money where to go before your feelings do! Don't tell me what you value, show me your budget and I’ll tell you what you value. For if you keep doing what you're doing, you'll keep getting what you're getting! It's never too late to turn things around.



## Daily Juice~10227

Whatever we surrender our minds to, will eventually shape our character and define the quality of our life. Be careful what you surrender your mind to, even if it’s only for a day, or an hour. The mind is very important. It's the door to your spirit and it's also the door from your spirit out, to bring something into the natural world. Get the right information from God's word and your mindset towards life would change. Nothing can defeat a man whose mind is made up to succeed and nothing can help a man whose mind has already accepted defeat. The mind is an influential force in your life. You own your mind; your mind doesn't own you. It's your instrument, learn to be its master and not its slave.



## Daily Juice~10243

Health is not only addressing the issue of what you're eating, but also what's eating you up. It is also what you're thinking and saying. Your body is 70% water and it responds to words. Don't deform the water crystals in your body with negative thoughts and words. The Word of God is medicine for your body. The key to wellness is to expose your body to God's Word, and accept personal responsibility for your health and wellbeing; and cheerfulness is one of the best promoters of health. Don't destroy your body and mind with worries; every challenge has come to pass. Trust God and relax! Your mind is like a garden, your thoughts and words are the seeds, you can grow beautiful flowers or you can grow weeds. Don't allow the body to scream for rest and turning "red" before you rest. Take care of your body; it's the only place you have to live in to fulfill your God-given dreams on earth.



## Daily Juice~10260

Remember, sometimes some things have to end for better things to begin. If other people and circumstances have caused you the mess you are in, it's time for a change. Quit blaming everything and everyone for the way things are with you. You have to accept responsibility in order to be in control and change things.



## Daily Juice~10269

Regardless of what's been done to you, it's the way you responded to it that has made you the way you are. The issue isn't the situation, it's your response that matters most. Don't think other people and circumstances need to change first before your life gets better. You are the one you can change to cause a change in the situation. Stop thinking like a victim, you are a victor. Your perspective towards the situation has a direct link to the change you require. God is more interested in changing you than in changing the situation, because if you change, the situation will change.



## Daily Juice~10292

To perceive the world differently, we must be willing to change our belief system. Don't equate your self-worth with how well you do things in life. You aren't what you do. If you are what you do, then when you don't, you aren't. You are the expression of divine excellence, and divine verities exude from you. Don't allow your temporary deeds make you think otherwise. You are always a valuable, worthwhile and unique person, not because anybody else says so, not because you are making lots of money, but because God says so, and you decide to know it and act so.



## Daily Juice~10296

You can't make a real success out of your life if you are unhappy with yourself. Flowers blossom in a forest even when there is no one to admire their beauty. A fundamental mistakes most people make is to search for happiness in things and people. Reshape your thinking, because you are a bundle of joy, and there's so much joy inside you. Happiness comes from the way you think and process situations. No one can create negativity, stress or sadness within you. Only you can do that by virtue of how you process your world. You and only you can choose your thoughts.



## Daily Juice~10299

Stop living in regret; your sin is not bigger and more important than what Jesus did for you on the cross. Worrying, habitually complaining and condemning of one's self will not produce a change of heart. Put yourself on a Word diet; don't give up. The most amazing things in life tend to happen right at the moment you're about to give up; just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, it became a butterfly. It's never too late to be who God has designed you to be. As long as you keep waking up in the morning, is proof positive that God isn't through with you yet.



## Daily Juice~10341

Do not pressure someone to change, you may lose your relationship with him, no one will change unless he wants to do so from within. Never loose yourself while searching or loving someone else. Being you is your only power. You are you, and there’s nothing wrong with You. Prove yourself to yourself, not to others. Don’t waste your energy trying to convince people to understand and like you. Your time is too valuable to try to prove yourself to people. God will always bring the right people into your life, but you have to let the wrong people walk away.



## Daily Juice~10362

If someone isn't what others want them to be, others become angry. Don't be afraid of losing people, be afraid of losing yourself by trying to please everyone around you. Don't be afraid to be who you are; if there are people who won't accept you, let them go. Don't let someone else's opinion of you take centre stage in your life. See that you have the best seat in the house of your life. When people take centre stage in the decision and activities that affect our lives and issues, there's tendency to encounter failure.



## Daily Juice~10366

Don't ruin a good today by worrying about an unpleasant yesterday. People have several things they've all gone through, but what they make of those things is what makes them. Your situation is not unique. You may not be able to control every situation and its outcome, but you can control your attitude and how you deal with it. Do not mix your problems and circumstances with your dealings with others. Look away and recover quickly from the pain of the past. Look at yourself with respect. Calm down, worrying get you exhausted with anxiety, thinking and fatigue, and why all this for something or an accomplishment. These matters are in the hands of God. The compensation that comes from God "no matter how seemingly late" erases the pains of the past and you'll be superbly blessed. Do not blame and distract yourself too much because of it, take it easy on yourself and trust God.. and soon you will have a testimony and you will rejoice and be happy. Be joyful and smile, the beauty of your smile was not created in vain.



## Daily Juice~10370

Don't let challenges, past mistakes or emotional hurts limit your life and stifle your future. Make a determination to embrace the good that is waiting for you. Refuse to be a victim. Look at the costs of being a victim, not only to you, but also to all the lives you have to touch. Determine that you 're not going to let negative events become the defining moments of your life. Focus on what you still have, not on what you 've lost, and as you do, a fresh enthusiasm and joy will spring forth from within you, because there is something inside you that is greater than all the challenges in the world put together.



## Daily Juice~10390

Rather than tying to figure out what others can do for you, start looking for things you can do for someone else. What you make happen for others, God will make happen for you. You were not created to focus only on yourself. Don't make the mistake of living life only for yourself. That's one of the worst prisons you could ever live in. To make an impact in somebody's life, you don't necessarily have to preach a long sermon to that person; just be good to them. Remember, those you've done good to don't necessarily have to be the ones to repay you, because that's where most miss it and become sad. It's a law and it'll certainly come back to you. Your actions will speak louder than your words. God is not looking for great preachers, He is looking for those who would walk in love. God is love. When you show love, you are showing God to the world.



## Daily Juice~10421

Today is a miracle, start it with gratitude! Don't allow the approval, applause and attention of others destroy you. Remain humble and grateful for all of your accomplishments, and know that the Greater One is always at work in you. Know that success is your nature and as such, you bring success into all you do. You are a child of God; you are entitled to a life filled with joy, love and blessings. Tie your joy to who you are and what you have in Christ and not to people or things. Don't see what you have achieved yesterday with the same pleasure eyes you used to see it when it was done by you. Look forward and do better than you did yesterday!



## Daily Juice~10469

Make your life an impact not a burden! Be a real contributor to your world, don't just exist, put the best into developing yourself; you have no idea how dependent the world is on you. Make the world a better place because you lived in it and played your part. A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle. Anyone can find dirt in someone else; be the one that finds the gold. You were born with an ability to change someone else's life, don't waste it. How you make others feel about themselves, says a lot about you. The light you have within you can light up someone's world. Be a channel of happiness! There is no joy in possession without sharing. The more you share of the virtue that you carry, the more you open up for more virtue. The more you share of the little you have, the more you position yourself for better things. The main reason God blesses you is because of others.



## Daily Juice~10477

Don't live your life based on the script and opinions of your environment. Create the right picture of your future from the scriptures. People will say negative things about you. No matter what is said, what you tell yourself is what really counts. Don't let negative and toxic people rent space in your mind! What you tell yourself everyday through your inner thoughts and words will either lift you up or tear you down.



## Daily Juice~10491

Whether you succeed or fail doesn't depend on others as much as it depends on you. Thoughts are powerful. Thoughts are pictures of the mind that have constructive or destructive possibilities. Harness your thoughts and focus! One of the true definitions of meditation I like is simply focusing your attention on something to the point that it never leaves your consciousness. Your feet will never take you where your mind has never been. You cannot grow above your consciousness level; if by chance you do, life will bring you back to the level of your thoughts. Live in the consciousness of blessings.



## Daily Juice~10496

People are insecure in themselves because they pay too much attention to what others are and what others are doing. Comparison is a thief of joy. It wanes down the joy of living your own life. Run your own race. You carry so much love in your heart. Give some to yourself. You are perfect exactly as you are! It's not what is outside, but what is inside that takes one to the top. There is no competition in destiny. Each one has its own. Your real competition is to always outdo your past! You can be the best that you can be when you are not comparing yourself with anyone. If you are not careful, you will end up living the illusions that others have created. When you know your worth, you do not need others to confirm it.



## Daily Juice~10535

It's the blessing of the Lord that makes one rich not one's strugglings. God only asks you to give what He wants you to have more of. Poverty can't stay when God is being glorified by your giving. God would not break His principles because you are crying. God does not respond to pain, He responds to faith. If you would want to see God, follow Him in His Word, by His Word and through His Word! Every opportunity you have to give to God is His way of setting you up for greater blessings. What your giving does for you is far greater than the thing you are giving for; it causes something unseen to be transmitted into your life, and as you believe in it, it produces results in all you do and follows you everywhere you go. Remember, your giving connects you and everything that concerns you with God's Spirit and gives you results that aren't only for today, but for tomorrow and for all time.



## Daily Juice~10548

Magnify God; don't magnify your problem. There's no situation that is greater than you. Understand, God did not create you as a victim of circumstances. He didn't create you as a negative thinking person; depressed, stressed out and worried. You were created to be happy, contended, peaceful and to enjoy your life. He wants us to be examples of what it means to live a life of faith. When people see us, they should see so much joy, peace that they will want what we have. See things from this perspective. Begin retraining your mind in these particular areas. Many times, the change or miracle we desire is hinged in our attitudes towards life, things and people.



## Daily Juice~10583

Wear your blessings, not your problem. Never let the things you want make you forget the things you have. One day, you'll look back and realize that you worried too much about things that don't really matter. Your past mistakes are meant to guide you not define you. Don't fall into the mental trap of assuming that people who are doing better than you are actually better than you. This is not necessarily true. They are just doing things differently, and what they had learnt to do, within reason, you could learn as well. Unknowingly, we spend so much time comparing ourselves with others and running after them and we miss out on our own God-given path.



## Daily Juice~10593

Nothing in this world can affect a person as much as his thoughts. Irrespective of where you're in life or what has happened to you,  get over it, move forward and make a success out of your life. Never give someone the satisfaction of watching you suffer.  The greatest investment is in yourself. Become the best version of yourself. Work on being, not just on having; with what you 're, you'll have. Rule your mind and mouth or they'll ruin you. What appears today to be a sacrifice will prove instead to be the greatest investment that you will ever make!

To enjoy the blessings of God in your life, your heart and mouth must work together in accordance with God's Word. When the seed of God's Word is planted in the ground (our hearts). It has the potential to produce one hundred fold. But the seed doesn't determine how much is produced: the ground does. If we have so many thorns in our lives, and allow the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust of other things enter into our hearts and choke God's Word, then we limit what He can do in our lives. We cannot really understand the greatness of God without shutting out some things out.



## Daily Juice~10623

Stop being affected by the opinion of others; the best things of life aren't things. As a man of purpose, focus on your destination, not on your situation. God isn't against you having things but He is against things having you. Refuse to major on the minor things of life. The success of one does not limit the success of another. Stop fighting with yourself in your mind and stop fighting with people in your head. Remember, that someone else is succeeding doesn't mean you are failing. Life is a journey and it is a series of phases. Get excited about your life, because your strength is connected to your joy. Never be intimidated by possessions or things. Refuse to focus on the lesser side and lesser things of life. A man's life consists not in the abundance of things which he possesses. A man is not what he has, but who he is!



## Daily Juice~10639

Don't confuse activity with productivity. Stop pressing rewind on things that need to be deleted from your life! The first step to getting what you want is having the courage to get rid of what you don't. Your BEFORE and AFTER must not be the same. Project yourself forward, open your arms to change but don't let go of your values. Remember, achievements means nothing if we are not a success as a person.



## Daily Juice~10650

Treat yourself with love; treat yourself like someone you love. Focusing yourself to be accepted by people is a waste of time. Just focus and add value to yourself and people shall come seeking your help. Stop wishing you looked like someone else or wishing people liked you as much as they liked someone else.

You are an embodiment of potentials and opportunities! Don't wait for life to make things happen for you, take yourself to the next level of life by making things happen. Be a first-rate version of yourself instead of a second-rate version of somebody else.



## Daily Juice~10659

You must have control of the authorship of your life. The pen that writes your life's story must be held in your hand. Accept no one's definition of your life if it is inconsistent with the Creator's description of you; define yourself through God's word! Never be intimidated by your challenges, no matter how tough they are, they will bow to your destiny. Work out your destiny with words!



## Daily Juice~10671

What you do with Time, Words and Opportunity given you will determine the direction of your life. Challenges in life are inevitable, but being defeated is a choice. God gave us His kind of life to bring the divine essense into all situations on earth. It's time to do greater things than what the 'you' from yesterday did. If you're not expanding, growing, multiplying, creating and attracting within your life, then you truly don't know what your life is all about. Your life will either be just to balance the ecosystem or a life worth living in which we prosper for a divine purpose. The choice is all up to you!



## Daily Juice~10681

Two people in agreement can do much more than 2000 people in disunity. As you move forward in life, you may have to check and possibly change your circle of friends. Not everyone around you is interested in seeing you improve. If you run around with 9 losers, pretty soon you'll be the 10th loser. You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. Leave that circle! Everyone carries an air than follows him or her. When you get the wrong people out of your life, the wrong things stop happening. Each friendship is an ingredient that changes the equation of your life for good or for good. Everyone cannot be in your inner caucus; a stranger does not get to your bedroom. A stranger isn't someone whom you've met or seen. A stranger is someone God has not sent to your life.



## Daily Juice~10690

Being a talkative is not a gift. The loose tongue spreads strife and hatred. When people open their lives and challenges to you, count it a privilege. They didn't tell you so you can spread it to other people. Learn to exercise self-control over your mouth and tame that push to talk! Become the leader that you would like to follow. Handle people's Information with utmost confidentiality! Train yourself to be someone that can be trusted. Betrayal is also leaking out information told you in private. Be a person of integrity that can be trusted to handle people's private information with utmost secrecy.



## Daily Juice~10696

Some goodbyes are good for growth. Don't always think what can happen in a month, or what can happen in a year; focus on the 24 hours in front of you and do what should do to get you closer to where you want to be. There's no future that is not connected to the present. What you do today affects your tomorrow. No one is busy, it's only a matter of priorities. Most times, you feel you don't have enough time, but actually, what you don't have is enough concentration. Your life is your responsibility. You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great. Practise more affirmations, it works!



## Daily Juice~10701

When God laid down the plan for your life, He lined up goodies for you. But God cannot do anything in your life if you can't give Him your attention, because your attention is your trust in Him. Your attention manifests your solution. God speaks to the heart that is relaxed. What dominates our attention determines the direction of our lives. If you don't set your mind on Him, your mind will keep going everywhere and mostly the wrong things. Don't give attention to your adversaries or distractions, for they don't count. It makes no difference how many people gang up against you, they are not a factor. If you give Him your attention, He'll give you a fulfilment that you could never know otherwise.



## Daily Juice~10714

Every man's life is a story, through which the lessons of life, either positive or negative, could be unravelled, for the inspiration required by others, to live a better life. Living in a world we've not lived in before requires a roadmap. The Lord knowing all these gave us the Bible. That's one of the great benefits of studying the Bible. To ignore the bible is to ignore solutions to life's challenges. Replace worrying and complaining with meditation on the Word.



## Daily Juice~10722

Your joy is one of the most beautiful things about you. People ask you what you do for a living so that they can calculate the level of respect to give you! Never mind, don't equate your work to your worth in life. Your work is not your worth; no amount of money given to you can be equated to your worth. Don't allow situation and people steal your joy, whether with a word, look, attitude, or anything that makes you sad. Feed your faith and your fear will starve to death. Your positive interpretation of what is happening to you matters more than the situation itself. Quit worrying! Worrying is meditating on the wrong stuff; It is using your imagination to create things you don't want. God is bigger than what you are worrying about. Learn how to enjoy where you are on the way to where you are going.



## Daily Juice~10836

Don't allow someone's bad attitude towards you turn you into what you are not. Irrespective of what happens, your response is what counts. You are not a product of circumstances, you are a product of your decisions. Bring out the good in other people; your greatest test is when you are able to help someone else while you are going through your own storm. Never look down on anyone unless you are helping him or her up. How you make others feel about themselves says a lot about you.



## Daily Juice~10849

Stop being defined by what others think of you. Do not live for the expectations of people around you; live for your purpose. Your value doesn't decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth. Life is based on perception; perception is based on opinion; opinion is based on thoughts; thoughts come from the mind through information. The only person that can stop you in life is you. When you feel good about yourself, you don't need anyone's validation or approval to be you. The only person you compete with is you. Don't compare yourself. You have different talents and abilities than others, harness and maximize your uniqueness. Be yourself, because an original is worth more than a copy. Believe in yourself; you are stronger than you think.



## Daily Juice~10922

Realize that you are not your mistakes, then let it go. Your present and future don't have to suffer the mistakes of the past. Often, it’s not about becoming a new person, but becoming the person you were meant to be. You are a product of divine skill. You can't depend on anyone or anything else outside of yourself to be happy. You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection. Learn to like yourself; learn to love yourself, not as men love you but as God loves you. You have everything within you to be a success and have good success. This is your life and no one else can live it for you. Find joy each day in the little things and you will find beauty in everything.



## Daily Juice~10982

One of the things that is unique to you is your smile. Don't allow people and circumstances take that away from you that you are now always frowning. Your smile is unique to you. Smile, you don't own all the problems in the world. Filter what goes on in your mind, your thoughts affect your mood. Don't make someone who lives with you in your present pay the price for an experience you had in your past. Sometimes we react with anger to people who live among us now, while in reality we are reacting to memories of a past gone. Life doesn't make you or break you, it's actually your mentality that decides. What's playing out of our lives is a picture of the function of our minds. How you see yourself does not only affect how others see you, but also affect how things are with you!



## Daily Juice~10988

Figure out your priorities and don't major on the irrelevant things. Stop attributing your problems to other people and your environment. The sky is not the limit, your belief system is. Take charge of your life. Many people can be responsible for your success but you are solely responsible for your failure. What you allow is what will continue. Life is what we make of it. Surround yourself with those on the same mission as you. Be your own inspiration! Your ultimate success depends on the choices you make. You need to understand your kind of person; therein lies your uniqueness and success. Your success story begins from within! You have been engineered for success from birth. Failure is not a gift from God, but a result of our decisions, actions and inactions.



## Daily Juice~10991

Life originates and comes from your spirit, not from your flesh or your mind. What is fulfilled in your life is your responsibility. In your life, you can decide to grow or you can decide to fail; it's your responsibility. For some people, suffering is a gift, not from God but because of their attitudes. Don't bad-mouth or back-bite others. If you are still involved in harming others, hostility, gossip, unkindness, meanness, you are not growing spiritually and you are attracting negativities into your life. There's no law that is greater than love. The extent of your maturity is expressed in your love walk.



## Daily Juice~11010

Nothing brings down a man or takes him up more than his own thoughts and words. Refuse to think the wrong thoughts but set your sail on the right thoughts. The right thoughts and words create an environment of good that surrounds you, and that environment repels the negativities of life. God made you to be happy. If you are not happy, you are not fulfilling the purpose for your creation. He created you to be happy, sound and prosperous. You are for His joy and He is for your joy. Give things time. Don’t let how things appear make you forget how much is already happening in your favour. Just because you don’t see it all instantly manifesting doesn’t mean great things aren’t on the way or in the works for you. Be patient and keep talking the Word. Your Confessions are the pictures of your future.



## Daily Juice~11022

Stop struggling, success in life begins with Christ! What people think about you doesn't matter as much as what you think about yourself, so be what God wants you to be, not what people want! Because their opinions change, but your vision of yourself will stick with you for life. You can change environment, but until you change, nothing else will ever change. Remember, things don't change with time, things change with the application of truth. Aging is a matter of the mind, if you don't mind, it doesn't matter. Maturity doesn't come with age, it comes with demands and responsibilities. The first step to getting what you want is having the courage to get rid of what you don't want. Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. New information may be required to birth something new. You may have to change your strategy. Your personal values if not geared towards divine acceleration comformity would have to change. There are friends and thoughts you may have to let go for you to make impact and greater progress.



## Daily Juice~11080

You are as divine as God is, and you have all that God could ever give. You create the right environment around you through the words you speak. We are made in the image and likeness of God. God speaks and sees the results. You are the speaker, God is the doer; speak and see the result. Therefore, do not let your dreams die half-way or let your visions die midstream. Refuse to reduce the scope of your thoughts and what you can achieve in life because of present circumstances. That situation is a distraction and a mirage. God never gives up on His dream. You are His dream, you must not give up! Most people fail because of broken focus. Success requires constancy of purpose. Life has its responsibility to distract you but you have the responsibility to remain focused.



## Daily Juice~11087

Don't allow social media train you wrongly that you start comparing your life instead of appreciating everything you are and have. No wonder most people are depressed. Recognize greatness in others. Never monopolize achievement. Be a vehicle to bring out the best in everyone, even those deemed your opposition. You don't have to blow off another's candle for it won't make yours shine brighter. Refuse to feel unimportant and insecure when someone does something remarkable. Your time will come, you will shine one day. If you are in the background cheering for someone else today, just keep working on yourself and on your dream, sooner or later, things will change and others will be cheering you up. Remember, sometimes to see a miracle, you have to be the miracle. Someone else's success will not limit yours, and their success shouldn't be the source of your unhappiness.



## Daily Juice~11113

Life becomes more exciting when others can smile because of you. There are many good people in this world, if you can't find one, be One! Be the reason someone believes in the goodness of people. Those that live only for themselves are terribly limited. Whatever you do for yourself is gone when you are gone but the deeds you do for others remain as your legacy after you 're gone. Refuse to be a dead end, be a fountain! Never underestimate the difference you can make in the lives of others. If your success isn't for the betterment of other people, you are a failure! Don't see success with God as success with things. Success in life isn't just about what you 've accomplished for yourself; it's about what you inspire others to do that make them better. You never look good trying to make others look bad. You rise by lifting others. The key in life is not accumulation, it's contribution. When you live to improve the lives of others, your life improves automatically. The seed you give may leave your hands but it doesn't leave your life, it prepares the ground for production and harvest.



## Daily Juice~11116

## Daily Juice~11127

God has given you the characteristics that attract love and affection. Someone who doesn't like you doesn't know you and never be angry with someone who doesn't like you. The only reason why he doesn't like you is because he doesn't know you. The day he gets to know you, he would like you because you are loveable. Don't put your happiness on hold because of someone or something. You were made with all of God's divine skills. Take a moment to appreciate how awesome you are- Yes, You are!

## Daily Juice~11180

Know that the strength of your personality follows the strength of your thinking, and do not look at yourself with an inferior look. Do not give yourself the feeling that you are not special. On the contrary, see yourself as a special, distinct personality. We lock our rooms. We lock our offices. We lock our cars. But some of us leave the door of our minds open to all sort of trash to get in! We allow our minds to be filled with negative words; the words we hear, the words we read, and the words we speak to ourselves! They are toxic. It's time to detoxify your mind. Stand guard at the door of your mind 24/7. Your mind is the door to your heart. Choose what gets in and what stays out. Remember that your mind is a thought factory. It produces base on the raw materials you feed it. If you put in garbage, you get garbage. So, fill your mind with faith-filled words, so your thoughts will create the reality that you want to see in your life!



## Daily Juice~11186

You need peace more than people. People will not always appreciate the good that you do but will put you down for the one mistake you make. Rise above their criticisms and stay strong. Don't amplify that one mistake. Remember, that you made a mistake doesn't mean your life is a mistake. Never allow people's compliments get to your head nor their criticisms get to your heart. One of the most important decisions you have to make is to maintain an atmosphere of joy. No matter how much you grow and try, someone will be there to: gossip you, put you down, judge you, hurt you. But their words can't take the power or your joy from you unless you allow it. People who are secure in themselves don't put others down; they lift them up. You must be careful that you don't destroy other people's image and confidence through careless words or actions. Don't judge others because they think differently than you do. Remember, every time you judge someone, you reveal a part of yourself that needs healing.



## Daily Juice~11195

Don't leave your future in the hands of someone else. The major thing making you unhappy isn't the situation but your own thoughts, change them. Your perception becomes your reality. Don't accept your present state in life as final, because it is just a state. There's so much in the future. Refuse to give up on life and on yourself. Don't rob your life of your own peace and joy because of a situation. Don't wait for the spectacular, what is important is the supernatural. The lessons that are coming to you are for a brighter future. Believe in a greater tomorrow, but the greater tomorrow begins with today's principles.



## Daily Juice~11202

Sometimes, the weight you have to lose isn't on your body but on your mind. The most important places to keep clean are your heart and mind. Refuse to allow resentment, bitterness, unforgiveness, anger, cynicism find expressions in you and through you. Unforgiveness is like holding the door open for the devil; It's like drinking poison and hoping it would hurt someone else. To be unforgiving is to allow circumstances rob you of your joy in life. Forgiving others isn’t so much about the one who offended you; it’s about your own life; it’s for your benefit not theirs. Don't allow his anger become your anger. Don't waste your words on people who deserve your silence. Sometimes, the most powerful thing that you can do is to say nothing at all. People are different. If the doctor treated all patients with the same medicine, most of them would have died, so do not treat all people in the same way. Let God’s essence within you flow out like a stream as you relate with others in love.



## Daily Juice~11208

No negative emotion is worth holding on to when you consider what it is doing to you. countless people today are making themselves sick over things that don't count because they let things get to them. The only person who can make you act in an unloving way is you. Only you can decide how you act.

Your biggest enemy is the version of yourself that wants to settle for less. You don't need too many people to be successful. The only two you require to be successful are God and yourself, and happily, both are already with you. Greatness is in your DNA. God doesn't make junk. Don't allow pains and challenges to infiltrate the walls of your life that all you think about are the challenges. Take responsibility for your life and for your happiness. Most people suffer more in their minds than they do in real life because of worrying. Worrying is a waste of emotion and imagination. Overthinking is parasitic. It’s viral. It’s deadly, even. Letting yourself fall victim to overthinking doesn’t just kill your happiness, it destroys who you are. The mind is a beautiful and complex thing, and the only person who can hurt it is yourself. No situation is permanent, you can change anything. Some challenges come as distractions. Starve your distractions, feed your focus. Focus your attention on the Word. All of life is study of attention; where your attention goes, your life follows.



## Daily Juice~11295

A simple change in your belief system guides a large part of your life. It permeates every part of your life. Don't judge your abilities from your previous attempts. Everyday, there's a fresh grace for you, and don't dwell on the previous failures or mistakes. God does not put a dream in your mind without giving you the ability to achieve it, so do not despair.‌‌ Don't misuse your imagination through worrying. What are you using your imagination for? For the tomorrow you want or for the tomorrow you don't want? Imagination is a mental tool given to us to work miracles in our lives. By using your imagination, you can see your future life as scripted by God. Align your imagination with the realities of blessings, success, progress and favour in your life. Use your imagination for the kind of life you desire.

Nobody is a necessary factor for your success in life like you. There are some situations we don't see which would have been worse off but God intervened.

Be so happy that when others look at you, they become happy too. Keep the smile of a victor on your face always. Nothing can successfully work against you because all things, in all of creation are working together to produce good in your life. Just because something bad happens to many people doesn't mean it should happen to you. Remember, you will always attract what you believe you're worth. The measure of a man's strength, worth or value isn't by the number of his friends but by the power of his enemies and the way he bears up under challenges. Adversity causes some men to break, but causes others to break records. Where do you fall in? Refuse to be a victim of another man's ignorance or bad demeanor. Remember this: You are free to choose but you are not free from the consequences of your choice.



## Daily Juice~11386

Sometimes there are reasons why people act the way they do. Probably, who knows if you had gone through the same condition, you might have acted same way. Don't mix bad words with bad mood; you might have several opportunities to change a mood but you'll never get the opportunity to replace the words you've spoken. Hurting someone can be as easy as throwing a stone in the sea but do you have any idea how deep that stone can go? Respect people's feelings, even if it doesn't mean anything to you, it could mean everything to them. How you make others feel says a lot about you. Hurting people hurt others. Don't be quick to judge, you need to understand that person's feelings and thoughts and what they might be going through. Be sensitive to the plight of others. A little consideration, a little thought for others makes all the difference. You are who you are today because of what God's grace has made you.



## Daily Juice~11390

Anything you can pay more attention to more than God has become your idol. You can't put your life in the hands of God and regret it! Stop trusting men for what only God can do. Why put in the hands of men what should be in God's hands. Don't focus on man; if a man makes you, man will destroy you. To walk with God and enjoy God, you must give Him time and patience. God uses "using" you to work on you because He wants to match your character with the destiny He has for you and that's why He's more interested in changing you than in changing your circumstances. The God that has brought you this far cannot leave you now. Your life has been fashioned and planned by God for good. Refuse to be discouraged! Sometimes, some situations that happen to you is a form of instruction if you pay attention.



## Daily Juice~11407

Don't allow circumstances and your needs dictate your life. The happiness and success of your life depend on the quality of your thoughts. It is never too late to decide to become a better person and become successful. Your curiosity for what is hidden in you is far better than your curiosity for what is hidden from you. Success is inside you. Be addicted to bettering yourself through the Word! The Word of God is a step-up converter, it will step up your life. Give yourself time, but you will struggle to focus until you give yourself a clear deadline. Be success-conscious! Success isn't necessarily measured towards the tail end of one's life; it can be measured at different stages of one's life. Remember, behind every successful man, there's God. So, when you get successful, don't allow it get to your head, and refuse to be distracted. Keep your feet and eyes on God! Don't walk away from God.



## Daily Juice~11416

Be careful what you surrender your mind to, even if it's only for a day, or an hour. Whatever we surrender our minds to will eventually shape our character and define the quality of our lives. The mind is an influential force in your life. You own your mind, your own doesn't own you. It's your instrument, learn to be its master and not its slave. You will never have more, go further or accomplish greater things than your thoughts allow you. There is a direct correlation between the quality of our thoughts and the quality of our lives. You are the architect and building contractor of your life. Use your thoughts as an architect uses a blueprint. If you do not take control of your inner thoughts, you will become a slave to your outer circumstances. You won't be driving your life; challenges and circumstances will.



## Daily Juice~11455

You are either changing the circumstances of your life and your world or your world is changing you! People with purpose and goals have no time for drama. They are too busy adding value to their life and the lives around them. Don't be stagnant; life is all about the next step. Irrespective of the phase of life you are in, face it and win! We cannot solve problems with the kind of thinking we employed when we came up with them. Don't have an expired mind; every next level of your life will demand a better version of You. Be consistent and focused; result happen over time, not overnight. Make a room for what you are praying for and expecting. That's how you proof you are ready for acceptance, so God will do the work of release.



## Daily Juice~11462

Parenting is a special duty; more special than any position you may hold anywhere. If we don't teach our children to follow the right way, society will teach them the wrong way as the right way. This one responsibility doesn't only affect you and your immediate family, but also the entire society at large. We all have one option where parenting is concerned, and it is to get it right. You must be intentional about it and be ready to make sacrifice there is to make, because it's all on you; it is one divine task given to you by God. If your success doesn't translate into the good character of your children, you are a failure! Your greatest contribution to the kingdom of God and on earth may not be something you do, but someone you raised. The greatest legacy one can pass on to one's children is not money, or other material things but rather a legacy of character and faith.



## Daily Juice~11488

Place a premium on your worth. You can rise up from anything. You can rebrand yourself. You are not stuck. You have choices; you can think new thoughts, you can learn something new, you can create new habits and attitudes. All that matters is that you decide today and never look back. A man sees in the world what he carries in his heart. If your imagination is out of focus, check your mental diet and upgrade your vision to be in sync with kingdom paradigm. Vision is the ability to think progressively; it connects you to your future. The greatest tragedy in life is people who have sight but no vision. Vision is imagery of the truth; a mental image of future possibilities. Seeing your situation changing for the best, seeing yourself doing more, being more and having more. The extent of your vision is the boundary of your blessings.

Switch your mentality; realize the role your thought is playing in your present situation. Break patterns of self defeating thoughts. The events of your past do not reduce your potentials. How someone has treated you or what someone has said about you does not change your ability. In your life, God may have done wonders in the past, but you haven't seen anything yet. The best is yet to come! Your best days are not behind you, they are in front of you! There's so much glory and beauty inside you. Don't allow your life to become obsolete and dull. God planted His seeds of greatness inside you; refuse to make little plans for your life because of present circumstances. Keep dreaming, keep stretching yourself, planning for new projects, experiences and greater adventures with God. You were never created to reach a certain level and then stop.



## Daily Juice~11497

God doesn't bless us because we are good, He blesses us because He is good. All of God's blessings are fulfilled in your life. Learn to be positive about life and about God's relationship with you. Set your mind on the good He has done for you. Life is lived through knowledge; we function through knowledge. Remember, the workings of God in your life are never proportionate to your need of Him but proportionate to your knowledge of Him. Go for accurate knowledge of God's word, and as you buy a book, also buy the time to read it.



## Daily Juice~11517

People only understand you from their level of perception. If necessary, explain your actions, not yourself. Those who really know you don't need your explanation. Remember, it's not your job to make people understand you. It's your job to understand yourself. The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think. You don't need the approval of someone or a situation to be happy. The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of everything, they just make the most of everything that comes their way. Many problems that people suffer are their behaviours and attitudes towards people and situations. Sometimes, overcoming a challenge is as simple as changing the way you think about it.



## Daily Juice~11521

Keep smiling; it increases your façe value! Don't let the sadness of the past and the fear of the future ruin the happiness of the present; for if you want something new, you have to stop doing something old! Old habits won't open new doors. If you’re going to go forward in life, you must quit looking backward. Don't let your past poison your future. Don’t let your setbacks become your identity. A great future doesn't require a great past. God hasn't brought you this far to leave you now.



## Daily Juice~11525

You don't need the approval of others to be happy! Don't let your loyalty become slavery! Irrespective of where you're in life or what has happened to you, get over it, move forward and make a success out of your life. Never give someone the satisfaction of watching you suffer. The greatest investment is in yourself. Become the best version of yourself. Work on being, not just on having; with what you 're, you'll have. Rule your mind and mouth or they'll ruin you. Life doesn't get better by chance, it gets better by change. It's not the external event or someone that takes our smiles and peace away- it's because we give them permission to enter and give them life in our minds.



## Daily Juice~11532

If you don't like the direction of your life, you can change it. You are not helpless; refuse to be a victim of circumstances. Don't allow your environment to make you poor. People are poor not because of their environment or family background, they are poor because of their poor mindset. You can change the course of your destiny. You are the icon and the reflection of the divine image. Our thoughts and words are our creative tools. They mold and shape the direction of our lives. Each of us becomes the person we are, choose the direction we take, and accomplishes everything we do based on the content of our thoughts and words.



## Daily Juice~11537

Every morning is a symbol of a fresh start. So, refuse to be a prisoner of the past; its moments and memories. You have to realize that you are not required to talk about everything and it is not a requirement that you run after what the world runs to. This is not the end of the world, you are stronger than circumstances, there are those who have experienced the worst and they overcame, don't give up! What troubles us the most are our thoughts.‌‌ Stay strong and make them wonder how you are still smiling and making an impact with your life. Let your hands be so busy catching blessings that you don't have the capacity to hold onto grudges. Forgive yourself and forgive others. Remember, forgiving is not for others, it is for you! Happiness is part of who you are. You are unhappy because you are not in alignment with who you are, not because of what anyone else is doing or has done.



## Daily Juice~11558

Don't let anyone or anything rent space in your mind unless they are a good tenant. Create your day in advance by thinking the way you want it to go, and you will create your life intentionally. How you think about your opportunities determines how you will act on them.The way we think about anything in life will determine the things that we do about them.If you think that you will fail then you probably will because you have already decided that it will be the outcome. Don’t underestimate the power of your thoughts. You are the master of your life and the universe is answering your every command. The universe offers to you the harvests of your thoughts and words.



## Daily Juice~11561

Your value doesn't decrease based on someone's inability to see your worth. You are not what has happened to you. You are what you decide to do next. If all your friends are in an uninspiring level, you 're in trouble; even if you take one step forward, the energy that sorrounds you would take you two steps backwards. Quality attracts quality. Become better to find better. Don't waste your valuable time with people that are not adding to your growth. Let them judge you. Let them misunderstand you. Their opinions aren't your focus. People will always paint their own picture of you, it's up to you if you autograph it. When you give too much attention on what people think, you will always be their prisoner. Give yourself discipline on how you spend your time. A time well spent is a life well lived!



## Daily Juice~11576

Enjoy your life and enjoy everything God has given you. Never make your happiness or success dependent on an attachment to any person, place or thing. Nobody knows what it takes to be you. Be who God wants you to be, not who the world wants you to be. Your beauty is in your uniqueness! The best project you'll ever work on is you. However, those whom you associate with matters to God, and that's why He gave the instruction in His Word, "Evil communication corrupts good manners." Surround yourself with people who talk about visions and ideas, not about other people.



## Daily Juice~11580

All of creations have been designed and commanded to function for your good-- Never forget this! Nothing and no one can successfully work against you; relax your mind, don't work against yourself. You were made and declared a success by God Almighty before you started out. Your victory is already a settled reality. Your mouth is a weapon of war and we are only engaged in one fight, and it is called the good fight of faith! Don't engage yourself in the wrong fight for victory. We don't fight for victory, we fight from victory!



## Daily Juice~11597

People will say negative things about you- you can choose to let it define you, confine you, outshine you or you choose to move on and leave it behind. No matter what is said, don't let it change your inner climate. No one can hurt your feelings or depress you other than what you allow inside. What you tell yourself everyday is what truly counts! Refuse to let negative and toxic people rent space in your heart. The less you respond to negative people, the more peaceful your life will be. Many have insulted and turned away people that were divinely placed on their path and orchestrated to help them fulfill their destiny. Build good relationships with others. We are in a partnership with all other human beings, not a contest to be judged better than others and worse than others. Treat people with respect and courtesy. Don't use anyone for temporary happiness. You can easily measure the character of a man by the way he treats and talks to others.



## Daily Juice~11612

If you have time to mindlessly scroll on social media, you have time to do something that will actually improve your life. Use your words to project yourself forward. Until you understand the power embedded in words, you may use words against yourself instead for yourself. Your words are your tools to pull into the present the future you have planned for. Where you are now is just a reflection of your past thoughts and words. Our lives go where our mouth goes. What we continually say will find a way of getting to us. Until we say it, heaven has nothing to work with for us. Our life today is the character of our words. Even if we don't say anything, something will still happen, but what will happen would be what we don't like. Be careful not to become ensnared by your own words. Remember, truth does not depend upon you to believe it to be true.



## Daily Juice~11618

Your future is being created by what you're doing. You are unique and different from everyone, so stop comparing yourself with others. Your path is different and you were given this life because you are strong enough to live it. Don't lose hope! You are stronger than whatever you are facing right now! The power behind taking responsibility for your actions lies in putting an end to negative thought patterns. Don't dwell on what went wrong or focus on whom to blame; never sacrifice who you are for what you want. Don't waste time building roadblocks to your success; yesterday doesn’t define you, it only prepares you for what is ahead. Your life is what you make it! Remember, you can't think like a slave and live like a king.



## Daily Juice~11627

If you are unhappy and depressed, check what you are meditating on. When you talk about your challenges to everyone, you perpetuate the memory of them. It positions you as a victim and delays any efforts for recovery. Talk magnifies things. The wise never discuss their challenges with someone incapable of solving them. Your chosen confidante should be competent and discreet. Nobody associates with losers and victims. When Job lost everything, everyone avoided him. It was only when God doubled his blessings that others returned to participate in his life by giving him gifts. Harness your mouth, thoughts and focus.



## Daily Juice~11630

Refuse to allow anything stop you to live and enjoy the life you were created for. What matters in life isn't what God has given you, it's what you do with what He has given you that truly counts and makes all the difference. Don't leave your life to chance! You can't really change what you tolerate, and sometimes, the things we don't change end up changing us. Things don't get better by chance, they get better by change. A change of status begins with a change of desire and until something within you changes, nothing changes around you. Irrespective of the situation, you are not helpless; you can do something about it. You are not a victim circumstances; you are a product of your choices, decisions, inactions and actions.



## Daily Juice~11656

Mistakes and challenges do not erase who you are. You can still be the person God created you to be. Bad days do not make you a bad person. Don't allow your mistakes to define you. God already provided forgiveness for that mistake even before the thought of it. God is in the now of your life; He does not consult your past to determine your future! Your life is not a chess game. Don't play games with your life. Flies cannot perch on a hot stove; life is spiritual. You are always responsible for how you turn out in life, not people or the circumstances of your life. Don't let how you feel make you forget who you are. Refuse to change what your heart believes because of what your eyes see. There's more to life than meets the eyes. Life is beyond the senses. If you only believe what you see, then you 're terribly limited to what's on the surface.



## Daily Juice~11677

You are so much more than the things that have happened to you. You may not be everybody's favourite but note this- You are God's favourite! Keep every stone they throw at you. You've got castles to build with them. You are a foundation layer within the sphere of influence God has given you. You have bricks and mortar within you to build, construct or tear them. You can't change someone who doesn't see an issue in their actions. Don't compare your results to someone else's. You can never be another person, you can only be a better version of yourself. Don't repress or suppress your uniqueness just because some people disapprove your eccentricity. You aren't meant to follow the crowd. Develop confidence in who God has made you to be. Refuse to allow anything inhibit your real self. Stand out and allow yourself to shine for you are the designer of your future.



## Daily Juice~11681

Every single day you should wake up and commit yourself to becoming a better person. Don't get to a point in your life where people are scared of correcting you because of your attitude, that's a dangerous place to be. Refuse to be angry and heady when corrected. Always remember, you 're blessed and privileged to have someone to correct you. The devil isn't as responsible for many things in our lives as much as our attitudes. God cannot go far with a man that is full of himself. A negative mindset will never give you a positive life.



## Daily Juice~11691

You may miss out on God's best for you while being distracted by issues that don't matter. One day, in 2 Samuel 16:5-14, King David was walking down the street and a young man started making fun of him, calling him names, even throwing stones at King David. He followed him everywhere, just pestering him, trying to pick a fight, trying to aggravate him. Finally, one of King David’s mighty men said, “Do you want us to put a stop to him? Do you want us to shut him up? He is a real pain.” I love the way King David answered. He said, “No, let him keep talking. Maybe God will see that I am being wronged and bless me for it.” That’s the attitude we need. It takes all the pressure off. You don’t have to retaliate. In fact, your attacker has done you a favour because God will serve as your vindicator. What this person meant for your harm will be used by God to promote you, and blessings will come your way. Those who try to insult you are expecting you to be in a fight mode, conquer them with your peace. Hold yourself in; have self-restraint and don't fight back.



## Daily Juice~11695

Negative comments from others are their own fears or insecurity being projected onto you. If You allow them to get to you, doubts will throw you off your path. Your past experiences may have made you the way you are but you don't have to remain and stay that way. Remember, God does not consult your past to determine your future. You are not your failure, and you are not a failure. Failure is an event not a person. Just because you couldn't do something yesterday doesn't mean you can't achieve it. Refuse to embody your mistakes and label yourself as a "failure" or carry your mistakes around with you. Instead, place them under your feet and use them as a stepping stone to arise above it. Your value doesn't decrease because you made a mistake; you are not your mistake. Be awaken to these truths and let go of all the negative individuals and thoughts in your life that just drag you down; don't let insecurity ruin the beauty you were born with; be better than you were yesterday. Take responsibility of your life, never put it in other people's hands. Never be a victim of life; be its conqueror!



## Daily Juice~11699

The more successful you are, the more criticism you will encounter. Not everyone will celebrate your victories and successes; sadly, for some, your success will evoke their critical spirit and jealousy rather than appreciation and compliments. They would rather be comfortable that you stayed in the same level with them or even less. Never mind and never take it personally. Many times, it's not even about you, even though it may be directed towards you. It's something on the inside of the critical person that lashes out at others, and unless they deal with it, it's going to keep them from rising higher. Your attitude towards someone's greatness or success is a proof of your humility. Remember, the attitude you create determines the atmosphere of your life. One important thing you've got to do is to learn to celebrate other people's success. If you get jealous and critical, your attitude will trap you where you are.



## Daily Juice~11716

Parenting begins on our knees. Be mindful of how you raise your children. Don't raise kids for the devil to use or be a tool for the work of the devil. Parenting is undoubtedly exacting. Sometimes you will feel like you are walking on a tight rope. The good thing is, God isn't expecting you to do it on your own. Don't forget, they are His kids, you are His caretaker over them. He expects you to partner with Him, and depend on Him for His desired outcome in the lives of our children. As they come into our lives at birth, we are tasked with the enormous responsibility of nurturing them into healthy and responsible adulthood not as we want them to be but as God wants them to be! Nothing is more sobering than the realization that parents will, one day, give account for the way they have raised their kids.



## Daily Juice~11726

You still have time to be what God wants you to be. Don't allow any person, situation or influence to dissuade you. Remember, most people build their lives on falsehood and falsity. Being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest achievement. You hang out with people who fit your future, not your past or history. Never try to hide who you are. The only shame is to have shame in who you are. Your success is hinged on your uniqueness. If we are not grateful for what we have, what makes us think we would be happy and grateful if we had more? Your attitude towards life influences your success and happiness, not what happens to you. Don't waste your energy on doing things that get you distracted. The days are the same, you make the difference!



## Daily Juice~11732

Where is the place of God in your life? Irrespective of where you're in life or what has happened to you, get over it, move forward and make a success out of your life. Never give someone the satisfaction of watching you suffer. Don't let an offense put out your candle, or the shortcoming of others reduce your dreams and service to God. Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hatred is a weapon that attacks the person who offended us. But hatred is a curved blade, and the harm we do, invariably we do to ourselves. To be wronged is nothing, unless we continue to remember it. Forgive!



## Daily Juice~11769

If you are not in the process of becoming the person you want to be, you are automatically engaged in becoming the person you don't want to be. Invest in your mind until you can stay calm under any circumstance. God has designed you to create success and abundance in every sphere you influence. Let go of the limiting belief. Whatever your predominant focus is, that is what you permit to exist in your life. Focus on God's Word and not on the present circumstances. Some focus on the negative, and that's they live in a cycle of negativity. Choose your focus. Train your mind to focus on God's Word. Bring your thoughts into divine alignment with God's will. Whatever is going wrong in your life could be as a result of your focus. If you don't like it, change your focus!



## Daily Juice~11775

The type of person you are is usually reflected in your business. To improve your business, first improve yourself. Your life only gets better when you get better. You will never have a greater or lesser dominion than that over yourself. The height of a man's success is gauged by his self-mastery; the depth of his failure by his self-abandonment. He who cannot establish dominion over himself will have no dominion over others. No one  can ever put you out or count you out of the game of life, except yourself. If you’re out of the game of life, it’s only because you counted yourself out. No one in life has the power to put you out of the game, except yourself. And once you understand who you are and your identity in God, life will no longer be a game for you, but a constant unveiling of progress and success.



## Daily Juice~11785

God loves you so much. Loving yourself isn't selfish at all. You are not that one bad decision you made years ago. It's time to move forward and blossom. Fullstop is not an end; because we can write a new sentence after it. Same is the case with life -as failure is not the real end, it can be a real beginning of success! You have the ability to overcome any challenge. Don't let your emotions make your decisions. Make excuses or make changes. The choice is yours. Don't let anything or anyone make you settle for a lowly existence. God didn't create anyone to suffer and struggle through life. A good life starts with Christ, and through His Word, you receive a new mindset. One thing no one can take from you is the freedom of your mind. A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it isn't open. Renew and strengthen your mind with God's Word, and it'll renew and strengthen your mentality, and then anything is possible.



## Daily Juice~11794

Examine your life; edit and filter it frequently. Afterall, it's your masterpiece. Every step forward counts and every step backward counts! Last year’s you should be proud of this year’s you. Also, this year's you should be proud of next year's you. Monitor your progress. There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice  what people say you are, you are who God says you are. What you believe about yourself and your life, on a deep conscious level is what you live out daily through your actions, words, and habits. It's also what you attract and manifest more of. Be mindful of the power of your belifes and their power over your life. That everyone is doing or saying something doesn't mean is right; majority is not authencity. God's Word is truth and it is the standard for measurement of truth not your mind, the society or the crowd.



## Daily Juice~11797

Inherent in every challenge is the mechanisms for its solution. Some opportunities come in disguise as challenges, but when unveiled, transform and give rise to a greater benefit. We need to surround ourselves with people who will tell us what we need to hear, not what we want to hear, but at the same time not make us feel we’re up against the impossible. Most of us, we don't believe in ourselves. We wish we were someone else and ignore that there is someone out there who wishes if he/she was you. Be yourself so that you can inspire other people. One of the best medications of success is believing in yourself. Do not underestimate yourself because you have all the tools that can make you a successful person within you. You are ultimately responsible for who you become. You are in control of your life. Nobody else, only you. Your tomorrow is in your hands. Let go of the people who dull your shine, poison your spirit, and bring you down. Cancel your subscription to their opinions. Don't feel guilty for doing what's best for you as long as it's in sync with God's purpose for you. You owe it to yourself to become everything God has designed you to be.



## Daily Juice~11802

The minute you realize your worth, you shift your energy to attract new people who respect your worth. It starts with you first. Don't strive for the approval of others or depend on compliments to feel good about yourself. Human love is fickle! Learn to love yourself, not as men love you but as God loves you. How you think about yourself will have a tremendous impact on the person you become, because you will probably speak, act, and react as the person you think you are. Stop being defined by what others think of you. Do not live for the expectations of people around you; live for your purpose. Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express not to impress. Don't strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt. It doesn't matter what anyone says about you, the only one who truly matters is the One who made you.



## Daily Juice~11848

Invisible to our naked eyes are the molecules of hydrogen and oxygen, yet through a chemical reaction they become a visible substance called water. God set these invisible processes in motion at creation to respond continuously to His word to form visible substances that add to our lives. He has done the same in the spiritual realm. Every moment of every day, we are surrounded by spiritual “molecules” that are designed to respond to our thoughts and words—or more scripturally put, our faith—to produce miracles. Everything you need already exists, but it exists in another form. Since the spirit realm is the causal realm, then your miracle is always in motion—you just need to get it to manifest on your behalf. Our spiritual genes hold the creative power to frame our personal world by the thoughts and words we think and speak, which are divine tools given for our creative use.



## Daily Juice~11862

You are a light, the more you speak the Word, the more you shine brighter and brighter, but when you speak negative words, your light goes dim.

The most important thing in your life is your word! Too many people release careless words into the atmosphere and can't figure out why certain things are happening or not happening in their lives.

Scripture has revealed to us that everything in the universe has to adjust itself to accommodate our words- good or bad, purposeful or errant. Words are free but how you use them may cost you.

In fact, God designed divinity to be revealed and released through words. Your word is a major contributory factor to the miracle you desire.



## Daily Juice~11885

A new place may not give you a new life. A fresh start is not a new place, it is a new mindset, because our lives always expresses the results of our dominant thoughts.

You can change environments but until you change yourself, nothing really changes. It doesn't matter where you live on the outside, what matters is how you are on the inside.

You cannot be greater than what you hold inside you. Your life is a reflection of what you are on the inside. Discipline your mind to focus on the Word; discipline has within it the potentials to create future miracles.



## Daily Juice~11889

Purpose is an essential element of you. It's the reason you are on earth at this particular time. Your very existence is wired and wrapped up in the things you are here to fulfill. Don't let your habits become handcuffs.

Anger will cost you more than you realize. A quick temper will pull you back and short circuit your destiny if you don't do anything about it. Quit saying and attributing it as your weakness. Get this- In Christ, there's no weakness.

If you are distressed by someone or anything external, you have given it the power to influence you, and the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to change at any moment.

Don't destroy yourself by allowing negative people add  dirts and debris to your character and purpose. Focus on God's purpose for your life.



## Daily Juice~11903

Prioritize God in your life! One of the great things of life is not so much where we are, but in what direction we are going.

Sometimes, in order to make progress, we must unlearn certain things and remove clutters and distractions from our lives.

The best time to correct past mistakes is in the past before they happen. The second best time is right now. How wonderful it is that you have the opportunity to have a better life.



## Daily Juice~11907

We are in a time in the world where "fakeness" and falsity sell, one of the bravest things you can do is to stay on the truth, maintain your uniqueness and be who God has made you to be and not sell your soul. A lie is not greater than the truth.

Run your own race; your life's journey is yours, take charge of it. Stop giving other people the power to shape your life. If you are not careful, you will end up living the illusions that others have created for you. You are the driver of your own life, don't let anyone steal your seat.

If you succeed at something, do not allow anyone to underestimate your victory, celebrate your victory, celebrate and grow, you deserve it. Being judged by others means you're so important that they have the time to think about you and talk about you.



## Daily Juice~11956

To invest in properties is good but to invest in people is far better! Don't let an ingrate stop you from making others great. God has blessed and equipped you for success and greatness. Don't be like an airplane that doesn't fly.
Function at your full potentials. You are more than what meets the eyes. You are more than all you have done. You can do much more, have much more.
All you have is not all there is. Don't live a lesser life than what God has purposed for you.
Don't allow circumstances and people becloud your mind and drown your dreams.
You have the determination to plant seeds of change now, and the wisdom to wait for the fruits to emerge.



## Daily Juice~11978

Sometimes we often remember what we should forget- the pains, disappointments, mistakes, and we often forget what we should remember- the victories, favours and blessings. When you learn to recall the good things God has done for you, it helps to stay in an attitude of faith and to remain grateful.

It's hard to complain when you are constantly thinking about how good God has been to you. keep a running record of the good things God has done. To someone else, it may seem insignificant, but let it be significant to you. No blessing from God is insignificant. Complaining and worrying don't produce miracles.

Don't take God's goodness for granted. Focus on the good and be grateful; your perception determines your reality. See how far God has taken you. Remembering where we came from is one of the best ways to keep yourself encouraged and grateful!



## Daily Juice~11987

Thanksgiving is absolutely one of the ways and a conduit to bring more into your life. Be thankful! Your thanksgiving and testimonies are your résumé for your next miracles.

A grateful heart is a magnet for a miracle. When you thank the Lord for His blessings in your life, you are attributing them to Him, thus distinguishing Him from all others. The result is, He blesses you even more and reveals Himself to you in a greater way. Get a moment aside to thank Him.

Remember that you are like a magnet, attracting everything to you through your thoughts and words. It is impossible to bring more into your life if you are feeling ungrateful about your life and what you have. When you give thanks as though you already have received what you want, you are emitting a powerful signal to the universe. Worrying is blasphemy against God's promises.



## Daily Juice~11999

The year may be winding up to a close but grace is not winding up to a close. Sometimes, we believe our prayers have gone unanswered because we can’t see desirable changes in our life. But have you ever considered that you might have been protected or saved from further pain and chaos? Sometimes, the results of our prayers come in different packaging.

Refuse to be a slave to the opinions of others. Don't let circumstances or the enemy take you on a useless journey. Some people often abandon the very things that took them to the top.

Focus on yourself, don't get lost in other people. There are seasons of change that you have to be alone with yourself and God.

Know the difference between being alone and being lonely. God will never leave you nor forsake you. Being alone can be empowering but loneliness can steal your joy.



## Daily Juice~12003

Stop thinking life is against you and start thinking all things are working together for your good! Our inner personality makes our point of view towards life, which either elevates us or brings us down. Remember, the world within not only colours the world without, but it is also its blueprint.

The way we see life shapes our lives. If you don't make the time on creating the life you want, you would eventually be forced to spend a lot of time dealing with a life you don't want.

Having better education does not necessarily mean that someone is better than you.

School rewards people for their memory, life rewards people for their creativity and ability to solve problems. One day, what will save may not be the things you learnt in schools but the values you've learnt outside a classroom.

There is a big gap between school skills and life skills. It's time to live life at a new level; It's either you magnify your excuses or you magnify your skills.

Your mindset filters everything you experience. If you have a negative mindset, you will perceive things to be mostly negative. Being more aware of this will help you to experience greater positivity in your life.

Do you remember reading in the Scripture about a man named Sethur, a man named Gaddi, or a man named Shaphat? I’m fairly certain that you’ve never heard of them. You know why? They were listed among the ten spies who brought the negative report. They also never made it into the Promised Land.

The fact is they were called to be history makers, just as Joshua and Caleb were. Each of the 12 spies was a leader from his tribe, so they weren't ordinary folks. They had seeds of greatness inside them, but the wrong mentality and words kept them from making their mark in history. Don’t let that be your story.

Don't allow challenges stop you. Joshua and Caleb were the only two from that whole wilderness company that made it into the Promise Land.

What counts isn't the size of the challenge but the quality of our mentality.



## Daily Juice~12043

Envying is of the devil; don't build hatred into you because of someone or a situation.

God is more interested in you expressing the fruit of the spirit which is encapsulated in love than in the gifts of the Spirit. His Word states, "by their fruits, you shall know them" not by their gifts. He places importance on our character which is expressed in our love walk.

The perfect will of God is love, and God is love and love is God and that's our nature.

There's something beautiful about everyone because each one is worth the Precious blood of Jesus Christ.

Be someone who makes everyone feels like somebody without stopping to inquire whether or not they worth it. Anyone can find the dirt in someone else's; be the one that finds the gold!

People will always forget what you wear but will never forget how you make them feel. Be the reason someone can believe in the goodness of people.



## Daily Juice~12046

Life is spiritual and there are myriads of spiritual activities all around us. Prayer is a spiritual activity. To live without prayer is one of the quickest ways to put your life in the hands of the devil and the circumstances of life.

There are certain things that will not happen unless we pray no matter how serious we need it, not because of the prayer itself but because of the effects of prayer. Prayer is reality. The busier and bigger you get, the more you should pray.

Time spent in prayer shows how much you need God. Not praying is to leave your life to chance and it's a show of pride. Until you understand the benefits of prayers, you'll always be a victim of life's circumstances.

Life is deeper than you think because life is spiritual. You don't wish for a change, you initiate change. Things don't change by chance rather they become worse. There is no natural solution to any spiritual problem but there is a spiritual answer to every natural problem you face. The answer is just as real and even more real than the natural impossibility you see, and God's answer is infinitely greater. But if you don't pray, then you leave your life to chance.

Remember, tomorrow's results are the seeds of today's choices and decisions.



## Daily Juice~12050

Stop attributing your problems to other people and your environment. Change does not happen when circumstances improve, change happens when you decide to Improve your circumstances!

Until you come to understand the connection between your outer experiences and your inner thoughts, you will always be a victim of life's circumstances. Your ultimate success depends more on you than anything else. Your mouth legislates your life.

Anything that comes against a blessed man falls flat because of the potency of the explosion of the blessings around the blessed man.



## Daily Juice~12055

Let your character carry more weight than your title. Do not let another day go by where your dedication to other people's opinions is greater than your dedication to your own identity in Christ. You have in you the gene and capability to excel.

Don't use failure to convince yourself that you can never succeed. Your situations and failures do not define you, you define what is the failure and you control how you act in your situations.

When a man is a prey to his emotions, he is not his own master. You have to free your mind from the thought that you are not good enough, you have to free your mind from the slavery of doubt. Doubt and fear kill more dreams than failure ever will.

People are slaves to things they do not like just because they think they can't make it without the presence of those things.

If no one has ever made it big in your family, it does not mean it is written on the wall that you will not make it.



## Daily Juice~12067

Every situation has three dimensions; Your views, People's views and the Truth. Success goes with the one who follows the Truth. The difference between seasons in a man's life is simply an instruction.

This spirit of trying to out-do others is wrong! Out-do your past and out-do yourself. Stop trying to out-do someone else because you don't know the kind of journey God has given that person to run.

We need to recognize that our accomplishments don't make us better or worse than others. God doesn't value us or define us by what we do; He looks at our hearts and why we do what we do.

Better performance does not make a better person. A person's character can be severely lacking even though their performance is good. God's gifts and callings are independent of our performance.

God is more interested in your relationship with Him than in what you do for Him. He is more interested in who you are than in what you do.



## Daily Juice~12073

You can work out and eat healthy meals, but if you don't deal with the stuff that's going on in your head and heart, you'll never be healthy. Health is not only addressing what you are eating, but also what is eating you up. It is also what you are thinking and saying. Don't destroy your body with worries; there's no challenge that is greater than you.

Trust God and relax! Your mind is like a garden, your thoughts and words are the seeds, you can grow beautiful flowers or you can grow weeds.

The world is full of beautiful places, let your heart be one of them.

Don't allow someone's opinion of you become your reality or let a bad situation turn you into what you are not.

God is in the business of raising you up so that you live a life of greatness, and with the expectation that you will in turn, help to elevate others.



## Daily Juice~12083

You are in charge of your own happiness; you don't need to wait for other people's permission to be happy. Give yourself credit for how you've handled this year.

Don't let challenges put out your light or dull your sparkle. Don't let that happen to you. Sometimes, things get worse before they get better. Feed your faith and your fears will starve to death.

Stop worrying! Worrying is using your imagination to create things you don't want and that's a misuse of the imagination. The most wasted day in one's life is one of worrying. No challenge is powerful enough to defeat you. Your current situation does not mean your final destination. Learn to look to and focus on what God is doing in your life.

Get this: What God is doing in you and for you is far greater than, and outweighs whatever the devil might be doing. It is no match! But where is your focus? Because your focus determines your experience.



## Daily Juice~12098

Refuse to be a victim of your own mind. Shift your focus from the past to the future. All of life is a study of attention; where your attention goes, your life follows. Some challenges and friends come as distraction to distort your focus and attention. Focus your attention on the Word.

God cannot do anything in your life if you can't give Him your attention, because your attention is a prove of your trust in Him. Your attention manifests your solution. God always speaks but only the relaxed heart that hears Him.

What dominates our attention determines the direction of our lives. If you don't set your mind on Him, your mind will keep going everywhere and mostly the wrong things.

Don't give attention to your adversaries or distractions for they don't count. If you give Him your attention, He'll give you a fulfilment that you could never know otherwise.



## Daily Juice~12114

What do you want in 2023? The first step in getting what you want is having the courage to get rid of what you don't want! 

As the new year approaches, don't carry an expired or old mind into the new year. Get new information, new attitudes that will give birth to new actions.

You are the architect of your life. Take charge of your life, and your ultimate success depends on the choices you make. 

Stop wasting time on unimportant things. Where your attention goes, your time goes and where your time goes, your life goes. Keep track of your time.

Bring order into your life; great things are never birthed from a disordered life. Stop pressing rewind on things that need to be deleted from your life. Project yourself forward!

You can't do big things if you are easily distracted. Distractions destroy dreams. Starve your distractions, feed your focus. Your results are the product of either your personal focus or distractions.

Stop getting distracted by things and people that have nothing to do with your goals.



## Daily Juice~12217

Insanity is defined as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. It's a new year. The secret of your success is tied to your daily routine. A future that's not connected to the present does not exist. You may change your strategy but don't trivialize the decision that determines the quality of your life in 2023.

There are friends and things you may have to let go for you to make greater impact and greater progress. Be careful who you let on your ship, because some people will sink the whole ship just because they can't be the captain. 

Stop roaming around and sit down to make your 2023 greater than 2022.

Things don't change by just wishing. Using God's Word, start creating positive mental pictures of how you want your life to go. Take a hold of your mind and mouth; they determine where and how your life goes in 2023.

But it'll take self- discipline and laser- beam commitment to move forward. It could be tough but you are tougher. Clear your mind of self doubt. When challenges show up, don't give up. Our emotions are not reliable guides.

You've been made a success before you started out. You are surrounded by such an amazing group of angels! They will keep you in all the ways God has for you! Trust that everything is going to be more glorious.



## Daily Juice~12521

Some people and situations are like Ads, just skip them. No one rolls into success by chance; give no room for excuses.

Tomorrow's results are the seeds of today's choices and decisions. Quit blaming the past, others and circumstances; your life is in your hands. Yes, your past and even your present may have been the result of someone's decisions or circumstances but your future is your choice and your decision.

You are not what has happened to you. You are what you decide to do next. It's not about knowing what to do but doing what you know. Intention does not change anything, action does. Knowledge that is passive does no good unless it is applied.



## Daily Juice~12531

Don't feel guilty for things you were unable to accomplish last year. Your direction is more important than your speed. Making yourself happy again is the biggest comeback.

Remember, the way other people treat you is a statement about them, not you. You are the only one who can decide what you will allow to be a part of your life. While you can't control someone's negative behaviour, you can control how long you participate in it.

This year, let your determination follow your decision for a change. You must focus your mind; discipline and channel your mind in the direction of your purpose. Use your tongue to direct your mind. You own your mind, your mind doesn't own you. You may have to change your relationship with your mind.

Remember, you are the "thinker" of your thoughts. Be the "thinker" not the thought. The power is with the "thinker", not the thought. Be the one to give your thoughts what to dwell upon.



## Daily Juice~12570

How high a man goes in life is not necessarily how hard he works but how high he thinks. You'll always travel in the direction of your most dominant thoughts.

There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it.

You can't start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one. Forget what hurt you in the past, but never forget what you've learnt from it.

There's more for you in the future but don't make the same mistake. Don't allow the sadness of your past and the fear of your future ruin the miracle and happiness of the moment.

Starve your past; your future can be better than your past, and you have the power to make it so. If you live in fear of the future because of what happened to you in the past, you'll end up losing what you have in the present.

You may not be able to control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.



## Daily Juice~12612

Engage in quiet time and reinvent yourself in the process. Don't allow the opinions, projections and slander of others have power over you. 

God has made you the proof and the expression of His kindness and goodness. Believe Him and serve Him selflessly! He's more interested in your success than you could ever be. If you are going to doubt anything, doubt your doubt, don't doubt God, His Word nor yourself. If people are doubting how far you go this year, prove them wrong and go as far as you can't hear them anymore.

No one is solely responsible for your success and happiness, you do it yourself, or it doesn't happen. There are thousands of excuses for failure but never a good reason. Don't let fear crush your dream. When you know what's important, it's easy to ignore what's not.

Go for knowledge. Ignorance is generational and transferrable. Don't be ignorant; ignorance will only make you a prey or a victim to life's circumstances.



## Daily Juice~12617

Today is a miracle, start it with gratitude. Don't ruin a good today by thinking about a bad yesterday. You are your own best friend. Never put yourself down.

Every phase of your life is growable. Treat yourself like someone you love. One day you'll look back and realize that you worried too much about things that don't really matter. Your future needs you more than your past.

Remember, the longer you hold onto something, the heavier it will become. Regret won't change your past. Anxiety won't change your future. Over-thinking is a slow poison. Don't let it complicate your life. Maximize the present; do something today that will birth you a better tomorrow.



## Daily Juice~12624

Life is beyond the intelligence of a man, life is spiritual. Ignorance of this is very costly.

Every atmosphere has a voice, and it echoes the voice of its occupants. You create your own atmosphere with words. Frame your life with God's Word; you can't have a life that is different from your words. Whatever we have today is a function of our present revelation. Growth starts from within.

Until your excuses give way to your strong desire for a change, change is not in view. It wasn't raining when Noah built the ark; you don't prepare for war in the time of war. Stop running around and leaving your life to chance. You can't wish your desires into reality. Do an appraisal on your life and find what is working and enhance it and also what is not working and change your strategy! 

Put a demand on yourself. Success is not accidental, success is more than principles, true success is spiritual.



## Daily Juice~12641

There are things you can't see unless you change your position. You can't see your reflection in a boiling water. Similarly, you can't see the truth in a state of anger. It doesn't matter how the situation looks like, what matters is your response. Your emotions are determined by your thoughts and perception.

Anger will cost you more than you realize. A quick temper will pull you back and short circuit your destiny if you don't do anything about it. Stop attributing anger as your weakness. If you are distressed by someone or something external, you have given it the power to influence you, and the pain is not due to the situation itself, but to your perception of it; and this you have the power to change at any moment. Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. To be wronged is nothing, unless we continue to remember. 

Remember, results aren't always the prove of God's approval. Moses missed out because of anger. He struck the rock the second time, water came out, but he lost his destiny. The result don't always prove that God was pleased.



## Daily Juice~12648

Place a premium on your worth. The absence or presence of someone or something in your life doesn't determine your happiness, you do. You and only you can choose if you will live happily or sorrowfully irrespective of what comes out against you. Everything that will make you happy isn't external but inside you. 

Acknowledge every good thing in you. Nobody and nothing will make you happy until you 're happy with yourself first. Being happy with yourself isn't selfish but necessary. 

Remember, there's a vacuum in every one that only God can fill and satisfy; nothing else can satisfy. When you get conscious of God's presence in you and with you, you wouldn't recognize the absence of others.

Don't look for happiness in another or attach your happiness to things. When you do, you make yourself a slave to those things. Find happiness in yourself!



## Daily Juice~12699

The quality of your life will be largely dependent upon the nature of your habits. Create habits that will move you forward rather than backward. Your daily routines are the deciding factors. Nothing changes until what you do daily changes. Our future is formed through our daily routines. 

Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you plant. What you are doing daily determines the direction your life is going. Nothing will ever dominate your life unless it happens daily. 

There are several distractions that life offers you but you have a responsibility for yourself to remain focused. The battle of life is for your mind; the battle of your mind is for focus. Your thoughts own your world.

Remember, as you are learning what would help you to make progress, it is equally important to know what could slow you down.



## Daily Juice~12707

Live your life by choice rather than by chance, live by design rather than by default.

Do what you ought to do, say what you ought to say- at the right time, and in the right way. When you want to live a life of success and influence, you must shun mediocrity and excuses. Replace excuses with results.

Be stronger than your excuses. Don't let "one bad day" stop you. Don't second guess yourself and make up excuses. Never worry about what others think about you; small daily improvements are the keys to staggering long term result. Success comes when your determination to succeed is greater than your excuses.

Don't be that person who always starts things but never completes them. The stone is broken by the last stroke; this does not mean the first stroke was useless - absolutely No!

A river cuts through a rock not because of its power, but its perseverance. One of your greatest advantages is the greater One in you.



## Daily Juice~12833

Prepare yourself for what you are praying for. The challenge we face is not the problem; the main challenge is our attitude about the challenge.

Life is in phases. Don't allow the challenges you are facing at a particular phase of your life make you think you are a mistake or you made a mistake.

Being challenged in life is inevitable and it's for your promotion but being defeated is optional and a choice.

Don't give up because things got hard. In life, there may be many challenges that would confront you but don't let the challenges put out your light; it came to pass.

Challenges gravitate towards their solution. Sometimes, things get worse before they get better.



## Daily Juice~12837

You don't have to convince your critics; you have a destiny to fulfill. Be the best that you can be, and before long, you will complete your dream and your result will answer your critics and God will take care of them.

When Nehemiah was rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, there were two men at the bottom of the mountain named Sanballat and Tobiah. They were greatly angry and mocking him and were his biggest critics, and the whole time he was working, they were trying to distract him saying, you will never finish the walls, it'll amount to nothing, you don't have what it takes. 

I love the fact that Nehemiah was focused. They were making a lot of noise, threatening him, calling him names but he recognized there was no benefit fighting with them. 

When God puts a dream in your heart, there will always be the Sanballats and the Tobiahs trying to distract you and engage you in battles that don't matter. 

Learn to ignore and be focused! Not everyone will like and understand you. That's alright.



## Daily Juice~12852

Your spirit is the life-giving part of you. It's the spirit that gives life to the body. Most people are missing out on what life is all about because they are focused on the wrong thing. 

They give all of their attention to the body by indulging and attempting to satisfying every appetite and emotion that comes along. The body is not the most important part of life.

The spirit is the real, life-giving part of a person-- that's the reason someone can have all of the money, fame, and possession imaginable and still be miserable. It's why people turn to drugs and other addictions.

They are trying to find life and happiness in the flesh and in other things, not realizing that what they are seeking only comes through the spirit.



## Daily Juice~12897

What you give attention to grows. Give attention to your life, and you'll grow.

Pick one good attitude and skill you want to cultivate and put all your effort into developing it. But don't be too hard on yourself when you make a mistake. Bad days do not erase your progress. Your mind is an instrument: learn to be its master, not its slave. Live in the truth and live in your purpose. Don't shrink yourself to fit the person you've outgrown.



## Daily Juice~12901

Work on being and not on having, because with who you are, you'll have.

Increase your value; the first step towards increasing your value is always inward learning who you really are and aligning yourself with the image you see in the Word.

A desire to learn and grow is critical to human success and happiness. But don't get sucked into learning without a purpose. Plan to apply what you learn immediately. Information is cheap. Execution is expensive.

You will be compensated not by how hard you work but by how much value and impact you've added to the world around you. Your value is not necessarily by how long you work but by how much value you add. To increase your value, become a more valuable person. You cannot have all that you want if you remain the same person you are, or better put, to have more from life, you need to be more in life.



## Daily Juice~12922

Believe in new possibilities. There's a future version of you who's proud you were strong enough not to give up. You are a walking miracle, never doubt how amazing you truly are. It's easy to spot a yellow car when you are always thinking of a yellow car. Likewise, it's easy to spot opportunities when you are always thinking of opportunities. You become and attract what you constantly think about. Work on your thoughts and watch your thoughts!

Restore focus to your thoughts, and harness the power of your thoughts. Stop fighting with people and circumstances; work on your mind and mouth.

Pay attention to fhe quality of your thoughts. Remember, the quality of your life can never be greater than the quality of your thoughts.

Taking control over your thoughts will cause you to gain control over your life.



## Daily Juice~12950

One good thing about the past is, it shows you what not to bring into your future and what to bring into your future. The events of your past do not reduce your potentials. 

How someone has treated you or what someone has said about you does not change your ability. In your life, God may have done wonders in the past, but you haven't seen anything yet. The best is yet to come! Your best days are not behind you, they are in front of you! There's so much glory and beauty inside you. 

Don't allow your life to become obsolete and dull because of circumstances. God planted His seeds of greatness inside you; refuse to make little plans for your life because of present circumstances.

Keep dreaming, keep stretching yourself, planning for new projects, experiences and greater adventures with God. You were never created to reach a certain level and then stop. There's no limit for the one who takes a hold of God's word to crystalize his mind and words, shakes off complacency to stretch into the next and higher level.



## Daily Juice~12958

If you follow the crowd, the place you will most likely end up is the exit. Do not allow other people's limited perception of you define you and don't make their opinions become a script in your thinking pattern. Remember that you are significant! You matter.

Stop comparing yourself to others! You have to reshape your perception of how you also view yourself. Believe in yourself! Perception believed is reality achieved! It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see that counts and we don't always see things the way they are, we see things the way we are!

Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life; not so much by what happens to you as by the way your mind looks at what happens!



## Daily Juice~12970

You can choose either to be a victim of the world's system or be a victor. It's all a question of how you view your life. Refuse to be a victim of another man's wickedness. Rise above it and be a victor that you are.

Life is a product of decisions and indecisions. You didn't get to where you are today by chance, it's a product of your decisions or indecisions.

Ignorance of this is costly. The actions you take each day create the results of your life. And since every action is preceded by a thought, thinking truly is the ancestor of performance. Think small and you'll play small.



## Daily Juice~12974

Your cell phone already replaced your camera, your calendar, your alarm clock.. Don't let it replace your family.

Your family is the best team you could ever have; all the elements of your happiness are already there. Enjoy your family! Don't take your family for granted.

Anything good is despised by everything evil. Don't destroy your family with jealousy and comparison. Stop comparing your family to that of others or your love story to those you watch in movies. Those in movies are not real and are written by scriptwriters and yours is written by God.

Follow God's laid down pattern. Differences, make us all different and unique. When we talk about a great man, it's not about how much money he's got in the bank, it's not in how many people respect him. It's the quality of his influence and personality. How he affects other people's lives positively in the quality of his personality. Stop living to impress people; any man who provides for his family at the right time and also extends his hand of blessing to others is a success! Restore focus to your family!



## Daily Juice~12978

It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams because they grow old, they grow old because they stop pursuing dreams.

Whether you succeed or fail doesn't depend on others as much as it depends on you. Your life is truly what you make of it. Many people may be responsible for your success but you are responsible for your failure. There's so much inside you, and you have what it takes to make the most out of life. You are unique and possess unusual endowment. Within you is the divine capacity to attract and manifest all that you'd ever need or desire.

Blaming circumstances or someone because of a situation or a misfortune is responding to a lie from the pit of hell. When you realize that no one can dictate your destiny but You and God, you will live a new kind of life. 

Don't waste your precious time blaming someone for any challenge or misfortune in your life. Whether someone wronged you or not, God will restore your wasted years. He will restore the years in fruitful measures.

Even if you 've made mistakes, relax. God has just started a new thing, to turn those mistakes for development and miracles. You can forget those losses and the hurts. Start afresh.

Don't make your life dull and put yourself in a vacuum. Don't wallow in ignorance, self-pity and enjoy it.



## Daily Juice~12983

Your mind, body, emotions energy and thoughts will all work in opposing directions, until you program them to be and work as one.

Some look around and feel like they missed out on the talents and abilities they see in others. In one way or another, many people go through life feeling like they are a mistake—so they just struggle and try to cope the best they can. 

The Lord’s plan for your life is far better than that. You aren’t a mistake. You didn’t miss out on the talents you need to accomplish God’s will. 

You don’t have to struggle through life, bouncing from one crisis to the next. He said your life is from glory to glory, not from problem to problem. God has a purpose for you. He created you for a reason.

You have a specific purpose in life and God wants you to discover that purpose and fulfill it!



## Daily Juice~12990

Life is not subject to chance, it is subject to truths. You have the same opportunity to improve your life and succeed as did others who succeeded. Don't distort the image of yourself because you were unable to achieve success. Success is your nature!

Failure is not your identity, and giving up is never an option, that will only take you back to the place you left. No matter the amount of faith you have, if you don't put it to work, it won't work; it will do you no good.

Don't miss this principle: the power for change is in your mouth. Faith is voice activated! You can tell where your life is going, because your words get there first, then your life follows your words.

Words are free, it's how you use them that may cost you! What you tell yourself everyday through your inner thoughts and words will either lift you up or tear you down.

Your words are the photographs of your future. Remember, as soon as a declaration leaves your mouth, it has already happened.



## Daily Juice~13031

Get excited about possibilities! Even if it looks like a dead-end, you still haven't run out of options. You are not defeated till you give up. Don't let your faith falter. You are greater than your challenges. Quitting is not a choice. Keep getting better at it.

Even if you made mistakes, you still remain an amazing person, but you can never make meaningful progress if you continually allow things that don't deserve your attention to often distract you and bring you down. 

The quality of your thoughts will affect the quality of your life. So keep checking them. Your thoughts can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Work on yourself; for your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.

See your bad results as motivation to be better and not a shame. A mistake that makes you humble is better than an achievement that makes you arrogant.



## Daily Juice~13036

Embrace your strength and uniqueness. Your power comes from what is unique about you. Bring those things together and specialize in that which makes you different. 

Show interest in the lives of others; it will bring joy to yours. But don't strive for the approval of others or depend on compliments to feel good about yourself. You don't need the approval of others to be happy. Make sure you don't start seeing yourself through the eyes of those who don't value you; know your worth even if they don't. 

Whatever you do, whatever happens with you, never ever treat yourself as unworthy.

A lot of people are waiting to take advantage of your lack of self-worth. They are willing to judge you, put you down, abuse your uniqueness if it doesn't serve their selfish interest. Don't let them succeed.

Never seek your importance through the standards of the world. Learn to love yourself not as men love you but as God loves you.

Align and match up your thoughts with God's thoughts for you. How you feel about yourself will have a tremendous impact on the person you become.



## Daily Juice~13042

All that you accomplish or fail to accomplish with your life is the direct result of your thinking pattern. You can handle whatever comes your way. Let a sense of purpose guide you. You deserve to grow, expand and rise. You are a co-creator who has significant impact on your experiential reality.

Don't lose Hope... maintain your Focus. Move at your own pace and with determination and your eyes on the goal, success is  yours. Never bother about how fast people are moving. That someone else is succeeding doesn't mean you are failing.

Remember, it's not how fast you build your house but it's how firm and strong the house will be when the storms of life come. You have the seal of greatness on you, so don't settle for less.



## Daily Juice~13046

When life puts you in tough situations, don't say "Why me" say "Try me". Negative self image can become a self fulfilling prophesy. How you start your day has an impact on how your day goes. Worrying is using your imagination to create something you don't want.

Worrying does you no good. It doesn't make your future better. It just burdens your present so much that you're unable to appreciate the blessings of today because you're busy worrying about sorrows of tomorrow that may never happen.



## Daily Juice~13050

Decluster your mind. 90% of your stress is optional. Stop choosing to be stressed. Just let it go. Stress messes with your brain by: Creating free radicals that kill your brain cells making you forget things, Intensifying your anxiety and irritability, Interfering with the creation of new brain cells, Increasing your risk for mental illness, such as depression, Shrinking your brain thereby causing you to forget things easily.

Those who hurt you don't matter. Take the lesson and move on. Don't hold on to any negativity or grudges. Don't let their actions decide your future. They can impact you only if you let them and they have nothing great to bring to the table. Know you deserve better and make space for that.

The past has no power to stop you from being present now. Only your grievance about the past can do that. What is grievance? The baggage of old thought and emotion. Believe in new possibilities.

Sometimes it's good to let go and trust the process.

Life is not a dress rehearsal. Not every closed door is locked. Push! We do not have to let our finances be dictated by the world. Our finances are dictated by heaven's economy, not this world's system.

Don't look at the economy and begin to think you have to cut back on your giving to the Lord. If you do, you are not expecting to prosper.

Irrespective of the situation and the season you are in, there is no season the Word of God does not work! Some cut back on their giving at this time because they anticipate having a problem. You can cut back on your debt and your spending- not your giving! 

The worst thing you can do to your harvest is to cut back on your sowing. If there's anything you need to increase, you need to increase your giving! But most people don't think this way, so they limit God.



## Daily Juice~13065

Switch your mentality! God made us much more than what we are experiencing in our lives. It doesn't matter if everyone else is losing, that doesn't dictate what will happen to you unless you believe it. Just because everyone else is suffering doesn't mean you have to suffer unless you believe you have to suffer. What you think matters more than what you experience. 

Comparing yourself with others and measuring yourself by the world's standard is the wrong measurement.

Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other.



## Daily Juice~13078

Choose which is important to you- your comfort zone or a better life. You have been built with the abilities and possibilities of divinty, make it count!

Don't allow the challenges of life make you think less of yourself. There is no passion to be found in playing small; in settling for a life less than the one you are capable of living. 

There's no joy in living your whole life on the ground. Don't short-change your life that you get accustomed to living less and being less to the point that you eventually sit back and accept it.

Refuse to settle in a land of barely enough; that may be where you are, it is not who you are; that may be your present state, it is not your identity.

Part of growing to maturity is learning to take personal responsibility for your life. You can't blame others or circumstances for your failure. No matter what it looks like, see your situation changing for good.



## Daily Juice~13081

The job of leadership is not just in meeting targets and making more money. It is impacting lives positively and giving lives a meaning in the process of meeting your targets. 

Many people quickly point out what you are doing wrong, but relatively few take the time to point out anything you are doing right. Never mind, but don't live life like that. Everyone you meet needs some sorts of encouragement. 

Learn to appreciate and build people up rather than condemn and tear them down. God puts people in our lives on purpose so we can help them become not what we want them to be but He wants them to be.

You have a lot to offer. Your life has significance and you can make a difference. There is something in you for the betterment of someone else. You are an answer to the cry of millions because everyone you touch has the potential of touching someone else.

When people come around us, they should leave better off than they were previously. Don't just get obsessed with yourself and with your goals; God cannot go far with a man who thinks only of himself.



## Daily Juice~13086

Don't give problems energy to expand through your thoughts and words. Stop overthinking! Know that your capabilities are limited only by your thinking, not by your circumstances. Life is not a result of circumstances, but a product of decisions. Your circumstances don't make you, your decisions make you. 

Success is a few simple disciplines practised everyday; while failure is simply a few indisciplines repeated everyday.

The quality of your life is to a large measure determined by the quality of your habit. Your life will not be any different from your habits. Create new habits that set you up on the path of success and stick to it, consistency is the key. Don't let laziness take over. Remember, you said this year would be your year, so get it together. God is with you! It's not important who is ahead of us or who is behind us. What really matters in life is who is with us.



## Daily Juice~13094

Ignorance is an enemy. It will not die by fire, it will only die by accurate knowledge.

If we do not walk in the fullness of love, then our faith will not operate in its fullest capacity.

This will show you why some of the things you have been confessing and believing for aren't happening in your life.

If we are to live in line with God's Word, we must not only be a faith child of a Faith God, but we must be a love child of a Love God. One of the reasons why faith is not working for some is they are not working in love, for faith works by love. Why do you want what you want? Some have confessed the word again and again, and it appears nothing is happening. It's not just in confession. Of course, we need to be careful about our confessions, but we need to be even more careful about our daily lives.

Sometimes, we become so accustomed to certain attitudes that we never realize they are hindering us spiritually. Sometimes, the answers to some of our prayers will only come after a changed attitude.

Remember, your christian maturity is demonstrated through your love walk.



## Daily Juice~13098

Don't allow circumstances determine the direction of your life. Don't be a baby where people, circumstances, in fact everything will be decided for you. Grow up and take charge of your life and make decisions that will pilot your life in the direction of God's perfect will.

Create the kind of thoughts you desire through God's Word. Change from within little by little. What drives success are small changes on the inside which ultimately will show up on the outside. This is tied to your success. Not all storms come to distrupt your life; some come to clear your path.

Don’t ever think you’re nothing, because someone somewhere along the line, who thinks you’re nothing.

Don't allow circumstances or someone's myopic opinion of you get into you and shatter your life. Ships don't sink because of the water around them; ships sink because of the water that gets in them. Don't let what's happening around you get inside you and weigh you down.

Take some time to rest and recover. You don’t always have to be so busy, pushing yourself so hard. Relax and take care of yourself. Those moments of self-care will add value, energy, purpose, and creativity to everything you do. Find a healthy balance and enjoy your life.



## Daily Juice~13102

God cares about your environment and the people sorrounding you. Your environment will impact your attitude, focus, faith, and the intentionality of your thoughts. If you are sorrounded by negative minded people, chances are you'll be infected by them and you'll find it more difficult to see the brighter side of life.

It’s perfectly OK to cut someone out of your life. Just because the same blood runs through your veins doesn’t make it alright for them to behave toxically and abuse you.

Stay in an inspiring environment that will spur and spark your dreams and creativity. You have the power to create an inspiring environment around yourself. Look for those particular environments that inspire thoughts of greatness and abundance on every level.



## Daily Juice~13107

Every new day with God brings the dawn of new and better possibilities. All good things find their beginning in Him, and without Him, nothing good exists. And He wants to express those good things through you. Your degree is not your life. Reinvent yourself constantly before you become obsolete.

We are either progressing or retrogressing all the while. There is no such thing as remaining stationary in this life. You are no under obligation to remain the same person you were a year ago, a month ago, or even a day ago. You are  to create yourself continuously.

Your intelligence cannot be measured by grades. Develop your skills; your skills are more valuable than your grades. Don't be limited by your degree or certificate. Get God's certification of you in His Word and make a success out of your life.



## Daily Juice~13111

If you are stuck to the past, you are sinking your future. If you can't handle stress and challenges, you won't manage success. Your worth is not based on what has happened to you or the circumstances sorrounding your life.

Sometimes, the questions that are complicated come with simple answers. It doesn't matter what the situation looks like, what matters is what you see.

Tomorrow won't be different if you don't change the way you think and change something you do today! See that challenge as a new seed of opportunity for growth and development.

Given our present-day situations, we have thd choice of how we are going to respond. Society can't make us respond a particular way. Our circumstances can't make us have a behavioural problems. It's our choice. No matter how you are, people will always judge you according to their mood and need.

Rather than waiting for an apology, or expecting one to come, realize it may never happen and that’s okay. Because your life and happiness don’t depend on someone else saying sorry. Your life and happiness depend on you and no one else.



## Daily Juice~13121

The nature of man's opinion is such that can bring different results. Don't let someone else's opinion of you become your reality. 

See that you have the best seat in the house of your life. When people take centre stage in the activities that affect our lives and issues, there is tendency to encounter failure.

The reliability on man is the beginning of a journey into a flunctuating and unclear future. The weakness of an opinion not backed by divinity is revealed in its lack of sustainability. Whatever cannot find its expression in divinity is a progress that will soon crash. 

Many things look beautiful on the outside but have long lost divine essense.

Wisdom is not when we act based on any knowledge but when our decisions and actions are guided by divine knowledge.

Taking crucial steps in life can determine if our lives would go to its fullest potentials or live in constant regrets lies in how well we consider our conclusions before they are made.



## Daily Juice~13125

Prepare yourself for the best life possible. You are meant for it.

Don't judge yourself so harshly because you failed. That is the job of your haters. Obsessing about what happened will improve nothing. It will only take away your peace and self-esteem. Things will change not by overanalysis but by taking an action to change. You can! Just give it another shot!

Refuse to speak negative of yourself because of your present situation or to please anybody. If you don't program yourself with God's Word, life will program you wrongly. Keep working on yourself; be so good that you can't be ignored!

Refuse to get distracted by things that have nothing to do with your goals; feed your focus and starve your distractions. The circumstances of your life may not describe the quality of your personality, but don't give up, hold on! That circumstance came to pass not to stay, just press on, it'll pass.

You are God's best! You are God's project, and remember, God doesn't embark on an unaccomplished project. There is a sense of destiny in your life because you are God's idea, His dream! God values you more than you could ever know. He's not mad at you, and the price He has paid for you is the proof of your worth.



## Daily Juice~13148

Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner. You have to get to a point in your life where your mood doesn't change based on the actions and opinions of other people.

You can never discover who you were meant to be if you use another person to find yourself. If you want to know who you are, look at God!Understanding life is in the source of life, not in the life itself. 

There's something in you more precious than what others have said about you. Don't ever let anyone throw you away. Refuse to let anybody demean you; you are God's best! You are not a junk.

When God looks at you, He sees things that others ignores. Don't accept the opinion of others because they do not see what God sees.

Your worth in life is essentially a product of your source-God.You came out of God with His abilities and possibilities! There is so much inside you and you have what it takes to make the most out of life! Your life will never be truly yours if you constantly care about what others think.



## Daily Juice~13154

How you think about yourself determines the opportunities and things that happen to you. When you feel that you are worthy, you attract great things. Your thoughts are powerful.

The way we think about anything in life will determine the things that we do about them. If you think that you will  fail, then you probably will because you have already decided that it will be the outcome. Don’t underestimate the power of your thoughts. In a world that pushes negativity,  refuse to allow someone's negative opinion of you become a script in your thinking pattern.

If someone devalues you, don't take it personally. It may be their tunnel vision that doesn't recognize you. They aren't even meant to understand your potential. It is for you to realize your hidden strength and create a miraculous journey for yourself.



## Daily Juice~13159

Stop thinking life is against you, but rather, start thinking all things are working together for your good! Our inner personality makes our point of view towards life, which either elevates us or brings us down.

Remember, the world within not only colours the world without, but it is also its blueprint. The way we see life shapes our lives. If you don't make the time on creating the life you want, you would eventually be forced to spend a lot of time dealing with a life you don't want.

Give the universe what you want through your words. Words are substantive entities that bring tangibility to the universe.



## Daily Juice~13177

Choose to be kind to yourself, and don't give away your joy because of a situation.

Keep your mind set on new opportunities, divine connections and supernational favours. Disengage your mind of self- defeating thoughts.

You can’t change what’s going on around you until you start changing what’s going on within you. It's your choice to be happy.

Make up your mind to enjoy your life; to have a blessed, prosperous and victorious life. You may have some challenges, but don't let that change your mind.

Keep it set on happiness. If you leave your mind in neutral, the wrong thoughts will creep in just by default. It's not what happen to you or what you have or don't have that is important; it's how your mind is arranged and the choices you make that count.

Whatever challenges you may face, whatever circumstances are weighing you down, you can choose your response. How you live your life is totally up to you. It's not dependent on your circumstances. It's dependent on your choices.



## Daily Juice~13181

You are unique and special. Don't hate yourself because of someone's perception of you. Be disciplined about what you respond and react to. Not everyone or everything deserves your time, energy, and attention. Some people only exist as examples of what to avoid. You are not obligated to continue with what makes you feel bad. Stay in your light! 

The same bottle of water in the supermarket costs differently in the gym, costs differently in a restaurant, costs differently in the airplane and costs differently in some other places. It all depends on where you need it. So, when people treat you as though you are worthless, you are in the wrong place. Sometimes, it is worth considering your place in life or in the perception of the world in order for something to change. Don't second guess yourself. You are stronger than you think.

When you know you are worthy and valuable, you attract great things. Your thoughts can bring things into your life, it can also take away things from your life.



## Daily Juice~13185

Every second of every minute of every hour of every day you are making decisions. These choices are about what will change, and how. How you are changing is up to you. What you are evolving into is up to you.

You won't change accidentally. To experience growth, you can't remain the way you are continuously. Apply yourself for a change; make room for growth. Put yourself on a Word diet. The thoughts, words and actions of your past are fundamentally related to who you are today. Your mind is a powerful tool. When you fill it up with positive thoughts from God's Word, your life will begin to change. For as a man thinks in his heart, So he is. Your mentality towards things is what becomes your reality.

Even in a negative situation, train your mind to think positively. Sooner or later, what you carry in your mind will become what you carry in your hand. How you think about the situation is more important than the situation itself. Your mind is the battlefield of your life. If you can win the battle in your mind, you can win the battle of your life.



## Daily Juice~13193

The brightest people in school are not likely to become the most successful in life. They are likely to become the most successful employees of the most successful people. Having better education does not necessarily mean that someone is better than you. School rewards people for their memory, life rewards people for their creativity and ability to solve problems.

One day, what will save may not be the things you learnt in schools but the values you've learnt outside a classroom. There is a big gap between school skills and life skills. It's time to live life at a new level; It's either you magnify your excuses or you magnify your skills.



## Daily Juice~13199

Be very choosy and particular about whom you invite into your life. Don't let others hijack your sanity and peace. Protect your joy and peace. Remember, setting healthy boundaries is not a punishment for others neither is it a show of pride. It is an act of self care. 

Everyone you meet has a part to play in the story of your journey in life and while some may take a chapter, others a paragraph, and most will be no more than scribbled notes in the margins. Some people come into your life as blessings; some others as lessons. You learn something from everyone who passes through your life; some lessons are painful and some are useful but they are all priceless and for a purpose. For everything has been designed to work for your good.

Appreciate everyone that has passed through and will pass through; they are a part of the ultimate plan.



## Daily Juice~13212

You glow differently when you are happy, be happy! The opinions, projections, lies and slander that others share have no power over you unless you allow it.

When the past is mixed into the present, it prevents you from experiencing the happiness the present offers. Focus your attention on that which is good in the present. Success begins when you begin to acknowledge who God has made you to be.

Trust in God's timing for your life. Your progress does not need to be appreciated or validated by another.

Give yourself some credit for the days you made it when you thought you couldn't.



## Daily Juice~13219

Life is a product of focus. Going back to an old habit or lifestyle is like rewatching a movie and expecting a different ending to happen.

Don't give your mind permission to get disturbed. A disturbed mind is easily influenced. This will cost you your peace and joy, and if the devil succeeds in touching your joy, he's got you.

Learn to maintain your peace by freeing yourself from attachments or the wrongs done to you. The heaviest thing you can carry is a grudge; let go and don't keep hurting yourself. We change our lives by changing our attitudes. The more you celebrate the life God has given you, the more there is in life for you to celebrate.

Happiness is not the absence of challenges but the divine peace that knows that all things work together for your good.



## Daily Juice~13224

Your mood is your personal decision, not because of a situation. Don't get so upset with people or situations; laugh at the situation because both are powerless without your reactions.

No matter what others do to you; they may spite, revile or criticize you; hold yourself back from responding in pride, anger or bitterness. Hold yourself in; have self-restraint and don't fight back. Silence sometimes is a good medicine.

Remember, the measure of a man's strength, value or worth isn't by the number of his friends but by the power of his enemies.

The only keeper of your happiness is you; stop giving people or situation the power to control your smile and your worth.



## Daily Juice~13228

Your future comes one day at a time.- it is God's present to you. It is the gift of the present. Don't handicap your life because of the events of the past. You become what you surround yourself with. Energies are contagious.

If you can't be yourself, you are nobody. Did you also know there are people who live fake lives? There are those who try to be others until they lose themselves in the process. There is nothing as interesting as being you. If you always think you need to be someone else you will never get to a level of knowing yourself and discovering your potential and uniqueness. One of the worst things to do with time is comparing yourself to others; you don't know what God has called them to do.

Run your own race! Sometimes, our minds talk more than our mouth. Your life is a reflection of what you hold inside you. Focus on the gifts and talents God gave you and don’t be envious of the blessings He gave others. Quit comparing yourself with others. You also have your unique strength that none has, look within and build on it.



## Daily Juice~13232

You were created without defects! Never let life's circumstances define who you are. Life may never present success directly to you, it will provide possibilities, challenges and opportunities to you, but it's up to you to convert them into success.

Oftentimes, we envy other people’s life. We pray and wish it belongs to us but it does not usually turn out automatically like that.

Many times we have been deluded to thinking that their life just emerged. We must note that on earth nothing emerges. They were all created. For there to be a forward movement, there must be an application of force. Kill laziness before it destroys your life. Your labour is your contribution to the miracle you desire. 

Most people just want to be in the result and not in the process, and it's in the process where you realize who deserves to be in the result.



## Daily Juice~13258

Success builds on success, and as this happens, over and over, you move toward the highest success possible.

When you see someone who has a lot of knowledge, they learnt it over time. When you see someone who has a lot of skills, they developed them over time. When you see someone who has done a lot, they accomplished it over time. The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It’s one thing at a time.

Begin to see yourself at your best and carry yourself that way. No one is going to change your life for you. Everything starts with you. The day you realize and internalize that is the day your life begins to change. Say no to doubts and fears that prevent you from moving forward.

Let the doubters be your fuel and keep pushing until their voices fade into the background. You're not stopping until you've reached the heights they thought were impossible.



## Daily Juice~13267

Never change your originality and uniqueness for the sake of others. No one can play your role better than you. Consider the fact that there are over 7 billion people on the face of the earth, but no two fingerprints are alike. You'’re unique, and so is your destiny in Christ.

Whatever God destined you to do, nobody can do it exactly like you. Nobody can say what He wants you to say the exact way you’d say it. Nobody can get your kind of results. Therefore, get excited about your uniqueness. Fulfil your purpose. Be what God made you to be. 

Pay attention to changes that God may be guiding you to make, and receive corrections. It's all so you can fulfill His destiny for you gloriously without reproach. Refuse to allow any weight cling itself to you, so you can make faster progress as He wants you to.



## Daily Juice~13276

Your choices got you where you are today, but the good news: you have it in you to choose to have a great future.

Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer grows you but distracts you. How your life goes is linked to how you spend your time.

Effective time management requires getting God's heart on what is worth investing in versus what we should be spending or even wasting time on. You must ask yourself what kind of return your time investments are yielding. Time "spent" is a cost- and you must be mindful of the benefits you are exchanging for the cost you are incurring. Things change with truths not by chance. You are the architect of your life.

Never complain about what you permit for you cannot change what you refuse to confront; face the giants in your life, win and move on. Your fear is 100% dependent on you for its survival and life presents itself to you as you think it to be.

Surround yourself with people whose definition of you Is not based on your background or past mistakes but on your identity and destiny in God!



## Daily Juice~13290

Talk yourself up! Give your life a destination through your words. Your vehicle to success is you, particularly your mouth. You are the driver of your life. Use words to beautify your life and set it on divine course. The words you speak today is a shelter for your tomorrow. The fruits you are harvesting today were planted as a seed by your words yesterday. Words create a magnetic force that pulls the manifestation of what we speak.

Affirm that there's divine order in your life and the favour factor is at work in your life. Remember, all of God's blessings are in your life. Your voice is the activation code. Refuse to be a victim of life's circumstances or a victim of another man's mistake. Irrespective of the situation, never talk yourself down. Your words are your lifting power.



## Daily Juice~13302

Model your habits. Remember, where you seat in your old age depends on where you stood in your youth.

For too long we allow ourselves to be distracted and bewitched by all that is happening outside. To be the master of our destiny, we would the master over our own inner world-  that's our thoughts and words. When things change inside you, things change outside you.

Refuse to allow the pressures and challenges of life dictate and becloud your thinking or allow yourself to be defined by someone's inability to see your worth or negative opinion of you.

The understanding of you is the foundation for living an outstanding life. It's not what is outside, but what is inside that takes one to the top. Form follows thought, and the shape of your life is a product of that thought.

Structure your time so you can structure your thoughts, for they provide the structure for your life. Know when to take hold of an idea and run with it and when to wait and let it mature until it has ripened.



## Daily Juice~13306

Stay away from time- wasters in your life. You can control your attitude and how you respond to situations. We are each the master of our own reality; life is what you make of it! Always remember that your present situation is not your final destination; your best is yet to come! Don’t give up because things are difficult; push yourself more!

One bad chapter doesn't mean your story is over. Don't look down on yourself because of what you might be going through at the moment. 

What you are going through is not a statement that you are finished. Regardless of what your circumstances or problems are, you're never more than one word from God away from a miracle.

The Lord knows exactly where you are and how to get you to where you're supposed to be. All you need is just the slightest instruction; a word from God!



## Daily Juice~13311

You're an amazing person even if others don't acknowledge that. Some people you meet in life are too obsessed with finding flaws in you. Never let them make you devalue yourself. There is a lot of effort you put to make things work. Appreciate yourself without waiting for others.

You don't need the approval of others to be happy! Don't let your loyalty become slavery! Irrespective of where you're in life or what has happened to you, get over it, move forward and make a success out of your life. Never give someone the satisfaction of watching you suffer.

The greatest investment is in yourself. Become the best version of yourself. Work on being, not just on having; with what you 're, you'll have. Rule your mind and mouth or they'll ruin you.

Life doesn't get better by chance, it gets better by change. It's not the external event or someone that takes our smiles and peace away- it's because we give them permission to enter and give them life in our minds.



## Daily Juice~13316

It is not the things that happen to a man that cause him to fail or succeed, but what he believes about the things that happen to him. 

Never let the experiences of your past bring harm to your future; your future doesn't deserve the punishment. Nobody is a necessary factor for your success like you, and your biggest competition is you. If you would get out of that situation, what you are going through doesn't matter, what matters is what is going through your mind and coming out of your mouth amidst the situation.

The devil mainly attacks or affects our perspective or view of life, of ourselves and of God. His major line of attack is the picture inside you. If he can control your perspective, he will control your behaviour and action. The devil cannot place a limit on you, don't place a limit on yourself. 

Stop trying to fit in when you were born to stand out. Be a voice not an echo. Life on earth is not about the number of days you live but what you fit into those days that make you live a remarkable life.



## Daily Juice~13321

You are the care taker of your body! Take care of your body, because it's the only thing that gives you access to this earth in fulfilling your purpose. Without it, no matter the dreams and plans you have, they might not see the light of the day. The whole can never be well if a part is unwell. Accept personal responsibility for your health and well-being, and cheerfulness is one of the best promoters of health.

Make time for relaxation! Each day, carved out time for relaxation to reduce the pressure, clear your mind and become empowered. You can set yourself up for sickness or you can choose to stay well. Refuse to allow the challenges of life get you worried and sap your health out of you. Remember, life is in phases, and that challenge has come to pass, not to stay! Don't destroy your body and mind with worries. Stop allowing your body turn red before you rest. Most times, health is not valued until sickness or breakdown comes.



## Daily Juice~13339

Build and maintain valuable relationships. Sometimes, opportunities are lost and destroyed because of wrong attitudes. Your attitudes are the functions of the activities of your mind.

Your phone isn’t the only thing that needs a recharge or upgrade, most importantly, recharge and upgrade your mind. Learning does not exhaust the mind, it elevates the mind!

One of the biggest mistakes you could make when trying to climb any company’s ladder is believing that only your skill, talent, and work ethic will be noticed and rewarded. These are good and important, but more often than not, the only thing holding you back is your mouth and your attitudes.



## Daily Juice~13344

Where is your attention placed? The direction of your life is determined by where your attention is. Life is more enjoyable when we have a deeper understanding of what God called us to do. Don't live a meaningless life; your life has a deeper meaning than you realize. 

The new month will mean nothing if you 're still in love with your comfort zone. Great things never came from comfort zones! Tolerate discomfort for a greater purpose.  In any given moment, you have two options: to step forward into growth or step backward into misery. If you don't step forward, you would always be in the same spot. 

There's something inside you that's greater than any obstacle. The enormity of the challenge is nothing compared to what lies inside you. Nothing can defeat a man who has already won on the inside.



## Daily Juice~13349

Anything that would change your life would have to begin from your heart. It's not outside you, stop running around. Life will only change when you become more committed to your dreams than to your comfort zone. 

You can imprison a man, but not an idea. Believe in something larger than yourself; dig within. Within you is the wellspring of good and greatness; and it's always ready to bubble up, if you just dig. You don't drown by falling in the water, you drown by staying there.

Be ashamed to catch yourself idle doing unproductive things. Be disciplined to do what you must do. There are thousands of excuses for failure but never a good reason. 

Don't make this period a lifetime of feeding on your fears and irrelevant things, rather feed on His word because if the word gets into you, it becomes a God and a force in you that gives your life divine direction! You must be intentional about your life; remember, your attitude determines your reality.



## Daily Juice~13354

If things aren't the way you want them to be and you aren't doing anything to change it, stop complaining. Challenge yourself for a change, no matter the situation.

Your old self is long gone. There's no point in holding on to old life. There are great possibilities that the future holds. Don't hesitate. Embrace new beginning. Don't dwell on the past sufferings. When you get excited about your next steps, you are able to see new doors opening.

Anything permitted increases. Don't allow your past to enslave or imprison you. Your past does not have to destroy or keep you from your future. Make your dreams bigger than your past. God does not live in your past, He is in the now of your life. He doesn't consult your past to determine your future. Changes are always proportionate to our knowledge. Remember, when you want something you have never had, you must do something you have never done.

When someone betrays you, that is a reflection of their character, not yours. But when you belittle yourself, it is a betrayal on who God has made you to be. Comparison is a thief of your uniqueness and joy.

Your significance is not In your similarity to another, but in your point of difference from another. Learn to like yourself, learn to love yourself; you have everything within you to be a success and have good success. This is your life and no one else can live it for you. Find joy each day in the little things and you will find beauty in everything.



## Daily Juice~13376

You cannot live a happy life with sad thoughts. The inner conversation you have with yourself is very important. Make sure it's healthy and positive. Don't allow yourself to wake up with yesterday's issues troubling your mind. You own your mind, your mind doesn't own you. Refuse to live backwards. Relax your mind.

A lot of the stress we deal with are just thoughts. See everyday is a new chapter. The challenge may not go away when you pray, and when it doesn't go away, it simply means God knows that He has trained you enough to face it and win!

Remember, life is not subject to chance, it is subject to truths. Don't miss this principle: the power for change is in your mouth! You 're a light, the more you speak the Word, the more you shine brighter and brighter but when you speak negative words, your light goes dim.



## Daily Juice~13380

Don't allow others to define your life. Your life is defined by the vision God has given you. Therefore, follow that path.

The truth is that the future of every seed lies in its nature. The quality of your character is the foundation for how great your future will be.

You are ultimately responsible for what you become. You are in control of your life. Your future is in your hands. Never apologize for making yourself the focus of your life. You are not reading this by accident. This is your confirmation. Everything is going to be fine.



## Daily Juice~13391

Sometimes, things change! They are a reminder that you have outgrown your old settings. Don't settle there anymore. You are ready for the next step in your journey. Free yourself from the rut of comfort zone. Let go of thoughts on what didn't work out. Shift your focus to what is possible. Your words are your vehicle to your next level.

The activities of your life are the characters of your words. Everything physical that we see around us was formed by words.

You may think your words don't matter that much, but they do. You can tell what you really believe by the words you speak. Our operating in faith is linked to the words we speak. Faith is voice activated!

What's in your heart will come out of your mouth. What words are you speaking? If you realize that your words aren't filled with faith, don't just change your words, change your heart and your words will follow suit. Words are the gauge of the heart.



## Daily Juice~13395

Your past experiences may have made you the way you are but you don't have to remain and stay that way. Remember, God does not consult your past to determine your future. You are not your failure, and you are not a failure. Failure is an event not a person. Just because you couldn't do something yesterday doesn't mean you can't achieve it. 

Refuse to embody your mistakes and label yourself as a "failure" or carry your mistakes around with you. Instead, place them under your feet and use them as a stepping stone to arise above it. Your value doesn't decrease because you made a mistake; you are not your mistake.

Be awaken to these truths and let go of all the negative individuals and thoughts in your life that just drag you down; don't let insecurity ruin the beauty you were born with; be better than you were yesterday. Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other people's hands. Never be a victim of life; be its conqueror!



## Daily Juice~13399

When you close the door of your mind to negative thoughts, the door of opportunity opens to you.

The success of another does not limit yours. Stop comparison! But additional disappointment in yourself and grief is when you surround yourself with people who have already succeeded. And as a result, you seem insignificant to yourself in such a contrast.

This comes from the desire to endlessly compare yourself to others. Therefore, this attitude should be abandoned.

Someone takes something more time, and someone less, so comparing yourself with others is an act of vandalism in relation to yourself.

You may be better than others at one thing, but they may be better than you at another. And this is not at all a reason for disappointment, or gloating. This is an occasion for cooperation of efforts and exchange of experience and skills.



## Daily Juice~13452

The way your life is going is the way you chose, consciously or unconsciously. Don't allow the success of another give you a nightmare. That others are succeeding doesn't mean you are failing. Let the success of other people be your inspiration, let it be an incentive for fulfilling your dreams. It should move you to act, not to drive you into depression.

Don't use failure or challenges to convince yourself that you can never succeed. Your situations and failures do not define you, you define what is the failure and you control how you act in your situations. 

When a man is a prey to his situations, he is not his own master. You have to free your mind from the thought that you are not good enough, you have to free your mind from the slavery of doubt. Doubt and fear kill more dreams than failure ever will. Nothing is achieved in life when you think and talk badly of yourself and underestimate your capabilities.



## Daily Juice~13474

Be picky about the energy you surround yourself with because the company you keep determines what accompany you.

You can never outgrow the company you surround yourself with. You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. Leave that circle! If you run around with 9 losers, pretty soon you'll be the 10th loser. As you move forward in life, you may have to change your circle of friends. Not everyone around you is needed at the next phase of your life and some may not be interested in seeing you improve. You owe yourself that much.



## Daily Juice~13479

There is creativity in your DNA. Don't put yourself in a box. Nothing limits achievement like small thinking— nothing expands possibilities like thinking outside of the box. Surpass your limit. Subject your thoughts to God's thoughts because you will never have more or go farther or accomplish greater things than your thoughts will allow you.

Complaining is a vain way of explaining pain without gaining relief. Keep complains distances away from you. We need to see with new eyes. When you get a different vantage point, it changes your perspective. It allows you to see things you should have seen a long time ago. The possibilities in our lives change when our perspective changes. 

Our lives are built by a series of thoughts, much as bricks are used to build a house. If your thoughts are inferior, your life will be inferior; but if your thoughts are lofty and honourable, you are laying the foundation to live accordingly.



## Daily Juice~13489

Success is not by luck but by design. A creative design! What we do with our time reveals who we truly are and the direction our lives is heading. Success is predictable.

Use the social media to make your life easier not busier. All of the modern conveniences of the social media can, of course, be very good, but only if we manage them and avoid letting the buzzes, pings, and beeps they make control you. People are eager to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves. That's why the remain the same or things even get worse.



## Daily Juice~13499

Don't be afraid to start over, this time you're not starting from scratch. You're starting from experience.

When a door is slapped shut at you, don't stand there twiddling your fingers begging. Remember, what you acquire through begging will have to be sustained by begging. 

Sometimes people come into your life just to teach you how to let go.

Refuse to let rejection define you. It's not what happens to you, but how you react that matters. Don't ruin today's happiness with mourning tomorrow. Don't settle for being an option; become a priority! Why put your happiness on hold because of a situation or someone? Refuse to allow your happiness to be dependent on the reactions of other people towards you. Rise above the reactions of others towards you and refuse to be a slave to the thinkings of other people.

You are the painter of your own mood; your days are only as grey as you allow them to be.



## Daily Juice~13511

One of the most important days in your life is today! What you do with your mind can either put you up or bring you down. Your certificate or decree does not guarantee a successful life. Stop worrying for it doesn't take away tomorrow's challenges, it only takes away today's peace.

No amount of guilt can change the past and no amount of worrying can change the future. What you fear, you empower, and what you empower, you attract! How you turn out in life is 100% your responsibility. What are you waiting for? What you do now has a link with your future. A future that is not connected to today does not exist.

Challenges are not personality trait. You may be experiencing a challenge, but it is not your personality trait or your identity. Refuse to be described or weighed down by it. You are not a victim. You may have been victimized, but never take on the title of victim to describe yourself. You were born to win, so win!



## Daily Juice~13519

People will always have different opinions of you. For some, nothing you do will ever please them. Yet, there is nothing wrong with you. 

You need to travel on the road God has designed for you. Your journey is meant to be different from others. Only you need to understand it, not them!

Slowing down doesn't mean giving up. Don't let challenging times make you forget your blessings. 

Remind yourself of your choice of life by visualizing it regularly. Life is not "it is what it is." Life is the way you make it.

Most times, what limits us is our minds. 

Take advantage of opportunities. Being successful or happy never goes out of style.



## Daily Juice~13523

Promotion in your job doesn't necessarily mean promotion in life. Real promotion is from God, and that affects everything about you.

The more you know who you are, the less you let things upset you. Sometimes people let the same problem make them miserable for years when they could just do something about it. There's so much inside you to bless your world with.

Don't let your age be an excuse as to why you can't start something new! You are timeless! There is no better time than the present! If you know how to manage your time, you are already on your way to success. Remember, the greatest value of our lives comes from what we do with our time, and the only time we really have control over is the present moment. While the opportunities and favour come from the Lord, the preparation is up to us.



## Daily Juice~13528

The devil isn't as responsible for many things in our lives as much as our attitudes. A negative mindset will never give you a positive life. Old habits won't open new doors.

Every single day you should wake up and commit yourself to becoming a better person. Don't get to a point in your life where people are scared of correcting you because of your attitude, that's a dangerous place to be. Refuse to be angry and heady when corrected. Always remember, you 're blessed and privileged to have someone to correct you. God cannot go far with a man that is full of himself.



## Daily Juice~13534

What if the meaning you assigned to a situation or someone was not an accurate interpretation?

Beyond the eyes seeing what the mind believes and comprehends, but most importantly, the eyes only see what the mind is prepared for. Regardless of what life throws at you, you have the capability to overcome it but until you take responsibility, nothing happens. The choice is always yours. You are responsible for how you act no matter how you feel.

Maturity is when you come to terms with the realization that your life today is the harvest of the seeds you've planted sometime back.

It's a new day! Flame the fire you have within. Take ownership of your life and discipline your habitual thoughts, words and actions to line up with God's destiny for you.



## Daily Juice~13545

The time you got the answer to what you have been praying for wasn't the time God did it, He had been working all along for your good.

Your situation didn't meet God unawares. After you have prayed, live as an answer to your prayer; be the answer to your prayer.

Quit giving the situation all that attention and don't give it the power it doesn't have. There are certain things that will not change unless you change; outgrow that challenge.

Be careful who you go to and where you go to for help. Your help is in the Lord! Never take your eyes away from God. Anything that takes your eyes away from God is an impending disaster. It's not every open door that is for you, some open doors are traps.



## Daily Juice~13554

Refuse to hate because a negative attitude towards others will never bring you success or increase your happiness.

If anyone has any "weakness," make it your duty to fill that gap. To speak about someone's "weakness" is not greatness. Your greatness lies in removing that "weakness" or you fill that gap.

Be a beacon of light in someone's darkness. Anyone can find dirt in someone else; be the one that finds the gold. Make your life an impact and a blessing to others not a burden.



## Daily Juice~13565

Nothing in this life is worth worrying over! Even if all you have now is now, you have a reason to be grateful, and use your now moments well. There is always something to be grateful for. Don't compare the moments of your life with the best moments of other people's lives. Understand and acknowledge every good thing in you and for you. Stop striving for the imposed ideal of someone else's life.

Given our present-day situations, we have the choice of how we are going to live. Society can’t make us live in a particular way. Our circumstances can’t make us have behavioral problems. It’s our choice.

When God created us, He gave us the ability to choose. Just as we have the ability to choose eternal life or death, we have the ability to choose to praise God in all situations. If you let people's perception of you dictate your behaviour, you'll never praise God and you'll not grow as a person.

Refuse to allow someone's opinion of you or a situation drag you into a pit of unhappiness that you refuse to praise God. God gave us choice and He doesn’t force the choice, on us, and Satan cannot force us into any decision. It’s our choice. God's instruction is our choice because His instruction is our life. Choose to praise the Lord, for praise is an expression of faith. You can fix that situation with praise!

## Daily Juice~13574

For someone not to believe in you is not entirely your responsibility, but for you not to believe in what God has made you to be is your responsibility!

Nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission!

Make sure you don't start seeing yourself through the eyes of those who don't value you; know your worth even if they don't. Never seek your importance through the standards of the world. You are more than this! You are unique, lovely, loved, amazing, worthy and divine! Nothing you've done, or will ever do, can stop God from loving you and nothing that you've done is too much for the mercy of God.

Don't allow  your life to be dependent on the reactions of other people towards you; refuse to be a slave to the thinkings of others. Let your conviction about yourself match up with God's destiny for you. You were made with all of God's divine skills. Take a moment to appreciate how awesome you are! Yes you are! You are worthy! Your life is THE something special



## Daily Juice~13590

Borrowing yourself from others will only erode who you are meant to be. The way people treat you is a reflection of what's happening inside of them, sometime it's not about you. Your worth never comes from another person. Your worth is right inside you.

Don't let other people bring you down. Sometimes, some people need to leave your life for some things to start happening. The energy you surround yourself with determines the happenings in your life. Don't be afraid to be who you are; if there are people who won't accept you, then let them go. If you don't challenge yourself, you will never realize what you can achieve. Learn how to be independent; in the end, you need to be there for yourself.

Challenges will come but how you respond to them defines your character and the quality of your personality. Remember, life will not wait for you, decide what you want and go for it.



## Daily Juice~13603

Holding grudges is not only bad for your mental health, but it also has a physical effect on your brain.

If you focus on the hurt, you will continue to live in worry and suffer the pains of the hurt. Change your focus and you'll create opportunities for a more glorious life that's always been available for you that you never thought of.

Entire water of the sea can't sink a ship unless it gets inside the ship; similarly, negativity of the world can't put you down unless you allow it to get inside you. Do not allow negative and toxic people rent space in your head. Define yourself! Don't blame people for disappointing you; blame yourself for expecting too much from them! Be yourself, no matter what other people think; What God thinks of you is what truly matters. Seek God's approval, not man's approval.



## Daily Juice~13608

A disorganized person cannot make meaningful progress. Give and direct your mind what to ponder upon. Don't let your emotions control and ruin your life. Learn to take charge over your emotions, making them align with God's Word. Consistently speak to your mind and talk yourself up to bring your emotions into line with the truth.

Create a life that aligns with your purpose, and your future self will thank you. Purpose is the cure for indiscipline. Sever ties with the old patterns of low self-esteem and self-sabotage. Let the old stories end. Welcome the new beginnings waiting across new doors waiting for you. It's all meant for you now! Take challenges as a push up towards your elevation.



## Daily Juice~13614

You can't make a success of your life if you dislike yourself! Stop disliking and hating yourself, stop being against yourself. The devil is already against you, don't join the devil being against yourself. God is for you, He wants you to be for you.

You need to be for you. Why do you believe the lie the devil says about you easily, but finds it difficult to believe the truth God says about you?

God never writes anybody off, so why write yourself off? He can bring out greatness out of great mess. You may have a negative past but you don't need to have a negative future. To have a negative past may not be your choice and responsibility but to have a negative future is your choice and responsibility.



## Daily Juice~13625

Hatred is an acid that does more harm to the vessel in which it is stored rather than to whom it is directed.

Remember, you cannot attract what you despise. Refuse to allow the joy and testimony of another steal your joy and turn you into what you are not. Wish others well and wish them the very best; their success will not limit yours. What a man cannot love and celebrate cannot gravitate to him.

Never underestimate the power of your mindset. Your mindset has the ability to shape your thoughts, and you already know that thoughts become things. What you think about all day is what you end up manifesting.



## Daily Juice~13637

Don't be a victim of your negative thoughts. Renew your mind; things can get better.

We can't keep learning if we think we already know everything. Let go of the associations that don't support the new version of you. Let nothing block you.

Trust God to take ownership of your journey. Don't bow to societal pressure if it doesn't align with your vision. Don't feel guilty of disappointing others. You're meant to fulfill your purpose, not chase the road others force you to follow. You owe that to yourself. You are not helpless; you have the capacity to change things. Be an energy converter. Whatever comes your way, convert it into what you want it to become. Everything is how you respond to it, not how it actually has to be.



## Daily Juice~13643

You have to be your own biggest fan! Every moment spent envying another person is a moment spent living outside of your life's purpose. God did not create you to be jealous of who someone else is or what they are doing; He created you uniquely to fulfill your destiny.

It’s time to stop longing for what other people have and quit trying to be anyone other than you. You are the best of you; bring out that best.

Remember, as long as you invest your time trying to be someone else, or pursuing what others have, you are not being the person God created you to be. Track and measure your progress and outdo your past. Don't compare your progress with that of others; that someone else is succeeding doesn't mean you're failing.

We all need our own time to travel our own distance. Don't live someone's life and then one day look back and realize it was a waste. Live your own life and go on your own exciting journey.



## Daily Juice~13683

You have been built with the abilities and possibilities of divinity! Your position of superiority over  circumstances was established when you became a child of God. Never justify failure or rewrite your theology to accommodate a tragedy. Refuse to get stuck in placing blame on others; crisis always occurs at the curve of change.

Reach up for the key out- what would you do with your mind and mouth? Your mind is the drawing room for tomorrow's circumstance; whatever happens in your mind will happen in your life. Our lives today is the character of our words. Our lives goes where our mouth goes; a silent christian will soon or later be a defeated christian.



## Daily Juice~13705

When you know you’re rare, you move different. You think and talk different. When you understand this you don’t waste your rarity trying to convince anyone of it, you just keep on being rare until someone realizes it and won’t treat you like anything less than what you truly are. Rare.

Nothing accelerates our progress and success like when our thoughts and words are in sync with God's destiny for our lives. If you live your life like most people do, you will get what most people get and settle for what they settle for. Success is not an accident. It is not something that randomly happens to you; it is something that you make happen.

Remember, things won't improve by accident; your success is decided by what you are willing to ignore and the truths you are willing to embrace. Don't cheat yourself and your world out of the fruits of your full potential. Your success blesses others!



## Daily Juice~13713

You'll be remembered more by what you do for others than by what you accomplish for yourself! Never let life's circumstances define who you are. Material accomplishments will soon be forgotten, the only thing that lasts is the investment we make in the lives of others. A man who lives only for himself cannot see afar off and will later or sooner be irrelevant in the scheme of things. The magnetism of your kindness will far outlast the memory of your genius. 

Make up your mind to be a blessing to others. If you bless people, you'll always be lifted. This is because your promotion is in promoting others. You're a greater success as you help others to succeed.



## Daily Juice~13744

Don't forget your dreams because of a salary. Like someone once said, "A salary is a drug they give you to forget your dreams." Don't let yourself be controlled by people, money and past experiences. Why place your mistakes on your head? The weight will crush you. Instead place them under your feet, and use them as platform to raise your vision.

With everything that has happened to you, you can either feel sorry for yourself or treat what has happened as a gift for a wake up call to pursue your dreams and purpose. Everything is either an opportunity to grow or an obstacle to keep you from growing. You get to choose. Don't allow fear action your behaviours.



## Daily Juice~13751

You'll never rise above your level of association. Choose your circle carefully. Spend time with people who belong in your vision and future, not those who should stay in your past. Remember, that you had a bad day doesn't mean you have a bad life.

As you are learning what would help you to make progress, it is also important to know what is slowing you down. Refuse to have itching ears for gossip, and don’t company with those who are fond of discussing the affairs of  others. Raise your commitment level to your growth and development and to your future. Don't gamble with your future. Life is what you make it! The Word of God is a step-up converter, it doesn't leave you where it met you. Give attention to the Word!



## Daily Juice~13756

Fall in love with the gifts and skills God has given you.

If you can't be yourself, you are nobody. Did you also know there are people who live fake lives? There are those who try to be others until they lose themselves in the process. There is nothing as interesting as being you. If you always think you need to be someone else you will never get to a level of knowing yourself and discovering your potential and uniqueness. 

One of the worst things to do with time is comparing yourself with others; you don't know what God has called them to do. Run your own race! 

Sometimes, our minds talk more than our mouth. Your life is a reflection of what you hold inside you. Focus on the gifts and talents God gave you and don’t be envious of the blessings He gave others. Quit comparing yourself with others. You also have your unique strength that none has, look within and build on it.



## Daily Juice~13761

Focus on the truth, the fake will fade away.

The pain or challenge you may be going through isn't the truth, it may be the fact but it's a lie and a distraction.

The Word of God is truth! irrespective of how long a lie has been,it doesn't make it the truth. Longevity doesn't mean authenticity! Always direct your thoughts to truths and they will produce in you and for you confidence, hope, joy, faith and love, and turn away your mind from thoughts and words that inspire you with fear and sadness.



## Daily Juice~13766

Refuse to be a slave to the thinkings of others. Treat yourself well,nobody can make you happy like You. Stop getting distracted by things that have nothing to do with your goals; Starve your distractions and feed your focus! Drive and stretch your mind. Put yourself on a Word diet and schedule.

The most important places to keep clean and tidy are my heart and mind. Refuse to allow resentment,bitterness,  unforgiveness, anger, cynicism find expressions in you and through you. Unforgiveness is like holding the door open for the devil. It's like drinking poison and hoping it would hurt someone else. To be unforgiving is to allow circumstances rob you of your joy in life. Forgiving others isn’t so much about the one who offended you; it’s about your own life; it’s for your benefit not theirs. Let the divine essence within you flow out like a stream as you relate with others in love.



## Daily Juice~13778

Don’t accept your present state in life as final, because it is just that, a state. Your perception of life will not only determine the activities in your life but will also control your decision in life. There's so much in the future. Life is not only about today, there's more tomorrow than today but what you do today will show up in your tomorrow. Learn to pray often. If you know what you are up against, you'll take prayers seriously.

You're God's idea and God doesn't do an unaccomplished project. Everything that goes into making you a success is inside of you.

Don't give up on yourself, there's a place for you. So many can be responsible for your success; but you are responsible for your failure! It doesn't matter what others are doing; what matters is what you are doing.



## Daily Juice~13782

In life, what we achieve is a direct product of our belief system! A belief is not merely an idea that the mind possesses, it is an idea that possesses the mind. Most of our limiting beliefs can be traced back to our childhood upbringing, life experiences. Beliefs decide our choices and experiences in life. We cannot grow beyond our belief system.

We can change our unwanted circumstances by changing our belief system using God's Word. If you change your belief first, changing your actions is a lot much easier. Because with new information from God's word, you would have new set of attitudes which would set you on course for new actions.



## Daily Juice~13788

Don't allow a situation make you speak the wrong language. Many are trapped more by their words than by anything.

Your life depends on your line of thoughts which of course will determine the quality of your words. The issue isn't as much a problem as your thoughts and words.

You are worth the life you dream of. All you have to do is to decide. If God gave you His best when you didn't know Him, How much more now.

Prioritize what you need from the day, not what the day needs from you.

Your biggest competition is laziness and lack of focus. If you have the courage to begin, you have the courage to succeed.



## Daily Juice~13793

Don’t let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it.

You have to travel there in your mind, before you go there in your life. When you live an experience through your imagination, as if it were real, you bring it to life. Let your visualizations become your reality.

The biggest wall you have to climb is the one you build in your mind: Never let your mind talk you out your dreams, trick you into giving up. Never let your mind become the greatest obstacle to success. Get your mind on the right track, the rest will follow.



## Daily Juice~13814

Some people are insecure and sad because they pay too much attention to what others are doing and other people's lifestyle. You’re not anointed to compete with others. God gave you the grace to be who He has called you to be. God did not create us to compare and compete with one another. Don't let comparison steal your joy.

The world is full of beautiful things like You. You can't change what's going on around you until you start to change what's going on within you. Know the power of your mind and program it for success. A grateful heart is a magnet for miracles.



## Daily Juice~13836

Don’t settle for a life you don’t want. The fact that you aren't where you want to be, should be enough motivation.

Begin to see yourself at your best and carry yourself that way. No one is going to change your life for you. Everything starts with you. The day you realize and internalize that is the day your life begins to change. Say no to doubts and fears that prevent you from moving forward.

Let the doubters be your fuel and keep pushing until their voices fade into the background. You're not stopping until you've reached the heights they thought were impossible.

Put yourself on a mental diet; not a diet of idle dreams or wishing. Be mentally awake and dilligent. Put your best into everyday. You are out to win, you are out to conquer!



## Daily Juice~13844

Sometimes, one reason we don't get big things is because we only ask for small things because of the quality of our minds.

You are the icon of the divine image. Have an expansion mentality. Prepare yourself for big things. Don't allow small thinking rob you of the great life dedigned for you.

Your thinking is abstract but the result of your thinking is tangible. What occupies your mind determines what eventually fills your mouth, and your life follows your mouth. Your outer world showcases all that has dominated and at times subjugated your inner world.

It is paramount that you become the master of your thoughts. Sift your thought life. Filter out anything you don’t want to have show up in your future, and focus on what you truly desire.

It is not what others call you that ultimately determines your life, it is what you call yourself that holds the most power in your life and also determines the course of your life. The universe is alive! The universe is at your command. It is waiting for you to command it with your thoughts and words.

Arrange circumstances in your favour with words. Our lives go where our words go. Our words are seeds, and our lives are the harvest and character of the seeds of words we've sown over the years. Since you have to eat your words, you might as well sow sweet seeds.

Put a premium on words and make investment in words, and you would yield not only sweet dividends of your words, but also a glorious reality and future.



## Daily Juice~13854

As you move forward in life, you may have to change your circle of friends. Not everyone around you is interested in seeing you improve.

Be picky about the energy you surround yourself with. You can never outgrow those you surround yourself with. You owe yourself that much. If you run around with 9 losers, pretty soon you'll be the 10th loser. 

You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. Leave that circle!

If you don't let go the wrong people, you'll never meet the right people. Sometimes, we can outgrow a friendship. It was good at one time but now, you are running at a different pace. It's a new season of your life. It's healthy for seasons to change. It doesn't mean they are bad but you ve outgrown the friendship. You cannot spend as much time with them like you used to and become all you were created to be. Appreciate the people that have helped you, always honour them but recognize when their part in your story is over.



## Daily Juice~13859

How time flies; maximize your time; be disciplined. Put your whole self into life; study; always seek to improve yourself. Lack of direction, not lack of time is our problem; if you don't know where you are going, any road will get you nowhere! Where are you heading to? What is your destination? Why are you here? What are you doing? Find your own path. Stay focused on your destination even if your path may seem stormy today, it could get brighter tomorrow.

Never give up, so many can be responsible for your success; but you are responsible for your failure! It doesn't matter what others are doing; it matters what you are doing! It is what you are and what you have in you that counts; everything that goes into making you a success is inside of you. Find it and make it work; it is there. Change your approach and your reproach will change; Stop procrastinating; focus! Re-strategize! Change your attitude! You must drive yourself; kill laziness!



## Daily Juice~13877

Today can be the beginning of whatever you’d like it to be. Don't underestimate your worth; place a premium on your worth. Raise your commitment to your personal development. With what you are, you will have. You can rise up from anything. You can create new choices, new thoughts and new habits.

Just because you took longer than others in achieving  something doesn't reduce your worth. If you live in fear, you are twice as defeated but if you live in faith, you are twice as armed for success.

Remember, you are not what has happened to you, you are what you decide to do next. Letting people go who aren't headed in the same direction you are is a form of self respect not pride.

The Lord is your helper. The extent to which you go with God is a function of the knowledge you have of Him; don't let your mind tell you otherwise.



## Daily Juice~13901

Your heart is not a basket for keeping tension, fear, sadness, bitterness and envy. Adjust your attitude towards life and things will change. Let your heart always be joyful. When you feel good about the success or happiness of another person, you are choosing those things for yourself from the catalogue of life. The success of one doesn't hinder the success of another. 

Competition can motivate growth and improvement, but the real competition should be with ourselves.

Striving for our best rather than comparing with others can lead to more sustainable success. After all, our journey is unique!

But success is not how high you have climbed, but how you make a positive difference to lives around you. It is not enough to be a man of success. Rather become a man of value!



## Daily Juice~13906

Challenges in life are inevitable and they are for your promotion but being defeated is optional and a choice. When you talk about your challenges to everyone, you perpetuate the memory of them. It positions you as a victim and delays any efforts of quick recovery. Talk magnifies things.

The wise never discuss their challenges with someone incapable of solving them. Your chosen confidant should be competent and discreet.

Nobody associates with losers and victims. When Job lost everything, everyone avoided him. It was only when God doubled his blessings that others returned to participate in his life by giving him gifts. Harness your mouth.



## Daily Juice~13910

How you see yourself shapes your life. Be determined to improve your self-esteem and you will be on your way to great achievement. Do not let a low self-esteem ruin your life. The way you think about yourself determines how you interact with others. It determines how you relate with opportunities that come to you.

What’s wrong with you? Nothing but your thoughts. Stop thinking that the world is closing in on you. Stop blaming other people for your challenges. The world is not your problem, your thoughts are your own problem.



## Daily Juice~13915

From this moment on, begin the process of self-esteem improvement. Think the right way and be determined to win and you will.

Often, one gets to the brink of success and with just a little disappointment or challenge, they lose heart and give up too easily and too soon. You can never know the great things that you might achieve only if you persevere.

Without a high self-esteem, your life could be rather boring. Change your thinking and begin to see yourself uniquely.

You have to decide either to remain in a miserable state of low self-esteem or acquire and develop a Word based self- image of yourself with good character. You were born to win. So, plan to win, prepare to win and expect to win.



## Daily Juice~13927

No matter what goes on in your life, always remember that your current conditions do not reflect your ultimate potential!

There's more to your life than the challenges of the past. Don't let anything that happens make you feel insecure. Show yourself unconditional love and don't allow your mistakes to become your identity. Life is a journey, keep growing.

The minute you realize your worth, you shift your energy to attract new people who respect your worth. It starts with you first. None was born to wake up every day to impress you. Don't look for happiness in another; you don't need the approval of another to be happy. Find happiness in yourself. Life is not about the quantity of friends you have. It is about the quality of friends you have. It's not about who's real to your face; It's about who stays loyal behind your back!



## Daily Juice~13931

Stop selling yourself small and don't sell yourself short! Don't be a giant that is being intimidated by a dwarf! We, too often over-emphasize challenges and over estimate things only in physical terms and we forget who we are in Christ and the Greater One in us.

Life is spiritual. We don't engage in spiritual matters with physical weaponry. In the eyes of God, in the realm of the spirit, David was the giant and Goliath was a dwarf. Physically, Goliath was about twice as tall as David, but David was far bigger on the inside than Goliath was on the outside, and that's what really counts.

It doesn't not matter what's happening on the outside or how the challenge looks on the outside, what matters is, when you recognize who you are and the Greater One on the inside, you'll find you are a giant who has long been intimidated by dwarfs!



## Daily Juice~13941

No one rolls into success by chance! Don't expect to see a change in your circumstances of you don't create one. A new place may not give you a new life. A fresh start is not necessarily a new place, it is a new mindset, because our lives always expresses the results of our dominant thoughts. 

You can change environment, but until you change yourself, nothing really changes. It doesn't matter where you live on the outside, what truly matters is where you live on the inside. 

You cannot be greater than what you hold inside you. Your life is a reflection of what you are on the inside. Your attitude determines who and what stays and leaves your life. Stop casting blames on others for your current situation. If you let them take responsibility for your happiness or sadness, they win. No matter the situation, you're in control of your attitude. And it is this attitude that determines who controls who- either the situation controls you or you control the situation.



## Daily Juice~13952

You were born with the abilities and possibilities of success! You were created and "re-gened" to be successful and to leave your mark on this generation.

Protect yourself; don't give a high position to anyone who talks you down and talks down what you are doing. Don't give high position to those who scoff and scorners in your life. If you don't set things right, they will poison your spirit, Impede your progress and poison your dream. The words of those that sorround you have an effect on your dream and on your life.

Everyone cannot be on your team. Don't choke your life and dream with unnecessary people; anyone that is not in your direction is a distraction. Guard the dream God has given to you. Certain things may not happen in your life except certain people leave your life and you cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a great life.



## Daily Juice~13956

The secret to a transformed life is in what goes on in your mind! Depression doesn't come from what's going on in your life. It comes from your thoughts about what's going on in your life. People get depressed and discouraged because they are caught up in the world. They dwell on things they should not be thinking about or they do not recognize the priority that God should have in their life.

Irrespective of the challenges or circumstances, you can choose your response. How you live your life is totally up to you. It's not dependent on your circumstances. It's dependent on your choices.

Arrange your thoughts so that you choose happiness each and everyday. You don't need anybody's help or consent to be happy. You have what you need to be happy.



## Daily Juice~13992

Challenges are part of the curriculum of life; they are for your promotion. Challenges are inevitable, but suffering is optional and a choice.

It’s no use going back to yesterday and it's issues, because you are a different person today and you are bettering your life now.


You don't have to be who you were yesterday, or last week, or a year ago. You are free to create yourself, each and every day. There's so much glory and beauty inside you for the betterment of your life and others.

Believe in what God has made you to be, and follow His blue print for your life. You were made this way for a reason. The way you think is special. The way you smile is unique. The way you perceive the world is unique. Stop wasting your uniqueness. Your power lies in your uniqueness. Don't try to blend in and be "normal".  Be you and the world will adjust.



## Daily Juice~14005

Some closed doors were a blessing. You were knocking on traps. Give thanks for the rejection, the redirection, and the realization.

Your joy is one of the most beautiful things about you. People ask you what you do for a living so that they can calculate the level of respect to give you! Never mind, don't equate your work to your worth in life. Your work is not your worth; no amount of money given to you can be equated to your worth. 

Don't allow situation and people steal your joy, whether with a word, look, attitude, or anything that makes you sad. Feed your faith and your fear will starve to death. 

Your positive interpretation of what is happening to you matters more than the situation itself. Quit worrying! Worrying is meditating on the wrong stuff; It is using your imagination to create things you don't want. God is bigger than what you are worrying about. Learn how to enjoy where you are on the way to where you are going.



## Daily Juice~14021

Your life has been fashioned and planned by God for good. There's no desire in your heart that God has not already fulfilled. Your challenge isn't new to God! Stop over thinking and quit making up problems that don't exist. 

Grace is something God did for you prior to you having a need for it. God extended His grace to you before you even existed. Before the problem came into existence, God had created the solution. Every good thing is in the now of your life and you are in the now of every good thing.

All of God's blessings are in your life. Align and synchronize your thoughts and words with this. Your voice is the activation code. Voice your miracles; don't wait for them to happen first. If you believe in God, believe in miracles. To believe in God and not expect a miracle is a contradiction and a misnomer.

Everyday, there's favour assigned for you; look out for it and you will find it. Your thoughts release signals and affect things around you and also attract those things that are consistent with it. Discipline your mind to make things happen in your direction.



## Daily Juice~14028

Refuse to allow circumstances steal your joy! Time doesn’t heal emotional pain, you need to learn how to let go. If you look up to others for joy and happiness, you may never find it. You deserve to be happy and have a life you are excited about.

Part of the reason for the way people turn out differently has to do with the values they develop for their lives and the way they see life and respond to life. Nobody will make you happy until you 're happy with yourself first. If you don't like yourself, you can't make a success out of yourself and you can't like someone else because you can't give what you don't have.

You can still be happy during the process of achieving something. God never attached your joy to something or someone; your joy is in Him. Happiness is a choice not a result. Deal with worries before they deal with your happiness.



## Daily Juice~14034

Situations pass, they cease to exist, but they continue to be alive in our minds. Refuse to harbour that situation in your mind, let it pass. Whether you know it or not, there is battle for our minds.

Your success and happiness depend on your mindset. What you think and how you think affect the quality of your life.

Our mindset affects how we see the world. If yours is distorted, so will be the way you see yourself, others and situations. Our beliefs and thoughts shape the way we behave, even if we don't realize it.

You don't need a new day to start over, You only need a new mindset!



## Daily Juice~14105

If you don't like the direction of your life, you can change it. You are not helpless; refuse to be a victim of circumstances. You can change the course of your life. You are the icon and the reflection of the divine image. There's something in you thay holds the creative power to frame your personal world. Don't let anything or anyone make you settle for a lowly existence. God didn't create anyone to suffer and struggle through life.

Refuse to be a prisoner of your past's circumstances. One of the definitions of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again, and expect different results.

If you want something to change on the outside, then you're going to have to start by changing something on the inside. You cannot keep the same internal thought processes and believe that your external circumstances will change. Change isn't going to come from the outside. It begins on the inside. If you want change in your life, then you're going to have to do something differently in your heart.



## Daily Juice~14116

Every man's life is a story, through which the lessons of life, either positive or negative, could be unravelled, for the inspiration required by others, to live a better life.

Living in a world we've not lived in before requires a roadmap. The Lord knowing all these gave us the Bible. That's one of the great benefits of studying the Bible. To ignore the Bible is to ignore solutions to life's challenges. Replace worrying and complaining with meditation on the Word.

Choose progress over comparison.  Focus on your own journey. If you are serious about growth, you'll be serious about being intentional about your life.



## Daily Juice~14126

Humans crave to be recognized because it is one of the best feelings in the world. However, when you become overly attached to that idea, achievements and your entitlement,that is where ego comes in and it does more harm than good to you. What we often fail to realize is that there's nothing we 're and have that God's grace has not made available to us. Shift focus away from yourself and unto God, then you would sense more of His grace.

Never stop doing the best just because someone doesn't give you the credit. If you don't mind who gets the credit, as long as the work is done, you'll go far in life.



## Daily Juice~14132

Don't devalue yourself. Don't let others treat you like a doormat. Because you are much better and greater than what you think about yourself. Treat yourself with respect. Acknowledge your awesomeness. When you build boundaries, others will have to follow them.


In a world that's constantly trying to bring you down, stay up. Stay strong!

You can't make a real success out of your life if you are unhappy with yourself. Flowers blossom in a forest even when there is no one to admire their beauty. A fundamental mistakes most people make is to search for happiness in things and people.

Reshape your thinking, because you are a bundle of joy, and there's so much joy inside you. Happiness comes from the way you think and process situations.

No one can create negativity, stress or sadness within you unless you allow it. Only you can do that by virtue of how you process your world. You and only you can choose your thoughts.



## Daily Juice~14138

It's either you are changing the circumstances of your life or the circumstances of your life is changing you. Some people end up sacrificing their lives to their lost pasts. While some are “offended” in life by their circumstances and by those whom they blame for those circumstances. Yet taking offense is damaging to a person’s heart.

Regardless of what's been done to you, it's the way you responded to it that has made you the way you are. The issue isn't the situation, it's your response that matters most. Don't think other people and circumstances need to change first before your life gets better. You are the one you can change to cause a change in the situation. Stop thinking like a victim, you are a victor. Your perspective towards the situation has a direct link to the change you require. God is more interested in changing you than in changing the situation, because if you change, the situation will change.



## Daily Juice~14248

Your gifts may take you to places, but your lack of character will pull you down. Many times we fast, pray and bind demons when the real problem is just our attitudes. Work on your character and attitude towards life and how you relate with people. Sometimes, the answer you seek is in someone else. We see people go through challenges for some protracted period of time, and it appears nothing seems to be changing. Check your attitude.

As important as prayer is, you cannot get by prayer what you should get by character and service. Remember, a prayer that doesn't change you from within is a waste of time.



## Daily Juice~14256

Open up to new ways of thinking and set yourself up for success! The short cut you are looking for is called discipline. If you keep doing the same old thing, you'll get the same old results. Someday: is not a day of the week. Start today and a year from now you'll be grateful to God and to yourself! No one is you; that's your superpower. 


Don't live your life based on the script and opinions of your environment. Create the right picture of your future from the scriptures. People will say negative things about you. No matter what is said, what you tell yourself is what really counts. Don't let negative and toxic people rent space in your mind! What you tell yourself everyday through your inner thoughts and words will either lift you up or tear you down.



## Daily Juice~14263

You can control your choices, but you cannot control the outcome of your choices. Whether you succeed or fail doesn't depend on others as much as it depends on you! 

The ability to be successful and joyful starts with your attitude. Never be fearful of the future. You are the one who carries the touch of Light for yourself and many others. Think and feel blessed and loved, it'll create and attract an aura of blessings around you! To think you will fail is a misconception. Release and detach yourself from every person, every circumstance, every condition, and every situation that no longer serves a divine purpose in your life. Life is in phases and seasons, and certain phases and seasons must come to an end. Don't force to stay a season or phase that should go. You can create a new season, filled with purposeful thoughts and divine activities.



## Daily Juice~14273

Rejoice in who you are--the person God made you--and stop worrying about trying to be somebody you were not created to be! Be comfortable with the person God made you to be. God did not grace you to compare and compete with others. He gave you the grace to be who He has called you to be. Sometimes, we spend so much time and energy comparing and competing with others, and we miss out on our own paths to our God-given destinies. Don't get distracted and lose focus by comparing yourself to others. Run your own race. You can be inspired by others, you can be challenged to rise higher.

But don't condemn yourself if someone else does better at one thing or another. Some people are stronger in certain areas, but we all have our strength. Discover yours, be the best of you and bless your world with it.



## Daily Juice~14286

A lot of people don’t make progress in life due to victim mentality. You can't make meaningful progress if you keep blaming others for your failure. Take responsibility for your life; some people and situations are just like ads, skip them. Don't build a prison in your mind trying to please everyone. You'll end up depressed.

Every decision you make is a reflection of how you see yourself; It's a function of the value you place on yourself.


Value yourself! Discover your self-worth. You're worthier than you think. You are not meant to suppress your potential. You are meant to evolve to your best possible version and live your best.



## Daily Juice~14339

If you don’t live life on purpose, you will live life by accident. Don't compare your chapter 1 to someone else's chapter 20. You are God's best! There's a sense of destiny in your life because you are God's idea, His dream! God values you, He is not mad at you, and the price He has paid for you is the proof of your worth. If you don't challenge yourself, you will never realize what you can achieve. Don't be afraid.

God gave us His Word for our advantage and profit. You do not put God's Word into practice in your life and lose! Quit fighting and start living the life God has arranged for you! The battle is already won. Live from that perspective and things in your life will change.

When God blesses you financially, you don't have to raise your standard of living. Raise your standard of giving!



## Daily Juice~14345

Don't let hesitation steal your opportunity! Sometimes we become so caught up in our goals and so focused on the end result that we miss the miracles all along the way. Take time to enjoy your life's journey. Enjoy the different personalities and things God has put in your life. 


Don't let yourself become so focused and driven, so busy with what you have to do each day, that you miss the "goodies" along the way. Start enjoying the different things God has put in your life. Appreciate and enjoy the great things He has placed in your life. 

Seeds of discouragement cannot take root in a grateful heart. Change your approach and you'll still achieve your goals, and your life will be so much more fulfilled.



## Daily Juice~14370

Complaining is a useless trait.
It's a complete waste of time as it gives power to your situation and makes you conclude you are a victim. Avoid complaining at all costs. Don't stay around people who always complain for too long.

Stop complaining! If you approach life complaining about what you don't have or complaining about what’s missing then you’ll be dissatisfied. Satisfaction comes from knowing that things can always be improved but at the same time appreciating what is right in your life, right now. When you complain too much, you carry an air of defeat around you that is very difficult to remove. You're even defeated before you start out anything because of the mental construction of your mind.



## Daily Juice~14406

Your destiny was chosen by God, but its fulfillment is decided by you! Authority without discipline is harmful for both leaders and followers. Be disciplined! God doesn't promote privates into generals overnight. God seeks to work in you before he works through you. You don't need prophecy to know the destiny of a man without discipline. Yield yourself to training. Don't be in a hurry.

Sometimes we often remember what we should forget- the pains, disappointments, mistakes, and we often forget what we should remember- the victories, favours and blessings. When you learn to recall the good things God has done for you, it helps to stay in an attitude of faith and to remain grateful.



## Daily Juice~14412

Are you a leader? The essence of leadership is creating an environment where individuals can freely express and share effective ideas. Authentic leadership is not about asserting dominance or control but empowering others to contribute their unique perspectives and insights.

By providing a platform, leaders enable individuals to showcase ideas that have practical value and can bring about positive change. It recognizes the importance of collaboration, innovation, and open communication in fostering growth and progress.

Ultimately, leadership is not just about personal achievements but about facilitating the success and development of others by enabling the dissemination of impactful ideas.



## Daily Juice~14427

Real-life management and principles can't be taught in a class room. Words are very vital in how circumstances change in our lives. Your words give direction to the power of God! Words are the tools of authority. Your words are your authority over life's circumstances.

Words are important in our spiritual growth, in our walk with the Lord and in our walk amongst men. Our lives follow the dominant words that we say, we rise or fall to the degree of that which we say, what we say is what we see. Be international about your life; speak consciously and consistently faith-filled words.



## Daily Juice~14433

Fear, doubt and unbelief are expressed via words. Doubt and worry can come to you as thoughts. Circumstances will present themselves that would communicate fear and worry but these would only have an impact when you say it.

Also, fear, worry and doubt come as thoughts, but would die unborn until you say it. Why? Because what you refuse to say has no authority over your life. But if you let it tarry long enough as thoughts, you would eventually say it. Every thought came to you by words, words said to you, and you may not control the words that are spoken to you, but you can control what comes out of you.

You cannot kill thoughts by thoughts. You neutralize or annul doubt by words. Circumstances would communicate words to you, but most importantly, what comes out of your mouth is what counts.



## Daily Juice~14439

Don't merely use words to describe your situation; use words to change your situation. That's not the reason you were given words. Perharps, you have had people and circumstances write negative, destructive words on you. Now, those words have taken roots and they are setting the limits for you. Unfortunately, because you ve heard such words for so long, they have seeped down into you and given you a particularly self-image.

There's nothing to worry about, but remember, the only way you can change the effects of those words and create a new and improved self-image is by speaking faith-filled words consistently over your life with your mouth.

The best cleanser, eraser, converter and game changer you can ever find is God's Word.



## Daily Juice~14446

The battles that count aren’t the ones for gold or money. The battles within yourself–the inner conflicts–that’s where it’s at.  No matter who you are today, you can always change for the better.

You can't expect to draw people into your life who are kind, loving, confident and generous if you are thinking and acting in cruel, weak, and selfish ways. You must put forth what you want to attract. 

Many have insulted and turned away people that were divinely placed on their path and orchestrated to help them fulfill their destiny. Build good relationships with others. We are in a partnership with all other human beings, not a contest to be judged better than others and worse than others. Treat people with respect and courtesy. You can easily measure the character of a man by the way he treats and talks to others.



## Daily Juice~14452

Often we think that forgiveness is something we do for someone else, but actually forgiveness is something we do for ourselves. Because it takes more energy to hold onto hurt, guilt, anger, resentment than it does to forgive. When we forgive, we experience peace of mind and free ourselves to move on and move forward.

No matter what others do to you; they may spite, revile or criticize you; hold yourself back from responding in pride, anger or bitterness. Hold yourself in; have self-restraint and don't fight back. Silence sometimes is a good medicine. There are over 7billion people in the world. Don't let one ruin your day. A strong person doesn't seek revenge. They just move on. Don't let anyone dull your sparkle. There's so much light within you to light up someone's world. You are a channel of happiness!



## Daily Juice~14480

Every day is an opportunity to be creative – the canvas is your mind, the brushes and colours are your thoughts and words, the panorama is your story, the complete picture is a work of art called, ‘my life’. Be careful what you put on the canvas of your mind today – it matters.

Do not think what your thoughts dwell upon is of no value. Your thoughts are not only orchestrating the experiences of your life, your thoughts are also making you. All those things that fill your mind hold the keys to your reality.



## Daily Juice~14505

There's a time to find a new circle, your network is your net worth! Every next level of life will demand a different you. 

Remember, stress doesn't come from what's going on in your life, it comes from your thoughts about what's going on in your life. Life may give you a hundred reasons to cry, stop the tears, and show life you have a thousand and one reasons to be joyful. Don't give up! The grace that brought you to this day will take you higher no matter the state of things with you right now. There is a brighter future for you and there's testimony for you! A miracle can be birthed with just a shift in your thought pattern.



## Daily Juice~14548

Don't downgrade your dream just to fit your experiences, rather upgrade your conviction to match your destiny!

Don't just be occupied with continuing the status quo that you miss opportunities that will change your life. Anything that keeps you from growing is not worth defending. Fear of failure becomes fear of success for those who never try anything new. The qualities of creativity and genius are within you, awaiting your decision to match up with the power of action.

Every thought that you have impacts you. By shifting in the middle of a weakening thought to one that strengthens, you raise your energy vibration and strengthen yourself, and it influences everything around you.



## Daily Juice~14559

Don't let circumstances or the enemy take you on a useless journey. Before you ever make a move, see if that has the potential of producing divine results. You own your mind, your mind doesn't own you; don't allow it to keep drifting into anxious thoughts over the challenges of life. Whenever you feel stressed or worried, pull yourself away and meditate on God's Word. Instead of allowing stress and worry to get to you, train your heart and mind to see how God sees the situation. 

The bigger God becomes in your heart, the smaller the challenges become and inconsequential in the presence of God.



## Daily Juice~14570

God's love for you is greater than your mistakes! Don't allow the circumstances of life deceive you about God's unconditional love for you. Your past experiences may have made you the way you are, but you don't have to remain and stay that way. 

God delights in you and in your prosperity, and He's more willing for you to be successful than you could ever be. He loves you more than you love yourself. The dominant experience of your life is a reflection of the way you are thinking on the inside. Instead of looking for a change to take place externally in everybody and everything else around you, the first thing you need to do is recognize that change begins on the inside of you. This occurs according to the knowledge that you have of God.

The "coincidences" miracles that happen every day of your life are hints that God has much bigger plans for you than you ever dreamed of for yourself.

Let go of the need for others' approval and start living the good life that has been preordained for you. Your success is what you decide to do in every moment. Don't wish away the present in favour of the future. A future that is not connected to the present doesn't exist.

One should speak little with others and much with oneself. We become the image of our own thoughts and words. Our internal dialogue puts us on the path of success or failure.



## Daily Juice~14618

Transform the way you think! The thoughts you cultivate create your reality. No matter how good or bad you did at school, once you graduate, you must reprogram your mind away from the idea that your degree or grade reflects your intelligence. It does not. It actually reflects your ability to memorise. 

If you accept the lie that your exam results, or graduation grade reflect your accurate intelligence, you will never outperform your performance at school in the real world. So, if you failed, you will just accept that you will also fail at life, business, work, and almost every other endeavour. Don't limit yourself to your grades. You are more than your exam score.



## Daily Juice~14632

Salvation changes the course and direction of the recipient. You are secured in Christ. The future is not only bright, but also great.

You are God's product; He sponsors no flops. Believe in yourself and have faith in the ability He has given to you. Understanding who are and your uniqueness makes you outstanding on this earth. Accept yourself, value yourself, forgive yourself, love yourself, improve yourself and be a wise master to yourself. There's no one better; you are the best of you! To wish you were someone is a waste of the divine skill and ability you were made with.



## Daily Juice~14642

The best things of life are free, it's a matter of mindset! You can't change the experiences of your life if you are not willing to change your belief system. 

Our adversary, the devil is not emotional. When Statan attacks you, he does not feel pity over you, he will make your condition worse if you let him. Satan has no emotional attachment to anybody, not even to the people he uses. We should not be emotional about the issues of our situations. Crying and feeling sad will not change the situation. It is the decision of faith that you make that has effect on your situation!



## Daily Juice~14650

Purpose gives meaning to our lives. Refuse to be a slave or a victim to your situation. People with half your talent are making bigger moves than you while you're still waiting to feel ready.

Choice is one of the most powerful tools we have. Everything boils down to choice. We exist  in a field of infinite possiblities. Every choice we make shuts an infinite number of doors and opens an infinite number of doors. At any point we can change the direction of our lives by a simple choice. It is all in our hands.

Refuse to be stagnant. Keep finding avenues for growth- because your potential has no limit. Filter out life's negative noises and be focused. Focus determines the quality of one's life. Start managing your attention, because whatever takes your attention has a grip on your life. Commit yourself in becoming the finest version of you!



## Daily Juice~14670

You are an amazing and an incredible person dominating and winning the challenges life throws at you. You are an inspiration with the way you handle the challenges life presents. Don't give up!

Be somebody that nobody thought you could be. Quit trying to be someone else- you are unique and endowed! Never let the fear of what other people think stop you from being you. God doesn't want a second-rate version of you, He wants a first-rate version of what He has created you to be.

You can do better than you think. Infuse your life with actions, don't wait for it to happen. God has already empowered you; you are excellent than you think. Remember, the image you place on yourself is proportionate to your success in life.



## Daily Juice~14678

Those who make excuses don't make progress. Your future is being created by what you're doing. You are unique and different from everyone, stop comparing yourself with others. Your path is different, and you were given this life because you are strong enough to live it. Don't lose hope! You are stronger than whatever you are facing right now! The power behind taking responsibility for your actions lies in putting an end to negative thought patterns.

Don't dwell on what went wrong or focus on whom to blame; never sacrifice who you are for what you want. Don't waste time building roadblocks to your success; yesterday doesn’t define you, but let it prepare you for what is ahead. Your life is what you make of it! You can't think like a slave and live like a king.



## Daily Juice~14697

Don't crucify yourself because you made a mistake. Refuse to speak negative of yourself because of your present situation. You are not what you do, you are what Christ did. You did not die for yourself, and you cannot die for yourself, Jesus died for you. Note this- God doesn't use the circumstances of your life to define you. He defines you by what Christ has done for you!

Stop thinking God is mad at you and against you, but rather, start thinking God is for you and all things are working together for your good! Our inner personality makes our point of view towards life, which either elevates us or brings us down.

You are God's best! You are God's project, and remember, God doesn't embark on an unaccomplished project. There is a sense of destiny in your life because you are God's idea, His dream! God values you more than you could ever know. He's not mad at you, and the price He has paid for you is the proof of your worth before Him.



## Daily Juice~14711

If you can't stomach the effects of a choice, don't initiate the cause. Don't judge yourself so harshly because you failed. That is the job of your haters. Obsessing about what happened will improve nothing. It will only take away your peace and self-esteem. Things will change not by overanalysis but by taking an action to change. You can! Just give it another shot!

There's something in you more precious than what others have said about you. Don't ever let anyone throw you away. Refuse to let anybody demean you; you are God's best! You are not a junk.

When God looks at you, He sees things that others ignores. Don't accept the opinion of others because they do not see what God sees.



## Daily Juice~14721

Develop good attitudes and habits that help put you on a path of success. Every greatness has a system that creates and maintains it.

You heard something ill about someone else and began to relate with the person based on what you 've heard about him/her without inquiring to know if it's true or not, you are not growing spiritually and you're creating an inroad for the devil and attracting negativities into your life. 

Refuse to allow any weight cling itself to you, so you can make faster progress as God wants you to. If the word of God cannot adjust your attitudes, then God cannot help you, because God and His word are one. Refuse to have itching ears for gossip and don't company with those who are fond of discussing the affairs of others. 

Let the improvement of yourself keep you so busy that you have no time to criticize and gossip others. Men and women of purpose and goals have no time for drama. They are too busy adding value to their lives and the lives around them.



## Daily Juice~14747

Your habits have a great impact on where your money goes. Money can never multiply in the hands of one who can't resist the urge to spend. Educate yourself to be financially literate. You may be academically illiterate, but to be financially illiterate is disastrous and it creates an alliance with poverty. Be humble! Don't be in a hurry to run when you have not learnt to crawl. Humility is not stupidity when it leads to financial ability. 

Ignorance makes you believe that life functions haphazardly. Wisdom teaches you that everything that happens in this theatre of life has profound significance. What you see today is not the fruit of chance but a fruit from seeds planted in the past. Plant seeds now of the kind of life you want, and you will create a life of peace in the future.



## Daily Juice~14753

Be intentional with your time and choices, know that even small steps can lead to incredible transformations. Time is a treasure. The difference from where I am to where I ought to be is time management.

Time is the platform to execute purpose. Your time is more valuable than your money; you can get more money, but you can't get more time. Don't just prioritize what's on your schedule but most importantly, schedule your priorities. Refuse to major on the "minors" of life.

Be picky and selective with whom and with what you invest your time in; wasted time is worst than wasted money. Your future is decided by what you choose to do with your time. Stop stressing. Shift your thoughts to make it happen and major shifts will happen!



## Daily Juice~14759

If you quit on the process, you are quitting on the result. You may be the only person left who believes in you, but it's enough. It takes just one star to pierce a universe of darkness. You need the right people with you, not necessarily the best people. Never beg anyone to accept you for who you are. Anything you acquire through begging will require begging to maintain it.

Life is not about the quantity of friends you have. It's about the quality of friends you have. It's not about who is real to your face; it's about who stays loyal behind your back.

Your life has a divine blueprint for divine agenda. Life is not subject to chance, it is subject to truths.



## Daily Juice~14766

What we think affects us. When facing challenges, it's easy to fall into a vicious cycle of negative thoughts. There is no success and victory in negative thinking. Focus your thoughts on what you want to see. You were made and declared a success before you came. Upgrade and match up your words to align with heaven's reality, because all of heavens are working on your behalf!

Nothing accelerates our progress and success like when our thoughts and words are in sync with God's destiny for our lives. If you live your life like most people do, you will get what most people get and settle for what they settle for.

Success is not an accident. It is not something that randomly happens to you; it is something that you make happen. Remember, things won't improve by accident; your success is decided by what you are willing to ignore and the truths you are willing to embrace. Don't cheat yourself and your world out of the fruits of your full potential. Your success blesses others!



## Daily Juice~14773

Change is everywhere. Most times, what holds people back is their mindsets. 

You can tell more about a person by what he says about others than you can by what others say about him. 

Always lift people up: leadership is not a position, it's a responsibility. Your good deeds, care and love may seem invisible, but they leave a trail that is imprinted on the hearts of others forever. Sometimes, we give up our comfort to comfort others, don't give up. Never stop just because someone doesn't give you the credit or someone else even takes the credit. 

In the realm of the spirit, a reward or blessing does not miss its direction. In helping others, we invariably help ourselves, for whatever good we send out comes back to us, and God's reward is far greater than any award or recognition you could ever get. Don't seek to please men; do all things with only one goal in mind: to please the Lord Jesus Christ and be a success for Him.



## Daily Juice~14798

Success before men does not necessarily mean success before God! God is more interested in your spiritual state than in all your accomplishments. 

Do you think you have accomplished so much in life that you are more special than others because of your accomplishments. Because of that, you are failing to see other's worth and importance. You only act based on what you think, because your opinion is the only one that matters to you. You barely admit mistakes; hence, you are depriving yourself of the opportunity to grow because you believe that you got everything you need. You are tarnishing your relationship with others by alienating them with your attitude. 

Ultimately, you are missing a whole lot in life. Remember, your heart walk with God matters more to Him than your work or accomplishments for Him. Accomplishment does not equal success; popularity does not mean success.



## Daily Juice~14815

You need to understand your kind of person; therein lies your uniqueness and success. Your success story begins from within! You have been engineered for success from birth! Failure is not a gift from God, but a result of our decisions, actions and inactions.

You didn't show up on earth by accident, you 're a person of destiny. Don't get accustomed to living less, doing less and being less to the point that you eventually sit back and accept it. 

The lessons that are coming to you now are for a brighter future. Believe in a greater tomorrow but the greater tomorrow begins with today's principles. Lessons in life are often repeated until they 're learnt. 

No one rolls into success or fulfillment by chance, it's all intentional. Success is not an accident. Work on being, not just on having; with what you're, you'll have. Success is not to be pursued, it is to be attracted by the person you become.



## Daily Juice~14833

Stop chasing something that appears perfect. It will distract you from creating something meaningful.

Your family is the best team you could ever have; all the elements of your happiness are already there. Enjoy your family! Don't take your family for granted.

Don't destroy your family with jealousy and comparison. Stop comparing your family to that of others or your love story to those you watch in movies. Those in movies are not real and are written by scriptwriters and yours is written by God. Follow God's laid down pattern. Differences, make us all different and unique.



## Daily Juice~14880

Make up your mind to be grateful to God. Don't allow people or circumstances change your mind. Keep it set on being thankful. It's not what happens to you or what you have or don't have that is important; it's how your mind is arranged and the choices you make. Know what to ignore and express your joy. 

You place a value on everything in your life. You are the one who esteems what's important to you. Apostle Paul wrote the book of Philippians while in prison. Yet, it's his happiest book. He used the words "joy," "rejoice," and "rejoicing" a total of seventeen times in just four chapters. Apostle Paul was praising God and rejoicing from jail.

Be thankful for what you have. Your life is someone else's prayer point and miracle. Someone somewhere is grateful for half of what you have. A grateful heart is a magnet for a miracle; thanksgiving is your resúmé for a testimony.



## Daily Juice~14897

It is your decisions, and not your conditions, that determine your destiny. God would not do for you what He has designed you do for yourself. Anything that makes God absolutely responsible for everything in your life is irresponsibility not Christianity, and the devil is not the problem either. 

God puts laws and principles into being- You put them into action and motion!



## Daily Juice~14934

Sanitize your thoughts to sanitize your life! Life does not happen to you. It responds to you. Life responds to your: thoughts, words and actions. What you think of affects what you say and what you say affects what you do. Think good thoughts about yourself and others. Your mind can’t process good and evil simultaneously. If you think good about yourself and evil for others, evil will dominate your mind, and eventually manifest in your life!

Whatever we surrender our minds to, will eventually shape our character and define the quality of our life. Be careful what you surrender your mind to, even if it’s only for a day, or an hour. The mind is very important. It's the door to your spirit and it's also the door from your spirit out, to bring something into the natural world. Get the right information from God's word, and your mindset towards life would change.



## Daily Juice~14942

Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.

What we do with our time reveals who we truly are and the direction our lives is heading. Success is predictable. Use the social media to make your life easier not busier. 

All of the modern conveniences of the social media can, of course, be very good, but only if we manage them and avoid letting the buzzes, pings, and beeps they make control you. People are eager to improve their circumstances, but are unwilling to improve themselves. That's why the remain the same or things even get worse.



## Daily Juice~14948

People 're going through internal conflicts, don't add to it, be a helping hand. Love, kindness and the good we do for others are never wasted, invariably, we do them for ourselves! Never let someone's bad behaviour stop your good behaviour!

No act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted. Kind words can be short and easy to speak but their echoes are truly endless. No kind action ever stops with itself. The tongue has no bones, but is strong enough to cause strife, hatred and war. Kind words do not cost much, yet they will accomplish so much. 

Never belittle the difference you can make in the lives of others. You may never know when a moment of few sincere words of appreciation can have an impact on a life. You don't rise by putting others down; you rise by lifting others. Never look down on anyone unless you are helping him/ her up.



## Daily Juice~14954

Treat yourself as you would treat someone you love, as someone you care about. You're worthy of love and care! 

The heaviest thing you can carry is a grudge; let go and don't keep hurting yourself. Don't carry your mistakes around with you like labels; instead, place them under your feet and use them as stepping stones. Forget what hurt you in the past but never forget what it taught you. Things will be thrown at you daily but what matters is how you respond to them. We alter our lives by altering our attitudes. 

The more you praise and celebrate God in your life, the more there is in life to celebrate. Happiness is not the absence of challenges but the divine peace within that knows that All things work together for your good. Not just "some things" ALL things.



## Daily Juice~14981

A person who causes you to react controls you. A person who compels you to think and consider doing differently influences you. 

Refuse to harbour unforgiveness towards anyone. Don't allow bitterness gets even a toehold on you. Satan uses such things as an inroad against you. Don't allow such rent a space in your heart or mind except God. Like it or not, there's a spiritual battle raging for your heart and mind. When we talk negatively about someone, we can hurt their feelings or even loose demonic activities against them and against ourselves. 

There's much more to life than just this physical, natural, surface level. Spiritual activities are constantly taking place. Whether or not the person you're speaking evil about ever knows it, you'll be affected. Venting anger, frustration, resentment, or unforgiveness affects you whether it affects anyone else or not.



## Daily Juice~15003

Remember, life is not the result of chance. Whatever you are thinking about becomes the reality you are projecting. Your prevailing thought or mood determines that which is to be drawn toward you.

The man who allows his mind to dwell constantly upon thoughts of failure brings himself into close touch with the minds of "failure" people, and each will tend to pull the other down still more. You are today setting into motion thought currents which will in time attract toward you thoughts, people and conditions in harmony with the predominant note of your thought.

Your thought will mingle with that of others of like nature and mind, and you will be attracted toward each other, and will surely come together with a common purpose sooner or later, unless one or the other of you should change the current of his thoughts.



## Daily Juice~15010

Your diet is not only what you eat. It is also what you listen to, watch, read, and, most importantly, the people you hang out with.

Food affects your physical health, but these other things affect your mental and spiritual health. That is why you see some people who look good physically are experiencing deep non-clinical depression. You can't eat well, then watch and listen to things that poison your mind. Things that promote ungodliness and expect to feel well. They will poison your soul. You are more than just your body. You are a spirit and have a mind that need to be fed well and protected from junks.

You will not thrive if you have a well nourished body carrying a malnourished minds. That is the root of many (not all) incidents of depression.



## Daily Juice~15034

Change does not roll in on the wheels of chance, but comes through continuous practice. You are a creator! Our words direct our lives. Our lives go where our words go. God's Spirit and angels need and use our words to work on our behalf. Do yourself a favour and zip up those negative confessions irrespective of the situation. The devil is already against you, don't be against yourself with negative confessions.

Our words are seeds and our lives today are the harvest and character of the seeds of words we've sown over the years. Since you have to eat your words, you might as well sow sweet seeds! Be glad about the opportunities you have to make a change, and take advantage of them. If we all make the right and proper investments with the time we have today in words, we will reap the harvest of a more prosperous tomorrow.

Put a premium on words and make investment in words and you would yield not only sweet dividends but also a glorious reality and future.



## Daily Juice~15042

Keep your life in the right perspective. Every one of us has something even right now to be happy about: our health, our jobs, our businesses, our families, a previous miracle or an opportunity. Don't manufacture unhappiness; if you complain, you'll remain, but a grateful heart is a happy heart and a magnet for a miracle.

Happiness and unhappiness is based on perspective. Be cognizant of the fact that the more you attach your value to those things outside yourself, the more you give those things the power to control you. No one can depress you. No one can make you anxious. No one can hurt your feelings other than what you allow inside. Monitor your inner dialogue and match your thoughts and words to what you intend to achieve.



## Daily Juice~15060

Others' approval can't buy you fulfillment and lasting joy. If you go against your dreams to get validation, you lose more peace than the transient pleasure you gain. It feels good to be revered but do it for right reasons. It's different joy when you chase your dreams and are admired for that.

The most important places to keep clean and tidy are our hearts and minds. In your journey in life, people will misjudge you, disrespect you and treat you badly, let God deal with it, because hate and anger in your heart will only consume you.

Remember, God did not promise us we will be made happy by others, He asked us to help others be happy. Anger destroys the beauty of the heart as well as the beauty of the face. Regardless of how you 've been hurt, there's a capacity in you to forgive and move on. Don't choke yourself with it! Forgiving others isn't so much about the one who offended you; it's about your life; It's for your benefit not theirs.

Holding on to anger and unforgiveness is like drinking an acid and expecting it to harm someone else. Anger is an acid that does more harm to the vessel in which it is stored rather than to the person on whom it is poured.



## Daily Juice~15112

Your emotions are determined by your thoughts and perceptions. You may try to hide your true feelings, and you may hide them very well for a time. But eventually, your true thoughts and emotions will surface and your actions will reflect those thoughts. 

No one can consistently perform differently from the way they think — the picture they have of themselves at that time and in that situation is what truly counts, because that's what will either bring them out or keep them still in that situation.

The cells in your body react to everything that your mind and say. Negativity brings down your immune system.



## Daily Juice~15138

Sometimes the things you least want to hear about will help you the most. Being busy is not a measure of productivity; don't let people rush you with their timelines. The greatest value of our lives comes from what we do with our time, and the only time we really have control over is the current moment.

There are no “overnight” successes, only people whose preparation met God-given opportunity. While the opportunities and favour in our lives come from the Lord, the preparation is up to us. It's not how early you wake up or how late you stay up. It's what you are doing with your time when you are up that matters.



## Daily Juice~15146

It doesn't matter what the situation looks like, what matters is what you see. Don't allow yourself to be shaped into the wrong mold. Thinking precedes manifestation. Your life is departmentalized and every area has a self-image. That image dictates how you respond emotionally and physically to every situation in life.

Sometimes, we can so be so focused on acquiring material things that we forget the value of life – the biggest moment of all. Life is precious. While you work for a better tomorrow, never forget to be grateful for today. The present moment is given to you for the betterment of your life, use it wisely!



## Daily Juice~15158

Friendship changes trajectory of your life. God cares about those whom you associate with. Take a look at your friends, that's what you're going to be like in a few years. If your friends are winners, givers, focused, if they have a spirit of excellence, integrity, motivated, positive, then those good qualities will rob off on you. 

When you are with them, you are investing your time wisely, they'll make you better. But if you hang out with people that are undisciplined, unmotivated, not going anywhere, saucy and sloppy. 

Let me give you some great advice; find some new friends. You cannot become who God created you to be hanging out with them. They may be good persons but your destiny is too great, your assignment is too important, your time is too valuable to let them drive you down. Some people, the only thing that's keeping them from attaining a new level in their destiny is wrong friendships.



## Daily Juice~15163

Anything that keeps you from growing is not worth defending or keeping. Your limits to success are defined by the agreement you've made about what's possible. Change that agreement and you can dissolve all these limits.

Self-worth cannot be verified by others. You're worthy to be successful. Picture yourself living a successful life. If you depend on others for your value, it is "other-worth." You can be successful, you can let the best in you come out. You can be the best of you and live an extraordinary life. Refuse to let anybody demean you. You are God's best.



## Daily Juice~15202

Time is one of your most valuable resources. It is one of the weapons everyone has in their arsenal. How effectively you are spending yours is a reflection of how your life will be. The ability to simplify your time means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.

However, as important as time is, your skills are very important, because things will not change with time, they'll change with skills. Skills change things. Things grow not with time but with skills. People only value your results, and not your efforts. It's time for a change; your comfort zone is a barren place, nothing ever grows there.



## Daily Juice~15208

Your happiness is your responsibility! If your life is always stressful, unhappy, unenjoyable and miserable, chances are, you 're focusing on the wrong things and you 're disrespecting the life given to you by His resurrection. 

God gave us the gift of life and expects us to live for His glory. Refuse to live your life to the limits of your natural senses. All of the good "stuff" in your life has arrived to serve you, rather than you being a servant of the good "stuff". 

Regardless of your current situation in life, you have a spiritual contract to make joy your constant companion. Know that you don't have to live a life filled with less-than-joyful activities. If you slip, it doesn't mean that you are less valuable. It simply means you have to learn some more. Don't try to rush things that require time and skills to grow.



## Daily Juice~15215

The understanding of you is the foundation of living an outstanding life. It's not what is outside, but what is inside that takes one to the top. You have been given authority. This means you have the power to give orders to your life, for it to align.

Don’t look back—you’re not going that way. Who you were 10 years ago? Doesn’t matter. Who you were last year  Irrelevant.Who you're becoming? That’s what counts. Let go of the past versions of yourself that no longer move you forward. Learn, grow and move forward!



## Daily Juice~15227

Don't allow someone's opinion of you become your reality or let a bad situation turn you into what you are not.

Refuse to let anyone who has done nothing stop you and make you belittle the dreams in your heart. God wouldn't have put a dream in your heart if He had not already given you everything you would need to fulfill it. 

If you would doubt anything, doubt your doubt, not yourself, God nor His word. Refuse to allow the pressures and challenges of life dictate and becloud your thinking or allow yourself to be defined by someone's inability to see your worth or negative opinion of you.



## Daily Juice~15232

If you focus on the hurt, you will continue to live in worry and suffer the pains of the hurt. Change your focus and you'll create opportunities for a more glorious life that's always been available for you that you never thought of. Entire water of the sea can't sink a ship unless it gets inside the ship; similarly, negativity of the world can't put you down unless you allow it to get inside you. 

Do not allow negative and toxic people rent space in your head. Define yourself through God's Word with the identity He's called you! Don't blame people for disappointing you; blame yourself for expecting too much! Be yourself, no matter what other people think; What God thinks of you is what truly matters. Seek God's approval, not man's approval.



## Daily Juice~15260

The unhappiest people are those who worry the most about what everyone thinks. Everyone will never like you nor agree with you in this life. Even if you help the whole world, some will still say that there's favouritism in the helping process. Be addicted to bettering yourself! Be loyal to your future not your past. You may lose people but don't lose yourself. 

Everyday, we make choices, and the choices we make eventually make us. Winners win not because they are allowed to win, but because they decide to win.



## Daily Juice~15279

Eliminate the time-wasters in 
your life. Concentrate on your God-connection. Ignore comments and people that breed doubt, defeat and pull you back.

Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer grows you but distracts you. How your life goes is linked to how you spend your time. Effective time management requires getting God's heart on what is worth investing in versus what we should be spending or even wasting time on. You must ask yourself what kind of return your time investments are yielding. Time "spent" is a cost- and you must be mindful of the benefits you are exchanging for the cost you are incurring. Surround yourself with people whose definition of life is linked with how well they use their time.



## Daily Juice~15292

Winning doesn't necessarily make you a better person, but being a better person makes you a winner. We all came from different backgrounds and experiences. Our experiences colour the way we respond to people and situations.

Don't be divisive. One thing you'll guard against is pride. When a man is proud, he sets his own standards, sees others small, rarely sees his mistakes, but his fall is usually very big. That you can talk doesn't mean you are more intelligent. People are different; some can talk while some are quiet. Our differences make us all unique.



## Daily Juice~15298

Intention doesn't change anything, action does! The difference between who you are and who you want to be is what you do. 

Don't let your habits become handcuffs. Anger will cost you more than you realize. A quick temper will pull you back and short circuit your destiny if you don't do anything about it. Quit saying and attributing it as your weakness. Get this- In Christ, there's no weakness. If you are distressed by someone or anything external, you have given it the power to influence you, and the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to change at any moment. 

Don't destroy yourself by allowing negative people add  dirts and debris to your character and purpose. Focus on God's purpose for your life. Purpose is an essential element of you. It's the reason you are on earth at this particular time. Your very existence is wired and wrapped up in the things you are here to fulfill.



## Daily Juice~15384

There is no competition in destiny. Each one has its own. Your real competition is to always outdo your past! You can be the best that you can be when you are not comparing yourself with anyone. If you are not careful, you will end up living the illusions that others have created. When you know your worth, you do not need others to confirm it.

People are insecure in themselves because they pay too much attention to what others are and what others are doing. Comparison is a thief of joy. It wanes down the joy of living your own life. Run your own race. You carry so much ability in your heart. Give some to fulfilling your destiny. You are perfect exactly as you are! It's not what is outside, but what is inside that takes one to the top.

It isn't what you have or don't have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about. Your happiness is your responsibility; you don't need the approval of anyone or circumstances to be happy. 

You were designed to be joyful. Make a decision today not to be defined by your past or by your mistake. If something is wrong, fix it if you can; but if you can't, train yourself not to worry; worry never fixes anything. Worrying is down payment of a debt you never had! Your secret is in your joy and laughter. If you let people's opinion of you dictate your mood, you'll never grow as a person and you'll live as a slave to the thinking of others. Remember, if you want to please everybody, you will have to compromise your happiness. Anyone is sure to have some haters, but that don't count, live your life joyfully.



## Daily Juice~15431

As you move forward in life, you may have to change your circle of friends. Not everyone around you is interested in seeing you improve. Be picky about the energy you surround yourself with. You can never outgrow those you surround yourself with. You owe yourself that much. If you run around with 9 losers, pretty soon you'll be the 10th loser. You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. Leave that circle! If you don't let go the wrong people, you'll never meet the right people. 

Sometimes, we can outgrow a friendship. It was good at one time but now, you are running at a different pace. It's a new season of your life. It's healthy for seasons to change. It doesn't mean they are bad but you ve outgrown the friendship. You cannot spend as much time with them like you used to and become all you were created to be. Appreciate the people that have helped you, always honour them but recognize when their part in your story is over.



## Daily Juice~15450

You are God's masterpiece! You were made with all of God's divine skills and abilities. Make your life a masterpiece! Smile, you don't own all the problems in the world. Keep the smile of a victor on your face all the time. Worrying people are never successful for long. In fact, when they are successful in anything, it's shorts lived.

The measure of the strength of a man is the way he bears up under challenges; Adversity causes some men to break, but causes others to break records. Where do you fall in?



## Daily Juice~15458

Don't be afraid of losing people, be afraid of losing yourself trying to please everyone around you. If they make you an option, make them a memory and create an impact with your life. Everyone you meet has a part to play in the story of your journey in life. Some have rounded off their journey with you, while some may take a chapter, others a paragraph and most will be no more than scribbled notes in the margins. Some come into your life as blessings, some as distractions, some as lessons. You learn something from everyone who passes through your life; some lessons are painful while some are useful but they are all priceless and for a purpose.

Nothing in this life can successfully work against you! Appreciate everyone that has passed through and will pass through; they are a part of the ultimate plan. Lessons learnt must not be forgotten and would be needed as you don't prepare for an exam during the exam, you prepare for an exam before the exam.



## Daily Juice~15510

Tomorrow's results are the seeds of today's choices and decisions. Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go or what you can accomplish but your decision to look within and take advantage of what you've got inside for a change. Yes, your past and even your present might have been the result of someone's decision or circumstances but your future is your choice and your decision. 

Success is not by chance; no one rolls into success by chance. Give no room for excuses. Quit blaming the past, others and circumstances; your life is in your hands. It's not about knowing what to do but doing what you know. Intention doesn't change anything, action does. Knowledge that is passive does no good to you unless it is applied! Be focused or you'll be left behind. Let determination follow your decision for a change. Determination today in the right direction leads to success tomorrow.



## Daily Juice~15523

Don't mix bad words with bad mood; you might have several opportunities to change a mood but you'll never get the opportunity to replace the words you've spoken. Hurting someone can be as easy as throwing a stone in the sea but do you have any idea how deep that stone can go? Respect people's feelings, even if it doesn't mean anything to you, it could mean everything to them. How you make others feel says a lot about you. Hurting people hurt others. Don't be quick to judge, you need to understand that person's feelings and thoughts and what they might be going through.

Be sensitive to the plight of others. A little consideration, a little thought for others makes all the difference. You are who you are today because of what God's grace has made you.



## Daily Juice~15536

This world should be happy you came. If we are to cause real change and transformation in our lives, we must learn to separate between what is truly valuable and what is not. Don't seek to please men; don't live to the cheers of men.

Most invest themselves and their lives in the nonessentials. Refuse to allow the excitement of the season drift you away and put your priorities in the wrong things. Life is beyond today; don't lose focus. There's no better investment than in the Word of God. The challenges of life are subject to wisdom, and the Word of God is wisdom.



## Daily Juice~15548

Instead of looking at what's depressing you, make being joyful your constant reminder. Every happiness works on both the giver and the receiver.

Simplify your life. Too many people see too much, hear too much and consider too many things, and too many things easily get their attention. Their priorities have been wrongly placed and it is slowly eating them up. We must simplify our lives or we are going to lose terribly. 

No negative emotion is worth holding on to when you consider what it is doing to you. countless people today are making themselves sick over things that don't count because they let things get to them. The only person who can make you act in an unloving way is you. Only you can decide how you act.



## Daily Juice~15556

What you do with your mouth determines the quality of your personality! The loose tongue spreads strife and hatred. When people open their lives and challenges to you, count it a privilege. They didn't tell you so you can spread it to other people.

Learn to exercise self-control over your mouth and tame that push to talk! Become the leader that you would like to follow. Handle people's Information with utmost confidentiality! Train yourself to be someone that can be trusted. Betrayal is also leaking out information told you in private. Be a person of integrity that can be trusted to handle people's private information with utmost secrecy. Being a talkative is not a gift.



## Daily Juice~15587

Complaining is a vain way of explaining pain without gaining relief. Keep complains distances away from you. We need to see with new eyes. When you get a different vantage point, it changes your perspective. It allows you to see things you should have seen a long time ago.

The possibilities in our lives change when our perspective changes. Our lives are built by a series of thoughts, much as bricks are used to build a house. If your thoughts are inferior, your life will be inferior; but if your thoughts are lofty and honourable, you are laying the foundation to live accordingly. There is creativity in your DNA. Don't put yourself in a box. Nothing limits achievement like small thinking— nothing expands possibilities like thinking outside of the box. Surpass your limit. Subject your thoughts to God's thoughts because you will never have more or go farther or accomplish greater things than your thoughts will allow you.



## Daily Juice~15595

Being graced by God is God's investment in you, and God's grace is available to all. Being focused and disciplined is your responsibility and your investment in yourself!

Don't place your mistakes on your head, their weight may crush you. Instead, place them under your feet and use them as a platform and a stepping stone to raise your vision.

Be kind to yourself and to your dreams. Be gentle with your heart. You have seen a lot going wrong in life. Treat yourself the way you will treat a loved one. Show yourself unbounded compassion and warmth without waiting for others to fill it up for you. You are meant to be loved right. Your peace of mind is a priority. Your growth is a priority! 

You are a priority; don't put yourself last!



## Daily Juice~15602

You don't have to suspend your joy because of a situation. Don't try to rush things that require time and skills to grow. Blaming circumstances or someone because of a situation or a misfortune is responding to a lie from the pit of hell. When you realize that no one can dictate your destiny but you and God, you will live a new kind of life. Don't waste your precious time blaming someone for any challenge or misfortune in your life.

Whether someone wronged you or not, God will restore your wasted years. He will restore the years in fruitful measures. Think the best of others, see the best in others, and believe that if you can be kind, and walk in love, others can do the same.



## Daily Juice~15609

Don't strive for the approval of others or depend on compliments to feel good about yourself.Human love is fickle!Learn to love yourself, not as men love you but as God loves you. How you think about yourself will have a tremendous impact on the person you become, because you will probably speak, act, and react as the person you think you are. Stop being defined by what others think of you. Do not live for the expectations of people around you; live for your purpose. It doesn't matter what anyone says about you,the only one who matters is the One who who made you! 

Even if you 've made mistakes, don't crucify yourself. God has just started a new thing, to turn those mistakes for development and miracles. You can forget those losses and the hurts. Start afresh. Don't make your life dull and put yourself in a vacuum. Don't wallow in ignorance, self-pity and enjoy it. No one associates with failures; everyone wants to associate and identify with success. Square your shoulders because you are a bundle of success.



## Daily Juice~15618

Inner rest is just as important as outer rest.Your physical body can rest, but if your mind never rests, if you live worried, fighting everything you don't like, you're going to be worn out and it's going to drain your joy and take your energy. You can't live a happy life with sad thoughts. Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy for this moment. The most important thing is to enjoy your life - to be happy - it's all that matters.Happiness is a choice. Enjoy what you look like. Enjoy life and enjoy You. 

Happiness isn't just about getting all you want, it's enjoying all you have. Relax your mind.A lot of the stress we deal with are just our thoughts and perception about a situation. God made you to be happy. If you're not happy, you are not fulfilling the purpose for this creation. He created you to be happy.



## Daily Juice~15651

You can't make progress without making decisions. Don't confuse activity with productivity. Stop pressing rewind on things that need to be deleted from your life! The first step to getting what you want is having the courage to get rid of what you don't. 

Your BEFORE and AFTER must not be the same. Project yourself forward, open your arms to change but don't let go of your values. Remember, achievements means nothing if we are not a success as a person.



## Daily Juice~15660

Pay close attention to your disciplines. Never limit thinking or yourself because of a challenge. Challenge your limits.

Although we blame the devil for a lot, the truth is that very little of what happens in your life is the devil. Of course, Satan is involved in everything negative. But all he has to do is tempt you and you can single-handedly ruin your own life. Many spend too much time engaged in spiritual warfare, fighting the devil and rebuking this and that, while they are actually just reaping what they've sown.

Instead, let's focus on renewing our minds in God's Word, canceling out the bad seeds and sowing good seeds with our thoughts and words!



## Daily Juice~15666

You become who and what you spend your time with. Anger, resentment and jealousy don't change the heart of others-- it only changes yours. Never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback, even if he deserves it. Don't allow his anger to become your anger.Work on your anger,hatred and bitterness issues before they take you to the wrong destination. They may seem  justifiable to you but the end is destruction.

Attachment to a hurt or pain arising from a past event blocks the inflow of blessings and joy into your life and makes you a prisoner of your past. Regardless of how you have been hurt, there's that capacity in you to forgive and move on. Don't choke yourself with anger and bitterness.



## Daily Juice~15680

Don't spend your life criticizing your imperfections. God never made you with any weakness or imperfections. Circumstances and people have sold that lie to you! Embrace the unique person that you are. Enjoy as much as you can wherever you are. Make the best of today. A happy and contented heart is the source of joy and a magnet for blessings. 

Don't allow anyone to make you feel you're not good enough. Be happy about You. You can't make a success of your life if you aren't happy about you! Quit trying to be someone else; you are the best of you. Don't let your emotions speak for you. Have value for yourself, for if you don't have value for yourself, you can't value someone else. There's always someone watching and has hopes on you. Never give up. Refuse to settle for less just because you have no other alternatives available.



## Daily Juice~15689

It's a new day! Flame the fire you have within you. There's no challenge that comes to you that you are not greater than. Regardless of what life throws at you, you have the capability to overcome it, but until you take responsibility, nothing happens. The choice is always yours. 

Remember, life has its responsibility of distracting you but you have the responsibility of remaining focus! Most people fail because of broken focus. You are responsible for how you act no matter how you feel. Maturity is when you come to terms with the realization that your life today is the harvest of the seeds you planted sometime back. Take ownership of your life, and discipline your habitual thoughts, words and actions to line up with God's destiny for you.



## Daily Juice~15721

Your actions are a window into your character! Too many people live their lives on autopilot. Be intentional about your life; be aware, stay present and stay focused.

Work on your habits, and your actions will change. Anger will cost you more than you realize. A quick temper will pull you back and short circuit your destiny if you don't do anything about it. Quit saying and attributing it as your weakness. Get this- In Christ, there's no weakness. 

If you are distressed by someone or anything external, you have given it the power to influence you, and the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to change at any moment. Don't destroy yourself by allowing negative people add  dirts and debris to your character and purpose.



## Daily Juice~15728

It's either you are changing the circumstances of your life or the circumstances of your life is changing you. Some people end up sacrificing their lives to their lost pasts. While some are “offended” in life by their circumstances and by those whom they blame for those circumstances. Yet taking offense is damaging to a person’s heart. Refuse to be a prisoner of your past. 

Focus on God's purpose for your life. Purpose is an essential element of you. It's the reason you are on earth at this particular time. Your very existence is wired and wrapped up in the things you are here to fulfill.



## Daily Juice~15737

Never let life's situations define who you are! Arrange circumstances in your favour. Celebrate your victories; don't wait for them to happen first. Live in the future of your dreams. Stay in the atmosphere of joy. There's a strong connection between praise and victories. Praise has something to do with victories. If you only knew what happens in the spirit when you rejoice, you would rejoice evermore. 

One of the quickest ways to activate the ministry of the Spirit and the miraculous in your life is through songs. Singing is a spiritual thing! Your praise attracts the attention of angels to work on your behalf. Praising God isn't optional; praise affects every area of our lives. Praise God irrespective of the situation or how you feel. Feelings are scam. Refuse to let your life be dependent on how you feel or let your feelings be a God to you that you now live your life to the limits of your natural senses.



## Daily Juice~15748

When you are a giraffe and you receive criticism from turtles, they are reporting the view from the level they are on. You are the giraffe, you are strong and powerful and you are on your own journey. If you stay true to yourself and refuse to follow the crowd you will definitely receive criticisms from those that quite frankly are jealous of how you stand your ground amidst the oppositions. 

You can let this get to you and give in to the thoughts and ideas of envious people but then you will only be moving down to their level. Or you can rise above it, like the giraffe, and stand steady in your beliefs. The choice is yours, but remember to always look at who is criticizing you and why. Stay focused. We often get sidetracked because we are worrying too much about Who's watching, what they are thinking and what's being said. Opinions are not results! People can assume all they want but they will never be able to predict your next winning move. Only you can determine that!



## Daily Juice~15766

Take care of your world inside of you, so that you can take care of your world outside of you.

There is a genesis effect to everything in creation. Most people do not realize they are already attracting things into their lives. Your mind is like a garden, your thoughts and words are the seeds. Whatever grows up, either flowers or weeds, it's our personal responsibility!

Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant. Our thoughts become things in our lives.The activities in our lives are expressions of the inner workings of our minds. Cultivate thought patterns that anticipate success and progress; you would create your life intentionally because the universe offers to you the harvests of your thoughts and words.



## Daily Juice~15798

Be a vehicle to bring out the best in everyone, even those deemed your opposition. You don't have to blow off another's candle for it won't make yours shine brighter. Refuse to feel unimportant and insecure when someone does something remarkable. Your time will come, you will shine one day. If you are in the background cheering for someone else today, just keep working on yourself and on your dream, sooner or later, things will change and others will be cheering you up. 

Remember, sometimes to see a miracle, you have to be the miracle. Someone else's success will not limit yours, and their success shouldn't be the source of your unhappiness.



## Daily Juice~15805

Action expresses priorities. Refuse to be a slave to social media! Don't allow social media train you wrongly that you start comparing your life instead of appreciating everything you are and have. No wonder most people are depressed.

People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures.



## Daily Juice~15817

Don't get tired and discouraged because of a challenging situation. Don't be hard on yourself and think less of yourself because of what you might be going through. The situation came to pass, it didn't come to stay. Don't establish and elongate the negative with your thoughts and words. You are bigger than any challenge. Give yourself some grace. Show yourself some compassion and love. Keeping your faith each day amidst the situation is an accomplishment in itself.

Just like a tea bag colours the water with flavour and fragrance when you put it into hot water, in the same way, be like a tea bag and colour your world with positive attitude and action. That is, allow the situation to bring out the best in you and make an impact on everything around you.



## Daily Juice~15823

Choose your circle carefully. Some people will judge you for changing. Others will celebrate you for growing. 

Most people are often bothered by what others think about them. Of course, the Lord didn't create us to be rejected. Therefore, no one likes to be rejected. 

We all want to be accepted, but what someone else thinks about you shouldn't determine what you think about yourself! What other people think about us is not the important thing; it's what we think about ourselves that control us. God's acceptance of you should matter more to you than the acceptance of men.



## Daily Juice~15840

The events of your past do not reduce your value or potentials. How someone has treated you or what someone has said about you does not change your ability. In your life, God may have done wonders in the past, but you haven't seen anything yet. The best is yet to come! Your best days are not behind you, they are in front of you! There's so much glory and beauty inside you. 

Don't allow your life to become obsolete and dull. God planted His seeds of greatness inside you; refuse to make little plans for your life because of present circumstances. Keep dreaming, keep stretching yourself, planning for new projects, experiences and greater adventures with God. You were never created to reach a certain level and then stop. There's no limit for the one who takes a hold of God's word to crystalize his mind and words, shakes off complacency to stretch into the next and higher level.



## Daily Juice~15862

Constantly exposing yourself to popular culture and the mass media will ultimately shape your reality tunnel in ways that are not necessarily conducive to achieving your God given purpose!

Take a hold of your mind and mouth; they determine where and how your life goes. Your body can stand to anything, it's your mind you have to convince. You have to train your mind to be stronger than your emotions or else you will lose yourself everytime.



## Daily Juice~15869

Habits are an investment, and as any investment, you will receive the dividends in a determined time. The kind of dividends is up to you! People tend to gravitate towards a success but a failure has no friends. 

Don't be afraid of losing people, be afraid of losing yourself by trying to please everyone around you. If they make you an option, make them a past memory and create an impact with your life! Refuse to be a slave to the thinkings of others. Stop getting distracted by things and people that have nothing to do with your goals; Starve your distractions and feed your focus. If you want to see what you are truly committed to, look at your results.



## Daily Juice~15880

Stop worrying, for it doesn't take away tomorrow's challenges, it only takes away today's peace! No amount of guilt can change the past; and no amount of worry can change the future. What you fear you empower, what you empower you attract.

God never consults your past to decide your future. He is not limited by your past, His Word can create a new destiny for you. But your ignorance is the most effective weapon Satan uses against you. Never ignore God's Word, if you ignore God's Word, you are ignoring solutions and struggling is inevitable. Your attitude towards God's Word is a picture of your reverence for God. Changes are always proportionate to your knowledge of the Word; the place that God's word holds in your life is the place God holds in your life. Remember, God does not respond to your fears and worries, He responds to faith.



## Daily Juice~15887

Sit down and make your life worth-while, spice it up with God's Word. If you don't starve your past, it'll keep drawing you back! There's no joy in living your whole life on the ground because of the mistake of the past; there's no passion to be found playing small; in settling for a life that is less than the one you 're capable of living. Stop short-changing your life. 

God has designed you for something greater but He wants your thinking to be in sync with His thoughts towards you. The best way to guard your mind is to fill it with God's precious thoughts towards you. Refuse to allow others discourage you, for you 're so much better than this. Don't give up or reduce your relationship with God to accommodate and please people who don't care about you as much as God does. If a man makes you, a man can "unmake" you if you offend him or he's not pleased with you anymore, but if God makes you, you are irreversibly made for life.



## Daily Juice~15895

God is good! That’s what the Bible says. It’s different from saying God is a good God; God is more than a good God; goodness is His character. It is His nature to be good. Don't struggle to impress Him, there's nothing you would do that would make God love you more or less. He already loved you beyond your wildest imagination. No matter how high your love for God is, it is little compared to the love He has for you! 

Sometimes, we sing about how we love Jesus but He first loved us before we love Him. And our confidence is not in how we love Him but how He loves us. He loves us with a love that can never be broken, and once you realize that nothing can change God's mind about loving you, it frees you. No matter what you've done wrong, no matter what you've done right, He loves you all the same because even before you knew how to do right, He already loved you. There's no need to feel condemned. God loves you personally and His love for you covers every minute detail of your life.



## Daily Juice~15925

Today is a good day to have a great day! But the new day will mean nothing if you are still tied to the issues of the past in your mind. Refuse to allow someone's bad behaviour destroy your inner peace. Don't allow your happiness to be dependent on the reactions of other people towards you. 

Conquer today. We tend to define our days as being “good” or “bad”, by the way we perceive the things that happen to us. It’s all about perspective. We set the tone for our day depending on our reaction to things— take it easy. It’s not a bad day, it’s just a small moment in the day. Shift your view, don’t let that moment hold so much weight of your day. Notice the level of significance and energy you are placing on that particular incident. You hold the power, take control of your day— everything is actually okay.



## Daily Juice~15948

You are an embodiment of joy; treat yourself well, nobody can make you happy like you! Time doesn’t heal emotional pain, you need to learn how to let go. If you look up to others for joy and happiness, you may never find it. You deserve to be happy and have a life you are excited about. Part of the reason for the way people turn out differently has to do with the values they develop for their lives and the way they see life and respond to life. 

Nobody will make you happy until you 're happy with yourself first. If you don't like yourself, you can't make a success out of yourself and you can't like someone else because you can't give what you don't have. You can still be happy during the process of achieving something. God never attached your joy to something or someone; your joy is in Him. Happiness is a choice not a result. Deal with worries before they deal with your happiness. Refuse to allow circumstances steal your joy!



## Daily Juice~15954

Just because a lot of people are saying the same thing loudly over and over, doesn't mean it's true. A lie is not just an opposite of truth. A twisting of the truth is a lie. The Word of God is truth! The truth is not bitter, it is only bitter to the one who likes and enjoys falsehood.

Be who God wants you to be, not who the world wants you to be. Life doesn't get better by chance, it gets better by change. It's not the external event or person that takes our smiles and peace away- it's because we give them permission to enter and give them life in our minds.



## Daily Juice~15965

Time is currency; spend it well and invest it wisely! You don't need the approval of others to make progress with your life! Create your day in advance by thinking the way you want it to go, and you will create your life intentionally.

You are the master of your life and the universe is answering your every command. The universe offers to you the harvests of your thoughts and words.



## Daily Juice~15977

Some look around and feel like they missed out on the talents and abilities they see in others. In one way or another, many people go through life feeling like they are a mistake—so they just struggle and try to cope the best they can. The Lord’s plan for your life is far better than that. You aren’t a mistake. You didn’t miss out on the talents you need to accomplish God’s will. You don’t have to struggle through life, bouncing from one crisis to the next. He said your life is from glory to glory, not from problem to problem.

God has a purpose for you. He created you for a reason. You have a specific purpose in life and God wants you to discover that purposepurpose, and therein lies your fulfillment.



## Daily Juice~16000

Your mindset filters everything you experience. If you have a negative mindset, you will perceive things to be mostly negative. Being more aware of this will help you to experience greater positivity in your life.

If you are stuck to the past, you cannot enjoy the beauty of the future. Someone who can't handle stress and challenges, you won't manage success. Your worth is not based on what has happened to you or the circumstances sorrounding your life. It doesn't matter what the situation looks like, what matters is what you see.

Tomorrow won't be different if you don't change the way you think and change something you do today! See that challenge as a new seed of opportunity for growth and development. No challenge can stop you! What counts isn't the size of the challenge but the quality of our mentality.



## Daily Juice~16017

Life is always the product of our choices, not the product of our circumstances. Given our present-day situations, we have the choice of how we are going to respond. Society can't make us respond a particular way. Our circumstances can't make us have a behavioural problems. It's our choice. No matter how you are, people will always judge you according to their mood and need.

Rather than waiting for an apology, or expecting one to come, realize it may never happen and that’s okay. Because your life and happiness don’t depend on someone else saying sorry. Your life and happiness depend on your perception and not on anyone else.



## Daily Juice~16041

Quit trying to be someone else; compete with who you were yesterday. Your mind and mouth are necessary tools for your transformation. Some people believe they live in lack because they are unfortunate, not realizing that their belief systems are rooted in scarcity thinking. 

You must put forth what you want to attract. Act as though what you want to manifest is already a reality. Eliminate thoughts of conditions, limitations, or the possibilty of it not manifesting.



## Daily Juice~16058

Whatever happens in your mind will happen in your life. It's often said, mind your language, but we need to also mind our minds! The health of your mind heavily influences the quality of your decisions and your ability to maintain focus and invariably determines the quality of your personality. 

The mind is not a "Thing". The mind is an activity, an image-maker, a creator and the mind operates by law. Whatever is impressed upon the mind must be expressed. Whatever you think about, you bring about. Be choosy and picky what you expose your mind to.

We can't be thinking like we used to and expect to live a different kind of life. Stop attributing your problems to other people and your environment. We are today what and where our thinkings have brought us. Change your thoughts and the activities in your life will change.



## Daily Juice~16071

The assignment God has given you is unique to you. Fulfill it! Don't let comparison steal your joy. Stop letting envy, jealousy and insecurity ruin the beauty of your life! 

The world is like a stage with men and women. Everyone has his/her role in the script of life; both the good and the bad act out their roles. Don't try to act another person's role. Look for your role in the script and act yours.



## Daily Juice~16099

You are responsible for your own happiness. If you expect others to make you happy, you will always be disappointed.

Happiness is an inside job. Don't assign anyone else that much power over your life. Happiness doesn't depend on any external conditions, it is governed by our mental attitude.

Reframe your mind with God's Word; don't let others influence your emotions. When someone tries to trigger you by insulting you or by doing or saying something irritating, switch off your ego and refuse to be influenced negatively. 

Remember, if you are easily offended, you are most likely to be easily manipulated. Most times, people are victims of their own mind, decisions and choices.



## Daily Juice~16107

Your environment plays a significant role in your behaviour. If you're looking to change your behaviour, examine your environment. 

The power of association brings about conformity. Sometimes, when God wants to change the story of an individual; He brings him or her to a place or in contact with a people. The devil also does the same, because the company you keep determines what accompany you! Each association is an ingredient that changes the equation of our lives for good or for bad.

Today is different from yesterday. You will never have this day again, so make it count. Keep your life in the right perspective. Every one of us has something even right now to be happy about: our health, our jobs, our businesses, our families, a previous miracle or an opportunity. 

Don't manufacture unhappiness; if you complain, you'll remain, but a grateful heart is a happy heart and a magnet for a miracle. Happiness and unhappiness is based on perspective. 

Be cognizant of the fact that the more you attach your value to those things outside yourself, the more you give those things the power to control you. No one can depress you. No one can make you anxious. No one can hurt your feelings other than what you allow inside. Monitor your inner dialogue and match your thoughts and words to what you intend to achieve.



## Daily Juice~16131

Don't allow a challenge or someone dim your light! Understand that there's no such things as coincidence when your life is directed by God. God is good and He is the giver of all good things. When something good happens to you, be sensitive, recognise the work of God and learn to ascribe the glory to Him and praise Him for it. 

Sometimes we take these things for granted. Some don't even realize it was God at work in their lives. Some are complaining, waiting for the "big breaks." Remember, life is a series of daily little miracles that when recognised and appreciated produce the "big breaks."



## Daily Juice~16148

Don't allow society and people give you a wrong image of yourself! The way you see yourself and see life affects the way you live, it controls the decisions you make and the things that happen with you and around you.

You are the perfection of God's creation; the expression of divine excellence. There's nothing wrong with you. Your life is full of beauty and excellence, because you 're created in the image and likeness of God. You look like God and function like Him. If God wants to look at Himself, He looks at you because you're His image, His mirror!

You're not the angry, unhappy, frustrated person that your mind or Satan tries to depict you to be. Be happy about you and about life. Life was given to us to learn, express, help, enjoy and live. If your life is always stressful, unenjoyable and miserable, you are focusing on the wrong things. Then, you 've disrespected the life given to you and the purpose for your creation.



## Daily Juice~16164

Don't look down on yourself! The strength of your personality follows the strength of your thinking, and do not look at yourself with an inferior look. Do not give yourself the feeling that you are not special. On the contrary, see yourself as a special, distinct personality.

We lock our rooms. We lock our offices. We lock our cars. But some of us leave the door of our minds open to all sort of trash to get in! We allow our minds to be filled with negative words; the words we hear, the words we read, and the words we speak to ourselves! They are toxic. It's time to detoxify your mind. 

Stand guard at the door of your mind 24/7. Your mind is the door to your heart. Choose what gets in and what stays out. Remember, your mind is a thought factory. It produces based on the raw materials you feed it. If you put in garbage, you get garbage. So, fill your mind with great words, so your thoughts will create the reality that you want to see in your life!



## Daily Juice~16177

You may not have been where you pictured yourself a year back. But you have travelled far from where you were back then. You aren't the same person you used to be. You are improving. Let that continue in the next year and the year after that. It is an ongoing process that needs no rushing.


Pick up the pieces, dust yourself off, and keep going. You're a champion! Be excited for the things you can do to make your life even better.

You're the captain of your ship and the prophet of your life. The sea of life responds to your thoughts and words. Consider this: Our sense of control is influenced by our inner state, not external circumstances. Don't get caught up in the waves. Focus on mastering your navigation skills!



## Daily Juice~16192

Having a kind heart in a cruel world does not mean weakness, it shows courage. Don't allow what your eyes see change what your heart believes. Stop attributing your problems to other people and your environment. The environment is not the limit, your belief system is. You don't need to blow off another's candle, for it won't make yours shine brighter. Don't feel unimportant and insecure when someone else does something remarkable.

There's something unique only you can do, do it and make the world a better place! There's a beautiful world inside of you. Look inward and superimpose that world into your world with the You in you.



## Daily Juice~16203

Don't let people or circumstances undermine your ability to achieve your dreams. 

You were born to win and it's true. We all know that a great start does not guarantee a great finish. And how many people have a rough start in life, only to triumph against all odds? See, the truth is, it doesn’t matter where a person starts, it’s what they do with it that determines where and how they end up. There were some that started out strong but they allowed one thing or the other fizzle them out. Don't fizzle out.

Don't allow circumstances or people put out your candle. There's more inside you and you are responsible for fanning the emblems of God's fire inside you. Be afire for Him. Stir the emblems within you all the time.



## Daily Juice~16219

Anything that would change your life would have to begin from your heart. It's not outside you, stop running around. Life will only change when you become more committed to your dreams than to your comfort zone. You can imprison a man but not an idea.

Believe in something larger than yourself; dig within. Within you is the wellspring of good and greatness; and it's always ready to bubble up, if you'd just dig. You don't drown by falling in the water, you drown by staying there. Be disciplined to do what you must do and what you must not do. There are thousands of excuses for failure but never a good reason.

Don't make this season a period of feeding on fears and irrelevant things, rather feed on God's word because if the word gets into you, it becomes a God and a force in you that gives your life divine direction!



## Daily Juice~16254

It's the season of joy and celebration, yet for some, the festivities are shadowed by struggles and hardships. This Christmas, as we revel in the blessings around us, let's remember those who lack the means to partake in the merriment.

There are many who can't afford a decent meal or basic necessities during this special time. Let's heed the call to seek out these individuals and extend a helping hand. Bringing joy to someone's life can truly embody the spirit of the season.

May this Christmas be a reminder of God's love residing in our hearts, inspiring us to emulate His kindness and generosity. As we celebrate the birth of Christ, let us shine forth His love by uplifting those in need.

Wishing you a Merry Christmas filled with the joy of giving and a celebration that reflects the greatness of His love within you!



## Daily Juice~16264

In 2009, Brian Acton wanted to apply for a job at Facebook but was turned down. A few months later, he and a friend created WhatsApp, which Facebook bought from them in 2014 for $19 billion. Let your value increase as the years roll by!

You are the CEO of your life; get involved in your destiny. Engineer your life to go in the direction of divine purpose. You are either changing the circumstances of your life and your world or the circumstances in your world are changing you! 

People with purpose and goals have no time for drama. They are too busy adding value to their lives and to the lives of others around them. Don't have an expired mind; every next level of your life will demand a better version of you. 

You have been blessed with being everything that God has destined you to be. And as you experience the joy of fulfilling your purpose, you will benefit, others will benefit, and the world will be blessed.



## Daily Juice~16271

Certainly, one of the distinquishing characteristics between human beings and animals is the ability to use words- to speak. This gives us creative power like God. God spoke the universe into existence. We can speak circumstances into existence by our words.

Life has no middle ground. Every word you speak either releases life or death; there's no middle ground. A person who has no control over his tongue is headed for destruction. You can tell what you really believe by the words you speak. You may think your words don't matter much, but they do.

Most people say what they have and they continue to have more of such situations. If you realize you don't really like the circumstances of your life, don't just change your words, change your heart and your words will follow suit. Words are the guage of your heart.



## Daily Juice~16280

Your heart walk with God matters more to Him than your work or accomplishments for Him. Accomplishment does not equal success; popularity does not mean success. Success before men does not mean success before God.

God is more interested in your spiritual state than in all your accomplishments. Do you think you have accomplished so much in life that you are more special than others because of your accomplishments. Because of that, you are failing to see other's worth and importance. You only act based on what you think, because your opinion is the only one that matters to you. You barely admit mistakes; hence, you are depriving yourself of the opportunity to grow because you believe that you got everything you need. You are tarnishing your relationship with others by alienating them with your attitude. Ultimately, you are missing a whole lot in life.



## Daily Juice~16288

Don't provide a reaction to irrelevant things. God created us with emotions. Emotions were created to be good and we are to enjoy these emotions. They're one of the spices of life. At the same time, even though emotions are intended to be good and God gave them to us to be enjoyed, many people find their emotions out of control. Instead of controlling their emotions, their emotions are controlling them. 

Though emotions were intended to be a positive thing, they can also be the very thing that drive people into all kinds of problems. You control your emotions. You do not have to explode with anger whenever someone else decides to behave in an angry or vindictive way. Some have lost great opportunities out of anger.



## Daily Juice~16325

Always remember that you are a masterpiece in progress, and God never leaves any project unfinished. The potential for success lies within you.

Don't settle for your current state in life because it's just a temporary phase. How you perceive life not only influences your actions but also shapes your decisions. Remember, there's so much more to the future. Life is not just about today; there's a brighter tomorrow waiting for you. What you do today will impact your tomorrow.

Don't lose faith in the ability of God in you to put you over and above every situation, because there is a special place for you in this world. While others may play a part in your success, ultimately, you are responsible for your own journey. It's not about what others are doing; it's about what you choose to do.

Wishing you a Happy New Year filled with opportunities, growth, and success!



## Daily Juice~16344

How this year will turn out is what you make of it. Purposely challenge yourself; real living truly begins at the end of your comfort zone. Be intentional about your life. 

Progress isn't accidental, it is not possible without a change, and those who cannot change their way of thinking cannot change their lives.

The life you have now is the result of your past choices and actions. You can change at anytime. Newness starts within you - in your intentions, vision, and actions.

When you evolve out of old ways of thinking, talking and living, you bring revolution to your life and the lives of those around you. Then it truly becomes a new year!



## Daily Juice~16350

Your past doesn't dictate your future in the eyes of God; He doesn't consult your past to determine your future. You are not defined by your failures; they are events, not your identity. Just because something eluded you last year doesn't mean it's beyond your reach this year.

Reject the notion of embodying your mistakes and branding yourself as a "failure." Instead, use these experiences as stepping stones, placing them beneath your feet to elevate yourself. Your worth and God's love remain constant; they don't diminish due to mistakes that you make. You are not defined by them.

Embrace these truths and release the negativity from people and thoughts that weigh you down. Don't let mistakes overshadow the innate beauty within you. Strive to surpass your past self; aim to be better than you were last year.



## Daily Juice~16362

Prioritize your time and avoid living according to someone else's expectations. Reject the constraints of conventional thinking, as it reflects the ideas of others. Do not let the opinions of others overshadow your inner voice. The transformation between different phases of life is simply a matter of learning and growth.

Just as the only way to access premium TV content from the comfort of your home is by subscribing to a paid TV service, similarly, the only way to elevate your level of success permanently is by subscribing to and continually upgrading your thought patterns. However, the decision to change ultimately rests with you.



## Daily Juice~16382

Events come and go, yet their imprints linger in our minds. However, it's within our control to release their hold over us. Refusing to dwell on past situations allows them to pass, granting us the freedom to move forward. Unbeknownst to many, a silent battle rages for dominance over our minds.

The path of success and happiness lie within our mindset. Our thoughts and their patterns wield immense influence over the quality of our lives.



## Daily Juice~16436

Your transformation doesn't demand a new year; it demands a new mindset. 

The power to start anew lies not in waiting for a new year, but in adopting a new mindset. By transforming our mindset, we can change the trajectory of our lives and unlock our full potential. This shift allows us to break free from limiting beliefs and embrace a path of continuous improvement, progress and success. It's a journey that requires courage, resilience, and a commitment to nurturing our inner growth. As we embark on this journey, we discover the immense power that lies within us to shape our own destiny and live authentically.

What you give yourself to this year will show up as your experience sooner than later. Priotize God's Word; expose yourself to God's Word much more than ever before. This intentional act will not only shape your thinking pattern, it'll also guide your thoughts and actions, and will give you a divine thinking pattern.



## Daily Juice~16450

In a world filled with the goodness of God, it's important to keep our focus on the positive aspects of life. It's easy to get caught up in negativity, but by shifting our perspective, we can uncover the abundant blessings that surround us.

It's crucial not to lose sight of the good things that life has to offer. Instead of allowing ourselves to be consumed by negativity, we should actively seek out and appreciate the beauty and joy that exists in the world, which is a testament to the grace of God.

Let us therefore endeavour to cherish the goodness that the earth offers, recognizing it as a manifestation of God's benevolence. By doing so, we cultivate a spirit that thrives on gratitude, allowing the magnificence of existence to illuminate our paths.



## Daily Juice~16456

Those who make excuses don't make progress. Your future is being created by what you're doing. You are unique and different from everyone, stop comparing yourself with others. Your path is different, and you were given this life because you are strong enough to live it. Don't lose hope! You are stronger than whatever you are facing right now! 

The power behind taking responsibility for your actions lies in putting an end to negative thought patterns. Don't dwell on what went wrong or focus on whom to blame; never sacrifice who you are for what you want. 

Don't waste time building roadblocks to your success; yesterday doesn’t define you, but let it prepare you for what is ahead. Your life is what you make of it! You can't think like a slave and live like a king.



## Daily Juice~16463

You can't make this year better with ignorance. Ignorance doesn't give you anything good but takes everything good away from you. Every situation encompasses three dimensions: Your perspective, others' perspectives, and the Truth. Success often aligns with those who prioritize the Truth. Align with the Truth! 

Avoid investing your valuable time in relationships that don't contribute to your personal growth. Surround yourself with individuals who foster your inspiration and aspirations.



## Daily Juice~16471

To shape a successful future, it is essential to take action in the present. The future is not a standalone entity; it is built upon the foundation of the present. Trust that if God has placed a dream in your heart, you already possess the necessary tools to realize it.

Tolerating undesirable circumstances only prolongs their existence. Focus on the life ahead of you rather than dwelling on the past. Forge new paths and be a pioneer in your own journey. Instead of fixating on past events, concentrate on propelling yourself forward.



## Daily Juice~16561

In the journey of life, it's crucial to close certain doors not out of pride, incapacity, or arrogance, but because they no longer align with your path. The most significant relationships you'll cultivate are with God and yourself. By embracing these connections, you'll gain insight into how to authentically relate to others.

Understanding your unique personality is paramount; it holds the key to your success. Your personal success story begins from within – you're inherently engineered for success from the moment you're born. Remember, failure isn't a divine gift; it results from the decisions, actions, or inactions we choose.



## Daily Juice~16570

Every day count; embrace a mindset of action and determination. In life, we are judged by what we finish, not what we start. Every accomplishment begins with the decision to start. Indecision is the thief of opportunity. Therefore, it's crucial to determine your priorities and focus on them, as your focus ultimately determines your reality.

Inside each of us lies a force greater than any obstacle. It's the choices we make, not our circumstances, that determine our success. Instead of wishing, it's time to start doing and constantly challenge yourself.

Remember, if you're not willing to learn, no one can help you. However, if you are open to learning, no one can stop you. Your attitude plays a more significant role than your aptitude in determining your altitude in life.



## Daily Juice~16578

Avoid engaging in trivial or unnecessary conflicts. You are capable of so much more than that. Your strength surpasses such trivial battles. True victory isn't just about winning fights and arguments; you were born inherently victorious. Winning a fight does not define your worth; you are genuinely valuable.

Do not fear losing the approval of others. Instead, fear losing your own identity by constantly seeking validation. If someone treats you as expendable, prioritize your own well-being and leave a lasting impression through the way you live your life.



## Daily Juice~16589

In a world where titles and positions often define individuals, it remains crucial to acknowledge that every person, regardless of their status, is entitled to respect. Whether a person has a title, position or none of the above; everyone on this planet deserves respect. 

Having a compassionate heart in a world that can be unkind is courage, not weakness. Do not let the harsh realities you witness alter the compassionate virtues in your heart.



## Daily Juice~16606

Never underestimate the power you have to take your life to a new and better direction. Take charge of your life. You are responsible for your life and your ultimate success depends more on the choices you make.

Stop attributing your problems to other people and your environment. Those are not your limit, your belief system is.



## Daily Juice~16649

Don't simply exist in this world to maintain ecological balance or fit into societal norms. Instead, be the kind that adds value to every space and life you encounter; a positive force wherever you go and in everything you do, you are enriching the lives and spaces around you.

Within you lies a beautiful world waiting to be explored. Take the time to look inward and bring that inner world to life by superimposing that world into your physical world with the You in you!



## Daily Juice~16668

God created you to experience joy and the good life. If you are not feeling fulfilled and content, you may not be living in alignment with your purpose. He desires for you to live a life filled with happiness, soundness, and prosperity, as it brings joy to Him.

It's important to prioritize your focus and not waste time on unimportant matters. Where you direct your attention, you also allocate your time, and ultimately, your life.



## Daily Juice~16677

Embrace the growth that comes with outgrowing those who didn't grow with you. Don't settle for being just one of many; strive to be one in a million. Dare to become the person nobody expected you to be. You are not small; you are a universe in ecstatic motion, and within you resides a greatness that surpasses this world.

At times, your success and progress may be impeded not because of your own negative thoughts, but due to the negative words spoken over you by others, which you've come to believe. Don't passively accept these words; refuse to let them define you. Take an active role in your life. Counteract the negativity with faith-filled words from God's Word. Remember, you hold the power to shape your life because you are the prophet and architect of your life.



## Daily Juice~16687

Do not allow challenges to define you; instead, let them refine you. Choose to embrace joy, gratitude, and expectancy as you look towards a prosperous future. Our focus determines our reality, so it is important to reflect on what we identify with and where we direct our attention.

Avoid relying on others for your happiness and resist the urge to compare yourself to them. Each person's journey is unique, so it is essential to understand and embrace your own path. You are the creator of your life, not influenced by others or external circumstances. Remember that it is not the weight of your challenges that is the issue, but rather how you carry them. Take ownership of your happiness and stop giving others the power to dictate your emotions and self-worth.



## Daily Juice~16695

Many people speak without considering the impact of their words, and then wonder why certain things are happening or not happening in their lives. According to the scriptures, everything in the universe adjusts itself to accommodate our words, whether they are positive or negative, intentional or careless.

You possess a unique gift that you can offer to the world. You are an embodiment of opportunities. Instead of waiting for life to happen to you, take control and elevate yourself to the next level by using the power of your words to make things happen.



## Daily Juice~16741

Do you find yourself feeling insecure or sad as you constantly compare your life to others? It's a common struggle for many, but don't let that be your story. It's important to remember that you are not meant to compete with anyone else. You have been uniquely created and gifted by God to fulfill your own purpose. Your race in life is not against others. 

Instead of getting caught up in comparisons, focus on embracing who you are and the path you are meant to walk. God has given you the grace to be true to yourself and to follow the calling placed upon your life. Rather than allowing comparison to steal your joy, recognize that the world is full of beauty, including the unique qualities that make you who you are. God has given you words as tools for change; words are the tools of authority. Your words are just as valuable as your status, your words would work on the issues in your life.



## Daily Juice~16755

When life gives  you a hundred reasons to cry, show life that you have a thousand and one reasons to smile and be joyful! Never let life's circumstances and people define who you are. 

Their perspective of you belongs to them. Everyone will see you differently, you don’t have to break yourself in any direction to try and appease others. Your expressions, feelings, emotions, the way you talk, and everything else makes you— YOU. Be who who God has made you to be, nothing less.

You cannot live a happy life with sad thoughts. Don't allow someone else's joy make you sad.That someone else is succeeding doesn't mean you're failing! Never find your delight in another's misfortune. Stop thinking about your problems and start appreciating all the blessings in your life that you take for granted.



## Daily Juice~16766

The key to a transformed life lies in the power of your mind. True wealth is not measured by the contents of your bank account, but by the richness of your thoughts and what you choose to invest in mentally.

What you focus your mind on will shape your reality. The perspective from within holds more influence than the external world. Your perception is a reflection of your mindset; as you think, so you become.

Your thought patterns are the cornerstone of your success or failure, not the external circumstances. You have authority over your mind; it does not control you. By directing your thoughts, you shape your expectations and ultimately, your experiences.



## Daily Juice~16780

We have a responsibility to support and uplift others, guiding them along their path. However, it's important to recognize that we are not responsible for the choices they make. We cannot force a positive attitude upon someone who chooses to dwell in negativity and self-pity.

If we constantly pour our energy into trying to encourage others, coaxing them to make better choices, and keeping their spirits up, we risk depleting ourselves. It's not our duty to ensure the happiness of others is constantly maintained; that responsibility lies with them.

It's crucial to set boundaries and not allow others' negative attitudes to drag us down. We can offer support and guidance, but ultimately, each person is responsible for their own well-being. Focusing too much on others' happiness can leave us feeling unfulfilled. It's important to strike a balance and prioritize our own well-being while still being there for others in a healthy way.



## Daily Juice~16805

In the realm of spiritual activities on behalf of humanity, the presence words is an essential requirement. It serves as the conduit through which spirits can operate to positively impact human lives. Without the Word, no spirit is permitted to engage in this noble task.

One of the most exquisite gifts bestowed upon humanity by God is the gift of words. The ability to articulate thoughts and emotions through speech is a unique and powerful capability. It is through words that we express our innermost feelings and convey our intentions to the world around us.

The words that we speak shape our lives in profound ways. Our life's trajectory is often a direct reflection of the words that emanate from our mouths. Every word spoken contributes to the overall narrative of our existence.



## Daily Juice~16862

Stop searching for reasons to dwell in unhappiness. Instead, open your eyes to the abundance of things to be thankful for. Whether it's the blessings you have received or the challenges you have overcome, a grateful heart acts as a magnet for more miracles.

Happiness isn't determined by your circumstances, but by your attitude. Choose to reject worry and anxiety, no matter what life throws your way. Worrying only poisons the soul and hinders personal growth.

While not every day may meet your expectations, there is always something worth celebrating. Take time to recognize the goodness in each day, no matter how small it may seem.

Live a life so full of gratitude and praises to God that even the forces of negativity can't help but take notice that you are not yielding ground or giving in to worry.



## Daily Juice~16882

Avoid toxic people who can poison your heart. Surround yourself with positive influences and avoid fault finders, critics, and busybodies who only seek to gossip and judge others. Such negative company can hinder you from reaching your full potential and fulfilling your destiny. Remember, if they talk about others behind their backs, they will likely do the same to you.

God does not support those who spread rumors, gossip, or sow discord. If you have an issue with someone, approach them with love and honesty instead of talking behind their back. It's okay to disagree or not understand everything, but spreading rumors and gossiping is never the solution. Choose to uplift and support others rather than tearing them down with hurtful words.



## Daily Juice~16898

Despite your best efforts, there will be times when people may hurt you. It's important to recognize that hurting people often end up hurting others as well. Rather than allowing yourself to be defined by the opinions of others, focus on living according to God's purpose for your life.

Don't let the expectations of those around you dictate your actions. Instead, prioritize living into alignment with your true calling. Remember that the only opinion that truly matters is that of the one who created you – God.

Avoid living a life that lacks meaning and purpose. Refrain from investing your time and energy into pursuits that do not align with your values. Instead, strive to live a life that is dedicated to pleasing the Lord Jesus Christ and achieving success in His eyes.



## Daily Juice~16928

Today can mark the beginning of a new chapter in your life. It's a gift, yours to shape as you see fit. 

You hold the power to either squander it or wield it for good. What you choose to do with this day matters; it's an investment in your future. Tomorrow, this day will be but a memory. Make sure it's a memory you're proud to leave behind.



## Daily Juice~16941

We all come from diverse backgrounds and have unique life experiences that shape our interactions with others. It is important not to let these differences divide us. One common enemy we all need to guard against is pride. When a person is consumed by pride, they set their own standards and belittle others, but their eventual downfall can be significant. Remember, the ability to articulate thoughts does not equate to intelligence; people express themselves differently.

Furthermore, eloquence does not determine one's spirituality. True spirituality is reflected in walking in love and forgiveness. Resist the temptation to harbour feelings of resentment and bitterness instigated by others. Embrace a mindset of compassion and understanding, and let go of negativity.



## Daily Juice~16975

Regardless of how bleak your current situation may seem, there is always room for growth and transformation. Adopting a mindset scripted from God's Word and faith in the face of adversity allows you to envision a brighter future for yourself.

You are not defined by your circumstances; you are defined by your response to them. Embrace God's power within you to rise above any challenge and create the life you truly deserve. Refuse to settle for anything less than your best, and watch as God's ability in you unfolds before your eyes. Remember, you are capable of achieving greatness – it's time to believe it and make it happen.



## Daily Juice~16989

Take a moment to bask in your awesomeness - yes, you! You were intricately crafted with all of God's divine skills. Don't let external circumstances or others' words dim your light. Refuse to tether your happiness to the fickle opinions of others.

You possess qualities that naturally draw love and affection towards you. Remember, someone who dislikes you likely does so out of ignorance. Don't harbor resentment towards them. Instead, recognize that their lack of fondness stems from not truly knowing you.

The key is to stay true to yourself and radiate the love that makes you inherently lovable. Trust that those who take the time to understand you will appreciate the wonderful person you are.



## Daily Juice~17000

Don't just be occupied with continuing the status quo that you miss opportunities that will change your life. Anything that keeps you from growing is not worth defending. Fear of failure becomes fear of success for those who never try anything new. The qualities of creativity and genius are within you, awaiting your decision to match up with the power of action. 

Every thought that you have impacts you. By shifting in the middle of a weakening thought to one that strengthens, you raise your energy vibration and strengthen yourself, and it influences everything around you.



## Daily Juice~17021

Avoid opening the door to negativity in your life. Giving generously will not replace what you've lost due to disobedience. Regardless of your achievements, never disregard God's Word or consider yourself above correction. The validity of a thought or action should not be based on emotions.

Don't let differences of opinion lead to division or anger. Pride is a toxic force that can cloud your judgment. Eliminate pride before it ruins your life. Allow God's Word to guide your decisions, not your personal desires. You are cherished by God, unique, and exceptional! Why tarnish your mind with pride, jealousy, envy, or gossip? Remember, you are royalty and a product of Love.

Avoid speaking negatively about others or fostering animosity towards them. Refrain from inciting hatred; instead, promote love and unity. Let positivity and kindness be the essence of your interactions with others.



## Daily Juice~17032

Don't let lack of recognition deter you from giving your best. Remember, one person who genuinely cares about you is worth more than a crowd of insincere individuals.

Oftentimes, the most ordinary things can become extraordinary when shared with the right person.



## Daily Juice~17076

Never regret showing kindness to those who may not appreciate it. Your actions reflect your character, while theirs reveal their true nature. To truly understand someone's essence, observe how they treat those beneath them, not just their equals.

It is essential to believe in the strength of goodness over evil. Goodness is not synonymous with weakness; in fact, it holds far more power. Many individuals fear evil rather than honour goodness, but this imbalance does not diminish the inherent strength of good.

Remember, good triumphs over evil. It is greater, stronger, and more potent in its influence. Trust in the enduring power of goodness to prevail in any situation.



## Daily Juice~17089

The battles that really matter aren't the ones fought for money or fame. It's the battles within ourselves, the conflicts we face deep inside, that truly shape us. No matter who you are today, remember that you always have the power to change and grow for the better.

If you want to have kind, loving, confident, and generous people in your life, you can't expect that if you're thinking and acting in cruel, weak, and selfish ways. You attract what you put out into the world, so be the kind of person you want to have around.

Sometimes, we push away the people who were meant to help us on our journey. It's important to build positive relationships with others. We're all in this together, not in competition with one another. Treat people with respect and courtesy. The way someone treats and speaks to others says a lot about their character.

Changing your life starts with changing your daily routine. The power lies in the habits you cultivate. Motivation can give you a kickstart, but it's the habits that keep you going. Your life is a reflection of your habits.

It's important to recognize that who you are and how successful you become is a direct result of your habits. They shape your beliefs, personality, and ultimately, your outcomes. So, it's time to let go of old, limiting habits and replace them with new, empowering ones.

Remember, old habits won't open new opportunities. Start small with an incredible new habit that's so easy, you can't say no to it. Gradually increase your habit in small ways because success is built on simple disciplines practiced every day. On the other hand, failure stems from repeated indiscipline.

As you journey towards progress, it is essential to identify and address the obstacles that hinder your development. Avoid the temptation of indulging in gossip and steer clear of individuals who thrive on discussing the lives of others.

Beliefs are not just idle thoughts in the mind; they have the power to shape our entire existence. Often rooted in our upbringing and life experiences, our beliefs dictate the choices we make and the paths we take in life. They serve as the invisible boundaries that define our potential for growth.

However, it is possible to break free from limiting beliefs by reprogramming our minds with the truths found in God's Word. By aligning our beliefs with divine wisdom, we can transform our circumstances and unlock new possibilities. When we change our beliefs, our actions naturally follow suit, guided by a fresh perspective and renewed mindset.

Never try to force your way into someone's life; if they truly valued you, they would make space for you. Remember, you are here for a reason - the universe has a purpose for you. Embrace the sense of destiny in your life.

The most important relationships you can cultivate are with God and yourself. Don't fear losing others; instead, fear losing yourself in the pursuit of pleasing everyone around you. Authenticity is key - if you can't be true to yourself, you lose your essence.

Some people lead artificial lives, losing themselves in the process of trying to be someone they're not. Embrace your uniqueness; there is nothing more captivating than being yourself. If you constantly seek to be someone else, you'll never truly understand your own potential and individuality.



## Daily Juice~17193

No matter what challenges come your way, remember that you have the power to choose how you respond, regardless of your emotions. By minimizing interactions with negative individuals, you can cultivate a sense of peace in your life. Learning to discern what to ignore and where to direct your attention can greatly enhance your enjoyment of life.

It is important to starve distractions and nourish your focus. When you prioritize what truly matters to you, life becomes more vibrant and fulfilling. Your focus shapes your reality, so it is essential to channel your energy towards what aligns with God's destiny for you.



## Daily Juice~17207

In life, transformation isn't random; it's driven by intentional actions rooted in truths. Your journey towards improvement isn't a gamble; it's a deliberate alignment of your emotions with your purpose, guided by the wisdom of God's word.

Emotional decisions can be limiting, hindering your progress. To break free from this constraint, challenge yourself purposefully. What may seem daunting to others might be your key to growth. Have the self-respect to step away from anything that hinders your progress, even if it once served you.

Evaluate your circle of influence: if it doesn't inspire you, it's not a circle—it's a confinement. Surround yourself with those who uplift and motivate you, for greatness thrives in an environment of support and encouragement.



## Daily Juice~17224

You can't deposit excuses everywhere and expect to live a great life. Scrolling through social media isn't free, it costs your focus. Remember, hidden costs always exist. You are the painter of your own mood. Your days are only as grey as you allow them to be. Happiness is an inside job. Don't assign anyone else that much power over your life.

Happiness doesn't depend on any external conditions, it is governed by our mental attitude. If you put negative thoughts into your mind, you're going to get negative results. It's just as true that if you put positive thoughts in your mind, you will be a recipient of positive results.



## Daily Juice~17242

Welcome to a brand new month! It's time to fuel the passion God has placed inside you. No challenge is too big for you to conquer. No matter what life throws your way, remember, you have the power to overcome it. But it all starts with taking responsibility. The choice is always yours.

Life may try to distract you, but it's up to you to stay focused! Many people stumble because they lose focus. No matter how you feel, you're in control of your actions. True maturity is realizing that where you are today is a result of the choices you made in the past.

It's time to take charge of your life. Align your thoughts, words, and actions with your destiny. Own your journey, and embrace the discipline needed to fulfill your purpose.



## Daily Juice~17322

As you go through life, you might need to change who you spend time with. Not everyone around you wants to see you do well. It's not about having lots of friends, it's about having good friends. What do you want from life? Some people can bring you down.

Be careful about who you are friends with. Spend time with those who encourage you and help you be your best. Stay away from those who are jealous, make fun of you, or put you down. Sometimes you need to let go of certain friends to move forward.

If you're with chickens, you'll act like a chicken. But if you're with eagles, you'll soar. You choose your friends, so choose wisely!



## Daily Juice~17342

Some individuals may enter your sphere only to steer you off course, veering your trajectory downward. Exercise discernment in your friendships. Surround yourself with those who ignite your potential and enrich your existence. Conversely, distance yourself from those who harbor envy, belittle your aspirations, or undermine your progress. Sometimes, to truly make an impact and stride forward, you must bid farewell to certain connections.

Remember, your circle shapes your perspective and aspirations. If you linger among those who limit their ambitions, you risk adopting their mindset. Conversely, aligning with individuals who soar high encourages you to elevate yourself.

Friendship is a conscious choice, not an obligation. The power to cultivate meaningful connections lies within your grasp. Choose wisely, for your companions can either weigh you down or propel you towards greatness.



## Daily Juice~17358

When God gazes upon you, He perceives qualities that others may overlook or dismiss. Embrace a lighter perspective, infuse more laughter into your days, and resist the urge to become overly consumed by trivial matters. Deep within you lies a reservoir of untapped potential, equipping you with the strength to seize life's opportunities and fulfill your aspirations.

Do not passively await the unfolding of events; instead, empower yourself to shape your own narrative through the alignment of your words with decisive actions. Release the burden of comparison and cease longing to resemble others or seeking approval akin to that bestowed upon someone else. Such comparisons only breed discontentment, particularly with oneself.



## Daily Juice~17370

Reject any external attempts to define your existence if they diverge from the divine blueprint set forth by God; instead, script your identity in accordance with His timeless truths. 

The narrative of your life is a tale that must be penned by your own hand, guided by the affirmations you speak into existence. Stand firm in the face of life's trials, for even the most formidable challenges will ultimately yield to the unwavering resolve of your destiny.



## Daily Juice~17425

Pointing fingers at circumstances or others when faced with challenges or setbacks is like falling for a deceitful tale. The truth is, your destiny is not in the hands of others but in yours and in God's. Once you grasp this truth, a new chapter of life unfolds before you. 

Don't squander your precious time laying blame on someone for the hurdles in your path. Regardless of past wrongs or injustices, if you take charge of your life, God promises to restore what was lost. He will replenish those years with abundance beyond measure.



## Daily Juice~17500

Nobody ever got rich by saying "amen" without creating value.  Saying "amen" without creating value is like standing still in a world that is constantly moving forward. It is important to remember that true success comes from the value we bring to the table. Money follows the exchange of value. God blesses the works of our hands not the numbers of our amen! 

It is only through actively creating value, whether it be through innovative ideas, smart work or genuine contributions, that we can truly prosper. The pursuit of value is not just a means to an end; it is a way of life that drives us to constantly improve and innovate. By focusing on creating value, we not only enrich our own lives but also uplift those around us, leaving a positive impact on the world. 

Say "amen" to the power of creating value, let your actions speak louder than words and watch as your success grow beyond your wildest dreams.



## Daily Juice~17518

You can control your choices, but you cannot control the outcome of your choices. Whether you succeed or fail doesn't depend on others as much as it depends on you! 

The ability to be successful and joyful starts with your attitude. Never be fearful of the future. You are the one who carries the touch of Light for yourself and many others. Think and feel blessed and loved, it'll create and attract an aura of blessings around you! 

To think you will fail is a misconception. Release and detach yourself from every person, every circumstance, every condition, and every situation that no longer serves a divine purpose in your life. Life is in phases and seasons, and certain phases and seasons must come to an end. Don't force to stay a season or phase that should go. You can create a new season, filled with purposeful thoughts and divine activities.



## Daily Juice~17540

When the past is mixed into the present, it prevents you from experiencing the happiness the present offers. Focus your attention on that which is good in the present. Enjoy your life and enjoy everything God has given you. Never make your happiness or success dependent on an attachment to any person, place or thing. 

Nobody knows what it takes to be you. Be who God wants you to be, not who the world wants you to be. Your beauty is in your uniqueness! The best project you'll ever work on is you. 

However, those whom you associate with matters to God, and that's why He gave the instruction in His Word, "Evil communication corrupts good manners." Surround yourself with people who talk about visions and ideas, not about other people.



## Daily Juice~17551

In a world where choices abound, it's crucial to recognize your worth and assert your boundaries. When faced with individuals who view you merely as an option, it's empowering to step back and remove yourself from the equation. This isn't about pride—it's about self-respect. Refusing to give part-time people a full-time role in your life is a declaration of your value.

Central to this mindset is understanding your worth and refusing to settle for anything less than you deserve. Let them misunderstand you; let them gossip. Their perceptions do not define your reality. Instead, ground yourself in the truth of God's Word, finding strength in your authenticity and commitment to love.

Regardless of others' actions or words, never doubt your worth or the significance of your purpose. Remember, your truth is not dictated by external opinions but by your faith and convictions. Stay true to yourself, remain steadfast in love, and embrace the joy and freedom that come from honoring your authenticity.



## Daily Juice~17563

Avoid the trap of broadcasting your challenges to everyone. Instead, harness the power of selective disclosure. Engage with those who can offer meaningful support and guidance. Broadcasting your struggles to the wrong audience may only attract sarcasm and pity, further perpetuating feelings of defeat.

Do not allow life's challenges to define who you are. While facing challenges is a natural part of life and can lead to personal growth, succumbing to defeat is a choice. Continuously discussing your challenges with others only serves to reinforce their presence in your life, positioning you as a victim and hindering your ability to move forward.



## Daily Juice~17632

The success of a man is not a matter of chance; it is a result of deliberate effort and focus. Your life is shaped by the influences you allow in, particularly the training you provide for your spirit, mind and body.

The training of your spirit holds significant importance in this journey. By immersing yourself in God's Word, it'll teach you how to think and what to think, then you'll understand the connection between your outer experiences and your inner thoughts. Then you can gain clarity on your purpose and thoughts.



## Daily Juice~17646

Take charge of your mental faculties by directing your thoughts with intention. Your mind is a tool that you wield, not a force that controls you. Transform your relationship with your thoughts by assuming the role of the "thinker" rather than being consumed by individual thoughts. 

Harness the power of your words to steer your thoughts. You're in control of your mind; it doesn't dictate you. Cultivate a mindful relationship with your thoughts, recognizing yourself as the master of your mental realm. Empower yourself to dictate what your thoughts dwell upon, thereby claiming authority over your own narrative.



## Daily Juice~17673

You can rise up from anything. You can completely recreate yourself. You can think new thoughts. You can learn something new. You can create new habits. Leading your own education and rebrand yourself. All that matter is that you decide today and never look back. 

There's a 100% returns of dividends for investing in yourself and you become a better blessing to others. It may be a slow process, but quitting won't speed it up! You are your greatest investment. Raise your commitment level to your growth and to your future. At the end, it is you versus you.



## Daily Juice~17685

If you live without purpose, you may find yourself drifting aimlessly through life, shaped by external circumstances rather than intentional choices. Remember, comparing your beginning to someone else's middle or end is unfair to your unique journey. You are a divine creation, God's masterpiece.

Embrace the sense of destiny woven into your existence, for you are a manifestation of God's vision and purpose. Know that you are cherished by Him, and the sacrifice He made for you underscores your immeasurable value. Only by pushing yourself beyond your limits can you uncover the depths of your potential.



## Daily Juice~17717

You lay a foundation for your change and success through your prayer life. A prayer that does not affect you cannot effect a change in a situation. Whatever will change your life will have to come from your heart. The longevity of your prayer is not as important as your consistency at it. 

Give yourself that discipline. Kill laziness before it destroys your life. If God can get your attention, you'll experience glorious changes in your life.



## Daily Juice~17806

Embrace the power within you to define your own happiness. Your worth is immeasurable, and no external factor should dictate your joy. You hold the key to your own contentment, regardless of the circumstances that may challenge you. True happiness resides within your spirit, waiting to be unlocked by the accurate knowledge of God's Word and acceptance.

Refuse to rely on others or material possessions for fulfillment. Placing your happiness in external sources only serves to enslave you to their whims. Instead, liberate yourself by discovering the boundless joy that resides within your own being.

Choose to prioritize your own well-being and recognize the incredible strength that lies within you. By cultivating a deep sense of love and appreciation, you can create a life filled with genuine happiness and fulfillment. Trust what God has deposited in your spirit to guide you towards a life that is truly and authentically joyful.



## Daily Juice~17820

Big things can only come from the small things you start. Switch your mentality; realize the role your thought is playing in your present situation. Break patterns of self defeating thoughts. The events of your past do not reduce your potentials. 

How someone has treated you or what someone has said about you does not change your ability. In your life, God may have done wonders in the past, but you haven't seen anything yet. The best is yet to come! Your best days are not behind you, they are in front of you! 

There's so much glory and beauty inside you. Don't allow your life to become obsolete and dull. God planted His seeds of greatness inside you; refuse to make little plans for your life because of present circumstances. Keep dreaming, keep stretching yourself, planning for new projects, experiences and greater adventures with God. You were never created to reach a certain level and then stop.



## Daily Juice~17835

Keep your life in the right perspective. Every one of us has something even right now to be happy about: our health, our jobs, our businesses, our families, a previous miracle or an opportunity. Don't manufacture unhappiness; if you complain, you'll remain, but a grateful heart is a happy heart and a magnet for a miracle. 

Happiness and unhappiness is based on perspective. Be cognizant of the fact that the more you attach your value to those things outside yourself, the more you give those things the power to control you. No one can depress you. No one can make you anxious. No one can hurt your feelings other than what you allow inside. Monitor your inner dialogue and match your thoughts and words to what you intend to achieve.



## Daily Juice~17852

Most people are often bothered by what others think about them. Of course, the Lord didn't create us to be rejected. Therefore, no one likes to be rejected. We all want to be accepted, but what someone else thinks about you shouldn't determine what you think about yourself! 

What other people think about us is not the important thing; it's what we think about ourselves that control us. God's acceptance of you should matter more to you than the acceptance of men.



## Daily Juice~17865

Health is not only addressing the issue of what you're eating, but also what's eating you up. It is also what you're thinking and saying. Your body is 70% water and it responds to the energy of words. Don't deform the water crystals in your body with negative thoughts and words. The Word of God is medicine for your body. 

The key to wellness is to expose your body to God's Word, and accept personal responsibility for your health and wellbeing; and cheerfulness is one of the best promoters of health. Don't destroy your body and mind with worries; every challenge has come to pass. 

Trust God and relax! Your mind is like a garden, your thoughts and words are the seeds, you can grow beautiful flowers or you can grow weeds. Don't allow the body to scream for rest and turning "red" before you rest. Priotize rest before your body signals distress. Take care of your body; it's the only place you have to live in to fulfill your God-given dreams on earth.



## Daily Juice~17956

Remember, the image you place on yourself is proportionate to your success in life.

You are God's product; He sponsors no flops. Believe in yourself and have faith in the ability He has given to you.  

Understanding who are and your uniqueness makes you outstanding on this earth. Accept yourself, value yourself, forgive yourself, love yourself, improve yourself and be a wise master to yourself. There's no one better; you are the best of you! 

To wish you were someone is a waste of the divine skill and ability you were made with. Quit trying to be someone else- you are beautiful, unique and endowed! Never let the fear of what other people think stop you from being you. 

God doesn't want a second-rate version of you, He wants a first-rate version of what He has created you to be. Project yourself forward. You can do better than you think. God has already empowered you; you are excellent than you think.



## Daily Juice~17980

Practice talking yourself up using faith-filled words! Self-talk reflects your innermost feelings. You can't litter negativity everywhere with your thoughts and then wonder why you've got the kind if life you have! Do no think that what your thoughts dwell upon is of no matter. Your thoughts are making you. There's no scarcity of opportunity, there's only a scarcity of resolve to make it happen.

You need to learn how  to create a match between what it is you desire, and the thoughts and words you are choosing to attract those desires.



## Daily Juice~18006

Sometimes, we don't know the spiritual significance of our choices, words and actions. They functionally determine the course of our lives. 

You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. The power is in your daily routine. Motivation may get you started; habit is what keeps you going. Your life today is essentially the sum of your habits. 

How successful or unsuccessful you are and you will be- a result of your habits! What you repeatedly do ultimately forms the person you are, the things you believe, and the personality that you portray. Old habits won't open new doors!



## Daily Juice~18022

Don't allow circumstances define who you are. Prime your mind for success. Be addicted to bettering yourself. Be intentional about your life. Start early, make everyday count! Procrastination doesn't only steal our time but it also destroys our dreams.

You deserve to do more. Don’t accept your “normal.” Don’t be satisfied with your current situation. Go after your goals and keep your eyes on its fulfilment. Remember, everyone's journey is different. Don't allow people's opinion define your reality.

Some people will refuse to see the new you because they are comfortable with the outdated version of you in their minds. This is natural and normal but don't get upset about it or about them. Leave them alone and continue to evolve into the new you. Life changes for the better when you stop waiting around for people who are unsure about you.



## Daily Juice~18040

Throughout life, the two most futile emotions are guilt for what has been done and guilt for what might be done. Not one tiny slice of that guilt will do anything to change anything in the past. Forgiveness is one of the most powerful things you can do for yourself. If you can't learn to forgive yourself, you may never achieve true success in your life. 

Being relaxed and at peace with yourself affects your performance in everything you do. The more you extend kindness to yourself, the more it will become your automatic response to others. You have a God-given right to be successful. In your Creator's eye, no one on this planet is any better than you. Don't assign responsibility to the past for why you can't be successful or happy in the present.



## Daily Juice~18098

Make your life an impact not a burden to others! Be a real contributor to your world, don't just exist, put the best into developing yourself; you have no idea how dependent the world is on you. Make the world a better place because you lived in it and played your part. A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle.

Anyone can find dirt in someone else; be the one that finds the gold. You were born with an ability to change someone else's life, don't waste it. How you make others feel about themselves, says a lot about you. The light you have within you can light up someone's world. Be a channel of happiness!

There is no joy in possession without sharing. The more you share of the virtue that you carry, the more you open up for more virtue. The more you share of the little you have, the more you position yourself for better things. The main reason God blesses you is because of others.



## Daily Juice~18119

The power of association brings about conformity. Sometimes, when God wants to change the story of an individual; He brings him or her to a place or in contact with a people. The devil also does the same, because the company you keep determines what accompany you! 

Take personal responsibility for your relationship. At the end, it is You versus You. Your future is a picture of your association. Sometimes, you may not leave a certain phase of your life or make greater impact until certain people leave your life.

The company you surround yourself with has a direct impact on your life and will change the direction of your journey positively or negatively. Each friendship is an ingredient that changes the equation of our lives for good or for bad. You cannot hang out with negative people and expect to live a positive life. When you get the wrong people out of your life, the wrong things stop happening.



## Daily Juice~18145

Don't let circumstances or the enemy take you on a useless journey. Before you ever make a move, see if that has the potential of producing divine results. You own your mind, your mind doesn't own you; don't allow it to keep drifting into anxious thoughts over the challenges of life. 

Whenever you feel stressed or worried, pull yourself away and meditate on God's Word. Instead of allowing stress and worry to get to you, train your heart and mind to see how God sees the situation. The bigger God becomes in your heart, the smaller the challenges become and inconsequential in the presence of God.



## Daily Juice~18164

Ignorance is the root of most misfortune. Don't adjust your theology to fit your challenges. God has never made a piece of junk. He has never made an inferior person. 

We all have something that God wants to accomplish through us, but most of us are ignorant of this. God wants to do absolutely miraculous things in everyone's life. God can only flow through you to the degree that you believe. You are the only one who can limit what God wants to do in your life. 

Do you know that, chances are, you are limiting God? Most of us limit God in one way or another. There are many things that can hinder or limit what God wants to do in our lives. One area in which we can limit God is through our wrong beliefs. Our lives go the way of our thoughts. The way we think directs the course of our lives.



## Daily Juice~18175

Depression doesn't come from what's going on in your life. It comes from your thoughts about what's going on in your life. People get depressed and discouraged because they are caught up in the world. They dwell on things they should not be thinking about or they do not recognize the priority that God should have in their life. Irrespective of the challenges or circumstances, you can choose your response. 

How you live your life is totally up to you. It's not dependent on your circumstances. It's dependent on your choices. Arrange your thoughts so that you choose happiness each and everyday. You don't need anybody's help or consent to be happy. You have what you need to be happy.



## Daily Juice~18223

Our actions and attitudes align with the direction our words are plotting out. Words are spiritual entity and a force. They are containers shaped by our thoughts- tools that chisel our lives and the lives of those around us into beautiful masterpieces, edifices or they poison our reality. 

The winds of life may still blow but when we use our tongue as the rudder of our actions and attitudes, the winds don't control where we are going; our words do. Our words control our direction.



## Daily Juice~18240

The nature of man's opinion is such that can bring different results. Don't let someone else's opinion of you become your reality. 

See that you have the best seat in the house of your life. When people take centre stage in the activities that affect our lives and issues, there is tendency to encounter failure.

The reliability on man is the beginning of a journey into a flunctuating and unclear future. The weakness of an opinion not backed by divinity is revealed in its lack of sustainability. Whatever cannot find its expression in divinity is a progress that will soon crash. 

Many things look beautiful on the outside but have long lost divine essense.



## Daily Juice~18253

Leadership is taking responsibility. It has nothing to do with title or the title on your business card or the size of your office. Leadership is not about how much money you make or the clothes you wear. Leadership is an influence. It's an attitude. It's a state of mind. And it's available to each one of us.

Don’t ever see anybody as too small to counsel you when you know that they have the knowledge that can move you to your next level. Don’t ever feel too proud to learn from your subordinates. If you seek the truth to move ahead, it'll gravitate towards you. And if you ignore the truth, it'll stay far from you. It does not matter who teaches you; all that matters is that you get the knowledge you need to move ahead in life. Put your pride aside and learn from even your subordinates so that you can continue to go higher and higher. Don’t despise the wisdom you need to succeed just because it is domiciled in your subordinate.



## Daily Juice~18262

Patience is not just the ability to wait, but the ability to keep a good attitude while waiting, knowing fully well that all things have been structured and commanded to work together for good for you. 

Waiting time does not mean wasting time. Just because something isn't happening for you right now doesn't mean it will never happen. Don't give up and don't let discouragement and comparison weigh you down. Two things define you; your attitude when you have nothing and your attitude when you have everything. Patience can be demanding but her fruit is always sweet! All great achievements require time. 

One moment of patience can prevent a life time of disaster, and one moment of impatience can ruin a whole life. Trust in God's timing; you can't walk in God's timing and miss His backing. It is better to wait for a while and have things fall into place than rush and have all things fall apart.



## Daily Juice~18329

The simple things are also the most extraordinary things, that's why most people miss it. Part of the reason for the way people turn out differently has to do with the values they develop for their lives and the way they see life and respond to life. 

Remember, you see life the way you are not as it is. Nobody will make you happy until you 're happy with yourself first. Treat yourself well! If you don't like yourself, you can't make a success out of yourself and you can't like someone else because you can't give what you don't have. 

You can still be happy during the process of achieving something. Happiness is a choice not a result. Don't allow your happiness to be dependent on circumstances or on the reactions of other people towards you; refuse to be a slave to the thinkings of others. Don't put the key to your happiness in someone else's pocket; nobody can make you happy like you.



## Daily Juice~18342

Ask yourself, if what you did yesterday and what you'll do today get you closer or in the direction of where you want to be tomorrow. Tomorrow's  results are the seeds of today's decision. Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go or what you can accomplish but your decision to look within and take advantage of what you 've got on the inside for a change.  Success is not by chance. No one rolls into success by chance. 

Give no room for excuses. Stop blaming the past, circumstances and others; your life is in your hands. It's not about knowing what to do, but doing what you know. Knowledge that is passive does no good to you unless it is applied! Take responsibility for your life. Be focused or you'll be left behind, for your life is what you make of it. 

Determination today in the right direction leads to success tomorrow. Remember, life is a gift and it offers us the privilege, opportunity and responsibility to live to the fullest. Live by choice, not by chance.



## Daily Juice~18353

The activities of your life are the characters of your words. Everything physical that we see around us was formed by words.

You may think your words don't matter that much, but they do. You can tell what you really believe by the words you speak.  Our operating in faith is linked to the words we speak. Faith is voice activated! Your words are your vehicle to your next level. 

What's in your heart will come out of your mouth. What words are you speaking? If you realize that your words aren't filled with faith, don't just change your words, change your heart and your words will follow suit. Words are the gauge of the heart.



## Daily Juice~18360

A miracle can be birthed with just a shift in your thought pattern. Do not think what your thoughts dwell upon is of no value. Your thoughts are not only orchestrating the experiences of your life, your thoughts are also making you. All those things that fill your mind hold the keys to your reality. 

Remember that stress doesn't come from what's going on in your life, it comes from your thoughts about what's going on in your life. Life may give you a hundred reasons to cry, stop the tears, and show life you have a thousand and one reasons to be joyful. Don't give up! The grace that brought you to this day will take you higher no matter the state of things with you right now. There is a brighter future for you and there's testimony for you!



## Daily Juice~18373

We don't have to cheat on our future because of the mistakes of the past. Pray for your country. Never think that your prayer isn't making any difference; you make great impact when you pray. Therefore, continue in prayer for your country. 

Too many people release careless words into the atmosphere and can't figure out why certain things are happening or not happening in the country. Many a time we get to a point in the  journey of our lives where we consider the challenges our country is facing and we tend towards neglecting our contribution. Our country is our country not because we had parents and grandparents who paved the way for us to be a nation, we are a part of the country because it was a divine arrangement.

Your problem is not bigger than God! God is who He is, regardless of our opinion. Doubting God doesn't diminish who He is. When we focus our hearts on the Lord through praising Him, God looks bigger than any problem. 

However, when we focus on our problems, it appears bigger. Our minds enlarge whatever or whomever we focus our attention on and decrease what we neglect. Of course, God is greater in size, extent, and effect than any problem we face, regardless of what we do. It's not a matter of who God is that determines our victory or defeat. It's our perception of who He is that controls our experiences. 

God is always the same for all of us, but different people receive different results because of how big or small they perceive Him to be. Focus your mind on Him. Let God be big in you and all your challenges will shrink and fade away.



## Daily Juice~18456

Today is a miracle, start it with gratitude! Don't allow the approval, applause and attention of others destroy you. Remain humble and grateful for all of your accomplishments, and know that the Greater One is always at work in you. Know that success is your nature and as such, you bring success into all you do. 

You are a child of God; you are entitled to a life filled with joy, love and blessings. Tie your joy to who you are and what you have in Christ and not to people or things. Don't see what you have achieved yesterday with the same pleasure eyes you used to see it when it was done by you. Look forward and do better than you did yesterday!



## Daily Juice~18470

Time is a treasure. Until you value yourself, you won't value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it. The difference from where I am to where I ought to be is time management. Time is the platform to execute purpose. 

Your time is more valuable than your money; you can get more money, but you can't get more time. Don't just prioritize what's on your schedule but most importantly, schedule your priorities. Refuse to major on the "minors" of life. 

Be picky and selective with whom and with what you invest your time in; wasted time is worst than wasted money. Your future is decided by what you choose to do with your time.



## Daily Juice~18486

People are insecure in themselves because they pay too much attention to what others are and what others are doing. Comparison is a thief of joy. It wanes down the joy of living your own life. Run your own race. You carry so much love in your heart. Give some to yourself. You are perfect exactly as you are! It's not what is outside, but what is inside that takes one to the top. 

There is no competition in destiny. Each one has its own. Your real competition is to always outdo your past! You can be the best that you can be when you are not comparing yourself with anyone. If you are not careful, you will end up living the illusions that others have created. When you know your worth, you do not need others to confirm it.



## Daily Juice~18500

For someone not to believe in you is not entirely your responsibility, but for you not to believe in what God has made you to be is your responsibility!

Nobody can make you feel inferior without your permission!

Make sure you don't start seeing yourself through the eyes of those who don't value you; know your worth even if they don't. Never seek your importance through the standards of the world. You are more than this! You are unique, lovely, loved, amazing, worthy and divine! Nothing you've done, or will ever do, can stop God from loving you and nothing that you've done is too much for the mercy of God.



## Daily Juice~18551

You aren't defined by your past. Be at peace with yourself and with others. We are Innately peaceful beings. Peace is our deepest inner state of being. Live with this consciousness. Don't allow pollutants of any negative images or old memories and experiences to disturb us into negative thinking. Refuse to give them permission to enter and create life in our minds. 

Your life should not be dependent on the reactions of other people towards you; refuse to be a slave to the thinkings of others. Let your conviction about yourself match up with God's destiny for you. You were made with all of God's divine skills. Take a moment to appreciate how awesome you are! Yes you are! You are worthy! Your life is THE SOMETHING SPECIAL!



## Daily Juice~18571

Don't use your energy to worry. Negative comments from others are their own fears or insecurity being projected onto you. If You allow them to get to you, doubts will throw you off your path. Your past experiences may have made you the way you are but you don't have to remain and stay that way. 

Remember, God does not consult your past to determine your future. You are not your failure, and you are not a failure. Failure is an event not a person. Just because you couldn't do something yesterday doesn't mean you can't achieve it. Refuse to embody your mistakes and label yourself as a "failure" or carry your mistakes around with you. Instead, place them under your feet and use them as a stepping stone to arise above it. Your value doesn't decrease because you made a mistake; you are not your mistake. 

Be awaken to these truths and let go of all the negative individuals and thoughts in your life that just drag you down; don't let insecurity ruin the beauty you were born with; be better than you were yesterday. Take responsibility of your own happiness, never put it in other people's hands. Never be a victim of life; be its conqueror!



## Daily Juice~18593

No matter how wonderful, generous and kind you are, you will find someone who does not love you for reasons you do not know, so do not be upset too much, some people are just like that. Avoid being distracted by the opinions of others and wasting time on insignificant matters. Avoid seeking other people and things to fulfill you. 

Be one of your own sources of fulfillment so you don’t have to look outside of yourself for it. Believe you’re enough. Know your worth from God's Word not from people or the society and what you want in life and allow it to flow to you because a resemblance of what you want is already in you.



## Daily Juice~18611

The world is full of people who want change in their circumstances, but only few recognise that change begins on the inside of them. The dominant experience of your life is a reflection of the way you are thinking on the inside. 

Instead of looking for a change to take place externally in everybody and everything else around you, the first thing you need to do is recognize that change begins on the inside of you. This occurs according to the knowledge that you have of God.



## Daily Juice~18638

If you don't plan your life, then you 're believing in luck. A disorganized life cannot make meaningful progress. Sit down and make your life worth-while. Starve your past! 

There's no joy in living your whole life on the ground; there's no passion to be found playing small; in settling for a life that is less than the one you 're capable of living. Stop short-changing your life. God is setting you up for something greater but He wants your thinking to be in sync with His thoughts towards you. The best way to guard your mind is to fill it with God's precious thoughts towards you. Refuse to allow others discourage you for you 're so much better than this. 

Don't give up or reduce your relationship with God to accommodate and please people who don't care about you as much as God does. If a man makes you, a man can "unmake" you if you offend him or he's not pleased with you but if God makes you or blesses you, He cannot curse you or reverse it and no man can "unmake" or curse you.



## Daily Juice~18678

Don't let other people bring you down. Sometimes, some people need to leave your life for some things to start happening. The energy you surround yourself with determines the happenings in your life. 

Don't be afraid to be who you are; if there are people who won't accept you, then let them go. If you don't challenge yourself, you will never realize what you can achieve. Learn how to be independent; in the end, you need to be there for yourself. Challenges will come but how you respond to them defines your character and the quality of your personality. 

Remember, life will not wait for you, decide what you want and go for it. You can never grow above the level of your thought life; watch the depth of your thoughts, for as you think so are you. The world around us takes up the properties of our thoughts and words. Through our thoughts and words, we can influence how the world around us takes form.



## Daily Juice~18702

Remember this, just because someone stays in your heart doesn't mean they will stay in your life too. Don't put your happiness on hold because of someone or something. You were made with all of God's divine skills. Take a moment to appreciate how awesome you are- Yes, You are! 

There's something unique and beautiful about you. Next time when you think of beautiful things, don't forget to count yourself in. Never allow yourself to be defined by someone's inability to see your worth. You 're a person of destiny, gifted and creative. You're equipped for this life and designed for a purpose. 'Make’ your life. Don’t just live it. Make it beautiful, sweet, enjoyable, remarkable. 

God has given you the characteristics that attract love and affection. Someone who doesn't like you doesn't know you, and never be angry with someone who doesn't like you. The only reason why he doesn't like you is because he doesn't know you. The day he gets to know you, he would like you, because you are loveable.



## Daily Juice~18705

You can control your attitude and how you respond to situations. We are each the master of our own reality; life is what you make of it! Always remember that your present situation is not your final destination; your best is yet to come! 

Don’t give up because things are difficult; push yourself more! One bad chapter doesn't mean your story is over. Don't look down on yourself because of what you might be going through at the moment. What you are going through is not a statement that you are finished. 

Regardless of what your circumstances or problems are, you're never more than one word from God away from a miracle. The Lord knows exactly where you are and how to get you to where you're supposed to be. All you need is just the slightest instruction; a word from God!



## Daily Juice~18721

The difference between your today and tomorrow is what you do with your time today. Life today is the seed of another. No one day is the same as another. The value placed on time is the value we've placed on our lives. Life is made up of millions of moments. 

Everyday is important and valuable. Realise that each passing moment is the most important moment. What you do with each gives birth to the other. It's not what others do to us or even our mistakes that hurt us the most; it's our response to it. 

Chasing after the poisonous snake that bites us will only drive the poison through the entire system. It's far better to take measures immediately to get the poison out, so it has no power over the next moment. Our response to circumstances affects the quality of the next moment.



## Daily Juice~18735

Rise above the deceptions and temptations of the world. Your words are the vehicle that'll move you from point A to point B. Words can be like X-rays if you use them properly-- they'll go through anything. 

Quit trying to be someone else. Compete with who you were yesterday. Never allow critics or those who aren't doing anything stop you or slow you down from doing what God has asked you to do. Other people may be doing great things like you but the assignment God has given you is unique to you. Fulfill it! 

Don't let comparison steal your joy. Stop letting envy, jealousy and insecurity ruin the beauty of your life! The world is like a stage with men and women. Everyone has his/her role in the script of life; both the good and the bad act out their roles. Don't try to act another person's role. Look for your role in the script and act yours.



## Daily Juice~18769

No relationship is ever a waste of your time. If it didn't bring you what you want, it taught you what you didn't want. Everyone you meet has a part to play in the story of your journey in life and while some may take a chapter, others a paragragh, and most will be no more than scribbled notes in the margins. 

Some people come into your life as blessings; some others as lessons. You learn something from everyone who passes through your life; some lessons are painful and some are useful but they are all priceless and for a purpose. For everything has been designed to work for your good. 

Appreciate everyone that has passed through and will pass through; they are a part of the ultimate plan. Lessons learnt must not be forgotten and would be needed as you don't fully prepare for an exam only during the exam, you prepare for an exam before the exam.



## Daily Juice~18788

Make up your mind to be grateful to God. Don't allow people or circumstances change your mind. Keep it set on being thankful. It's not what happens to you or what you have or don't have that is important; it's how your mind is arranged and the choices you make. Know what to ignore and express your joy. 

Be thankful for what you have. Your life is someone else's prayer point and miracle. Someone somewhere is grateful for half of what you have.



## Daily Juice~18807

The people in your life should be a source of reducing stress not causing more of it. God first, people second. Worlds system.....not on the list.

Your success story begins from your mind! Successful people form a good relationship with their minds. Your mind is the gate way to your life, and the state of your mind determines the quality of your life. Remember, what you hear, read and see determines how you think, how you think determines how you behave, and how you behave determines what becomes of you.



## Daily Juice~18821

Prayer is a spiritual activity and we must learn the spirituality of life. Understand that the spiritual controls the physical. Men are not controlled by their minds; they are controlled by the conditions of their spirits. 

Every moment of prayer is an investment in eternity and true prayer is a romance with divinity. There's a transfiguration that takes place in your life when you commune with God regularly. Remember, what prayer does in you is far greater than the thing you are praying for or praying about.



## Daily Juice~18835

Don't make the challenges of life become your identity. Challenges in life are inevitable, and they are for your promotion but being defeated is optional and a choice. When you talk about your challenges to everyone, you perpetuate the memory of them. It positions you as a victim and delays any efforts of quick recovery. Talk magnifies things. 

The wise never discuss their challenges with someone incapable of solving them. Your chosen confidant should be competent and discreet. Nobody associates with losers and victims. When Job lost everything, everyone avoided him. It was only when God doubled his blessings that others returned to participate in his life by giving him gifts. Harness your mouth.



## Daily Juice~18871

No matter what happens to you, your attitude belongs to you. Your attitude is your choice and responsibility. The more you know who you are, the less you let things and people upset you. Don't allow someone else's attitude make your life miserable

Those who try to criticize and speak ill of you are expecting you to be angry and be in a fight mode, conquer them with your peace. Hold yourself in; you have self-restraint, don't fight back, maintain your inner climate. 

The less you respond to negative people, the more peaceful your life will become. We would enjoy life a lot more if we get good at knowing what to ignore and what to focus on. You may miss out on God's best for you while being distracted by things that don't matter. Remember, your attitude is your responsibility!



## Daily Juice~18887

Activity is not synonymous to progress and productivity. Simplify your life. Your daily routines are the deciding factors of your future. 

Too many people see too much, hear too much and consider too many things, and too many things easily get their attention. Their priorities have been wrongly placed and it is slowly eating them up. 

We must simplify our lives or we are going to lose terribly. You cannot go far if you are easily distracted by people and things that have nothing to do with your goal. No negative emotion is worth holding on to when you consider what it is doing to you. Countless people today are making themselves sick over things that don't count because they let things get to them. The only person who can make you act in an unloving way is you. Only you can decide how you act.



## Daily Juice~18900

Remember that your real wealth can be measured not by what you have, but by what you are and give.

Each person is unique and has their own paths and pace of development. It would seem that the success of one person may have nothing to do with the success of another. That someone is succeeding doesn't mean you are failing. Therefore, comparing yourself to others makes no sense and can only cause negative emotions.

Instead, you should focus on your own growth and progress. Each person has their own goals and strategies for achieving success. Instead of comparing yourself to others, you should focus on your strengths, goals and achievements.

It is your uniqueness that makes you exclusive. And to decide that someone is better than you is to treat yourself in a far from friendly manner.



## Daily Juice~18917

Whatever is growing in the garden of your life is what you've planted or allowed to be planted. Before things can change, you must quit giving excuses and blaming anybody and everybody else for what's wrong in your life. 

Quit saying, "it's fate," or "bad luck" or "nothing ever works for me." Scripture reveals that as you think in your heart, that's the way you're going to be. Thoughts produce things in your life. Your thought life produces a harvest in the natural realm.



## Daily Juice~18937

The dominant experience of your life is a reflection of the way you are thinking on the inside. Instead of looking for a change to take place externally in everybody and everything else around you, the first thing you need to do is recognize that change begins on the inside of you. This occurs according to the knowledge that you have of God. This is a simple truth, but it's profound. In fact, most people miss it because it's so simple. God's Word is true! 

You can turn any circumstance in your life around by getting God's perspective and starting to think His thoughts and declare His Word. Once you realize the power of your tongue, you won’t just say anything. If there was any great lesson you would learn today, let it be this: no battle was ever won with silence! Learn to always speak faith-filled words. 

When you realize the power of your thoughts, you won’t entertain just anything. And once you realize the power of your presence, you won’t just be anywhere.



## Daily Juice~18996

Letting go also means to come to the realization that some people are a part of your history, but not a part of your future destiny.

Enjoy your life and enjoy everything God has given you. Never make your happiness or success dependent on an attachment to any person, place or thing. 

Nobody knows what it takes to be you. Be who God wants you to be, not who the world wants you to be. Your beauty is in your uniqueness! The best project you'll ever work on is you. 

However, those whom you associate with matters to God, and that's why He gave the instruction in His Word, "Evil communication corrupts good manners." Surround yourself with people who talk about visions and ideas, not about other people.



## Daily Juice~19062

Certainly, one of the distinquishing characteristics between human beings and animals is the ability to use words- to speak. This gives us creative power like God. God spoke the universe into existence. We can speak circumstances into existence by our words. 

Life has no middle ground. Every word you speak either releases life or death; there's no middle ground. A person who has no control over his tongue is headed for destruction. 

You can tell what you really believe by the words you speak. You may think your words don't matter much, but they do. Most people say what they have and they continue to have more of such situations. If you realize you don't really like the circumstances of your life, don't just change your words, change your heart and your words will follow suit. Words are the guage of your heart.



## Daily Juice~19086

What people think about you doesn't matter as much as what you think about yourself.. so be what God wants you to be, not what's people want! Because their opinions change, but your vision of yourself will stick with you for life. 

You can change environment, but until you change, nothing else will ever change. Remember, things don't change with time, things change with the application of truth. Aging is a matter of the mind, if you don't mind, it doesn't matter. Maturity doesn't come with age, it comes with demands and responsibilities.



## Daily Juice~19102

Transforming with time: shedding old habits to make room for growth. Mistakes and challenges do not erase who you are. You can still be the person God created you to be. Bad days do not make you a bad person. Don't allow your mistakes to define you. God already provided forgiveness for that mistake even before the thought of it. God is in the now of your life; He does not consult your past to determine your future! Your life is not a chess game. Don't play games with your life. 

Flies cannot perch on a hot stove; life is spiritual. You are always responsible for how you turn out in life, not people or the circumstances of your life. Don't let how you feel make you forget who you are. 

Refuse to change what your heart believes because of what your eyes see. There's more to life than meets the eyes. Life is beyond the senses. If you only believe what you see, then you 're terribly limited to what's on the surface.



## Daily Juice~19120

People only understand you from their level of perception. If necessary, explain your actions, not yourself. Those who really know you don't need your explanation. 

Remember, it's not your job to make people understand you. It's your job to understand yourself. The unhappiest people in this world, are those who care the most about what other people think. You don't need the approval of someone or a situation to be happy. 

The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of everything, they just make the most of everything that comes their way. Many problems that people suffer are their behaviours and attitudes towards people and situations. Sometimes, overcoming a challenge is as simple as changing the way you think about it.



## Daily Juice~19173

God loves you so much. Loving yourself isn't selfish at all. You are not that one bad decision you made years ago. 

It's time to move forward and blossom. Fullstop is not an end; because we can write a new sentence after it. Same is the case with life -as failure is not the real end, it can be a real beginning of success! You have the ability to overcome any challenge. Don't let your emotions make your decisions. Make excuses or make changes. The choice is yours. Don't let anything or anyone make you settle for a lowly existence. God didn't create anyone to suffer and struggle through life. A good life starts with Christ, and through His Word, you receive a new mindset. 

One thing no one can take from you is the freedom of your mind. A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it isn't open. Renew and strengthen your mind with God's Word, and it'll renew and strengthen your mentality, and then anything is possible.



## Daily Juice~19183

There are so many things to be grateful for. Life itself is a huge blessing, cherish today. 

You can't expect to draw people into your life who are kind, loving, confident and generous if you are thinking and acting in cruel, weak, and selfish ways. You must put forth what you want to attract. 

Many have insulted and turned away people that were divinely placed on their path and orchestrated to help them fulfill their destiny. Build good relationships with others. We are in a partnership with all other human beings, not a contest to be judged better than others and worse than others. Treat people with respect and courtesy. You can easily measure the character of a man by the way he treats and talks to others.



## Daily Juice~19205

You don't have to wait for everything to be perfect in your life before you become happy. 

There are over 8 billion people in the world. You have a unique gift to offer this world. You are of an inestimable value than you could ever imagine, made with all of God's divine skills. 

Your worth in life is not a function of your environment or human opinions, but a divine arrangement and value. Stop being defined by what society or others think of you. Don't let any anyone dull your sparkle. 

There's a beautiful world inside of you, let it out. There's so much light within you to light up someone's world. Don't be in this world just to balance the ecosystem or to complete the square. Be the type of energy that no matter where you go or what you do, you always add value to the spaces and lives around you.



## Daily Juice~19274

When chances are one in a million, be that 'one'. There will always be someone who can't see your worth. Make sure that person isn't you. The same boiling water that softens the potato hardens the egg. It's about what you are made of, not the circumstances.  

Take personal responsibility for yourself. There's a 100% returns of dividends for investing in yourself. Be a first-rate version of yourself, not a second-rate version of someone else. Stop comparing yourself, especially on social media. 

Everyone has a story, focus on yours! You must have control of the authorship of your life. The pen that writes your life's story must be held in your hands. Accept no one's definition of your life if it's inconsistent with God's definition of you in His Word.



## Daily Juice~19284

Age is automatic but growth is intentional and your responsibility! Don't expect to see a change if you don't create one. A new place may not give you a new life. 

A fresh start is not a new place, it is a new mindset, because our lives always expresses the results of our dominant thoughts. You can change environments but until you change yourself, nothing really changes. It doesn't matter where you live on the outside, what matters is where you live on the inside. 

You cannot be greater than what you hold inside you. Your life is a reflection of what you are on the inside. Your attitude determines who stays in your life. Stop placing blame on others for your current situation. If you let them take responsibility for your happiness or sadness, they win. You are in control of your attitude. And It's this attitude that determines who controls who- either the situation controls you or you control the situation.



## Daily Juice~19339

Magnify God; don't magnify your problem. There's no situation that is greater than you. Understand, God did not create you as a victim of circumstances. He didn't create you as a negative thinking person; depressed, stressed out and worried. 

You were created to be happy, contended, peaceful and to enjoy your life. He wants us to be examples of what it means to live a life of faith, hope and love. When people see us, they should see so much joy, peace that they will want what we have. See things from this perspective. 

Begin retraining your mind in these particular areas. Many times, the change or miracle we desire is hinged in our attitudes towards life, things and people.



## Daily Juice~19348

There's an important fact we often overlook and take lightly. Here's it- Our thoughts are creative. That is, what we think tends to change, even to create reality.

The conditions, circumstances, events, and experiences we go through are not accidents. They accurately reflect our habitual thinking and imagery. When your thoughts are God’s thoughts, God’s power is with your thoughts for good.



## Daily Juice~19364

Silence the voice of negativity. Take charge of your temper, regulate your thoughts and govern your tongue with the Word or they will keep you down. There is a fountain of wealth and wisdom inside you; develop what you have within you. You are more than this! 

You are capable of much more. You are stronger than than whatever you are facing right now. Your dreams and aspirations can still come alive. God will not put a dream in your heart if He had not already given you everything you need to fulfill it. Don't lose hope; don't give up! That challenge is tied to a testimony and someone needs your testimony to be inspired. 

The lifting power is in what you say amidst the situation. It doesn't matter where you live on the outside, what matters is where you live on the inside. Whatever will affect your life must come from your heart. The future is completely open, and we are writing it moment to moment through our thoughts and words.



## Daily Juice~19374

Befriend yourself! Your peace is not dependent on circumstances; it is dependent only on Jesus Christ, who is the same yesterday, today, and forever. 

You can't live a peaceful or happy life with worried and sad thoughts. If your anger is the result of your sadness or your sadness is the result of your anger, you are not fulfilling the purpose for your creation. It is not pleasures that make life worth living. It is the attitude you bring into life and what you do with the life God has given you that makes life worth living.



## Daily Juice~19391

Before you were born, you existed in God's mind. He knew this world would need you at this time. He planned you with a special purpose that no one but you could fulfill. It's your road and yours alone. Others may walk in with you but no one can walk in for you. 

There's only one of you in the entire world and your uniqueness is what makes you beautiful. Material accomplishment will soon be forgotten, the only thing that lasts is the investment we make in our lives and in the lives of others. Don't see your importance or value through the standards of the world. 

Refuse to let life's circumstances define you. You don't have to conform to society's social norms and stereotypical boxes. You don't have to feel pressured to be like anyone else. You are the best of you. You must engage in new audacity. Don't cluster or crowd your life with activities which do not have eternal value. The important things of life are very simple and also very simple to miss. Activity is not synonymous with productivity. "Uncrowd" and simplify your life.



## Daily Juice~19443

Nothing in this world can affect a person as much as his thoughts. Stop being affected by the opinion of others; the best things of life aren't things. As a man of purpose, focus on your destination, not on your situation. God isn't against you having things but He is against things having you. 

Refuse to major on the minor things of life. The success of one does not limit the success of another. Stop fighting with yourself in your mind and stop fighting with people in your head. Remember, that someone else is succeeding doesn't mean you are failing. 

Life is a journey and it is a series of phases. Get excited about your life, because your strength is connected to your joy. Never be intimidated by possessions or things. Refuse to focus on the lesser side and lesser things of life. A man's life consists not in the abundance of things which he possesses. A man is not what he has, but who he is!



## Daily Juice~19502

Stop pressing rewind on things that need to be deleted from your life. Anger, resentment and jealousy don't change the heart of others-- it only changes yours. Never respond to an angry person with a fiery comeback, even if he deserves it. Don't allow his anger to become your anger. Work on your anger, hatred and bitterness issues before they take you to the wrong destination. They may seem  justifiable to you but the end is destruction. 

Attachment to a hurt or pain arising from a past event blocks the inflow of blessings and joy into your life and makes you a prisoner of your past. Regardless of how you have been hurt, there's that capacity in you to forgive and move on. Don't choke yourself. Your BEFORE and AFTER must not be the same. 

Remember, achievements means nothing if your character does not match with your success.



## Daily Juice~19517

One instruction from God can change your life forever, and one instruction missed can also keep you far from making progress for a long time! Some goodbyes are good for growth. Don't always think what can happen in a month, or what can happen in a year; focus on the 24 hours in front of you and do what should do to get you closer to where you want to be. 

There's no future that is not connected to the present. What you do today affects your tomorrow. No one is busy, it's only a matter of priorities. Most times, you feel you don't have enough time, but actually, what you don't have is enough concentration. Your life is your responsibility. You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great. Practise more affirmations, it works!

God doesn't send bad things our way. It's not by chance or fate. There's a real enemy out there that we must learn to deal with. Life is spiritual. Some don't recognize the role that the spirit realm plays in what occurs in our daily lives. We just tend to look at things as being normal and natural but the devil is busy influencing people and circumstances everyday. 

There's an intense battle being waged all round us each and everyday. We need to know the spiritual significance of our choices, words, and actions. The devil can't control you outside of your will. He can't influence you without your cooperation and consent. The Greater One lives in you! Refuse to fear.Your fear is your cooperation. 

However, your lack of awareness and understanding of the battle only works to his advantage. You can resist the devil and he will flee from you. Your passivity and lack of resistance doesn't mean that the battle isn't raging. It just simply means you aren't winning.

God does not start a thing without knowing the outcome. He begins every work with the end in mind. Since He already knows the end from the beginning, He also knows everything in between. It won't take Him time to make something beautiful out of your life. He only needs your attention and availability. 

When the seed of God's Word is planted in our hearts, it has the potential to produce a hundred fold. But the seed doesn't determine how much is produced; the ground does. If we have so many thorns in our lives and allow the cares of this world, it chokes God's Word and limit what God can do in our lives.



## Daily Juice~19607

What's your thoughts gathering to your life? It's often said, mind your language, but we need to also mind our minds! The health of your mind heavily influences the quality of your decisions and your ability to maintain focus and invariably determines the quality of your personality. 

The mind is not a “Thing”. The mind is an activity, an image-maker, a creator and the mind operates by law. Whatever is impressed upon the mind must be expressed. Whatever you think about, you bring about. 

Be choosy and picky what you give your mind to. Never think about what you don't want; refuse to entertain ideas you don't want showing up in the canvass of your life. Don't sit around gossiping, whining, complaining and griping like other people; put it out of your life. We can't be thinking like we used to and expect to live a different kind of life.



## Daily Juice~19620

Keep your life in the right perspective. Every one of us has something even right now to be happy about: our health, our jobs, our businesses, our families, a previous miracle or an opportunity. Don't manufacture unhappiness; if you complain, you'll remain, but a grateful heart is a happy heart and a magnet for a miracle. Happiness and unhappiness is based on perspective. 

Be cognizant of the fact that the more you attach your value to those things outside yourself, the more you give those things the power to control you. No one can depress you. No one can make you anxious. No one can hurt your feelings other than what you allow inside. Monitor your inner dialogue and match your thoughts and words to what you intend to achieve.



## Daily Juice~19636

Don't allow life's circumstances define who you are and make you discredit yourself. You are an amazing, wonderful masterpiece of God. 

Never put down yourself to please anyone. If you keep doing that, it won't do you any good. Some are more focused on their flaws and mistakes and forget the beauty they were born with. Beauty is not in how tall or slim you are or how perfect you look. Beauty is in being who God made you to be with confidence. Irrespective of how you are, take what you have and make a sucess out of your life. God made you as you are on purpose. He gave you your looks, height, your personality on purpose. 

You are the best of you! Nothing about you is by accident. God calls you His masterpiece. You are special; there's nothing ordinary about you. Rather than being down on yourself and discrediting who you are and focusing on all your mistakes. I wonder what would happen if you focus on the masterpiece God has created you to be and declare, "I am excellent". "I am amazing". "I am valuable". "I am blessed". "I am favoured". The goodnews is when you talk like this consistently, whatever follows the "I am" will eventually follow you.



## Daily Juice~19656

Life is not subject to chance, it is subject to truths. You have the same opportunity to improve your life and succeed as did others who succeeded. Don't distort the image of yourself because you were unable to achieve success. Success is your nature!

Failure is not your identity, and giving up is never an option, that will only take you back to the place you left. No matter the amount of faith you have, if you don't put it to work, it won't work; it will do you no good.



## Daily Juice~19660

How you handle your money reflects who you are. It's not the amount of money you earn that matters, it's the size of your thinking that counts. Your ideas, skills can bring money, and money is meant to bring more money. The rule is money makes money, and the money money makes, makes more money.

You are the root of your financial success or failure; if you work on the root, the fruits will take care of themselves. Beware of little expenses-- a small leak will sink a great ship. A budget is telling your money where to go, instead of wondering where it went. Tell your money where to go before your feelings do! Don't tell me what you value, show me your budget and I’ll tell you what you value. For if you keep doing what you're doing, you'll keep getting what you're getting! It's never too late to turn things around.



## Daily Juice~19702

If you focus on who you are not, you will lose focus on who you are. Your life has a beautiful blueprint from God's Word. If you always think you need to be someone else you will never get to a level of knowing yourself and discovering your potential. You will always find someone better than you at something but you will never find anyone better than you at being you. There is nothing as interesting as being you. There are others who try to be others until they lose themselves in the process. 

You are a unique seed! The power of a seed is not in its size but in the quality of its product. Remember, the fruits come from the seed. Good things come from within, the seed germinates from within. For growth to be realized, it has to be from within you. If you are looking for greatness outside there, then you are looking at the wrong direction. When you discover the greatness inside of you, it will attract the greatness outside.



## Daily Juice~19717

Your worth is not defined by someone else's limited vision. You are not a product of your past; you are a pioneer of your future. Your true strength lies not in what has happened to you, but in what you choose to do next.

Surround yourself with people who uplift and inspire you, for the energy of those around you can either fuel your growth or drain your potential. Remember, quality attracts quality. To attract the best, become the best version of yourself.

Don't waste your precious time on those who don't support your growth. Let the opinions of others be their own; it's up to you to define your own narrative. When you focus too much on what others think, you become a prisoner of their expectations.



## Daily Juice~19733

Inherent in every challenge is the mechanism for its solution. Some opportunities come in disguise as challenges, but when unveiled, tansform and give rise to a greater benefit. We need to surround ourselves with people who will tell us what we need to hear, not what we want to hear, but at the same time not make us feel we’re up against the impossible. 

Most of us, we don't believe in ourselves. We wish we were someone else and ignore that there is someone out there who wishes if he/she was you. Be yourself so that you can inspire other people. One of the best medications of success is believing in yourself. Not to be believe in yourself is not to believe in the creativity and skills of God deposited within you. Do not underestimate yourself because within you are all the tools that can make you a successful person. 

You are ultimately responsible for who you become. You are in control of your life. Nobody else, only you. Your tomorrow is in your hands. Let go of the people who dull your shine, poison your spirit, and bring you down. Cancel your subscription to their opinions. Don't feel guilty for doing what's best for you as long as it's in sync with God's purpose for you. You owe it to yourself to become everything God has designed you to be.



## Daily Juice~19752

You don't have to disrespect and insult others simply to hold your own ground. If you do, that shows how shaky your own position is. Your prevailing thought or mood determines that which is to be drawn toward you - The man who allows his mind to dwell constantly upon thoughts of failure brings himself into close touch with the minds of "failure" people, and each will tend to pull the other down still more. 

You are today setting into motion thought currents which will in time attract toward you thoughts, people and conditions in harmony with the predominant note of your thought. 

Your thought will mingle with that of others of like nature and mind, and you will be attracted toward each other, and will surely come together with a common purpose sooner or later, unless one or the other of you should change the current of his thoughts. Remember, life is not the result of chance. Whatever you 're thinking about becomes the reality you 're projecting.



## Daily Juice~19768

You are so much more than the things that have happened to you. You may not be everybody's favourite but note this- You are God's favourite! Keep every stone they throw at you. You've got castles to build with them. You are a foundation layer within the sphere of influence God has given you. You have bricks and mortar within you to build, construct or tear them. 

You can't change someone who doesn't see an issue in their actions. Don't compare your results to someone else's. You can never be another person, you can only be a better version of yourself. Don't repress or suppress your uniqueness just because some people disapprove your eccentricity. You aren't meant to follow the crowd. 

Develop confidence in who God has made you to be. Refuse to allow anything inhibit your real self. Stand out and allow yourself to shine for you are the designer of your future.



## Daily Juice~19800

There's no challenge you face that is greater than you. The world cannot place a limit on you; don't place a limit on yourself. Challenges will come but how you respond to them defines your character and the quality of your personality. Remember, life will not wait for you, decide what you want and go for it. 

You can never grow above the level of your thought life; watch the depth of your thoughts, for as you think so are you. The world around us takes up the properties of our thoughts and words. Through our thoughts and words, we can influence how the world around us takes form. 

Don't let other people bring you down. Sometimes, some people need to leave your life for some things to start happening. The energy you surround yourself with determines the happenings in your life. Learn how to be independent of circumstances.



## Daily Juice~19818

There comes a time in your life when you have to choose to turn the page, write another book or simply close it. Stop letting insecurity ruin you. Nothing holds you back more than your own thinking pattern. 

You'll always travel in the direction of your thoughts. Stop worrying, for it doesn't take away tomorrow's trouble, it only takes away today's peace. No amount of guilt can change the past, and no amount of worrying can change the future. Keep calm and keep doing the Word. What you fear you empower, what you empower you attract! 

Sometimes, it's not the challenge that's the load that breaks you down, it's the way you're carrying it. The only time one fails is when one falls and stays down.

Do the best that you can do 

We will sing songs of thanks and praise to God.
Prayers

All the extra, add it to the distributions to the poor. 

Members can help in sponsoring the feasts but it should be the church that does the preparation.

Someone can say "I would like to sponsor the one for Tuesday, or Wednesday"
Whatever you put together, the church should be responsible for cooking the food. 
Individuals should not cook the food and bring to church.
Let the church be responsible.

Do not contract it to anybody outside.
Organize with your men and women in church.

I affirm that I've been empowered to prosper in all things. I'm the symbol of God’s blessings. I'm a carrier of His presence and His grace. When I show up, blessings show up, like Joseph, in the house of Potiphar. Everything I do prospers. I have the consciousness of sufficiency and superabundance. I deal wisely in the affairs of life and finances. The businesses and projects that I'm involved with are blessed; the law of multiplication is at work in them. I can never suffer loss. I’m supernaturally protected and preserved, walking in divine favour continually. All my investments yield hefty profits. Glory!

I am abundantly supplied, I have all that I require for life and godliness. I am self-sufficient, possessing enough to require no aid or support and I am furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation. Hallelujah!

I affirm that I received abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life by the name of the anointed one, Jesus Christ. I live in His authority and that makes me immune to lack and poverty. When I call on that name, all nature responds and heaven stands at attention. Supernatural doors open for me; I am called and chosen for jobs, blessings, promotions and contracts I do not naturally qualify for. Strangers are obligated to favour my financial increase because my promotion comes from God and not man. I celebrate the grace of God which causes His glory to be revealed in all that I do and usher me into my next level of greatness. Glory!

I affirm that I am graced to prosper financially; God's grace is working mighty in my life and my profiting is evident for all to see. Of the Lord’s fullness have I received, and grace for grace. That grace attracts the right people at the right time to deal with in my business ventures. Business partners, lucrative investments and mega financial opportunities locate me as I radiate the grace of God. I am shinning in every project that I am involved with; I cannot be hidden. I have the nerve and audacity to do extraordinary, history making financial exploits that always bear supernatural results. I rise above every adversity for I am not enabled by qualifications or abilities but by grace. Glory to God!

I affirm that I live a life of immense, vast and enormous richness. I am not destined to be poor, deprived, broke or miserable, rather God’s will is for me to prosper and be in health, even as my soul prospers. Prosperity and greatness have been imparted to my spirit. As an heir of God, and a joint heir with Christ, the silver, the gold, the cattle upon a thousand hills, the world and the fullness thereof belong to me. All things are mine! I see myself in this light for this is the truth about my prosperity. I do not see my job, trade, career, skill or business as my source of income, but as a medium to bless others. I reject poverty, lack, want and everything that is inconsistent with the realities of the God-life. I live a joyful, prosperous life every day. Hallelujah!

I affirm that I received abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life by the name of the anointed one, Jesus Christ.

Strangers are obligated to favour my financial increase because my promotion comes from God and not man. I celebrate the grace of God which causes His glory to be revealed in all that I do and usher me into my next level of greatness. Glory!

I affirm that I received abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life by the name of the anointed one, Jesus Christ. I live in His authority and that makes me immune to lack and poverty. When I call on that name, all nature responds and heaven stands at attention. Supernatural doors open for me; I am called and chosen for jobs, blessings, promotions and contracts I do not naturally qualify for. Strangers are obligated to favour my financial increase because my promotion comes from God and not man. I celebrate the grace of God which causes His glory to be revealed in all that I do and usher me into my next level of greatness. Glory!

I affirm that the Word of God regarding my prosperity is in office. As Solomon made gold and silver in Jerusalem, it is so with me concerning money. The supernatural is evident in my finances; my impact in kingdom financing cannot be ignored. I’m found at the top of those sponsoring the gospel.

## Day 3 Healing Streams July 11~5416

Reverend Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DD

WHO IS IN YOUR HOUSE?

According to the bible, your body is your house. You are not the physical body that you see. You are a spirit being, given a body to live in, so you can express yourself on this earth. 

Demon spirits are evil spirits that have been punished to have no bodies to express themselves. So they must enter into another living being to express themselves. 
That's why they enter into human beings because human beings are the highest and most intelligent of God's creatures.
They can express themselves to their worst when they enter human beings. 
They can enter into animals. 

Matt 5. When Jesus was casting out devils from the mad man at Gadara, Jesus permitted the demons to enter into the swine, and they went in. 

So it matters what animals you have in your house. 
Those in witchcraft will tell you that they've been able to carry out their wicked acts. 
But the best creature to use is a human body.

Same with God; The spirit of God would rather use a human being to express himself on the earth.
Jesus looked like us. 
He so looked like us that He was standing with his 11 disciples and they needed Judas Iscariot to identify him out if the disciples for them.

God reached us through one with a human body. 

Sickness and disease are Satan's expressions in a human body.

Pains and afflictions are all expressions of Satan's presence.

The first of the signs that Jesus said will follow those who believe in him, is that they will cast out devils. That shows you how important it is.

Most of people's problems and challenges are caused by demons. 
But it is very easy to deal with; when you use the name of Jesus. 

All demons fear the name of Jesus because Jesus defeated them.

1 Cor 6:19-20.
He wrote this to Christians.
If you haven't received the Holy spirit, get ready today. 
Without the holy spirit you cannot serve God. 
You need him to guide you! To instruct you in the way you should go. 

Real Christianity is not possible without the holy spirit. 

At the Rapture of the church, all the dead in Christ will come out of the grave or wherever their bodies are. Those are alive will be caught up to meet with them in the air. 
That can't happen without the holy spirit. 

Glorify God in your body and in your spirit.
Live a life that glorifies and honors God 

Through the power of the holy spirit, you can stop sinning and stop all the evils you had been Living with. 
There is too much evil, hatred, murder, violence in the world. 
Satan is the killer. Satan is a liar. 
Falsehood and deception comes from Satan.
That's the reason there's so much killing in the world and God is calling them to repentance. 
But without the holy spirit they can't live the life God called them to live. 

Some of you are living evil lives maybe because of money, and you feel there is no other way exception deception and violence.  
But still they won't be happy. .their whole life is misery.
Because you opened your life to Satan, he gave you the suggestions and made you carry out those atrocious Acts. But if you let the Holy Ghost today live inside you, you will be fulfilled and satisfied in your life. 
You will know peace with God which you cannot buy with money.

I will lead you through that process. It is very simple but very real and powerful. 

God's plan for you is to be healthy always. 

Who is in your house?
This house of your body...
Is it God that's inside or demons inside?
No man ever freed himself from demons. They are too powerful for human beings, but in the name of Jesus, we can help you. 
They will pack the sickness and diseases that they came with and get out of your body.

Colossians 1:27..
If demons are in you, they will torment your life and bring fear.
But if Christ is in you, there is hope always. 
It also shows you that this glory of God has come to be fulfilled in your life. 

From that moment on, your life will be changed. God will separate you from all that is evil because he makes you light.



## “BELIEVING” AND “TALKING” MUST GO TOGETHER.~5603

That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Romans 10:9-10).

Your mouth is your instrument to chart your course through life; it's not just for eating and drinking. There’re people in hospitals who, as a result of sickness, are drip-fed through their veins. So even though it’s convenient to use the mouth for food, its greater function is for talking; using the power of words for creating your victorious life.

Salvation has already been made available in Christ Jesus. Titus 2:11 says, “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.” However, to catapult yourself into the realms of glory—where you enjoy the benefits of salvation—you must use your mouth rightly, for with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. This is the reason some people, even though they’ve been Christians for long, have never really enjoyed the benefits of Christianity. They haven’t acted on the Word. You’re to make confessions of the Word; that means speak the same things that God has said concerning you in His Word. That is what takes you beyond salvation, to enjoying the benefits of salvation.

You ought to always make confessions about yourself on the basis of the Word of God that you’ve believed. Until you make those confessions, your believing won't produce results. Your believing and your confessions must go together. 2 Corinthians 4:13 says, “We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.”

Those whose confessions are at variance with what they believe experience lots of ups and downs in life; no consistent victories. This is because as the Word says, a fountain doesn't produce sweet water and bitter water at the same time (James 3:11). Speak the Word only, and always, for a life of consistent victory and excellence.

AFFIRMATION TIME:
The Word of God prevails mightily in me today, producing glory in my life. My victory is undeniable, and all the blessings and results of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ are evident in my life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## August The Month of Praise!!!~5676





## GLOBAL DAY OF FASTING AND PRAYER~5679

1st August 2021

Rev Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DD

The spirit of the Antichrist is a devil, and this devil has manifested at different times and seasons in the earth.
Sometimes He has possessed an individual as he would do in the last days.

When the covid fiasco began, I told you that Lord told me very clearly that we were dealing with the prince of Assyria. And we are going to find these evil spirits enter into people in these last days. 
And they take on the character of Satan in a peculiar way 

Rev 17:8
I described this one to you. He is the prince of Greecia.

V9-10 Those mountains were referring to these empires which I have given you a list of them.
Egypt, Assyria,Babylon Medo-persia, Greece Rome, Revised Roman.

Those that formed the power of the Roman empire would be the ones to make up the Revised Roman empire which would be made up of 10 kingdoms, and which would rule for just a short time...based in Europe
 
V11: 

OWG: One world Government. Which would be led by the Antichrist. 

In Christ the word of God would let you drive through the time and space of the bible and see parallels and reflections of truth. 
If you are awoken to such realities, you will be able to deal with the affairs of life. 

Without the knowledge of the word you cannot recognize these things


Jesus told the disciples 'if you had known me, you would have known the father also". 
He has given us a principle. 

Romans 1:20 KJV, AMP.
Invisible things are understood by things that are made visible. 

He shows us these parallels and reflections of truth. 

How is God going to respond in this particular situation? Look at the word

We are dealing with the spirit of Assyria and his works. 

Revelations 17:9-10
The 7 Kings (actually not up to 7)
Abaddon
The Assyrian
King of Babylon
Prince of Persia
Prince of Greecia
Satan
Prince of Babylon
Prince of Assyria

There was so much idolatry in these nations.

This is the same thing this prince of Assyria is causing people to do today.

Abaddon of Egypt is already in the bottomless pit. 
The prince of Greecia is currently there as well, but he is going to come out later. 


But right now we have these spirits instigating these evil works together with Satan the devil. 

In the OWG, Satan will empower the beast. The Antichrist will be possessed with the prince of Greecia.
It is a tripatheid operation where Satan the dragon, is running things, the Antichrist is possessed by the prince of Greecia and become so powerful (Go and see how powerful the Greece empire was). The third one is the False prophet also described as a beast.


I want to show you some interesting things.
There are countries that already sold themselves to the pharmaceutical industries.
This is the modus operandi of the prince of Assyria and I will show you from the bible.
And they cannot come out by themselves. Something spiritual has to happen. 

Isaiah 52:3-4
They sold themselves for NOTHING.

Many nations have sold themselves. It's a sad thing

Isaiah 10:24
God tells his people not to be afraid of the Assyrian. (Assyrian here refers to the spirit of the Antichrist).

All of this going on is a kind of preparation for the OWG that will come in place. BUT NOT YET!!!

Isa 10: 24-25
God is judging his people and allowing the Assyrian to be the hand of that Judgement.

God is telling his people that it's just for a while until the indignation is passed. When his anger is pacified it would end in the destruction of those people which he used to carry out that Judgement. 

V26-27
This is very prophetic because he indicates to his people that the yoke of the Assyrian will be destroyed because of the anointing. 
By reason of the anointing which his people have, the yoke will be destroyed..... In that day 
This is that day. We have the anointing now. 
The yoke of the Assyrian will be destroyed. 

That's why in the last days, when the Antichrist will take over the nations, it will happen because the church is not present.

The presence of the anointing makes it difficult and impossible for the yoke to remain.



## WARNING
MUSIC MINISTERS~5689

"In many churches, the worship is gone.
What the Lord wants is for us to offer spiritual sacrifices, Pastor's don't yield your platforms anymore for such demonstrations of personal agendas.
Everything should be done for the honour of Jesus christ, for the glory of His name
All that should change.
Serve the Lord with gladness.
If you have a gift for singing, you're either going to use it to serve God or your personal agenda, that is dead in the house of God now.
To use the gospel for your personal agenda is a sin, you cannot use the gospel to make a career; if you're a true singer and you're not singing in the church, you're doing it for yourself.
That means what you're doing is selling the gospel, you're using it for your personal career, it's a sin.
Those things are over in the house of God.
The end of those things has come, every gift He has given us is used in the house of God.
If you want to use a gift to make money or get fame, don't do it with the saints.
Don't do that.
Those things must change and the day to change it has come.
Encourage those who want to serve God with the ability God has given them.
All that worldliness is over.

This month of praise we will give attention to praising the Lord in songs, in music, give attention to it.
This month, give a major time for praising God, for celebrating His name.
In 2020, when the world was shutdown, did you sing anywhere?
Don'copy the world and just put gospel, or the name of Jesus on it.
Singers jumping from church to church, be disciplined in the house of God.
Get involved with the house of God, stay in church.
If you're going to serve God, serve God correctly.
Serve under your Pastor.
Stay in the house of God and be disciplined. 
It's for your life, take it, it's a spiritual warning. 

Put the house of God first.
Prepare for the house of God.
Give time to the preparation of praise and worship to the King of glory.
You'll see the spirit of God manifesting Himself like never before.
In the Bible, there's no place where He told us to sing old songs, it's always 'sing new songs'.
God is asking for new songs.
God is doing something new in His church. It's time for the new songs, it's time to sing new songs. 
Have praise day. Praise Monday, praise Tuesday, praise Wednesday, praise Thursday..

They start in the choir, get popular then leave, that means they used the choir.
They think they're bigger than the choir.
What in the world do you think you are?
God saves the best for last.
God has proved them wrong, now we've got the best singers in our choirs.
You can't create a ministry for Christ.
The only ones we use to win souls must be conducted by the church.
Never neglect the church of God.
The local church, the ground and pillar of truth."

 - Pst Chris Oyakhilome

## KEEP SAYING IT!!!!!!! Hallelujah!!!!!!!~6015

📌 In The Name of the Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I set into motion right now, spiritual laws that can never be reversed:

📌 I walk in prosperity, in every area of my life. 
Prosperity is my birthright, righteousness is my birthright. Success is my birthright. 

📌 I am prosperous. I prosper and dwell in prosperity. I am established in prosperity, for God takes pleasure in my prosperity, therefore every thing I lay my hands upon to do prosper.

📌 I am not a product of chance. I am a product of prophecy: Predestination is at work in me. I do not meet people by accident. I meet with those ordained of God to encourage and promote the purpose of God for my life. 

📌 I walk in the 7-Fold Increase every day of my life. Increase in Grace, Increase in Ability, Increase in Knowledge, Increase in Wisdom, Increase in Fortune, Increase in Speed and Increase in Accuracy.

📌 God's favour promotes me and causes me to increase daily. I am God's "favourite" I'm a love child of a love God. Because the favour of God shields me, no sickness or disease has a right to live in my body. 

📌 People are remembering me for good NOW. The thought of me is blessing. I declare that Money is locating me now, in the name of The Lord Jesus Christ!  As money comes into my hands, I have Phronesis to know what to do with it. I treat money rightly. Therefore, money always knows my correct address and is ever up to date with my precise location. Money always has ways and reasons to come to me at all times, in every circumstance and in every place. Money is ever gravitating towards me; In The Name of Jesus Christ. 

📌 All doors are open unto me; all nations are open unto me; all businesses are open unto me in the Name of The Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

📌 I grow faster than every economy; I grow faster than inflation! Therefore, nothing is ever expensive for me. I set into motion right now, all the laws that magnetize money towards me consistently in ever increasing measures in The Name of The Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth!

📌 My eyes are open to see what God wants me to see. 
My ears are open to hear what God wants me to hear. 
My mind is open to learn what God wants me to learn. 
My heart is open to know and understand what God wants me to know and understand. 

📌 My eyes are open to see the needs of men and opportunities in every place and in every circumstance, and by the Spirit of God, I meet their needs! 

📌 I was born as an answer to the cry of Billions! And everything I ever require is available to me. 

📌 My mind is open to receive wise and brilliant revolutionizing, earth-shaking, money-making ideas from the Holy Ghost. As I receive these ideas, I have the boldness, the desire, the will, the ability, the wisdom, the grace, the power, and the authority necessary to bring it to fruitage. Therefore all the necessary permissions, resources, finances, knowledge and information gravitate towards me. In The Name of the Lord Jesus Christ!

📌 I am ordained of God to produce results. I produce results, I bring forth fruits! And my fruits remain, my results do not expire! I’m filled with power, I’m filled with the Holy Ghost, the anointing works in me, and it’s makes a way for me!

📌 I am a soul winner! I win souls! The gospel of Jesus is alive in my heart as a burning fire, shut up in my bones, and I am not quiet about it!

 📌 I’m full of God’s love. I’m full of faith! The love of God is shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Ghost who lives in me. Therefore, when I speak, people do listen to me, because I have the Spirit of love; I have the Spirit of faith, I have the Spirit of possibilities, I have the Spirit of hope, I have the Spirit of righteousness, and I have a spirit that dissolves doubts and explains hard sentences from which my language emanates!



## PREPARE TO MEET GOD, HE WILL BE HERE SOON~6033

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 1 CORINTHIANS 15:52 | KJV

I told you the church has 2000 years to reign in this earth, I took you from the book of Genesis through the whole Bible to show you Bible chronology, just to let you know according to the Bible where we are now. 

Satan is preparing because the Next major thing to happen in this earth is the Rapture of The Church of Jesus Christ. This is the next biggest thing that is about to happen. Yes there are some Christians and ministers who keep arguing that the rapture is not eminent. They say it is not about to take place. Some have even said Recently for Another 100 years it still not going to happen. 

But Remember, what exactly did Jesus tell us to do? He told us to live as people who are waiting for their master to return (Luke 12:36). Even some people abused us for making Gods people Afraid. How ridiculous it sounds. If you belong to Jesus and you are living for him, you can’t be Afraid when we talk about the rapture, you should be glad about it. 

Don’t let anyone in this world deceive you, the time is really short and Jesus is coming. These things happening in the world today are all the signs. If you follow carefully the chronology that I gave you, you will find out that anyone who said Jesus would have come in the 90s 70s is wrong. Because the calculations have been there and never added up to those times. Study the Bible by yourself and don’t let anyone mislead you. 

God bless you



## September The Month of Visualization!!!~6078





## COMMUNION SERVICE
5TH SEPTEMBER 2021~6089

Pastor Chris
 

Message of the Month. 

(Exodus 7:1, Deuteronomy 23:13-14, Joshua 6:1-3, 8:1-2, Jeremiah 1:3).
The Word "See" is Translated from several Hebrew words, with Different connotations. But particularly refer to 'visual images'. (2 Corinthians 5:17, 2 Corinthians 4:18).

Translated Behold, See,Lo with similar thoughts in communicating visual images. (Isaiah 23:30). 
 Look with the Eyes of the Prophet- 'Kazar'. Ra ar- To See. (Genesis 15:5, Revelation 6:5). It's about Visual Images. 

God wanted His People to look and See. If you listen a lot to negative things,fear will come into your Heart. And you'll believe Them. 

THIS MONTH OF SEPTEMBER IS OUR MONTH OF VISUALIZATION.

God wants us to use our Visual Powers. And you're gonna use yours. Visualization is the Design of Your Life and Circumstances. See! Satan Wants you to see everything else from his perspective so that you'll create Everything he wants. Cause You Are a Creator. Don't do it. Don't give him what he wants.
You construct your Life and Circumstances with Thoughts and Words.

 (Revelation 6:5-Example). You're going to Intentionally use Visualization. You choose to do it. Keep away from those things that'll work against your Construction. You're constructing your life. Scan! See can't be Generalized. When we pray,we don't just talk. We use the Power of Visualization. 

The Lord has given us Authority and Power and we are exercising those things. Faith is Substance. You're going to use your Faith, enrich your Mind. What do you want your life to be like Everyday?

## NEW COMMUNION SONG~6090

This bread is my body
Broken just for you
This cup is my blood
Shed just for you
As you eat this bread remember me
As you drink this cup remember me
It was all for you
I did it all for you

As I behold your loveliness
The more of you I see
As I behold your presence 
The deeper I get in you
There's no better place that I could be
There's no greater life than the one you gave 
It was all for me
You gave it all for me

Your body was broken
Your blood was shed
That I might live
You carried the cross
You hung on that cross
And you died for me
You went to the grave
And broke the chains
And set the captives free
You overcame darkness
And abolished death
You said it is finished
It was all for me
You did it all for me

I'm grateful ever grateful Lord
You did it all for me
I'm grateful ever grateful Lord
You did it all for me

I worship you
Lord I worship you
Yes I worship you
You did it all for me

Numbers 13:33

We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.”

For years, I agonised over what people thought about me. I didn't realise that the more I considered other people's impression of me, the less confident, the less bold, the more hesitant, I became daily. 

I lost opportunities because I didn't believe I could do them. I shrank back because I didn't think God would favour me. Why would He believe in me when people didn't believe in me. I couldn't reach for the sky. I couldn't believe in my dreams. 

Deuteronomy 1:8

See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the LORD swore he would give to your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—and to their descendants after them.”

👀. Look. Fix your gaze. Keep looking. 👀 what God says that you should 👀. Pastor Chris said "He who looks at the sun doesn't 👀 shadows".

We have an inner 👁. That 👁 puts the 📸 of what we read or hear in our minds. Remain in place and contemplate the 📸 you 👀 from God's Word that you hear. 

Mark 9:23

Jesus said, "If? There are no 'ifs' among believers. Anything can happen."

Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believes (it is possible).

A People of Prophecy 

The Loveworld prophetic channel 
The Loveworld Nation is a spirit powered nation

Psalm 89:19,21-24 KJV
Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. [21] With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him. [22] The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. [23] And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. [24] But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.

This is pastor Chris 

The difficulty in any city is the faith of the pastor

Ezekiel 37:1-10 KJV
The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, [2] And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. [3] And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest. [4] Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. [5] Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live: [6] And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord. [7] So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone. [8] And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath in them. [9] Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord God ; Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live. [10] So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.

Pastor takes out the lion, we take out the rest

Ippc is a place to enlarge your vision and capacity 

An exceeding great army is raised 

1 Timothy 1:18-19 KJV
This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare; [19] Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:

There's a Prophesy attributed to me, 

2 Timothy 2:4-5 KJV
No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. [5] And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.

We are in a time of war, Stay Focused 

Be Trained for the mandate

1 Timothy 1:19 KJV
Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:

War with faith

Prepare your heart to serve the lord - Focus

Prepare for the house of God both physical and spiritual 

Prepare with the gospel... preach to everybody,  Jesus died for everyone 

Prepare to meet God

Pastor is a captain and all our ministry platforms are team players

2 Corinthians 4:3-9 KJV
But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: [4] In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. [5] For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. [6] For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. [7] But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.

DAY 2 16TH NOVEMBER 2021

Morning Session 1

Pastor Chris Oyakhilome 

Three levels of knowledge 

1. Recognition 

2. Awareness 

3. Relationship 

First level of recognition, yes you're born again but you're not aware, it hasn't dawned on you. When you become aware of who He is, who you are, your language changes you now recognise the things that are not of God, your spiritual senses are now getting trained. You're beginning to walk by faith. Using your faith to get things, putting your faith to work. From there, you move to the next level

The HolyGhost guides you, conducts you, brings you from the first to the 2nd level of Awareness. 

I write to you young men   - Toy house

I write to you fathers           -  Real House

Different levels of knowledge 

You need to come to the 3rd level of Relationship with the Lord where you live, nothing moves you now. You work and protect it because nothing else matters but this relationship with God. Everything else seizes to matter. 

God has set eternity in our hearts.

That's what we train for

Until you discover it

Abraham saw Everything in a split second 

He wasn't looking at the distance 

He saw the world, he became the heir of the world. 

The new journey through the word and the guidance of the Holyspirit 

When you get to this level you can use your imagination in the spiritual realm.

You think about somethings in your mind and God responds.

Something wrong with the way the church has been worshiping wrongly for over 50 years, this needs to be corrected 

David was given the understanding of the spiritual 

Psalm 141:2 KJV

Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

1 Timothy 2:8 KJV

I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

1 Peter 2:5 KJV

Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

Our giving in the church is also spiritual sacrifice, because it's for the gospel 

Hebrews 13:15 KJV

By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.

Revelation 1:6 KJV

And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

Revelation 5:10 KJV

And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

1 Peter 2:9 KJV

But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:

Romans 12:6-8 KJV

Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; [7] Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; [8] Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

1 Peter 4:10-11 KJV

As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. [11] If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

Colossians 3:16 KJV

Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

Two parts here (To God & to me)

A.  teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,

B. singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

We admonish one another 

We encourage one another 

We sing and minister to the Lord 

Ephesians 5:19 KJV

## December The Month Of Thanksgiving!!!~6933





## December The Month Of Thanksgiving!!!~11860





## December The Month Of Thanksgiving!!!~15998





## December Communion Notes:~6963

Rev Chris Oyakhilome DSC DD

December is one of the months that you don't really need to ask "what is the message of the month?" Because, its the month of Thanksgiving.
Its full of Thanksgiving and of course, later this month, probably from next Sunday and the one following, you will be having an annual Thanksgiving service. 

I plan to read part of a verse that was strong in my mind as I reflected on this month.
I was thinking "what is on the Fathers mind?"
And as I was thinking about that, this was what dropped in my spirit in the scripture.

Revelation 19:7
Let us rejoice and be glad and give honor to him..

That second part of it is not connected to this message of the month. Its the first part that I want you to see. 

If you look at the NIV and the way its rendered, it says "let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory".

As I was reflecting on these thoughts and what's in the mind of the Father with respect to this message of Thanksgiving, I was drawn to the First Psalm of David, the man of God.

When you look at that Psalm (1 Chronicles 16:7-33)
This Psalm that's recorded here actually you find in bits and pieces in the book of Psalms (psalm 105, 96 etc)
But it's all put together in this historical writing of 1st Chronicles.

He constantly tells us to give thanks to God and give him glory and remind us of what God has done.

Its like Calling the people to remember what the Lord had done for them all through their past. How He put them over so many challenges of life.

Its very much related to the way we will think this month, when we realize all God has done for us in a month like this and how that He glorified his son Jesus in our lives.

Reflect back to March 2020 when they shut down the whole world. They called it a lockdown but it was a lock up.
All that period, the expectation was that the church was gone forever.
But they didn't have the power to neutralize Gods church.

In fact what they are seeking to do, to control the whole world under their umbrella, I've also said that's not going to happen until a certain time. 
All this that they are doing right now, is a wasted effort.

They are not going to get what they want because hat they want us devilish.
And the church of Jesus Christ is given authority in this age to glorify God through Jesus Christ.

2022 is the year the full clouds would empty themselves upon us both for circumstancial reasons and God's perfect timing.

Where we are now is not where we're going. 

All the prayers that seemed unanswered are storing up in the clouds and 2022 is the year the clouds will be emptied.

## PASTOR LANRE ALABI~7100

Why is Fasting Necessary?

The term 'Fasting' generally refers to a period of abstinence from food for the purpose of engaging in uninterrupted study, prayer and meditation with a clear objective and goal in focus.

Why is Fasting Necessary?
The scriptures are replete with numerous accounts of remarkable results and dramatic testimonies produced through Fasting. As Christians, Fasting is one of the godly exercises we should engage in regularly, with the promise of present and eternal benefits. The advantages are numerous, and here are a few:

• Through Fasting, we can improve our effectiveness in the things of the spirit. In simple terms, Fasting helps you to tame the flesh and lift the spirit. As Christians, we are required to walk in the spirit, always. This means to be spirit-controlled and not flesh-controlled. This is important because Rom 8:6 says "to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace" and also in John 6:63 our Lord Jesus said "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing. So how does Fasting help you to tame the flesh and lift the spirit?

One of the cravings of the body is food. It is a craving that is connected to the senses. When we fast, we deliberately abstain from food even though our body tcraves it. We resist the urge to eat thereby improving our mastery over the cravings of the body, and instead focus on activities that build the spirit. Of course, we could engage in activities that build our spirit without abstaining from food, but the abstinence from food adds a level of 'seriousness' and 'discipline' to the exercise.

• Fasting helps to sharpen our ability to receive or hear from God. It is like raising a spiritual antenna to pick the finer signals of the Spirit's communication. But how does this happen? When we Fast, abstinence from food is a key characteristic but that is not all. The Fasting exercise promotes focus and undivided attention to study and prayer. There should be a deliberate cessation of all unnecessary activity and a conscious increase in activities of that engage the spirit. This helps to unclutter the mind and remove the 'noise' or interference that often prevents the hearing of God's voice. During a period of Fasting, many have received clear direction and heard the voice of God in a more distinct way than before.

• Fasting can be a vehicle to effect dramatic and urgent change in things that pertain to us or even in the circumstances of others around us. In James 5:17 (amp) the scriptures assure us that "the earnest (heartfelt) prayer of a righteous man makes power available (dynamic)" which means power to effect changes, shift things, re-arrange things in the present or in the future can be produced by me – when I pray a certain way.

So how do I ensure my prayer is earnest and heartfelt. When you declare a Fast, you are raising the stakes. It is a declaration of seriousness and urgency in addressing the matter at hand. It helps you to be earnest in your prayers and certainly it will be heartfelt. Your heart is in it to the point that you are giving up eating to focus on the matter at hand. And when you pray like this, the results are guaranteed!

FASTING THE RIGHT WAY! MAKING IT EFFECTIVE

It is important to note that Fasting is not an effort to change God. When we fast, we are the ones that change and we are the beneficiaries of the Fast. Our Fasting does not change God for the scriptures say in Mal 3:6 "I am the Lord, I change not" So with this in focus, here are steps that can make our Fasting more effective;

• Have a clear objective in focus – what are your expectations from this Fast?

• The period of Fasting must include regular intervals of prayer, study and meditation on the Word. Having a clear focus and expectation will help guide your prayer, study and meditation time.

• Minimize unnecessary activity or distractions during the Fasting period. Though solitude may not always be achievable, strive to be 'alone' with the Spirit as much as possible.



## THURSDAY 30TH DECEMBER - PRAYER GUIDE FOR 31ST SERVICE AND END OF YEAR PRAYER AND FASTING:~7108

⭕ Pray that as we give ourselves more to the Word and fellowship with the Spirit in these final moments of the year of Preparation, the Lord is opening our eyes and guiding us with clarity into His divine will in all areas of our lives; we see and apprehend that which He has made available to us, as we get ready to receive the word for 2022, with our hearts sensitive and ready to follow His leading and instructions to precision. 📖 ISAIAH 45:1-3 - Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;  2- I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron:  3- and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.

 ⭕ Take time now to pray for yourself, declaring that you are in sync with God’s purpose, plan and timing for you in 2022. Speak in tongues and declare that your heart is being prepared as fertile ground for the Word, and God’s instructions for the coming year, and your life will be the manifestation of the working of that Word from the first day to the last, as you prepare diligently now to take a hold of it at the 31st Service. 📖 ISAIAH 55:10-11 - For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

PRAYING FOR THE 31ST SERVICE

 ⭕ Pray for all our personnel and officials for the 31st Service; declare that the work diligently in line with God’s purpose concerning their specific duties, manifesting divine ability, and we record outstanding success in every unit, resulting in the overall success of the program. 📖 EXODUS 31:3-5. And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship...

 ⭕ Pray that throughout the 31st Service, as Pastor ministers, a mighty spiritual force-field spreads over the entire world, and the authority of the Spirit that the Lord has given us will be in strong manifestation, such that even the hardest of hearts will yield to the gospel, and supernatural changes will occur in men’s lives, in families, in cities, nations and governments all around the world, in line with God’s purpose and timing for His saints and for the work of His Kingdom in the year 2022. 📖 EXODUS 40:34 - Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. 📖 MATTHEW 28:18-19 - And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost

## 2022 The Year Of The Gathering Clouds!!!~7119





## 2022: New Year Message~7131

Rev Dr Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DD

Today is a very special day for many reasons.

If we were to go by the things that happened in the first quarter of 2020, we should not even be here. 
If it were left to the globalists who wanted to destroy this world, who believed that they were in charge of this world, we should all have been hiding in our holes in fear of some virus; in fear that somehow something would get us 

The world was full of fear.. especially from the month of March 2020. The nations were completely paralyzed; locked down (I said It was actually a lock up).
It wasn't just me thinking it was a lock up. In the minds of those who orchestrated the lock down, it was a lock up.
In their hearts, meetings and plans, it was a lock up. It's very easy to know.

Shortly after, they said "if you will be free you must do this and that". They said " Public Liberty must now be censored". They redefined liberty..
No more personal liberty except defined within the confined of overriding public interest.
They knew they locked up the people. 
Lock up is imprisonment but they used the Euphemism of lock down because they didn't want to offend the sensibilities of the people.

We are able to meet around the world because the power of the name of Jesus is above all. 
That's why I say to you what Jesus already told us "Fear not".
We cannot be afraid 

I really welcome you to 2022. It is remarkable that we are here. 
It is extraordinary that we are here. 
Hallelujah!

It is a very special year and I want to begin to share with you some important things.

All over the world, so many are tuned in to this meeting right now from all nations.
We've got thousands and thousands of outlets reaching out to so many right now. 

This is so important because the things I'm sharing with you are missiles into the spirit 

In 2020 and 2021 I had many programs with you on the platform of "Your loveworld" . Because God wanted to strengthen and inspire you so that through the  word of God you would be propped up and propelled in those days of difficulty.

In that light I shared God's word and I'm sure it helped you and it still will 

Eccl.11.3a - If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: 


This year, the clouds will be full and begin to empty upon the earth. 
The clouds of prayer, faith and expectations. This year, those clouds will be full and empty themselves

Prayers that you have prayed. The faith that you have expressed. Your expectations that have already risen up in the clouds of God. They will empty and  pour out in answers. .this 2022, the clouds of prayer, faith and expectations are full and emptying out in the name of Jesus.

It's a special year.

Zechariah 10:1
Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain...

The word tells us of the former rain and the later rain.
The early rain is for sowing and the matter rain is for harvest. 
He is saying it's a rain of Harvest.
The Lord shall make Bright clouds and give rain... Showers of rain. 
To not some, but every one grass in the field. 

This is remarkable because of what this means. 

In James 5
Jas.5.7 - Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.
Jas.5.8 - Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.

The latter rain precedes the coming of the Lord.
He is telling us to be patient. 
Right after the latter rain, the Lord comes. 

This rain, from what we have seen in Zechariah 10, it means that there will be a revival, a harvest and following that Harvest is one more thing that you need to see.

John 11: 49-
This was when Jesus was arrested and brought before the High priest...

I am guided in the path of life and led by the Spirit in the direction of God’s perfect will for me. Today, I declare that I function in supernatural wisdom and this propels me to walk in divine health, strength, vigor, and peace, in Jesus’ Name.



## 2022 IS THE YEAR OF THE GATHERING CLOUDS~7241

Ecclesiastes 11:3a KJV

If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: 


This year the Clouds will be full and begin to empty out


Clouds of faith, prayers, expectations 

A year in which prayers i have prayed, faith expressed, expectations in prayers poured out in answers


Zechariah 10:1 KJV

Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.


Former rain =Sowing

Latter Rain = Harvest


The Lord shall make Bright Clouds and give showers of rain to EVERYONE GRASS, NOT SOME


James 5:7-8 KJV

Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. [8] Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.


The latter rain precedes the coming of the lord


Right after the latter rain, the Lord comes 


Means that there'll be a Revival and a  harvest and one more thing



John 11:49-52 KJV

And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, [50] Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. [51] And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; [52] And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.


Jesus was God's hand to gather together in one the children of God scattered abroad on all nations


The death of Jesus accomplished it, made it happen. 


They planned to crucify Jesus 


Jesus said if i be lighted up, I'll draw all men unto me.


His Crucifixion achieved this




2 Thessalonians 2:1 KJV

Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,


The gospel is God's method and wsy of reaching people.



A day is coming which the Lord has appointed to gather all men together unto him


1 Thessalonians 4:14-18 KJV

For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. [15] For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. [16] For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: [17] Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. [18] Wherefore comfort one another with these words.



Jesus came not win, or save men alone but to gather together all the children of God of all Nations to himself


This gathering is not on earth 


For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: [17] Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, 


When they died, their Spirit went to God but their bodies returned to dust


For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.


Their Spirits will come with Jedus and pick up their glorified bodies.


To live the full life, they need their bodies


Not disembodied Spirits.


In the twinkling of an eye, in a moment, our bodies will be changed 


At the first trumpet... the dead in christ comes out of death/graves


Second trumpet.....we who are alive join them and meet the Lord in the Air


Gathering together in the clouds


1 Thessalonians 4:17 KJV

Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.

- EXCERPTS FROM "YOUR LOVEWORLD SPECIALS SEASON 5 PHASE 5 - [DAY ]" WITH PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSc, DD.

✍We are the light of the world and we will not be overcome by darkness, we will not be over shadowed by darkness.

✍Our role has been cut out for us, to display the virtue and perfection of Christ.

✍Christ has called us to rule the world for Him. We are the light of the world.

✍As God’s people, we need to be very careful of nomenclature. Those who want to inculcate their values and make you what they are.

✍Jesus does not exaggerate, He speaks only the truth. Remember, Christ is the way, the truth and the life.

✍We must not allow the threats of evil to let us fear. You have to look beyond them because they are fallen. These forces of evil, these princes of darkness, have all been defeated.



## June The Month Of Prayer With Unending Praise!!!~9745





## GLOBAL DAY OF PRAYER 
24th June 2022~9967

Rev. Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DD 

Praise and worship to God is the Highest form of prayer. 
There are different forms of prayer but the highest of them all is praise and worship.

You can worship God in different ways and about different things. But when you praise him it is different.
You praise him according to his mighty works. you recognize him with his own definition and praise him with his words.

Today we are praying much as we have done in the last couple of years since 2020 when we began the global day of prayer and praying has changed so many things.
This is for 24 hours plus. Meaning that since we started almost an hour ago, leading up till tomorrow at about this time, a chain of Unending praying and prophesying God's word to build and inspire faith. 
We will have several ministers of the gospel sharing with us 
Right after I'm done, Pastor Benny is also going to be sharing with us 

We have made tremendous impact through prayer.
Had the churcb been praying like this before now, there would never have been Covid and to make sure that doesn't happen again, we are going to pray 
As long as the church is on this earth, there are things that should not happen.
And covid and it's associated wicked impact is one of those things that should not have happened.

A couple of days ago, Joe Biden said they are expecting what he called the second pandemic. 

They had this agenda 2030, a plan for a new world order to come into place by 2030. When they saw that what they had done worked so well, they felt, they didn't have to wait. I told you this was their best opportunity yet. So they don't want to let it go. 

But what it reminds me of is when the children of Israel after they had come out of Egypt at the edge of the red sea. Gold told Moses to split the waters.
So, the Israelites went into the red sea on dry ground.
The Egyptians saw that, and said "we got them. Let's go". so they went after the Israelites.

But God told Moses that when the Last of the Israelites got out, He should stretch out his hands. And the congealed waters came back and covered the Egyptians and not one of them escaped.

So I see these Satanic Globalists doing the same thing.
They so believe they've conquered the world. They believe they have an opportunity here. So instead of 2030, they brought it closer.
That's why I really want to thank everyone of you who joined us in prayer. 

Remember I told you about the amendments being pushed by the WHO, WEF and the US Biden Governemnt.
They needed a member nation to push  for the amendment of the IHR of 2005. 
Most of the world was taken by surprise. They didn't know what was going on.
It was worse than the pandemic treaty that nations were tricked into signing. They wanted to Usurp the sovereignty of nations and bring in their new world order with a one world government initially led by the director general of the WHO.
There had been an agreement between the WHO AND THE WEF, which wouldn't have been because the member nations had not signed into it.

But God saw it and awakened us to it.
I told you that even if people went into the street to protest, it wouldn't produce result unless we bind the strong man of the spirit. 

And I called on you to fast and pray and we die for 7 days. 
And after that, I said to you that the spirit of God wanted us to go further (3 days). And we did. 
And when we did.
Let me show you 2 articles. I want you notice the language

"WHO IHR Amendments defeated in Geneva"

"WHO forced into humiliating back down".

That's to tell you that it was not normal.
They suffered a humiliating defeat 

Had we not done that praying, our world would have not been the same right now.

They wanted to do that through Simple majority. By their math, they had everything.
At the end of their conference in 28th of May, you would have woken up to find that your country had lost its sovereignty.

## August The Month Of Meditation!!!~10419





## GLOBAL COMMUNION SERVICE
MONTH OF AUGUST~10440

We are going to make a lot of progress for the rest of the year. This month will help you intiate the amazing things that the spirit of God will do in your life the rest of this year.

Why would we have needed the spirit of truth if not that the world was going to be filled with so much darkness and deception?
Jesus warned us. Now you understand why you need to be filled with the holy spirit. With the holy spirit, you won't be deceived. He will guide you to the truth.
We have got to reach the whole world. We have to take it seriously. Preach to the whole world and to their worlds.

You cannot crown Jesus. 
The only one crowned in the bible was the antichrist. 
No one called Jesus 'Jesus' after He resurrected. He was called 'Lord'. You cannot talk to him directly and address him like that. If you know him, you won't address him that way. 

You're going to make so much progress. You will advance on every side.

Josh.1.8 - This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.

Look what he tells you to do.
Did you notice here he was talking to Joshua at the very beginning of his leadership, after the death of Moses. The Lord showed him how to be a success in his life and how to be progress. 
This book of the law: This was the word of God given to them
Shall not depart out of your mouth; you've got to talk it. The word of the Lord must not depart from your mouth.
Meditate on the word day and night.
Meditate : Hagar- to meditate, ruminate, cogitate, to mutter, to roar.
I did teach on the three levels of meditation. 
If you meditate on it, You will observe to do. You will become a doer. 
When you meditate on it, it will stay in your heart and your heart will compel you to act accordingly. 
You will find yourself doing the word. 
You will make your way prosperous. 
You will have good success. 


1Tim.4.15 - Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.

This is remarkable. 
Meditate: to revolve in your mind. To imagine. To contemplate. To give attention. To focus ones attention. 

What things was Paul talking about? 

1Tim.4.12 - Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

He was telling Him what life to live if he was going to be successful. 
Are you pushed to do things that are wrong because of the environment in which you live! Or because of things you see on the internet? Don't you know that Jesus is the Lord of your eyes?.. you don't look at, or read everything. You have to live a sanctified life. 

Profiting: advancement, progress. 
Appear: to spread abroad. To become apparent. Openly manifest.

When Jesus said "when you pray, go into your closet to pray. The father who sees in secret will reward you openly". That's the same word used in the above scripture. 
The Lord will reward you publicly. 
You will make such progress that can not be denied. 

Your advancement will become apparent to all and spread abroad. 

This month of August is the month of Meditation.
You are about to spread abroad. 
To make such advancement that cannot be denied. 
But the secret is what we do this month. 
Mutter the word, confess the word. Meditate day and night. Soak your spirit with the word of God.
At the end of August, you will know that you have made a lot of progress and in the montjs following, the results will begin to show. 

Some warnings for our young people
Prov.19.18 - Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.

Read in NIV: Discipline your children, for in that there is hope. Do not be a willing party to their death.

Foundation school is Compulsory and must be taken seriously. Start building the blocks of your life with success in the word.



## 5 THINGS TO DO TO DEVELOP YOUR DIVINE NATURE~10475

1. THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORD(ACTS 20:32)

▪The only way God can build you is by His word.

▪You need the knowledge of the word. The knowledge of God's word that you have determines your quality of life. All Christians don't have the same quality of life even though Jesus died for them all.

2. MEDITATION ON THE WORD

▪Some people know the word. They can quote the scriptures but they don't meditate.

▪So you wonder how come this guy knows the word and he's so indiscipline!. You can see his isn't going in the right direction but he can quote lots of scriptures. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?...Those scriptures are in his head!

▪You can memorise anything but it changes your life when you take them into your spirit through meditation. When you meditate, your system is soaked and you start living the life. You become a walking Bible.

1 TIMOTHY 4:15(Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear unto all.)

▪That means you cannot hide this progress. Your progress becomes evident to all. If you will meditate on the word of God and you will grow spiritually, others will take notice of your growth, of your progress. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE IT!

3. PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT

▪Praying in the spirit will do two(2) beautiful things for you, even though there are lots of them:

1⃣ 1 Corinthians 14:2(For he that speaketh in an unknown speaketh not unto men, but unto God, for no man understandeth him;howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.)

▪When you pray in tongues, you speak mysteries. Mysteries about your life, about your home, about your job. These mysteries are "creative" mysteries. These have to do with your life and the life of others and you are arranging things in the realm of the spirit.

▪How can you achieve all the things that you have to do?.... It's by praying in the spirit!

▪As you pray in the spirit, the Spirit of God does things your mind can't comprehend.

▪Do you want your life to be smooth, that no matter what happens you're a success non the less?....Pray in the spirit!!!

▪There are people who face a little crisis and they fall. But there are those who say "come what may, I'll still be standing victoriously". Because I'm speaking mysteries in the spirit, arranging things in my life.

ROMANS 8:28(And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.)

▪It's impossible for me to be disadvantaged. It's impossible, absolutely impossible because ALL things work together for good for me!!!!! Hallelujah!. There's no disadvantage to the child of God! We don't loose.

2⃣ Edification

1 CORINTHIANS 14:4(He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself.)

▪When you speak in tongues you build yourself. You improve yourself, you edify yourself!

▪You want to improve yourself?

SPEAK IN TONGUES!

▪The day you received the Holy Spirit, He came with His language. That language is resident in you. All you have to do is switch from your brain to your spirit.

▪If you will pray in tongues, if you would do it everyday, you'd become unmovable and unshakable. Even when you hear bad news, you say " it's working for my good, no disadvantage, it's already in check!"

GLORY!!!!!



## YOUR NAME IS A CONFESSION~10651

▪️All Over the World, people bear names that represent different things. 

▪️Some names represent personalities, landmarks or events, and they’re handed down from one generation to another. 

▪️Many times, Christians have found themselves bearing names that contradict what they believe. 

▪️Those names were handed to them by their forbears, and not many ever bothered to find out the meaning of those names to be sure they’re consistent with who we are in Christ.

▪️It’s no use answering the name that contradicts what you believe about the Gospel and who you are in Christ, for it can work against you. 

⭐ The Name you answer is a major confession in your life. 

⭐ As you answer that name you’re continually confessing the meaning of that name. 

⭐ If you STUDY the Bible, you’ll notice how God changed the names of several people. 

⭐ Before their names were changed, they lived the life of the name they bore. When God changed their names, their destinies also changed.

▪️Abraham, for example, which means father of many, used to be called Abram, meaning “exalted or assumed father".

📖 GENESIS 17:5

5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.

⭐ He and his wife were without a child until their names changed to Abraham and Sarah. 

⭐ Isaac’s son, Jacob is another example. His name meant “one that takes by the heel; deceiver.” 

⭐ In today’s rendition, that would mean, “swindler, fast guy, or scammer.” 

⭐ Of course, he grew up to answer his name; he deceived his father, cheated his brother, and remained a cheat until God met him and changed his name (Genesis 32:27-28).

📖 GENESIS 32:27-28

27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

▪️To answer a name means that you agree to, confess and endorse the meaning and import of that name in your life. 

▪️That’s why you ought to answer only names that are consistent with God’s purpose for you; names that glorify God’s Word and are consistent with your identity and position as a new creation in Christ Jesus.

🗣️ Say This Prayer:

Dear Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I thank you for giving me a new name according to your divine plan for me. I am success, a victor, and more than a conqueror; I’m not just the effulgence of the glory of God, my name is “the glory of God”! Prosperity, divine health, joy and peace are all mine, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## IPPC DAY 1 EVENING SESSION,  SUPER SESSION TWO  BY PASTOR JOY AMEINKHIEN - STUBBORN FAITH- THE FAITH LIFE OF A MINISTER~11686

Stubborn faith doesn't mean you're Stubborn, it's about taking a stand for God.


Heb11:1


Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report.

Hebrews 11:1 - 2 KJV

And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:

Hebrews 11:32 KJV


Get it rght the first time


1 Samuel 17:26,32-36 KJV

And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? [32] And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. [33] And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. [34] And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: [35] And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. [36] Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God.


Go After it.....

What are the challenges you're facing

Bring it down with your proclamations of faith. 

Watch what David said

Run towards the challenge not away from it... As David did to Goliath 


1 Samuel 17:41-47 KJV

And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield went before him. [42] And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. [43] And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. [44] And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. [45] Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. [46] This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. [47] And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord's, and he will give you into our hands.


1 Samuel 17:48-51 KJV

And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. [49] And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. [50] So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David. [51] Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.

It doesn't matter what the challenge may be 

Don't be afraid, NEVER be afraid 

We have Conquered this World

What about Paul 

The More difficult you are, the more difficult your city is

2 Corinthians 11:23-27 KJV

## YOUR MIND IS YOUR CAPITAL~13944

═══════════════
📖"Everyone admires a man with good sense, but a man with a warped mind is despised" (PROVERBS 12:7 TLB)
═══════════════

There are too many people who think the most important requirement for success is money. So they go for money, and all their  lives, they keep going for more until they get frustrated. That's not how to become a success. 

Success always begins with a dream. Joseph was a young man who had a dream of success. His brothers envied him for his dream and tried to kill him. But they couldn't kill him. Instead, they sold him into slavery in Egypt. It's hard to kill a man with a dream. Joseph's dream kept him alive until it eventually came to pass. If you have a dream and you're disciplined enough to pursue it, nothing can ever stop it from coming to pass. The only person that can kill your dream is you.

═══════════════
Your dream in life shouldn't be about how or where to get money. Instead, it should be about improving your world to be a better place than you met it. To realize your dream, you need capital, and by that, I don't necessarily mean money. Money is not the most important capital you need to realize your dream. The first and most vital capital is your mind. That's what determines whether you become a success or not.

Your mind is where earth-shaking ideas are born. Those ideas, if properly harnessed, are more valuable than money. Money is a slave of your ideas. If you nurse your ideas long enough and discipline yourself in the direction of ideas, money will eventually come looking for you.

It's important what you set your mind upon everyday. Get rid of the wrong stuff that won't do your mind any good and go for edifying and educative material that will help you think right. Polish your ideas; refine them and get ready for a great future!

You’re God’s vessel, sanctified to be in fellowship with Him through the Holy Spirit. Don’t jeopardize that communion because of a bad attitude or worldly lifestyle. 2 Corinthians 13:5 says, “Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves” Don’t live the wrong life: don’t get yourself entangled with the things of this world, for the Bible says, “No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life” (2 Timothy 2:4). You were separated from the World through the Gospel, but you’ve got to take the world out of you, through the sanctification of your mind and soul. This happens as you yield to the authority and lordship of the Word, and guidance of the Holy Spirit in your life.



## #RealityCheck~13979

It’s important that, always, the spread of the Gospel around the world is top priority to you. Matthew 24:14 (TLB) says, “And the Good News about the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, so that all nations will hear it, and then, finally, the end will come.” These compelling words reiterate the urgency of the moment— the need to preach the Gospel throughout the world, to every man, woman, boy and girl; It’s our responsibility to make it happen.



## #RealityCheck~13990

There’s no other reason for you being on earth than to demonstrate God's glory in bringing others to Him, and also to train for the Spirit-life. This is why you must use your earthly resources, the things that He has blessed you with, for the furtherance of the Gospel. Your relevance in the spread of the Gospel is one of the major reasons He channels prosperity your way. Your involvement in soul winning attracts more grace and prosperity to your life.



## #RealityCheck~13999

Be Spirit-ruled and Word-governed. Refuse to be stirred by and attracted to fleshly things. The Bible says, “they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh” (Romans 8:5). What are the things that stir you up? Remember, where a man’s treasure is, there will his heart be also. You’re after the Spirit if your affection, time and energies are focused on things pertaining to Christ, His Gospel, and the eternal life that He’s given us. So, let the Word of God control your values, ideas, opinions, choices and decisions.



## #RealityCheck~14024

Always remember that the challenges you face, irrespective of how they come, are subject to change. Your role is to act on the Word; keep affirming who you are in Christ. As you keep your focus on the Word, you’re metamorphosed, and every unfavourable situation will align with your status as an associate of the God-kind.



## #RealityCheck~14032

Yield yourself to knowledge. Have a voracious appetite for the Word. Those who don’t know the Word easily get overwhelmed by circumstances, and defeated by the crises of life. But through the knowledge of God, grace and power over crisis (peace) are multiplied in your life (2 Peter 1:1-3). Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~14101

Being born of the Spirit, you’re sustained by the Spirit; He’s the life of your physical body. Romans 8:11 says, “But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.” Become more conscious of the God-life in you, and give expression to your divine nature in Christ.



## #RealityCheck~14109

The primary reason for your mouth is to steer your life in God’s direction for you. 1 Peter 3:10 declares, “For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.” It’s that simple: you can have a great life and enjoy your days in God’s blessings and goodness if you’d use your tongue aright. It’s about what you say!



## #RealityCheck~14123

The more knowledgeable you are in the things of the Spirit, the more humble you become. If your knowledge in Christ, and of God, doesn’t produce a greater level of humility in you, then something is wrong; your knowledge is of the flesh and such knowledge puffs up (1 Corinthians 8:1). True knowledge of God is the knowledge of the Spirit, and in unity with His Spirit. The more you know Him, the more you reveal and reflect Him in your thoughts, character, words and actions.



## #RealityCheck~14136

Every day, we’re presented with opportunities to be offended. Offences will come, according to the Bible. People will do things that may hurt or offend you, but it’s entirely up to you to decide whether or not to be offended. Always remember that it’s to your glory to overlook an offence. Don’t say, “I can’t take that insult for any reason!” You’ve been decorated with honour and kingdom dignity; no one, and nothing, can dishonour you.



## #RealityCheck~14252

In expressing love to others, it’s not about what you stand to gain. It’s about your love for God and desire to do His will. So, even when it isn’t convenient, you have to walk in love. Even if those you love disdain you, continue to love them. Tell yourself, “I’m going to walk in love, no matter what.” Walking in love is proof that you love the Lord. Therefore, let your life be the out-shining of divine love.



## #RealityCheck~14260

Ephesians 5:2 says, “And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.” To walk with God, you’d have to love like Him. Help those around you stand strong, and make their lives better. You’re called to be a blessing to your world. Today, consciously look out for opportunities to express God’s love.



## #RealityCheck~14267

You’re unique, and so is your destiny in Christ. Nobody can do it exactly like you. Therefore, get excited about your uniqueness. Fulfil your purpose. Be what God made you to be. He planned before the foundation of the world that you’d serve Him and live for Him. Through you, His righteousness would be established in the earth, and in the hearts of men.



## #RealityCheck~14290

Utilise every opportunity at your disposal to win souls and bring sinners to Christ. Make every moment count; maximise the time as God’s ordained agent of salvation, to turn sinners from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God! Remember, this glorious Gospel of the blessed God has been committed to your trust (1 Timothy 1:11). So, we must preach it with the urgency and passion that it deserves. Just to think that we’re the custodian of His message of salvation is simply sublime; something that even the angels wonder at. But it’s our calling.



## #RealityCheck~14321

Many hardly take the time to review their own thinking process; how their minds work. A mind that’s not renewed with the Word will often come up with some of the weirdest thoughts. Such minds are filled with negativism. Until you change your way of thinking, your life and circumstances won’t change. You’ve got to choose the character of your thoughts. Take charge of your thoughts. God gave us the ability to monitor our thoughts; to accept or reject the wrong thoughts. So, always, be sure that your thoughts are wholesome.



## #RealityCheck~14343

There’s a difference between your thinking process and your mindset. What’s a mindset? It’s a habitual or characteristic mental attitude that determines how you interpret and respond to situations. Each one of us has a mindset, but the important thing is the origin of your mindset. The Word of God must frame and shape your mental attitude and disposition to life; otherwise, you’re sunk. Studying and meditating on the Word of God will give you a peculiar mindset; the mindset of the righteous.



## #RealityCheck~14350

Don’t just listen to any preacher or teacher because they seem to be saying something religious. Don’t receive counsel from just anyone, neither should you read every book and listen to every preacher you see on TV. The Bible says to prove every doctrine; it’s the reason you must study and know the Scriptures for yourself, so you’re not tossed around by every wind of doctrine. Your behaviour, your life, would be greatly affected by their communication (Ephesians 4:14).



## #RealityCheck~14375

You've got to be mindful of your associations; those you listen to and relate with; they can corrupt your life. You may think the communication or information being passed to you is harmless. But it’s akin to somebody sowing the wrong seeds in your garden, while you simply look on. Those seeds would certainly grow. You may say, “I’m just listening or reading the book; I really don’t believe the message.” Don’t be deceived; they’re sowing seeds into your life that’ll reproduce.



## #RealityCheck~14416

If you’d learn to use the Name of Jesus in your life, in everything you do, you’d be amazed at the victories and extraordinary blessings you’d experience every day. His Name is an instrument, a great blessing for us in the New Testament. The Word tells us to use the Name of Jesus in all things. Colossians 3:17 says, “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.” You couldn’t fail or lose in His Name! His Name is the key that unlocks every door!



## #RealityCheck~14421

Irrespective of the darkness and evil in the world in these last days, you’re to shine ever so brightly. So, what’s happening is, while there’s darkness in the world, we’re not waiting for the light of God to shine; rather, we shine, for He’s made us His light in a dark world. How do you shine? It’s by acting out God’s Word; living out the Gospel; doing the works of God. Matthew 5:16, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”



## #RealityCheck~14425

Just as we all have different mindsets, we all also have different world views; for a lot of people, their world view is formed by what they read or hear in the news media. God gave us His Word to show us what our political inclinations should be, what views we should hold. His Word is given to guide us, to give us understanding and point us in the right direction in all things. Live and see from God’s perspective only. His Word is light; the light in which you must live. That way, irrespective of the decadence in this present world, you’ll live in continuous victory and prosperity, and joy, because you’re living from the mountain top. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~14437

It doesn’t matter where you are in your life today or what’s in front of you; you can always know what to do to win, if you’d consult the extraordinary strategist. It makes no difference how hopeless the situation may seem; He knows what to do. He’s never confused, even when you seem flustered. He knows the way out of every crisis you face. He knows how to make you a success. He has the best strategies for your business, your job, your ministry, and your finances. All you need is to depend on Him for direction. Follow His Word and the counsel He gives you from within.



## #RealityCheck~14444

Being a Christian, you’ve been commissioned to preach the Gospel; to take the message of God’s saving power to your world and beyond; the way you deliver it has a lot to do with the quality of your personality. This is why you must be fully yielded to the Word of God to mould your life and character. None of us was made for “dishonour”; each one of us has been raised for His glory, but you can decide if you’re going to be a vessel of honour or a vessel of dishonour, by the kind of life that you live.



## #RealityCheck~14450

Follow the Lord and His Word, not your emotions or opinions. As long as God has given the Word, you ought to say, “Yes Sir,” because He’s the Boss. It’s not about you, it’s about Him; you voice His will, plans and purpose, not yours or anyone else’s. Irrespective of your opinions, the Word of God is forever true! So, if the Word says it, you’re going to have to do it, even if it doesn’t align with your culture. We’re God’s messengers; we preach for God, not for ourselves.



## #RealityCheck~14466

Your mind is very important. It’s the door to your spirit, and it’s also the door from your spirit out, to bring something into the natural world. You've got to scrutinise the thoughts you allow to go through your mind, to be sure they’re consistent with God’s Word and His perfect will for your life. Now that you’re born again, you’re required to think excellence and only see pictures of excellence. Focus your mind on things that are pure, just, honest, lovely, virtuous and of good report (Philippians 4:8). You can’t afford to continue with the old way of life; you’re different now.



## #RealityCheck~14476

Remember that your life has a purpose, and the purpose of God for you is revealed and becomes clearer as you fellowship with the Word and the Spirit. He’ll grant you insight through the Scriptures. He’ll bring your thoughts to something that He wants you to know now, that you can apply to your life. Then, His wisdom will leap out of the message and inundate your heart, and you find that you’re walking the path of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding.



## #RealityCheck~14484

One of the things you must make up your mind to do is to be very serious with your Christianity. Don’t profane spiritual things or play games with the Spirit. Some people become so carnal and casual with spiritual things and don’t realize when they’ve walked away from God and His plan for their lives. Don’t allow bitterness or anger prevent you from fulfilling your destiny in Christ. Make up your mind to live in the Word, and by the Spirit of God. Follow spiritual instructions and be excited about your service in the house of God.



## #RealityCheck~14555

Irrespective of the evil, darkness, and negativism in this world, you must think differently. Be unperturbed, because you’re in Christ, and in Him you always win. Nothing can be set against you. In your journey of faith, and in fulfilling God’s plan for your life, don’t entertain thoughts of fear, lack or unbelief. Put away anger, bitterness and unforgiveness. These are the things that can hinder your spiritual progress and the call of God on your life. Keep your heart in God’s Word.



## #RealityCheck~14564

The Christian belongs in God’s class; he’s not a mere religious person. Christianity isn’t a religion at all; it’s the active life of God in a human being. Christianity is Christ alive in you; it’s a real relationship with the real and living Christ. In Christianity, the divine life of Jesus Christ is imparted to you; it’s a real experience. Christ took up His abode in you the instant you were born again. When you really get to know this, every day of your life, you’ll be so full of joy!



## #RealityCheck~14579

In our world today, there’re so many distractions, but you must remain focused on the dream, the vision, that the Lord has put in your heart. Have a tunnel-vision towards God’s agenda. It’s the way to win. Don’t look around. Be focused; refuse to be distracted.



## #RealityCheck~14586

When was the last time you gave thanks for something you realised you needed, without having to ask God for it? That’s the life you ought to be living as a Christian. Cultivate the lifestyle of thanksgiving. All things are yours already; therefore, when you think there’s something you require, give thanks to God for it, because you know it’s yours already. The Father loves you so much; there’s nothing you’d have to 'drag' Him to do for you. Your response - your faith attitude - should be a daily life of praise and thanksgiving to Him for His grace and loving-kindness.



## #RealityCheck~14605

Remember, you’re the architect of your own life, with the design brief from your heavenly client. An architect is able to walk through the length and breadth of a skyscraper in his mind, by reason of his training, even before the foundation of the building is laid. To him, that building is already a reality, even though it may still be on paper. Likewise, let the image of your glorious life and future be so clear and real in your spirit as you spend time in prayer and meditation.



## #RealityCheck~14623

There’re people who won’t fulfil their calling, as it has happened in history, because of anger. And in such cases, what God does is to have another plan. Don’t let it happen to you. Why should anyone miss out with God, and fail in their divine destiny, because of a negative attitude that could easily be controlled and overturned with God’s Word? Psalm 37:8 (NIV) says, “Refrain from anger and turn from wrath” Act on God’s Word. Refuse to let anger rule you.



## #RealityCheck~14638

Never allow the glorious Gospel you’ve been entrusted with be tainted with any kind of discrimination or prejudice. Refuse it! The Word of God transcends all cultural, ethnic or national barriers. If you minister the Word of God in truth, it’ll break barriers and separate between those that are in bondage and those who really want to hear the truth. Truth has neither colour nor borders. Truth is divine! And the Word of God is truth (John 17:17).



## #RealityCheck~14645

2 Corinthians 5:17 says "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. We’re a new species; a kind of creature that never existed before; a new type of man! When you come to this realization and understanding that what you have isn’t a mix of the divine and human natures, you’ll cease from the struggles to live right, and you’ll find yourself fulfilling God’s will for your life gloriously from a position of rest. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~14654

Make God's love your heartfelt contemplation; stay and be at rest in His unrivalled and unconditional love for you. If you ever comprehend this truth, it’ll suddenly awaken in you, your value, and you’d never be discouraged, despondent, fearful, afraid, intimidated, or ashamed, irrespective of the challenges. Your consciousness of His love for you makes you a success and a victor forever.



## #RealityCheck~14659

God has a plan for your life, an excellent one at that! Remember, He’s gracious and of loving kindness; your role is to discover that plan and walk in the light of it. As you study and meditate on the Word, you become more and more acquainted with His plans for your life. You must yield yourself to the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He’s the One who helps you understand the Scriptures. He grants you insight into the mysteries and realities of the Kingdom. He’s in you to help you fulfil God’s plan for your life.



## #RealityCheck~14666

The day you were born again, your destiny in God began. You were set on a preordained path of righteousness: predestination is at work in you. You don’t go anywhere or meet anyone by chance. Your life has a purpose with God; He leads you by His Spirit that lives in you. And in that path that He’s set for you to walk is everything you’ll ever require to fulfil all that He’s called you to do, and meet those that He’s planned for you to meet. Some of them may not like you or even want to see you, but because they’re put there by God, whatever they do would only turn out as blessing and promotion for you.



## #RealityCheck~14673

Refuse to be burdened with stress and anxiety. Don’t worry about your work, family, business, finances, or anything. Worry is fear in disguise. It’s fear of negative possibilities; the imminence of unwanted outcomes. Fear attracts its images. The cure for worrying is living in God’s Word; act on the Word. Rather than worry, receive whatever you require, and live in the consciousness of Christ’s victory, grace and abundant provisions. Anything short of a life of absolute joy and fulfilment in Christ Jesus isn’t God’s best for you.



## #RealityCheck~14693

The real essence of Christianity is Christ in you, manifesting and expressing Himself in, and through you. The Christian is one who expresses and demonstrates the life, nature, character and righteousness of Christ. This is one of the things you check in appraising yourself spiritually; how much your actions, attitude, words and character epitomise Christ. In all you do, and at all times, refuse to yield to the flesh; rather, respond from your Christ-nature.



## #RealityCheck~14703

All that God wants manifested in you is Christ; touching and changing lives through you. The prophet said, “he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days” (Isaiah 53:10); you’re that seed. Hallelujah! You reveal the glory and beauty of Christ. That glory is in your spirit, where Christ dwells. Therefore, look inwards; see the glory within and reveal the same to your world.



## #RealityCheck~14718

Your experience should never affect your confidence in the Word. The Word never fails. The Word of God is truth, irrespective of what your experiences might be. Just because it’s been several days or months and there’s still no change as you expect doesn’t mean the Word isn’t working. You must understand that Christian growth and maturity is progressive and there’s a fight of faith. Train yourself in the Word and in the faith life; you don’t give up! You stand your ground, confident that God’s Word will prevail over circumstances and put you over all the time.



## #RealityCheck~14730

When God puts you in a particular job or business, His interest isn’t about the office or your designation. What matters to Him is how effectively you’re using your office to promote His righteousness. He wants you passionate for the Gospel, and the establishment of His Kingdom in the hearts of men and nations of the earth. Everywhere you are, be busy for the Lord. Stand for Him. You’re His ambassador, and a minister of reconciliation (2Corinthians 5:20-21). What counts the most in your life is what you do with the Gospel, for the salvation of men, regardless of your vocation.



## #RealityCheck~14736

Your reaction to challenges and adversities of life will be to the extent of how much of the Word is richly deposited in your spirit. In the day of crisis, you can only pull from the reservoir of the Word in you. If the Word isn’t dwelling in you richly, your response would be from your head, and out of fear; and that wouldn’t work. The Word of God that you’ve imbibed—that has gained the ascendancy in your spirit—is what puts you over in the day of trouble.



## #RealityCheck~14743

Preach the Gospel. Minister the Word to those in your world. The Bible says He’s made you an “able minister of the New Testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life” (2 Corinthians 3:6). You’re God’s mouthpiece; speak for Him! Do His work. Do great things for the Kingdom. Be bold. Let nothing keep you quiet. Keep bearing His message of faith, hope and love with urgency, for the end of all things is near (1 Peter 4:7).



## #RealityCheck~14750

There’ll never be an updating of the Bible. What you believe and live by must be consistent with what the Bible says. The Word of God is, and must be, your guiding principle for life. Many are being subtly lured into the wrong path, with scriptures being misinterpreted, and they think everything is fine; something is wrong. The Bible says, “Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith” (2 Corinthians 13:5 NIV). There’s no other way to examine yourself besides the Word of God.



## #RealityCheck~14763

God gave us His Word, so that you may boldly respond in consonance with it. That’s what changes your life. The promise alone doesn’t change your life; the principle must be applied. You don’t merely “quote” what God has said; you give your personal faith-response to the Word, on the basis of your understanding of His required response. An accurate response is learned through the Word, and the Holy Spirit. He gave us mouths so we can vocalize and use His Word to mould and shape our lives and destinies in the direction of His perfect will.



## #RealityCheck~14769

Be resolved to serve God with your life, to live as a Christian, no matter what! Make a decision that’s worthy of Jesus, because He made a decision to save you. Never allow any form of distraction in your service to the Lord and spreading of the Gospel around the world. Let it be so strong that even your countenance conveys it.



## #RealityCheck~14790

These are perilous times; the Bible says, “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come” (2Timothy 3:1). We’re in that time that was spoken about, and only those who walk in the dominion of the Word, in the consciousness of their victory in and through the Word, will prevail. So, learn the Word of God for yourself, for your life. Store it in your heart, and let it come out of your mouth, “for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh” (Matthew 12:34).



## #RealityCheck~14811

Praise is our profuse expression of appreciation of the goodness, blessings, kindness and righteousness of God. It’s the appreciation or confession of His character. When you say, “Lord, you’re gracious and kind; you’ve blessed me; you’re righteous, etc.,” you’re defining and appreciating His character; that’s praise. When you worship the Lord in that light, it shows who He is in your life; it separates Him from everyone else and from everything else; the necessary result is that He’ll do more in your life.



## #RealityCheck~14830

There’s so much that we can do when we take advantage of our authority and dominion in Christ. Too many Christians have been too quiet about many things, living as though they’re victims in life; no! Take charge; you’re in office. You’re seated with Christ in the place of power, in the position of authority; you have His dominion; it’s yours by right; so, use it! Make things right in your life, in your home, in your ministry, job, business, city, nation, etc., using the Name of Jesus. That Name is greater than every government, or institution, name or title that could be conferred, both in this world and in the world to come.



## #RealityCheck~14837

Jesus Christ is the effulgence of the Father’s glory; the express image of His Person (Hebrews 1:3). And that’s exactly what He’s made you, for the Bible says as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17). He said, “And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one” (John 17:22). Live with this consciousness every day!



## #RealityCheck~14895

Victors don’t talk fear, lack or weakness; they speak the wisdom of God: “Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world...But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery” (1 Corinthians 2:6-7). Others may be griping over the darkness in today’s world, the decimation of global markets and world economies; none of these should move you, because you’re not of this world. When men are cast down, you’re to say, “I’m lifted! The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; I have a goodly heritage; my prosperity is independent of circumstances.” That’s how victors talk; they respond to circumstances and situations with the Word; they say what God has said.



## #RealityCheck~14912

In Christ, we have the transcendent life; we win always! We have an ever-joyous life, with power over crises and dominion over circumstances. This is our normal life in Christ. Does this mean as Christians, we don’t face challenges? That’s not what it means! Rather, it means irrespective of the magnitude or fierceness of the challenges we face, there’s only one outcome: we win!



## #RealityCheck~14917

Something you must do consciously and consistently every day is to boldly declare who you really are. Don’t speak failure; don’t speak defeat. Have the right vision. See from God’s perspective. Meditate on and declare His Word. When you affirm what God has said about you, your soul will be adjusted to act that way. Whatever God has said about you, endorse it, believe it, and affirm it to yourself consistently (Hebrews 13:5-6). Consciously program your life with the Word of God.



## #RealityCheck~14939

It makes no difference the pressure you face from the adversary; refuse to give in. Never be flustered by circumstances or threats. Christ lives in you and He’s the greater One. Therefore, when you face crises, declare, “Greater is He that’s in me than all the adversities and adversaries that could ever come against me!” Whatever you may be going through today is a light affliction; it came “to pass.” So refuse to allow anything steal your joy.



## #RealityCheck~14951

God’s Word created everything; therefore, it can and will create anything. Whatever you desire today, the power to make it real is in your mouth. Through meditation, you create good things in your heart; Jesus said a good man, out of the good treasures of his heart, brings forth good things (Luke 6:45). Words are things; they have creative energy. Use your faith-filled words to frame your world, and programme your spirit for success, victory and ever increasing glory.



## #RealityCheck~14975

The Holy Spirit in you makes you more than a man. There’s a divine energy working in you; it doesn’t burn out, neither does it require replenishing. Refuse therefore to be limited by your physical ability; your potentials are limitless! The Holy Spirit works in you mightily to achieve results that are beyond human ability and comprehension (Colossians 1:29). Affirm this in your life always.



## #RealityCheck~14988

To love Jesus, you must express it in loving God’s people; the love of God you demonstrate in action—towards those you can see—is so important. Do you remember those that labour or work with you? Do their conditions affect you or are you hard-hearted towards them?  If you’ve not been love-ruled, if your actions haven’t been motivated by love, you must repent. Make up your mind and train yourself to walk in love. Don’t be hardened against your brethren, your siblings or even strangers. Let your heart be softened and be easily stirred to help.



## #RealityCheck~14993

God’s Word is God’s creative material. Its power is unlimited. The Word created all things, and is effective today as ever. His Word to you at any time in your life, regarding any situation, is all you need; his Word to you is all that matters; that’s your victory. This is how it works: when God says it, and you respond by affirming the same thing, His Word to you becomes; it prevails in your life and circumstances.

Remember what the Word says in Romans 6:4: “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” This new life is the life of kings. Revelation 5:10 says He’s made us kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth. You’re a new person with kingly values and mentality. Look at the world differently, from the perspective of victory and reigning. You’re a king; reign as one!



## #RealityCheck~15037

Psalm 119:105 says "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path". Many have founded their lives on the misinformation, assumptions and theories of men, rather than on the Word of God. Unlike this world and everything in it, you can rely on the Word; it’s infallible, and immutable; the Word is eternal, and must be the source of the information you live by.



## #RealityCheck~15045

The Bible is the only reliable material on the face of the earth. When you stand before the Lord, He’s not going to ask you what your history teacher or professor taught you. He’s going to ask you about His Word, because the information therein was God-inspired. The ministry of the Word gives you direction in life. No matter what you hear or read, follow only the guidance and direction of the Word. Build your life on God’s truth.



## #RealityCheck~15069

It’s impossible to live the authentic Christian life without the Holy Spirit; as a matter of fact, what you’d have wouldn’t qualify to be called the Christian life. The Holy Spirit is the glory of Christianity. You couldn’t know God or love Jesus without the Holy Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit, you can’t have the character of Christ. Jesus had to have the Holy Spirit. The apostles had to have the Holy Spirit. Life without the Holy Spirit is empty. If you haven’t received the Holy Spirit, do so right away. Simply say, “Blessed Holy Spirit, I receive you into my heart now in the Name of Jesus Christ”; and be filled with the Spirit of God. Amen.



## #RealityCheck~15115

The human body is impacted by the presence of the Holy Ghost. When you have the Holy Spirit inside you, your body is literally affected. Now that Christ is in you, your body is vitalized by the Spirit! You’re impregnable to sickness, disease, and infirmity; being born again, your body is no longer dependent on blood for its life, your body lives by the Spirit. Now that you’re born again and have received the Holy Spirit, Refuse to yield your body to sickness. Take charge and rule over your body with the Word of God.



## #RealityCheck~15141

Have you ever turned on the light in a room and the darkness was so thick that it caused the light to recede? That can never happen! Even if the light is small or a mere flicker, the darkness has to pull apart. This should help you understand who you are when Jesus said, “Ye are the light of the world” (Matthew 5:14). He was talking about your calling as a Christian, and you must become conscious of this truth. You’re called to light up the darkness in your world, in your sphere of influence; you’re that light that darkness can’t comprehend. You’re the one to proffer answers; light up your world today.



## #RealityCheck~15170

God and His Word are one. When you declare the Word concerning any situation, you’re invoking His power to bring about a change in that situation. Maintain the habit of meditating on the Word; contemplating and speaking it forth, and you’ll experience the release of the power of God in your life.



## #RealityCheck~15196

Your life is the summation of the words that come out of you. The gift of words; the ability to speak and make words is the most beautiful natural gift from God to man. Life produces for you a harvest of what you say, and here, there’s no middle ground. As a Christian, you must keep talking; if you want to live in health, talk health. If you want to walk in righteousness and always produce works of righteousness, then talk righteousness; every so often, consciously declare, “I’m the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. I produce works and fruits of righteousness.” You have to say it, to live it.



## #RealityCheck~15239

Before the physical manifestation of the glory and victories that you desire in life, you must see them first within you. Once you can see it from within, then it’s yours. You can never have it on the outside if you didn’t first have it within. That’s where some have missed it. They want to see first with their physical eyes before calling it real; that’s not faith. Faith is calling real that which the physical senses can’t perceive. What is it that you desire in your life today? See it inside first. Create the picture and take possession in the spirit, and with your spirit, first, because it’s already real in the spirit-realm.



## #RealityCheck~15271

Be excited about preaching the Gospel and let nothing hinder you from it. Irrespective of the threats, persecutions or challenges that you might face, preach the Gospel unafraid. Remember, you’re a soldier in God’s army. Soldiers are undaunted about their cause. True soldiers don’t retreat, and they don’t surrender. They fight to the finish. So, be strong and tough in accomplishing the task of soul winning in these last days.



## #RealityCheck~15276

Have you ever wondered why some of the words you speak produce the wrong results? Perhaps you’re not speaking the right words. Don’t speak words that you learnt from the world; speak the Word of God. Get your language from the Word of God. That’s why you have to keep studying the Scriptures (2 Timothy 2:15). Think and talk like Jesus, and you’ll have His extraordinary result.



## #RealityCheck~15282

We’re partners and co-labourers with the Lord in building His Church—His body—winning souls and carrying out the work of the ministry. Refuse to be moved by some of the happenings in the world today—the confusion, fear and deception. By the power of God’s Spirit, we (the Church) are exercising our authority in Christ, bringing in the new order of things. Get vitally involved in this. Pray like you’ve never done! We’re setting in place a new world order in the Spirit, where the Gospel has free course, and in preparation for our soon coming Lord.



## #RealityCheck~15334

Consciously practising the Word is how you can enjoy its full blessings in your life, because the power of God is in His Word. Psalm 1:3 reveals something phenomenal about the extraordinary life of blessings you have in Christ. It says you’re like a tree planted by the rivers of water—ever luscious and green—fruitful and eternally productive. Affirm this every day about yourself. Irrespective, and independent of the happenings in the world, be unmoved, because you know you’re empowered to prosper. For you, it’s blessings only. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~15377

The Lord never tells us to do something we couldn’t do. If He says, “Be strong in the Lord,” it means that’s what you need to do. There’s a day of trouble (the evil day); it’s to be anticipated, but we’re not ignorant of the devil's devices. Satan isn’t a factor. As long as you’re strong in the Lord—keeping His Word in your heart and in your mouth—you’ll discomfit the enemy whenever he shows up. As long as the Word of God is your arsenal, you’ll always win. The Word of God is the sword of the Spirit with which you cut the devil down. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~15428

Clearly, we understand from the Scriptures that we’re in the final days before the rapture of the Church. This isn’t the time to loaf around; there’s a lot the Lord wants to do through you with the short time left. Romans 12:11 says, “Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.” You’ve got to work with the mentality that His appearing could be any minute, and become very passionate in your spirit for the Gospel—ensuring its spread and impact around the world.



## #RealityCheck~15434

As a Christian, recognize the enormity of the responsibility on you, to intercede for leaders of nations. Every so often, pray fervently in the spirit for the leaders in your country. With authoritative words, rebuke the forces of darkness to desist from influencing them, and affirm that their hearts are turned to the Lord to do His will. This is what we must do for leaders of nations to be influenced by God’s wisdom and righteousness; we must pray for them in line with God’s Word.



## #RealityCheck~15453

You can win every day, and achieve extraordinary success. 2 Corinthians 2:14 says, “But thanks be to God, Who in Christ always leads us in triumph [as trophies of Christ’s victory] and through us spreads and makes evident the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere.” As we get ourselves prepared in these days before the Rapture, you’re not only going to be triumphant in your city but everywhere you go.



## #RealityCheck~15466

1 John 5:4 says, “For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world; and this is the victory that conquers the world, even our faith” (AMPC). The question is, What’s your mentality? How do you see yourself? You’ve got to come to a place where you realize life isn’t for defeat; your journey is from victory to victory. That’s our heritage in Christ. It makes no difference that the world is in crises; there should never be fear in you. Jesus said, “…be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33). He overcame the world for you. To be born again is to be born of God, and it says whatever is born of God is victorious over Satan, the world and its failing system. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~15488

Irrespective of the evil or abuses they haul at you because you ‘follow’ Jesus, never be ashamed. Your association with Christ is the greatest honour ever. The Bible says, “For it is better to suffer for doing good, if this should be God’s will, than for doing evil” (1 Peter 3:17). So, distinguish yourself for the Lord. Arm yourself with the same mind—the mind of Christ. Don’t be ashamed to stand up for the Lord no matter the persecutions. He stood up for you, and saved you; so, you must stand up for Him. Don’t be concerned that you may be isolated or ostracized, live for him.



## #RealityCheck~15520

You can’t even know yourself outside Christ; only under His light is your true identity and personality revealed. The Bible says with Him is the fountain of life: in His light shall we see light (Psalm 36:9). If you use all the lights in the world to define your life, you’re sunk, because you’re sure to see the wrong things. But in Him, in His light, you see the glory of God. You see that you’re excellent and full of glory. His light shows who you are, what you have, and your abilities in Christ. It shows you have the greater One living in you, the Word guides you in God’s perfect will for your life, imparting to you the wisdom to fulfil it.



## #RealityCheck~15526

As a child of God, you’re called to live each day of your life in glory, in victory over every situation. You’re seated far above the devil and the cohorts of darkness, and the negative influences of this world. Have the mentality that you can’t be defeated or disadvantaged. Nothing in this world can successfully stand against you, for “greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world” (1 John 4:4). You’ve been translated into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son, who leads you in the triumphal excursions of life.



## #RealityCheck~15539

Refuse to think that your completeness is in the government, your place of work or any human structure, organization or association. Your completeness is in Christ. You’re sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency. Become totally inundated with this consciousness. Your confession, every so often, should be, “Father, I thank you, because I have all things! There’s no shortage in my life! This is the reality; refuse to live with a lack mentality, as though there’re certain things you don’t have. Take off the limits.



## #RealityCheck~15544

Refuse to think that your completeness is in the government, your place of work or any human structure, organization or association. Your completeness is in Christ. You’re sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency. Become totally inundated with this consciousness. Your confession, every so often, should be, “Father, I thank you, because I have all things! There’s no shortage in my life! This is the reality; refuse to live with a lack mentality, as though there’re certain things you don’t have. Take off the limits.



## #RealityCheck~15552

Colossians 2: 20 says "Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances". This scripture lets us know that we’re not subject to the principles of this world. Jesus dominated this world; He lived above the decadence of the world, the corruption and failure of His society. He lived far above, and beyond the government and systems of the day when He walked the earth. That’s the life He’s given us: one that’s not subject to, but lords over, the rudiments of this world. You're in charge so rule your world.



## #RealityCheck~15567

Your life is full of glory. That’s the reason you can manifest the glory of God; it’s what He called you to do: “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9 AMPC). The same way Jesus came to the earth to express God and manifest His glory, you’ve been chosen of God to show forth His glory. You’ve been called to display God.



## #RealityCheck~15591

The Word of God is more than letters; it’s spirit and life. The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Jesus said, “It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life” (John 6:63). The Word builds, lifts, and transforms us from glory to glory. It’s the reason you have to meditate on the Word of God. Meditation gets the Word into your spirit to become personal to you.



## #RealityCheck~15598

Meditation gets the Word into your spirit to become personal to you. As you study or listen to God’s Word, every time there’s a stirring in your spirit to speak forth words on the basis of what you’re studying or being taught, don’t suppress it. Speak forth. Each time you hear the Word, it’s God talking to you, but He always wants you to respond; that’s where the glory is! Until you respond to God’s Word, it won’t produce any results. The Word will be mere letters to you. But the Word in your mouth is God talking; it’s the sword of the Spirit with which you cut the devil down and prevail over the adversities of life.



## #RealityCheck~15615

This isn’t the time to hide your Christian identity. Nothing whatsoever should be viable enough to take your attention away from the Lord and His Kingdom. Some are only fervent in serving the Lord when everything seems rosy, but the true test comes when trouble strikes, and they get discouraged, and suddenly lose their fervour. Some others only serve the Lord during times of challenges. But as soon as they have a miracle and are out of the dilemma, their commitment to the Lord immediately wanes. Something is wrong. Don’t let that happen to you; be on fire for the Lord all the time, be instant in season, and out of season.



## #RealityCheck~15632

Christ is your sanctification. He’s your separator; He has separated you from the rest of the world, from sin and evil, unto the glorious liberty of the sons of God. Hallelujah! Just as you’re required to activate wisdom by speaking wisdom, you’re also required to speak sanctification—words that cleanse and purify. You can purify or sanctify anything that belongs to you with the Word of God and prayer.



## #RealityCheck~15662

With words, you can destroy or decimate things which are. Remember, you can call things that are not, as though they were. There’s no disadvantage to the child of God. Whatever the situation you’re facing today, there’s a way out. The victory is in your mouth. Don’t look at the circumstances, for they’re subject to change; look at the unseen—your victory—the picture the Word of God projects. Look at what the Word is telling you, and stick to the Word. The more dire the situation or circumstance is, the more you affirm the Word and proclaim that you’re victorious in the Name of Jesus! The Name of Jesus can’t be overthrown. Use it, and you’ll always win.



## #RealityCheck~15673

Faith is about acting on the integrity of God’s Word. In these challenging times, you can rely on the Word of God. He said, “If you abide in me, and my words are in you, ask what you want, and it shall be done for you.” All that’s required is for you to abide in Him and for His words to be resident in you. Are the words of Christ at home in you? Or do you set them aside? When His words are at home in you, it’s blessings all the way; victories only; success unlimited.



## #RealityCheck~15684

The Scriptures have the capacity to build you unto maturity: “And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified” (Acts 20:32). The Word is your life; therefore, yield yourself to the Word to build and nourish you. The Bible says, “As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word that ye may grow thereby” (1 Peter 2:2). The Word is the only ingredient that can transform and build our lives on all three levels: spirit, soul and body.



## #RealityCheck~15702

If you’d pay attention to what’s written in the Scriptures about the last days, and relate it to current happenings in the world, you’ll surely realize that you should be ready for His coming. Your responsibility is to prepare your heart through the Word; live your life for Him daily. Nothing can prepare you for the coming of the Lord like the Scriptures. Study and build your life on God’s truth. His Word cultures you to have Kingdom consciousness, with the goal and desire to please Him always and in all things. The Word cleanses and keeps you in the state of readiness to meet the Lord.



## #RealityCheck~15709

It’s impossible for anyone whose life is regulated and propelled by the Word to fail or be disadvantaged in life. The Word programmes you to be an absolute success. When God talks to you, when His Word comes to you, what He seeks is to write the “programme” and have it stored in your “heart,” which you can further process, because of who He’s made you. Psalm 82:6 says, “Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.” He created creators. You’re an innovator so give attention to God's word.



## #RealityCheck~15716

In your life, fear nothing; fear no one. Use the sword of the Spirit. Use the Name of Jesus. The Word declares that we have overcome all antichrist spirits. The forces of darkness are under our feet. In Christ Jesus, we have overcome the world. In every situation, you can declare, “I’m more than a conqueror. Greater is He that’s in me, than he that’s in the world!” As we deploy our weapons through the Holy Ghost, we win at every count.



## #RealityCheck~15725

When you want to know anything, get into the Bible to find out what God says about it. Whatever God says about it is what should matter to you. Build your life on the Scripture, for they’re able to make you wise unto salvation (2 Timothy 3:15), and make you an absolute success; complete and proficient, well-fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work!



## #RealityCheck~15731

It's important to know the scriptures for yourself. To know the Scriptures isn’t in the head; to know it is by the Spirit; without the Spirit, you can’t know it. It’s not to quote it to impress anybody, but to live by it. It’s no use learning it to be able to explain it to everybody and impress others whereas it has no power in your life. If you don’t live it, the head-knowledge of it will do you no good. So, make up your mind that through the Spirit, you’ll specialize in the Scriptures. Give attention to the Word. Know it by the Spirit. It’s what you must live by.



## #RealityCheck~15741

The breeding ground for wrong talk is wrong thinking; so, you must think aright. And don’t justify your negative talk by saying, “I’m only saying what’s happening around me.” No! You’re supposed to declare what should happen around you! You’re a king. Kings say what should happen; the moment you give the word, creation is set in motion. So the time in-between your declaration and its manifestation isn’t the time to give up or complain; rather, it’s the time to intensify the pressure on the adversary; you keep speaking until the “clouds are full.” The Bible says if the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth.



## #RealityCheck~15769

Everything in the epistle teaches us that our humanity was nailed to the Cross. When someone says, “We’re only humans,” it suddenly shows how ignorant they are of their divine life. If you say you’re human, you’ll suffer what humans suffer: the frustrations, depression, sickness, disease, lack, pain, misery, satanic oppression, and corrupting influences in this world. But if you profess your divinity and walk accordingly, you’ll live as a champion in this world, over and above the elements—the sufferings, distress, miseries and pain.



## #RealityCheck~15801

Use the authority He’s given you to dominate your world. This is your time. You’ve been enthroned to reign. You were born to exercise dominion over Satan and the circumstances of life! Whatever comes against you in life, take charge and reign over it through your faith declarations in the power of the Spirit. This is the time of the Church. If you don’t reign in Christ now, when are you going to fulfill it?



## #RealityCheck~15826

Don’t be carried away by the world’s symbols of success. Remember the words of Jesus, “a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth” (Luke 12'15). The most important thing in life is to discover your purpose, and fulfill it. It begins with living your life for Jesus, making impact with the Gospel; that’s living a purposeful life.



## #RealityCheck~15875

Your reaction to the things going on in the world today shows whether or not you truly believe in Jesus. It’s the pressures of life that reveal your convictions. If as a Christian, you’re “afraid” of sickness or disease, then in which God did you believe? Certainly not the same God that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the Prophets and the Apostles knew and talked about. We have the divine life that’s “uninfectable” and impregnable to any sickness or disease. Take the Word of God seriously; study it; believe it, and live it.



## #RealityCheck~15891

Sometimes, many ignore very important things without knowing it, such as paying attention to prophetic instructions, which is part of God’s guidance for His children. A prophetic instruction is an instruction of the Spirit that’s given to you by the Spirit; it’s directed to you, for you. It could come to you directly by the Spirit of God from within you or through someone whom He’s given some leadership influence over your life. When God gives you a prophetic instruction or guidance, it’s in your interest to follow through. Your entire destiny or the next level of your success, promotion and greatness may depend on it.



## #RealityCheck~15902

Christianity is living in the Name of Jesus. The Bible says, “be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might” (Ephesians 6:10); that means take advantage of His ability; take advantage of His might, of His power, standing in His Name and functioning under His auspices. You can’t have that Name and be helpless; never! Use it today and always, and live victoriously evermore.



## #RealityCheck~15910

The life of the Christian is one of ever-increasing glory; all-round success. God doesn’t want you deficient in any area of your life. In the 11th verse of Colossians 1, Paul continued in his prayer declaring that you be strengthened with all might, according to God’s glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness. You can be very fruitful, productive, and strong. God wants your life to be balanced; and you can actualize His desire in your life by walking in the knowledge of His Word.



## #RealityCheck~15952

You need to learn how to use the Name of Jesus and stand against the demonic powers that lure men into destruction and foment trouble in the nations of the world and around you. We’ve been vested with all power and authority in heaven and in the earth to subdue, dominate and decimate satanic powers, their activities, and take charge of our world. We have the power to frustrate the devil and keep him under our feet. We’re not helpless at all. You have the authority to determine what happens in your life, in the lives of your loved ones, in your nation, and around the world by using the Name of Jesus.



## #RealityCheck~15970

As God’s children, we’re born of His truth; thus, we’re children of truth. We live in and by truth. We’re located by truth, and receive truth. But the children of the world feed on lies, and therefore live a lie. How can you know truth? Truth distinguishes itself. The Bible says, “But wisdom is justified of all her children” (Luke 7:35). You’ll know truth when it comes to your spirit. God’s truth produces faith in you; it produces the love of God in your heart. His truth fills you with hope and brings liberty to your spirit. It’ll also give you direction, because the Word of God is light. Psalm 119:105 tells us, “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~15981

It doesn’t matter what challenges you’re facing in your life; focus on the destination. Don’t let the things that happen along the way distract you from finishing your course. Paul demonstrated his resolve as stated in Acts 20:22-24: “And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.”



## #RealityCheck~15997

Never find yourself apologetic, intimidated or reluctant to express your convictions about Christ and the message of the Gospel. We’ve got to be ready. We’re from a lineage of those who gave everything and requested no deliverance; they wanted a better resurrection, a victorious one. Come what may, be undaunted; be bold about your faith in Jesus Christ. Be convinced and compelled by the truth of the Gospel and preach it boldly.



## #RealityCheck~16005

There’s no better time to be strong in the Lord, taking advantage of all His might, than in these last days. You have to be strong in the spirit. Paul the Apostle, in writing to the church in Ephesus, said, “Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might” (Ephesians 6:10). How important this is for us today. There’ll be a time of testing in your life, and in that testing period, you must remain in the Lord.



## #RealityCheck~16051

James 3:2 says For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body. "This tells us about Christian perfection or maturity in Christ and how to measure it.” Jesus said, “For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned” (Matthew 12:37). He put the premium on words. In other words, whether you go to heaven or you go to hell would depend on the words you speak. Your life came by words, and so, it’ll always be dependent on words.



## #RealityCheck~16079

We don’t die! Life works in us. We don’t have the spirit of fear, but of love, power and a sound mind. Being born again, you belong to a heavenly pantheon; you’re in the God-class. The life in you can’t be tainted, corrupted or impaired by sickness, disease or death. But because many don’t know this truth, they live as victims. Be awakened to this reality, so much so, it reflects in your language. Let your divinity soar; give expression to the God-life, the God-nature in you. Don’t live as an ordinary man or woman, for Christ has made you extraordinary.



## #RealityCheck~16085

1 Corinthians 1:24 declares that Christ is the power and wisdom of God. Christ in you is God’s great answer to all human need. Christ in you is your glory and wisdom. Until you understand this, you may never take advantage of it. That’s why there’re lots of Christians who act confused in life, walking in darkness, when they’re the light of the world. Christ has been made unto you wisdom. Just as easily as you can say, “I’m the righteousness of God in Christ,” always be quick to affirm that this vital resource of divinity—divine wisdom—is deposited within the recesses of your human spirit and expressed in your daily walk. Remember, being filled with the Holy Spirit means you’re filled with Christ, the wisdom of God.



## #RealityCheck~16104

It’s important that you’re spiritually discerning; be spiritually minded. You have the Holy Spirit living in you; He’s the Spirit of knowledge. Through the revelation and enlightenment He brings to your spirit, you can know the truth about any situation. He’s the Spirit of truth, and part of His ministry in your life is to guide you into all truth. That way, you can always tell what’s behind a particular problem or situation. Listen to the Spirit of God; study and meditate on the Scriptures; pray often in the Spirit, and your spiritual alertness and sensitivity will be at its peak always.



## #RealityCheck~16113

Selfishness is contrary to the Word of God. Selfish people can’t walk in truth, and can’t truly walk in love. When you have a dream for something you want to do, even if it’s something you want to do for God, it’s important you ask yourself what your real motivation is. You may find yourself struggling between the love of God and the love of yourself, struggling between serving Jesus and serving your interests. Trust God with your life; serve Him with a pure heart.



## #RealityCheck~16123

You have to discipline your body; break it the way you break a horse until it does what you say, not you doing what it says. If your body can’t be subject to you, then it means you’re a slave to your body. And you can’t do anything serious for the Lord if you’re body-ruled. In 1 Corinthians 9:27, Paul said, “I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection...You have the ability and will to control your impulses, to subdue your body and tell it what to do, and it’ll comply.



## #RealityCheck~16135

God’s idea and expectation isn’t just for some of us to be effective in the work of the ministry, while some others in the Church are spectators. The work of the ministry is for every Christian; this is because we’re His ambassadors; the light in the midst of darkness. This is the time for those around you who don’t have the divine life to wonder whether you’re an angel, as you minister the Gospel to them in such power and demonstration of the supernatural.



## #RealityCheck~16160

Your mind is unlimited in its potential to create whatever you desire. When you put your mind-power to work, the possibilities are endless. There’re no limits to what you can achieve, and absolutely no restrictions to how high you can propel yourself in life. Your prosperity is essentially determined by the content and quality of your mind, because with your mind, you can change anything about yourself: you can establish a perfect structure and administration for your life, and enjoy to the utmost the special life and blessings God has given you.

Keeping Satan in check isn’t a question of how long you’ve been a Christian or how “spiritual” you think you are; it’s about Jesus and the authority He’s given you to walk and live in His Name. Satan has no right to run things in your life, in your home, city, nation, or in the lives of your loved ones; cast him out! Exercise your authority in Christ over him. Cast him out any day, anytime and anywhere by using the Name of Jesus. When you address Satan in the Name of Jesus, he responds as though he’s hearing directly from Jesus.

As you serve the Lord, you should know that He never allows you to burn out or wear out. He renews your strength. Isaiah 40:30-31 puts it beautifully; it says, “Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.” As a labourer with the Lord, working for and together with Him, there’s a renewal of your strength. You’re constantly refreshed and rejuvenated by the Spirit of God to be afire, inspired and full of joy as you serve Him. Be conscious of this.



## #RealityCheck~16209

We can’t afford to be quiet about the Gospel. It’s the answer to man’s cry. There’s no other way for men to receive salvation, learn of and understand the righteousness of God, outside of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. So, preach the Gospel. Spread the good news of righteousness to everyone in your world, being absolutely convinced that it’s man’s only way to be made right with God. Romans 10:9-10 says, “if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” If you’ve never been born again, now is the time: Confess the Lordship of Jesus over your life, believing in your heart that God raised Him from the dead. Accordingly, the life and nature of God will be imparted to your spirit—with the ability to walk in, and manifest the righteousness of God. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~16268

Keep yourself separated from, and in dominion over, all the negative influences and elements of this world through your faith-filled words. 1 Corinthians 2:12-13 says “Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak” Keep declaring the Word of victory over your life.



## #RealityCheck~16276

In Christianity, we don’t fight the devil or negotiate with him; we cast him out. We exercise dominion and execute judgement over Satan and the principalities of darkness. They’ve been judged, and we’re the ones authorized to execute the judgement; it’s part of our heritage in Christ. Psalm 149:9 clearly explains this: “To execute upon them (Satan and his demons) the judgement written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD”.



## #RealityCheck~16285

We have something to give to the world; it’s the saving Gospel of Jesus Christ. Recall what the Lord charged us to do: “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give” (Matthew 10:8). He has given us both the power and authority to do mighty works in His Name and demonstrate the character of the Holy Spirit to our world. Therefore, take your place in the ministry of the Gospel.



## #RealityCheck~16293

As a child of God, you’re divinely favoured, and it’s important that you recognize it. Romans 5:17 says, “For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.” That’s what we received: Abundance of grace! You’ve got to take advantage of the grace of Jesus Christ at work in you. With that grace, everything works: The earth responds to you; the heavens respond to you; life is glorious; and whatever you lay your hands to do, prospers.



## #RealityCheck~16304

You’ve got to use the Name of Jesus. Colossians 3:17 says, “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus” Imagine what victories you’d have if you lived in the Name of Jesus! The forces or elements of this world may want to exert their negativities on you, and get you to believe or act contrary to the Word. But you have to dominate them in the Name of Jesus! Therefore, exercise your authority and dominion in Christ over sickness, disease, death and the elements of this world.



## #RealityCheck~16313

One important ministry a Christian carries out to God is praise and thanksgiving; offer lavish thanksgiving to God today. Ephesians 5:20 says, “Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ”. Your prayers must be filled with gratitude, irrespective of what you feel or what you’re going through. Do not acknowledge what you can see; rather, acknowledge what God has done, because this is what keeps you living a life of gratitude. Give God your praise and thanksgiving today as a demonstration of your gratitude for all He’s done for you. He deserves all your praise and adoration. Maintain an attitude of praise and thanksgiving always.



## #RealityCheck~16338

Your faith is the victory over all circumstances and adversities of life: “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith” (1 John 5:4). Keep acting your faith on the Word. You might say, “What if it doesn’t work?” Faith always works. If it didn’t work, then it was never faith. Take advantage of God’s extraordinary power in overcoming life’s adversities by expressing your faith. Faith not expressed will not prevail (James 2:17 & 26). You express your faith in words and actions, remaining undaunted in the face of adversity.



## #RealityCheck~16354

The Word is the foundation for a great life. The Word in you makes you impregnable to the crises of life; it makes you think, see and act from the view-point of advantage and victory only. With such a mentality, everything you do prospers; you walk in excellence and grace. It makes no difference the challenges you face or who might be working against you; you’re unperturbed, because the Word has conditioned your spirit to know that nothing and no one can successfully stand against you.



## #RealityCheck~16366

In your life, don’t be too quick to find fault with others. Don’t give in to the urge to condemn. The Bible says the Lord Jesus has been “ordained by God to be Judge of the living and the dead” (Acts 10:42 NKJV). He alone is the true Judge, and He’s rich in mercy. There may be some people around you, perhaps, even in your local church that may not be living right; don’t judge them. Instead, be the light that wins them over. matthew 5:16 says Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.



## #RealityCheck~16393

In Christ, we were given a life that started with grace. John 1:16 says, “And from his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.” Hallelujah! It was with grace that your salvation came. There’s absolutely nothing in this world—including its fame or fortune— that could be compared with what the grace of Jesus Christ has bequeathed to you. By His grace, you’ve been endowed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:3). You have all that you require for life and for godliness (2 Peter 1:3). His grace brought acceptability, advantage, favour, joy, liberality, pleasure, and fulfillment. Glory to God!



## #RealityCheck~16417

Your life is from faith to faith; ever increasing faith! Talking about the Gospel, the Bible says, “For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith'’ (Romans 1:17). The more you receive God’s Word, the greater your faith, for “faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Romans 10:17). Your life never goes down; it’s upward and forward only. So, be more conscious of the glorious life that you have in Christ. Every so often, declare, “I’m moving from grace to grace, faith to faith, and from glory to glory.” Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~16442

One of the attributes of God is that He’s self-sufficient. He doesn’t need anything from anyone or anywhere. Everything is in Him. He doesn’t “need” power; He is power. He doesn’t “need” wisdom; He is wisdom. He doesn’t “need” righteousness; He is righteousness. He’s the self-existent and self-sufficient God. Did you know that’s the life He’s given you as well? Like Him, you don’t have to depend on external forces or factors; everything you require to fulfil all that God wants you to do, and to be all that He created you to be is in you. Get to know who you are and live accordingly, independent of circumstances. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~16476

The words of Jesus in luke 21:19 says "In your patience possess ye your souls". He’s telling you to always be in control while you wait; it’s an attitude of victory. When you’re confident in the Lord, in His ability and power at work in and through you, nothing shakes you. There’s nothing in this world that should get you ruffled or agitated. Meditate on these words of Jesus in John 16:33 AMPC: “I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have [perfect] peace and confidence. In the world you have tribulation and trials and distress and frustration; but be of good cheer [take courage; be confident, certain, undaunted]! For I have overcome the world. [I have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you].”



## #RealityCheck~16538

It’s not every thought that comes to you that is from God. Proverbs 4:23 GNB says “Be careful how you think; your life is shaped by your thoughts.” The only way you know the source of your thoughts is through the light of God’s Word, and the ministry of the Holy Spirit. It’s very important what you think about, and how you think, because your life is shaped by your thoughts.



## #RealityCheck~16556

The words of Jesus in Mark 8:36-37 says “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” This means the whole world—all of the cosmos—doesn’t compare to the value of one soul. The value of a soul is the blood of Jesus. If you were the only person on the face of the earth, Jesus would have still come to die for you. He didn’t come because we were many; He came because we were valuable to God. That’s why God isn’t willing that anyone should perish. If anyone goes to hell, it isn’t because God wanted him or her to go to hell; the only thing is, He can’t decide for you, because He gave you a very important gift: the ability to make decisions; the right to choose. And in His love, He went ahead to tell you what to choose: life in Christ (1 John 5:11).



## #RealityCheck~16566

Passion is palpable and infectious. What you’re hungry or passionate about, soon enough, will rub off on those around you. If you have a ravenous appetite for God’s Word, those around you would cultivate the same hunger soon enough. Therefore, be the first to be on fire. Be the example of what you want to see in those around you; lead by example. For example, don’t just encourage others to pray; be a praying person yourself, it’s got to begin with you. Spiritual or numerical growth isn’t a mystery, a miracle or an accident. It’s the application of revealed principles and means.



## #RealityCheck~16611

The Christian is blessed in all things. He’s blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. In Genesis 12:2, God didn’t say to Abraham, “I will bless you and make you ‘lucky”; rather, He said, “I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.” This is what you need: the consciousness that you’re blessed and you are a blessing!



## #RealityCheck~16640

Don’t let the reason you’re the member of any particular church or group in church be that you’re looking for someone to help you; rather, develop a desire to render service, to help others. Acts 20:35 tells us that it’s more blessed to give than to receive.



## #RealityCheck~16654

Do you want a life of ever-increasing grace, glory and dominion? The key is your mouth! It makes no difference what obtains presently in your “aion”; you can mend what needs mending; you can restore what needs restoration; you can fix anything that’s been ruined. You can quell terror and put a halt to the malicious destructions and havoc the devil seeks to wreak in your world, life, family, city or country, or in the lives of your loved ones, by uttering the Word of God that your spirit has taken a hold of. Use the Word; put it on your lips and use it to keep the adversary in his place.



## #RealityCheck~16683

You’re not an ordinary person; you’re a divine package of power to bless and heal your world. Mark 26:17-18 says "And these signs shall follow them that believe… They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover". As you preach the Gospel, do what Jesus said to do: heal the sick, raise the dead, and cleanse the lepers. Your hands are healing hands; they transmit the power of God. Through you, His divine presence is made manifest to those in your world.



## #RealityCheck~16711

In Christ, you’ve been brought into “deathlessness!” Whereas everything in the natural world degenerates, life works in you and in everything that’s connected to you, because you’re in the realm of life. You’ve passed from death to life (John 5:24). Romans 5:17 says, “they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”



## #RealityCheck~16736

Colossians 1:27 says the mystery of Christianity and the glory thereof is Christ in you. The glory of God is resident in your spirit; you’re a God-carrying vessel.Think that way, your presence in a place means the glory of God has manifested in that place. That’s part of what it means to be the temple of the Holy Spirit. In the Old Testament, the glory was in the temple;  and you’re that temple today—the temple of His glory. Blessed be God!



## #RealityCheck~16763

God’s people are soldiers; we’re built to withstand and prevail against the pressures and adversities of life. There’re no sissies in God’s army. Don’t faint in the day of adversity. The TLB version of the Bible says in Proverbs 24:10: “You are a poor specimen if you can’t stand the pressure of adversity.” Be strong and tough for Christ! It makes no difference how fiercely you’re persecuted for the Gospel; count it all joy! 2 Corinthians 4:17 says, “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.”



## #RealityCheck~16959

The Church is the only restraining force against the evil manipulations and dictates of Satan. Through our prayers, we contend for the souls of men, and cancel the wicked plans of the devil, and establish the will of God in the earth. Never take spiritual admonition as an exaggeration; take the Word of God seriously. Always take advantage of the privilege, opportunity and blessings of prayer. When it’s time to pray, avoid all forms of distractions. If you’re going to walk in God’s unusual blessings continually, then you must pray without ceasing.



## #RealityCheck~16972

Don’t be careless with words. Something very significant about God is that He places premium on words. Jesus emphasized the importance of words several times in His teachings. In Matthew 12:36, He said, “every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.” That’s a serious warning. Notice He didn’t say men shall give account for some idle words that they speak, but for every idle word. Idle words are empty, ineffectual words; careless jesting and ramblings; coarse language. Take words seriously.



## #RealityCheck~17041

The Lord Jesus instructed us in Matthew 28:19 "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost". The Lord Jesus never gave ordinary instructions; His instructions came with the power to carry them out. So, you never need to worry about whether or not you have the ability to execute His instructions. The ability comes in the instruction. The extent of our reach and the impact of our success with the Gospel are limitless. We’re to take His Word to the ends of the earth, teaching all nations the way of righteousness. This ought to make a great impression on you; He’s given us the ticket to the whole world.



## #RealityCheck~17047

Your choice of words is probably the most significant indicator of whom or what you’ve been listening to. You’ll surely talk like the person you look up to. If you set your gaze on the Lord and His Word, your words will be laden with the anointing to produce the right results. For this reason, Paul adjured the brethren; “Be ye followers of me” he said, “even as I also am of Christ” (1Corinthians 11:1). He wasn’t only desirous for them to imitate his action, but his words as well.



## #RealityCheck~17067

Our prayers and worship in the earth have great impact in heaven. When you’re praying here in the earth, it’s not a mere religious routine; it goes to Heaven as incense. That’s what David meant when he said, “Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice” Psalm 141:2. So, when you’re praying and worshipping the Lord, it’s important that you understand the spiritual significance of what you’re engaged in and do it with faith, hope and love.



## #RealityCheck~17101

God is love, and as His children, we’re to love as Christ loved us. Love makes you give of yourself to others without thinking of what you’ll get in return. It makes you think of others and accept them just as they are. They don’t have to act to deserve your love, for love is unselfish and doesn’t seek its own. It breaks the barriers of race, ethnicity and social status. The new creature in Christ is born anew after the image of God (Colossians 3:10) and is imbued with the divine ability to express divine love. Let God’s love in you come alive; it’ll lift you to a new level of life and you’d be glad this happened. The Christian life is a life of love, freely given to us of God. Manifest that same love to others.



## #RealityCheck~17115

Living by the Spirit is the way for the child of God. The way of the Spirit is the way of success, victory and ever-increasing glory. So, don’t ignore the Holy Spirit. Yield yourself to His influence and guidance by consciously acting on God’s Word. He’s the One with the blueprint for your success; He created you and knows everything about your life and future. He’s committed to seeing you finish your course gloriously, fulfilling the will of God with joy.



## #RealityCheck~17131

When it comes to your health, God’s plan is for you to use the Word to keep your body in divine health and not to bow to human solutions. His Word is medicine; the Bible says it produces health in your physical body: “My son, attend to my words… they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh” (Proverbs 4:20-22). This means you can apply the Word as you would a prescription drug. But the difference is, God’s Word is far more effective; it never fails. No matter how little you think the anomaly is, use the Word, and take charge of your health. Give no place to the devil.



## #RealityCheck~17164

We’re not of this world; we’re the peculiar people of a heavenly Kingdom. Though we live in the earth, our citizenship—the Kingdom to which we belong and from which we operate—is in heaven. It’s a royal and glorious Kingdom of priests. You were born into that Kingdom the day you were born again (Colossians 1:12-13). In this eternal Kingdom, we don’t allow the things which are seen to determine and control the quality of our lives. We see and live by faith. We’re confident that whatever we see that we don’t like, is subject to change. This is life in our Kingdom: we’re unmovable, we’re in dominion, we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us, we are forever victorious.



## #RealityCheck~17187

You were born a victor. Let that be the standpoint from which you view life. You’re more than a conqueror; you’re the blessed of God! You’ve been adequately furnished with every good and necessary thing you require for life and for godliness (2 Peter 1:3). So, stand up tall in Christ! You can never be disadvantaged. It’s victory for you all the way—in all things and in every place: 2 Corinthians 2:14 says “Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place”. You win all the time.



## #RealityCheck~17199

Learn to praise God. In the midst of challenges, praise Him. Be a wild praiser. Even now, forget about whatever may seem to trouble you and praise God lavishly. Tell Him how great and loving He is; sing songs of praise and adoration to Him. Celebrate the Lord right there where you are, for He’s gracious and kind, righteous, holy, faithful and ever true. Let your heart be full of praise to Him, not just today, but always. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~17216

Never let anything take your attention away from the Lord. Let the Spirit have pre-eminence in your life. Make it a principle for yourself, and one to live by, that you’ll trust the Lord only and always. Affirm this for yourself always. Every so often, declare that you’re circumspect and wise; you’re filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all wisdom and discernment. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~17239

When information comes to you, you have to know where it’s coming from; you’re not of this world (John 15:19); therefore, you can’t live by the information that comes from the world. Walk in understanding and discernment. Be spiritual. Through the ministry of the Word and the Spirit, the Lord graciously grants you the ability to discern and walk in His perfect will always. He wants you to be circumspect, cautious, prudent, vigilant and established in His Word, which is the true light that gives you direction and guidance.



## #RealityCheck~17251

How conscious are you of who’s controlling your thoughts and actions? When you make a decision, who’s responsible? Always focus on the spiritual, and not on the things you perceive with your physical senses. Be sure that your actions, thoughts and desires are always God-inspired. Let the Holy Spirit lead and guide you in all things. Set your affections on Him.



## #RealityCheck~17266

Even though we live in the world, we’re engaged in a spiritual warfare. It doesn’t matter that there’s an adversary who’s all out to oppose the Gospel and God’s children; he’s under our feet. Ephesians 6:10-11 says, “be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.” Use the spiritual weapons at your disposal to keep them at bay, to frustrate their stratagems and wiles, and foil all their evil works.



## #RealityCheck~17283

There’s no situation you can’t change by yourself! The inherent power to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ask, think or imagine isn’t in heaven; it’s in you. You may have been told that you can't come out of it or there's no solution; it doesn’t make any difference now, because you can change it! Put the Word to work; activate the power in you for a miracle; that power is activated as you pray in tongues, and it’s dynamic in its working.



## #RealityCheck~17328

Each one of us is ordained of God to be very successful. But you can’t really be a success until you know God’s plan for your life. You could be a success for “you” or for those cheering you on; but being a success for God is what counts. A success for “you” means you’ve achieved your goals and your dreams. A success for the world means you’ve fulfilled the world’s dream and expectation of you. But these aren’t true success. True success means you’ve achieved God’s goals and dreams. Success for life means your accomplishments on the basis of God’s calling, His vision, dream, and plans; and it always has to be done in God’s way, not man’s way.



## #RealityCheck~17349

Faith requires a corresponding action; you prove your faith by your actions. Whatever it is that you believe about Jesus Christ is revealed in your actions. The Word, as it’s given to us in the Scriptures, can be trusted. But for it to be effective in your life, you have to do what it says. The Word of God is for doing; acting the Word is where the power is, that’s what profits you.



## #RealityCheck~17363

Colossians 3:17 says And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. This means you’re to live your life in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That simply means one thing: absolute victory for you every day. If you’d do what the Word says, your life will be full of joy, glory, excellence and victories. You can’t fail or be defeated in His Name. It’s a legal thing; He gave us the power of attorney to use His Name and live in His Name. It doesn’t matter what challenges you might be facing; if you’d use the Name of Jesus, victory is assured. Praise God!



## #RealityCheck~17482

What we’re doing for the Lord, reaching out with the Gospel and winning souls around the world, aren’t for nothing; we’re preparing for His return. He told us He’ll be back; so, we’re telling everybody. These are the final moments of the last days; the time left is so short. Therefore, we’ll fulfill His vision and prepare the world for His return. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~17493

We’re living in the day of salvation; the day of God’s grace, not His wrath. The Bible says, “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:11-13). As we approach the end of this present world, we’re to live circumspectly, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present them perfect in Christ Jesus (Colossians 1:28). He wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4).



## #RealityCheck~17514

If you want to be perpetually successful, living the ever-victorious life you’ve been called to live, you have to be focused and consistent. In your confessions of faith, for example, you can’t talk strength, courage, victory, prosperity, health and wholeness, and at the same time speak weakness, fear, failure, poverty and sickness. The Bible says, “Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?” (James 3:11). That’s not going to work. Set your focus and go for the goal; and the great God of glory, who’s at work in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure, will see to it that you’re a success and you fulfill His destiny for your life. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~17536

God loves to show us visions when we pray. If you’re going to have extraordinary results in life, it’s important that you learn to catch the visions that the Spirit of God brings to you. When I pray, I see; I relate with divine visions; I’m lifted above this world; I receive ideas from God and get directions for life. To be visionless is to be stagnated. But one sound idea from God can transform your life forever. This happens as you shut out the world and fellowship with the Holy Spirit in prayer. Then He shows you the future and helps you know the next vital step to take, and how to take it.



## #RealityCheck~17559

When you were born again, you were imparted with the very life and nature of God at its best, and it can’t be improved. If you’re going to change—if you’re going to see another you, a more influential, effective, powerful you—you must change your way of thinking. There must be a significant change in your mind. That you’ve become a Christian or received the Holy Spirit doesn’t mean your reasoning will change. That effort is your responsibility.



## #RealityCheck~17601

You've got to understand that the fight in the realm of the spirit is won or lost as a result of what we do in the earth. Therefore, keep bearing your testimony of Christ, affirming the Word of God and taking the Holy Communion. That’s how to maintain your victory and keep reigning in life through Jesus Christ. The Bible says, “they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:17). You’ve overcome the world and its wickedness, its falsities and fears, its deceptions, systems and economics. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~17620

God gave us the responsibility to change our way of thinking, to renew our minds with the Word of God; you have to literally submit yourself to the Word to change your mind and give you a new way of thinking. It doesn’t matter that a Christian is quoting Scriptures; as long as those scriptures haven’t affected his mind, he’s not going to be different. Everything about your life, including your Christian growth, has a lot to do with the use of your mind. So, ingest God’s Word into your mind; feed and meditate on the Word. The guaranteed impact will be a transformation in your whole being that’ll result in increased manifestation of the glory of God in your life!



## #RealityCheck~17666

The ability of God is given through His message; His Word. Whatever the Lord has taught you or is teaching you, whatever He’s exposed you to and helped you to know are all for the furtherance of the Gospel. Therefore, find the opportunity to use them to advance His righteousness and the reign of His Kingdom in earth.



## #RealityCheck~17688

Satan’s modus operandi is based on deception with misrepresentations. The biggest strategy with which he enforces this agenda is misinformation through the news media. As a Christian, you shouldn’t be ignorant of this. Ephesians 5:6 says, “Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.” This is why you ought to know and walk in God’s truth—His light; when you walk in His light, you’ll never be deceived. Give yourself to the study of God’s Word. His Word illumines your path and enlightens your heart and mind such that you’re never deceived or in the dark. Hallelujah!

Your faith is your shield. Take up your faith! Don’t give it up. Someone said, “I was actually acting in faith, but things went wrong and I gave up.” No! Don’t drop your faith; the missiles directed at you from demonic forces can only be neutralized by faith. The Bible says “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Romans 10:17). The more of God’s Word that comes into your spirit, the more faith you get. And the more you use your faith, the more it’s strengthened; and when the devil throws his missiles, you’ll be unmoved because they’ll be disintegrated by your shield of faith.



## #RealityCheck~17746

Something actually transpired in the realm of the spirit when you were born again: your human life with which you came from your mother and father was supplanted by the divine life; it’s an actual birth, a true recreation of the human spirit. The Bible says, “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures” (James 1:18). “Firstfruits” means “the first and best.” See yourself the way God sees you. You’re peculiar, royal, excellent and full of glory. You’re the only one of you that God has ever had and will ever have. So, be your best and live your best for God.



## #RealityCheck~17769

As a Christian, stand on God’s Word: don’t go with the world, do God’s Word. The Bible says, “Do not love or cherish the world or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world--the lust of the flesh [craving for sensual gratification] and the lust of the eyes [greedy longings of the mind] and the pride of life [assurance in one’s own resources or in the stability of earthly things]--these do not come from the Father but are from the world [itself]” (1 John 2:15-16 AMPC). The plan of the adversary is to make sure that you’re vexed to compromise; but be smart. In John 14:15, Jesus said, “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” The proof of your love for Him is keeping His Word, and His Word adjures you to abstain from sin.



## #RealityCheck~17813

God’s Word is the only material given to us to build our lives. Your life, according to the scriptures, is like a house to be built, and that’s why Jesus said anybody who hears, does, and lives His Word is like a man who built his house on a rock. He said, “And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock” (Matthew 7:25). Build your life on the Word; it makes no difference the crises and adversities that come against it; it’ll remain standing, and it’ll be a great edifice!



## #RealityCheck~17827

1 Corinthians 6:20 says, “For ye are bought with a price” You weren’t bought with ordinary materials like silver, gold, and precious stones. Jesus paid for your life; so, you’re not your own anymore. He bought you with a great price. Henceforth, live on earth for Him alone because His blood, which represents His life, is your true value. The blood of Jesus gives you remission, justification, access, fellowship, cleansing and the blessings of the New Testament. The Bible says, “Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us” (Hebrews 9:12). Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~17845

When God blesses you, He blesses everything that’s connected to you, be it your money, clothes, properties, etc.; they become items and conduits of blessings. Think about that. It’s one of the reasons you should take good care of the things that God gives you, because the power flows through them; whether they’re your clothes, shoes, ties, cars, work tools, everything that’s connected with you is an item of blessings. It’s got the power to attract more. Everything that’s connected to you is connected to the Kingdom and blessed, because you’re in Christ. When you understand this, your life will take on a whole new meaning; the way you think, talk and walk among others will change. Not only that, the blessings in your life will continue to grow and impact others.



## #RealityCheck~17863

No matter what happens in your life—in the world, or around you—refuse to be broken, disillusioned or overwhelmed; use your faith! Your faith is the victory that overcomes the world and its failures, corruption, darkness, wickedness and decadence. Every adversity you face is your opportunity for a testimony as you use your formidable arsenal: the shield of faith. That’s the one you’re counselled to take on above all the others: “Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked” (Ephesians 6:16).



## #RealityCheck~17913

Our authority in Christ is all-encompassing and unlimited. We’re seated with Christ in the place of power, in a position of dominion and great glory. We can put a stop to the deception, perils and havocs the devil and his cohorts concoct around the world. You can stand your ground and speak God’s Word in prayer and exercise authority in Christ Jesus over your body, your family and loved ones, your city, your state, and your country. We’re the ones in charge! We function in Jesus’ stead; in His dominion!



## #RealityCheck~17934

You’re God’s excellent workmanship or handiwork. God has His brand on you, and remember, everything God makes and does is excellent and is forever. In God’s mind, He doesn’t expect you to succumb to sickness, disease, or the elements of this world, because He made you superior to them. He made you stronger than infirmities and the corrupting influences and negativities in this present world of darkness. Nothing in this world can hurt or hinder you. That’s why one of the signs of the believing ones as listed by Jesus in Mark 16:18 is, “if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them” This is how He wants you to think. You’re not like everyone else. You’re a superior being; you’re in God’s class, created without any defect. You were made to function perfectly and excellently in life. Glory to God!



## #RealityCheck~17952

When Jesus died, He died in the spirit; therefore, He was the first to come out of spiritual death. Spiritual death is separation from God. As Jesus hung on the Cross, He suffered the agony of being separated from the Father. He paid the full penalty for every man. Accordingly, because a righteous man was given for sinners, it became legal, and possible, for sinners to be given His righteousness. He took our place of sin, that we might obtain His righteousness. Now we’re as righteous as Jesus is! He has made you the very expression of His righteousness because He died spiritually for you, and when He came out of death, you were in Him. Now you reign and rule with Him in the heavenly realms—in the realm of life. Blessed be God!



## #RealityCheck~17974

Colossians 2:15 says “And then having drawn the sting of all the powers ranged against us, He exposed them, shattered, empty and defeated, in His final glorious triumphant act!” Guess what? When He did all of that in hell, you were in Him. So, in Him you already shattered, disarmed and defeated Satan and his cohorts of darkness. Stand in your authority in Christ and utter words: words of life, words of glory, words of liberty, words of prosperity, blessings and grace. Bless your world with words of righteousness. Remember, words are limitless; and your divinity, your dominion and authority in Christ are expressed primarily through words.



## #RealityCheck~17997

Don’t put your trust in the failing systems of this world. Don’t put your hopes in a government or the society or some authority. The Bible says, “It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes” (Psalms 118:9). The arm of flesh will fail; so, don’t live your life relying on systems and structures created by man for your success and prosperity. You were made to put your faith in God; in the Word of God. You’ve got to start practicing relying on God. Put your trust in God. Study His Word. Get to know Him; to know Him is to trust Him.



## #RealityCheck~18015

God doesn’t increase Himself or reduce Himself in you. He dwells in you in His full measure. Are you aware that God isn’t more in heaven than He is in you? You’re His living tabernacle, His habitation, and His mobile headquarters. You’re in Him, and He’s in you. In other words, you’ve become His habitation, and He’s become your habitation. Hallelujah! You live in Him, and He lives in you. You’re inseparably one with Him; so, don’t rely on your feelings in relating with God; rely on His Word. God is a Spirit, and He relates with you, with your spirit, through the Word.



## #RealityCheck~18038

The real blessing of prayer isn’t the requests and supplications we make; it’s our heavenly Father’s response. The boldness we have is that whenever we ask anything or make any request according to His will, He listens to us and responds. You’re ordained to receive answers when you make petitions or decrees in the Name of Jesus. In John 16:24, It says, “Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” God’s desire is for you to have your requests granted, so that your joy may be full. He’s your loving heavenly Father, and you can be confident to table your requests before Him with an assurance of a response. So, always pray in confidence.



## #RealityCheck~18045

Don't live as though this world is all there is, you have to realize that life on earth is short. Whether you’re a politician, an entrepreneur, civil servant, whoever you are, and whatever activities you’re involved in, the end of all things is at hand. Live purposefully. Refuse to allow anything to take your attention away from the Lord. Gain isn’t godliness (1 Timothy 6:5). Don’t think that since you’re acquiring possessions and recording success with earthly things, that means you’re fulfilling God’s will. No, don’t use earthly things to measure God’s approval.



## #RealityCheck~18059

No matter where you are today, I want you to know Jesus is coming soon. There’re those who believe it and are waiting for Him. There’re others who don’t think He’s coming and so, they’re not expecting Him. But He’s coming, and He’s coming for those “that love his appearing” (2 Timothy 4:8, those who are expecting Him. The Bible says blessed are those who are waiting for His return (Luke 12:37). Live your life as one who’s waiting for Him, as one who’s expecting Him. it’s not going to happen in some gradual process; it’ll be in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye; we’ll be raptured out of this world to meet the Lord in the air. Don’t be caught unawares. Stay in Christ, in righteousness, and keep living for Him.



## #RealityCheck~18081

Never think you lost anything for following and serving the Lord with all your heart and with all you had, just because you don’t seem to have much of this world’s goods. The greatest thing in this earth is to serve the Lord with your life and fulfil His purpose for your life. Free yourself of all forms of entanglements and encumbrances and serve the Lord joyfully with a pure heart. Don’t associate success with God with the world’s symbols of success. Serve God with a perfect heart and be excited to praise Him, irrespective of the challenges you might be facing.



## #RealityCheck~18100

In Luke 10:2, Jesus had said, “The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.” The Holy Spirit is here for a purpose. He is the Lord of the harvest, and through His grace and power that’s at work in us, we can be effective witnesses of the resurrected Christ. Recognize and take your place as a co-labourer with Him as He leads you in the work as a soul-winner and a soul-builder. Follow His guidance and direction.



## #RealityCheck~18128

Be bold. Be resolute. Be tough for the Gospel. Nothing, no one—groups, governments or institutions—can stand against the Church and win. History proves it. Our Lord Jesus revealed how futile such endeavours are when He said concerning His Church: “And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder” (Matthew 21:44). The adversities you face are for an eternal testimony. Therefore, serve the Lord joyfully without fear and inhibitions. Anyone who stands in your way will be pulverized. That’s what Jesus said and His words never fail.



## #RealityCheck~18153

Romans 8:5 says "For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit". As a child of God, you must walk in the wisdom of God. Be discerning! Let the Spirit of God guide you. Follow and trust God’s Word, for therein lies your glory and victories in life. Let the Word be the supreme authority by which you judge all things and you’ll journey on the clear path of success, victory, and progress. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~18172

The resurrection of Jesus Christ started a new reign, the reign of His spiritual Kingdom. Jesus was raised from the dead and given the Name that has power over all things, over all three domains: heaven, earth and hell. He’s Lord and Master over all things! Philippians 2:9-10 says, “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name. That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.” From the time He began to reign through the Church, He gave us the power of attorney to use His Name, to exercise authority in His Name. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~18204

Don’t regard the wrong done to you by others to the extent that you become bitter. The Bible says you shouldn’t allow any root of bitterness to spring up in your heart and trouble you, and then tells you why: it’ll defile you (Hebrews 12:15). It makes no difference how “justified” you may think you are to be angry, bitter, or offended; any action taken as a result of bitterness has defilement in it. It’s only a matter of time, the decadence in it will manifest. Don’t create new visions and new ideas or start new businesses, ministries and projects because you were bitter or offended. Don’t build any endeavour on the foundation of bitterness; it’ll fail. Build on love’s foundation.



## #RealityCheck~18219

Hebrews 11:3 says, “Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.” Don’t sit idly by and let Satan and his cohorts run rampage and distort things around you; repair, frame, perfect, mend and restore things in your “aion.” Be in charge and in control of how things go with you from day to day by speaking forth God’s Word. There’s a creative force in you to frame the kind of life and environment that you desire, to alter destinies and change the course of events in our world. Put it to work.



## #RealityCheck~18236

The Word of God is a sword; it’s an offensive weapon for spiritual warfare. “Rhema” is a specific Word at a specific time for a specific purpose. Thus, the ‘Rhema’ of God is the Word of God from your heart to your mouth—the inspired Word that comes out of your mouth. God’s “Rhema” word isn’t just a word that’s kept in your heart; rather, it’s inspired by God and comes out of your mouth. It’s always a word said, or a word in saying. Always put the Word on your lips; if it’s not coming out of your mouth, it’s not a sword; it’s not a weapon.



## #RealityCheck~18248

Your faith is a weapon, a shield against the adversary and his onslaught: Ephesians 6:16 says “Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.” You don’t have to look around for a shield called faith; faith is in your spirit. You were born again with the measure of faith you require (Romans 12:3) to live victoriously and reign gloriously in life. All you need do is grow it by more of God’s Word and strengthen it by using it. That faith neutralizes, quenches, defuses and puts out all the fiery darts the enemy throws at you. Your faith is the victory over all circumstances and adversities of life: “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith” (1 John 5:4). Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~18257

The Word says the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered. In other words, the Holy Spirit stands in the gap and intercedes for you; He takes charge in your behalf, carrying out His intercessory ministry through you. This is so important because the Holy Spirit doesn’t pray on His own. He needs your vocal faculties. This is the ministry of the Holy Spirit in you. He’ll help you pray right and effectively and speak forth God’s Word through you.



## #RealityCheck~18309

The human spirit is very powerful, with tremendous creative and imaginative ability. Remember, man was created in the image of God; he looks like God and functions like God. That’s why we say, “Your imaginative power is your creative ability.” Knowing this, you should only imagine positive outcomes. What you imagine is what becomes. Stay your mind on the Word and let it control your expectations.



## #RealityCheck~18393

Words are powerful, but the Word of God is all powerful. Always remember that. When you were born again, you were born of the Word: “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever” (1 Peter 1:23). You’re an offspring of the Word, called to live by the Word, built and being built by the Word. You dwell in the Word, and the Word dwells in you. Now, God says, “Let the same Word that brought you into being, flow out of your mouth.”



## #RealityCheck~18410

The Gospel is for everybody; every individual is important to God. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is potent; His grace, love and mercy have been poured out on all men for their salvation. The Bible says the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation for all men— regardless of their status, background or ethnicity. You must realize that your earthly job, business, education or profession is your opportunity and vehicle for transporting the Gospel. Never let an opportunity pass by that you’ve not utilized for the Gospel. This is what the Lord has set us on course for; so, be bold and fearless. Preach the Gospel to anybody and everybody.



## #RealityCheck~18426

John 7:38 says "He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water". Jesus said out of your innermost being flow gushers of living water. This living water comes out in words inspired by the Holy Spirit that lives within you. The Holy Spirit in you is a fountain of living water, pouring forth from within you in words of life. Two things characterize the words we speak: righteousness and salvation. Our words lead men into righteousness and salvation. So, we’re those who turn many to righteousness and bring them into salvation. Hallelujah.



## #RealityCheck~18453

As a Christian, God prepared your path, the path in life that you should follow. Predestination is at work in you; this simply means that your life is set on a course. You are not an accident. Most people never bother to find out God’s plan for their lives let alone see to it that they fulfil it. But that is the greatest thing in your life – discovering God’s purpose and fulfilling it. Be wise and know that you need to talk to God about what you should do, the direction you should go, because everything God wants you to achieve in life has been pre-ordained.



## #RealityCheck~18462

Study and know the Scriptures for yourself. 2 Timothy 2:15 says, “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” Your personal growth as a Christian is non- negotiable. And you can only grow and become more effective in the things of God by consciously making up your mind to study, meditate and live by God’s Word. The Word of God builds you; it empowers, inspires, uplifts, motivates and gives you clarity of purpose. With that clarity of purpose, you’re definite and focused on the steps you’re to take in fulfilling your God-given destiny.



## #RealityCheck~18478

The Lord Jesus gave us a message. It’s the message of salvation for the whole world, which He accomplished in His death and resurrection. We’re to preach this message until He returns as He promised. Because the time for His return is nearer than ever, we must preach the Gospel now with greater fervency and urgency than ever before. This isn’t religion; it’s about Jesus Christ and His living message: that He came to die for all men, and that God raised Him from the dead that we may have eternal life and come into fellowship with God; and that He’s coming back for all who believe in Him.



## #RealityCheck~18495

Jesus is coming again and the Bible gives us an interesting description of His coming. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 says, “For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” this is why you should be prepared by living for Him, every day.



## #RealityCheck~18512

If you want to be perpetually successful, living the ever-victorious life you’ve been called to live, you have to be focused and consistent. In your confessions of faith, for example, you can’t talk strength, courage, victory, prosperity, health and wholeness, and at the same time speak weakness, fear, failure, poverty and sickness. The Bible says, “Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?” (James 3:11) That’s not going to work. There’re lots of people who believe in a life that’s “up and down”; that’s not for the Christian. We go upward and forward only; we allow no distractions. Set your sail. It doesn’t matter what tries to pull you this way or that way; make the Word of God your focus.



## #RealityCheck~18524

Knowing that the coming of the Lord is closer than ever, take the admonition in Jude 1:4 to heart, living circumspectly, purposefully, worthily and accurately, not as the unwise and witless but as wise: “For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.” Blessed be God for His unfathomable grace, wisdom and mercy, lavished upon His Church to effectively proclaim the Gospel and establish His righteousness in all the earth in these last days!



## #RealityCheck~18538

1 Corinthians 2:6-8 says, “Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.” Speaking wisdom is speaking the Word. It discomfits the adversary; they can’t get in on it! For example When you declare, “All things are mine,” you’re speaking wisdom. When you say, “I have the life of God in me; I live in agelessness, ‘wantlessness,’ deathlessness and fearlessness,” you’re speaking wisdom. Declare what the Word says concerning you, irrespective of the situation. Affirm your righteousness, health, dominion and oneness with the Lord with boldness. Speak wisdom always and your life will glorify God.



## #RealityCheck~18589

As a child of God, commit to always executing your tasks and projects with excellence, your light will so shine before men that they’ll see your good works. Your good works will speak for you and men won’t be able to ignore you. It’s time you appraised yourself and made the conscious choice to be the best at what you do. Reject half measures. Do excellent things. Excellence can’t be ignored. It reminds of what the Bible says in Proverbs 22:29: “Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.” When you have an excellent mind and do excellent things, you won’t take a back seat to anyone.



## #RealityCheck~18604

Be excited always at the seemingly simple things that God does in your life and in the lives of others. Joyfully celebrate His goodness every day. There’s no such thing as a “small miracle”; every blessing from God is something to shout about, something worth praising Him for. Your heart should always go out to Him in worship, praise and gratitude for His great love, mercies and grace. The Bible says He daily loads us with blessings—benefits: “Blessed be the Lord, who daily loaded us with benefits, even the God of our salvation.” (Psalm 68:19). Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~18628

Excellence is for those who make a choice to do excellent things as a personal policy. Imagine it was revealed that an airline cut corners in their fleet maintenance and their pilots habitually skipped preflight checks, you wouldn’t want to board any of their planes. It’s for the same reason that you must refuse to cut corners or accept half measures in anything you do. It doesn’t matter whether or not someone would notice; just make the right choice for excellence and run with it.



## #RealityCheck~18644

Prayer is a spiritual exercise that you must train for. If you don’t train yourself to pray, you’ll never know how to pray effectively. If all you knew to do was mumble a few words in two minutes and you’re done, it’s time to get some training and discipline. The purpose of prayer isn’t merely to control or discipline your body, as good as that is; the main purpose of prayer is the conditioning of your spirit, and this is far more important. Prayer brings your spirit to a certain condition that makes your relationship and fellowship with God’s Spirit more real and synchronized with His will and purpose. Then you find that His thoughts become your thoughts and His words become your words; that’s when He puts a word in your mouth which you speak forth and it produces results.



## #RealityCheck~18656

You must protect your heart, keep it pure; keep it sanctified with God’s Word. Never let anything unwholesome take root in your heart. Pride, anger, malice, bitterness, hatred—these are poisonous to the heart. Completely eschew them from your life and from your heart. Your thoughts come from your heart; the character of your thoughts reveals the condition of your heart. When you were born again, you were given a heart of love. The Bible says, “the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us” (Romans 5:5). You have a heart of love, a heart that’s filled with God. Protect it; maintain it; keep it the way God wants it.



## #RealityCheck~18672

The proof that we know God’s love is how we share it. We don’t know God’s love until we share it and manifest it. Jesus was the manifestation of God’s love. He was God’s love in the flesh. That’s to say He was the “body” of love. God’s plan is to reveal Himself—character, ability, and His nature of love and righteousness through each one of us. The expression of His love in and through you is a key indicator of spiritual growth. You’re truly spiritually mature when the love of God is expressed more and more in your words, thoughts, attitude and actions. Walking in love is the manifestation of the life and nature of Christ that’s in your spirit. Praise God!



## #RealityCheck~18686

One of the areas Satan likes to take advantage of God’s people is in their health. Thus, in keeping yourself in health, the first thing you need to consciously recognize is that the Word of God is pure medicine. Meditating on the Word will keep you in soundness of health—spirit, soul and body. Every day, meditate on the Word. Don’t wait for trouble to strike before you start “trying” to meditate on the Word. Meditate on the Word ahead of the evil day. Something else you need that’s of equal importance is the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Be sensitive to the Holy Spirit about what you eat and how you treat your body. Such things aren’t too trivial for Him to give you clear guidance about. Trust Him; He’ll teach you how to be wise about food.



## #RealityCheck~18700

Practice being alone with God. There’s something about solitude; if you don’t understand the value of solitude, there’s a lot that you can miss in life. It’s so important to have personal times alone with God. Before revelation comes isolation. When you learn the value of having private times of fellowship with the Lord, you’ll be amazed at the transformation that’ll take place in your life and how effective you’d be in the things of God. Never take your private times with the Lord lightly; Make the effort to have your personal times with God every day.



## #RealityCheck~18715

When it comes to speaking or releasing the Word—using it against the adversary and adversities—be wild; refuse to be cool and calm. In putting the Word of God to work, be on the offensive. The Bible says, “So mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed” (Acts 19:20). As you speak the Word, it’ll keep growing; the necessary result, therefore, will be for it to prevail. So, use the Word to deal with any situation, irrespective of how dire or grave the situation is. The power doesn’t work just because you know it or believe it. The principle is that you must SAY it for it to work.



## #RealityCheck~18732

Refuse to think, talk, and act or live like a mere human being; otherwise, you’ll suffer what humans suffer. Don’t let the lamentation of the Psalmist in Psalm 82:5-7 describe the reality of your life. It says, “They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.” Rather, live the God-life, the divine life, because you’re born of God, which makes you a god. Gods don’t live by blood! Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~18740

Before you were born again, your body lived by blood. But from the day you were born again and received the Holy Spirit, you received the God-life that doesn’t require blood for its sustenance. When you’re born of God, you’re not human; you’re divine. That old system of having life in your body through your blood ceased to be; it was replaced by the life of the Holy Spirit. No wonder Jesus said in Mark 16:18, “if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them” There’s no poison that gets into your system through the blood vessels that’s potent enough to wreak a havoc. This is because the life in you is indestructible—it’s the life of the Holy Spirit! Those who don’t understand this truth live the ordinary human life.



## #RealityCheck~18752

Our evangelical responsibility is something that all of heaven takes seriously. Sadly, many don’t understand how serious this really is. 1 Corinthians 16:22 says, “If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.” That means let him be accursed. The proof of your love for Jesus is keeping His commandments—His Word (John 14:15). His Word says, “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature” (Mark 16:15). So you keep that word by being a soul winner. He said in Matthew 28:19, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations” That means make pupils of those in your world, teach them about God and the Kingdom-life, establish His Kingdom in the earth. Your love and commitment to the Lord must reflect in your dedication to the preaching of the Gospel.

It’s interesting to know that no other human was exactly like you in the past, none is like you now, and none will ever be like you. God made it so! Your uniqueness is such that can’t be obscured. It’s the reason you must live your best, be your best, and put your best into serving the Lord, Jesus Christ. Matthew 5:16 says "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven". This is significant; it lets you know you have a divine mandate to shine before all men–anywhere and everywhere. This means you can always win and make progress, no matter the circumstances of your life. I encourage you to put your focus and best energies on what God has called you to do, no matter where you are in life.

If someone does something that upsets or offends you, rather than become bitter or enraged, let it go. Jesus showed us a good example of how to walk in love. He loved everyone, including His accusers and persecutors. Have the love language and culture. Love everyone unconditionally. “In the case where the people you respect are those that hurt you, what should you do?” Honour them nonetheless. Love them. Grow out of that place where you can still be hurt. Live in God’s Word. Live like Christ and love like Him: “Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour” (Ephesians 5:1-2).



## #RealityCheck~18798

There’s the walk of a Christian. When you’re born again, the first thing God wants to help you learn is how to walk in Christ in your daily life. Colossians 2:6 says, “As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him”. How you live every day, how you relate with other people, how you relate with God—and the kind of mind you have—these are very important to God. There’s a way a Christian should and must live that distinguishes him or her from a non–Christian. Someone may be born again and not live the Christian life. This is one of the reasons churches and pastors are important, because the spiritual life requires training. God expects you to grow unto maturity and become firmly rooted in the faith, and live triumphantly every day to the praise and glory of His Name.



## #RealityCheck~18815

As you study the Word of God, you see a glorious you, because the Word mirrors you. The picture of you that you see in the Word is always one of glory. The more you see it, the more you’re transformed into the same image that you see in the Word. It’s an amazing spiritual principle. That’s the reality of how the Word of God works. That’s why James admonishes us to keep looking into the Word of God, which he calls the perfect law of liberty (James 1:25). Jesus said in John 15:16, “I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain” This means He’s given you a life of endless prosperity; your success shouldn’t be short-lived. Contemplate this every day. As you behold such words, the reality of what they say becomes your vital experience.



## #RealityCheck~18832

John 16:23-24 says And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. There are lots of results we’ll never see except we pray. It’s God’s way of relating with us; He asked us to do it. Have the audacity of faith to expect answers when you pray, because the Lord derives glory from answering your prayers. It brings to mind the words of Jesus in John 15:8: “Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.” His joy is for you to have a fruitful, productive and effective walk in righteousness.



## #RealityCheck~18844

Philippians 2:10 says "That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth". We’ve been given that Name to live by, to use, and it works all the time. When we call the Name of Jesus, things happen in the realm of the spirit; Angels are dispatched on your behalf, demons bow and limitations are destroyed, situations turn around for your good. Call that Name today; Call it over your city. Call it over your state, call it over your country, call it over this world! We’ve been given a treasure so great, and it behooves us to use it. It’s the Name of Jesus!



## #RealityCheck~18853

When you speak the right words, the Spirit acts upon them; words recognize no seasons or barriers. Words are things; they’re tangible and potent with creative energy. So, don’t say, “Well, I wasn’t serious when I said it”; in the realm of the spirit, everything you say is living and active. It’ll work for you or against you. That’s the reason we should speak the Word only; speaking truth. The Bible says, “For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned” (Matthew 12:37). Don’t use words carelessly. Know, think, talk and sing the Word—whether in merrymaking or in praise to God! Let your life be consistent with God’s truths, and you’d be amazed at the resultant blessings in your life.



## #RealityCheck~18865

As Christians, we shouldn’t fold our hands and watch the devil wreak havoc in different nations and in the lives of men. God expects us to do something about it. He says, “Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked” (Psalm 82:3-4). Don’t be ignorant of this. Don’t be content with only meeting your personal needs and chasing your own dreams. You have what it takes to change the course of your world.



## #RealityCheck~18882

Hebrews 11:3 says, “Through faith we understand The word “framed” is “katartizō” (Greek), and it means to repair or adjust, to restore, mend or make perfect. This means that with faith, you can repair the foundations of the earth that are out of place and put them back on course. You can fix those circumstances and situations in your world that are inconsistent with the will of God. By declaring faith-filled words, you give shape, structure and beauty to your world. It makes no difference how bad the current situation is, you can mend what needs mending, you can restore what needs restoration, and you can fix anything that’s been ruined. What you need is to use the Word to keep the adversary in defeat. Use it to frame the course of your world to line up with God’s plan and purpose.



## #RealityCheck~18895

As God’s people, we’re encouraged to be involved in the work of the ministry, to take the message of salvation to the unsaved and reconcile men to God. But while you’re at it, live a life that’s pleasing to the Lord. Christianity is a call to righteousness and a walk in righteousness. Don’t live in sin. The Bible says sin shall not have dominion over you (Romans 6:14). Serve God in holiness and righteousness. Stay in the Word and practise your Christianity, regardless of the pressures. Live the life of a righteous person every day.



## #RealityCheck~18909

If you want to see your life go from glory to glory, avoid empty, vain, useless, idle talk; rather, give yourself to the ministry of the Word and praying in the spirit. 2 Timothy 2:15-16 (AMPC) says, “Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analyzing and accurately dividing [rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth. But avoid all empty (vain, useless, idle) talk, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness.” Don't can’t spend your time in godless chatter, live purposefully.



## #RealityCheck~18947

Some people believe the Rapture of the Church is a hoax. Paul described it as a mystery: “Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51). In 1 Thessalonians 4:17, the Scripture says, we shall be “caught up.” Let no one deceive you; the Rapture is going to take place anytime soon. It’s closer than it’s ever been. It’s going to happen so fast that those who aren’t prepared and looking forward to it won’t have time to prepare and will be left behind. That had better not be you. Hebrews 9:28 says, “Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”



## #RealityCheck~18988

We aren’t some form of afterthought in God’s plan; no, our lives were carefully orchestrated. The works God commanded us to do were planned beforehand. The question isn’t whether the plan has been made; the question is whether you’ll agree in your life to live according to His plan. Your path of life was prepared ahead of time. He planned for you, not just to live, but to live the good life! In 2 Timothy 1:9, the Bible says God “hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.” Purpose and grace were given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. The plan was already there, and now, it’s made manifest (2 Timothy 1:10). Would you embrace it? This is your time for a realignment. He wants you to have a full, deep and clear knowledge of His will, His purpose for your life, and fulfil it. Nothing could be more important.



## #RealityCheck~19012

The Bible says, “I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High” (Psalm 82:6). Yet, you hear some Christians say, “We’re just ordinary people.” They think talking that way makes them humble. No! It just shows how ignorant they are. We were ordinary until we were born again; now that we’re born again, each one of us is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Your body is His living tabernacle. This is a reality and it has to come into your consciousness. You have to think this way. Until you become conscious of it, the power therein won’t work for you. Never again say, “I’m just an ordinary human being.” When you believed in Jesus Christ, you became a God-man, an associate of the God-kind. You were literally born of God. You’re actually a supernatural being. God made you exactly like Himself, “as he is, so are we in this world” (1 John 4:17). You have the life and nature of God now. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~19083

There’re lots of results we’ll never see except we pray. It’s God’s way of relating with us; He asked us to do it. Jesus prayed and taught us to pray. He said, “Men ought always to pray and not to faint” (Luke 18:1). Why did He pray so much? It’s because He was living in a world of darkness and needed to effect changes in men’s lives. It’s one of the reasons He was so effective. With so much going on in our world today, we should never think we’re helpless. There’s something we can do. Any Christian can actually effect changes. Don’t be like the person who says with a note of defeat, “All I can do is just pray.” No. We don’t just pray. In our praying, we’re definite enough to make definite changes. God never told us to “just pray” as a form of religion. He told us to pray so that things can be changed to our advantage.



## #RealityCheck~19096

It’s possible for us to know the will of God for our lives. The Bible says spiritual things can only be spiritually understood: “But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned” (1 Corinthians 2:14). When your spirit is enlightened by God’s Word through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, you’re able to know God’s will and purpose. The guidance of the Holy Spirit is so important in our lives. He guides your steps and grants you understanding of the Word. With Him, you’re never at a crossroads. Knowing Him and walking with Him is the key to that successful life you’ve always desired. He brings you into your inheritance and your destiny in God.



## #RealityCheck~19114

Learn to activate the divine life within you by declaring and personalising the Word of God. Remember, the greatest miracles are performed with words. The Bible says in 2 Peter 1:4, “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature” You’re an associate of a divine pantheon; you hail from above; your origin is divine. No wonder Jesus said, “Isn’t it written in your law I have said ye are gods?” (John 10:34). Recognize and affirm your divinity; practise it. The Bible says the communication, the everyday expression of your faith, becomes effectual as you recognize and affirm who you are in Christ (Philemon 1:6).



## #RealityCheck~19127

As one who’s born again, your life has been so excellently planned out and preordained by God. All He wants is that you follow the blueprint. There’re things that many people go ahead to do in life even though they aren’t part of God’s agenda for them. They want to live their lives for the joy of other people; they want certain jobs, professions or positions because others are pressuring them to. Never find yourself always insisting on what you want; ask God. You can be as happy as ever, fulfilling God’s purpose for your life. That’s the most important thing—discovering your purpose and fulfilling it.



## #RealityCheck~19162

Jesus is the embodiment of life. 1 John 5:12 NKJV says, “He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.” In the 13th verse, he climaxes his message and says, “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life” (NIV). For God’s people everywhere, this is your reality: You have LIFE—eternal life! Jesus is eternal life: “And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life” (1 John 5:20), Live in this reality.



## #RealityCheck~19179

2 Peter 1:4 says, “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature” We’re participators in the divine experience. We’re not spectators in the Kingdom; we’re part of the process of making things happen. Hallelujah! We’re now involved in that special life that God has, which hitherto no other being had. Now we have the nature of God! It’s the reason you can speak from where you are and things will happen. When you lift your hands, they’re God’s hands; therefore, God responds. Your victory has been settled; all you have to do is walk in the light of it. Study the Word to know and play your role in the divine experience. You’re not an ordinary person.



## #RealityCheck~19192

No matter how much you love Jesus and how much you’re touched by the need to preach the Gospel to sinners in the world, if you’re not filled with the Holy Spirit, it won’t work. That’s why Jesus said to His disciples, “tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high” (Luke 24:49). If you’ve received the Holy Spirit already, that’s just the beginning. You have to know Him; you have to walk in and with Him. He has to become a constant part of your life. Remember, the power of our message isn’t in the shouting, nor is it in the ability to use many words. The power of our message is the Holy Spirit: “And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power” (1 Corinthians 2:4).



## #RealityCheck~19213

In Christianity, we emphasize studying and meditating on God’s Word because of what it produces in your life: ever-increasing glory! That’s what your life is for. The glory of God is in the Word, and that glory becomes more visible in your life as you consciously and consistently feed on the Word. The Bible says, “Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind” (Romans 12:2). If you don’t give undivided attention to the study, meditation, and practise of God’s Word, you inhibit His glory in your life. This has happened to some people without them even realizing it. They exposed themselves to news and information from negative sources other than the Word of God. Remember, you’re what you eat; you become more and more like the information that you feed on. The Word of God is the glory of God; therefore, feed on the Word and your life will be increasingly excellent and full of glory.



## #RealityCheck~19280

The Lord Jesus said, “A good (healthy) tree cannot bear bad (worthless) fruit, nor can a bad (diseased) tree bear excellent fruit [worthy of admiration]” (AMPC). Notice how He described an excellent fruit; He said it’s worthy of admiration. That’s amazing! What’s your life like? Is it worthy of admiration? If everyone turned out like you, will you be happy? If people behaved towards you the way you behave towards others, would you like it? Let your life be a manifestation of the Spirit of excellence in you. Tower above envy, bitterness, anger and all the negativities of life, because you’re an excellent tree bearing excellent fruits: “Any branch in Me that does not bear fruit [that stops bearing] He cuts away (trims off, takes away); and He cleanses and repeatedly prunes every branch that continues to bear fruit, to make it bear more and richer and more excellent fruit” (John 15:2 AMPC).



## #RealityCheck~19304

The Word of God is the will of God expressed. Through studying the Word and spending time in fellowship with the Holy Spirit, you become filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. Talk to the Lord about your life’s decisions. He’s interested in everything about your life. Perhaps you’re learning of this truth for the first time and you’re unsure what your path is, it’s important for you to know that God has a perfect will for you. His will for you is an excellent life. It’s not too late to turn to Him who has all answers. Yield yourself completely to the transforming power of His Word and surely, you’ll “discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect” (Romans 12:2 ESV).



## #RealityCheck~19321

As Christians, we have a ministry of reconciliation; our work of the Gospel is to reach our world and reconcile men to God. We have to do it. Those of us who have believed in Jesus Christ have been brought into fellowship with God (1 John 1:3), but the whole world isn’t. It’s our responsibility to bring them in. Jesus said in Mark 16:15, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” This charge wasn’t given to angels, but to us—His disciples. You should be glad about that. Make it your life work. You’ve been given the opportunity to serve in the Gospel, to make His righteousness known, and establish His Kingdom in the earth and in the hearts of men. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~19330

The Bible says “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour” (1 Peter 5:8). That’s why you must be vehement when dealing with Satan: cast him out! You have the authority in the Name of Jesus to cast out devils (Mark 16:17). That authority is unrivalled and unparalleled in heaven, earth, and in hell. Therefore, when you say, “Devil, get out of here in the Name of Jesus,” he’s got to comply. Philippians 2:9 says God has highly exalted the Lord Jesus and given Him a Name that’s above every name. Put a stop to the devil's work; cast him out in the Name of Jesus and he’ll be gone!



## #RealityCheck~19345

Some people believe until they’re worried and flustered, God won’t do anything about their situation. What they don’t know is that worry actually short- circuits the power of God in one’s life. Worry is a “fiery dart of the wicked” (Ephesians 6:16); so, when it attacks you, repel it. Use the Word against it. Every day, be resolute that you’re going to practise God’s Word. His Word says, “Don’t fret or worry. Instead of worrying, pray. Let petitions and praises shape your worries into prayers, letting God know your concerns. Before you know it, a sense of God’s wholeness, everything coming together for good, will come and settle you down. It’s wonderful what happens when Christ displaces worry at the centre of your life” (Philippians 4:6-7 MSG).



## #RealityCheck~19355

Know your value; you’re special. In 2 Peter 1:4, the Bible describes us as partakers of the divine nature. In other words, we’re partners, comrades and associates of the God-kind! This means we belong to a heavenly pantheon. John 10:34 says, “Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods.” Hallelujah! This is the reality. You’re not supposed to live a beggarly life after Jesus has paid so much for you. When you pray, don’t pray like someone who is trying to get something from God. No! Nothing is too good for you. He already did, and gave, the best for you; He gave you ALL when He gave you Christ. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~19370

God wants us to be able to prove the message of the Gospel. That’s why He calls us witnesses. When you received the Holy Spirit, you received power—ability to bear witness of His truth, death and resurrection. With this power, you can do the same things Jesus did. It was this very power of the Holy Spirit that worked in Him to do the works of God. Jesus effected changes, and now you can too, because you have His Name and His power is at work in you. His Spirit and life in us is proof that He was who He claimed to be: the son of God. Jesus Christ is alive, and we must prove it with miracles, signs and wonders. As you take the Gospel to your world today, go with the consciousness that you’ve been given power to produce proof that Jesus is alive. Praise God!



## #RealityCheck~19388

The one who’s born again is a new creation; he or she has the life and nature of God. Being born again, your human life was supplanted by the life and nature of God. Now, your body houses a new type of life that’s unsusceptible and impregnable to sickness or disease. Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new! If you don’t know about this new life, you’ll never put it to work; you’ll be living the human life when you have the divine life in you. Learn to activate the divine life within you by declaring and personalising the Word of God. Remember, the greatest miracles are performed with words;  understand the power and energy of your words!



## #RealityCheck~19420

Romans 8:2 says For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. This law of the Spirit of life or law of life is also referred to as the law of liberty in James 1:25 and James 2:12. John said, “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you…that ye may know that ye have eternal life” (1 John 5:12-13). This (eternal) life is in the Son, and since you have it, you’re not supposed to struggle with sin, sickness, disease, infirmities and death. Think about this: at 120 years, Moses’ eyes weren’t dim and his natural force was unabated (Deuteronomy 34:7). Moses lived under the Old Covenant, but he had a consciousness of life; He knew the Word of God invigorates and makes alive (Deuteronomy 32:46-47). Have the same mentality, because when you were born again, you passed from death to life and from sin into righteousness.



## #RealityCheck~19433

Acts 19:20 says "So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed". We’re witnessing the greatest move of the Spirit in these last days. There’s been such unprecedented harvest of souls into the Kingdom, beyond what we’ve ever seen. The Word of God is growing mightily in the nations of the world and prevailing. We are reaching the whole world in an accountable way. It’s what God wants us to do and His grace is mighty upon us. Join the bandwagon of soul winners today and reach out to your estate, neighbourhood or community, where you live or do business, and the regions beyond.



## #RealityCheck~19463

Learn the power and value of thinking right and speaking right. If your thinking is wrong, it’ll reflect in your words. And if your words are wrong, things will go wrong in your life. Your confessions regulate your life. The Bible says, “Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth” (Proverbs 6:2). No wonder Psalms 39:1 admonishes that you guard what you say and speak only what’s right: “I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle.” James 3:2 says, “For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.”



## #RealityCheck~19509

Faith is acting on the Word; it’s doing God’s Word. James 1:22 says, “But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.” It’s akin to what Jesus said in John 14:15: “If ye love me, keep my commandments.” The way to show you love God is doing His Word, and faith works by love. Learn to walk in the light of God’s Word. In Colossians 1:10 NIV, Paul by the Spirit, prayed, “that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God.” This is fulfilled in your life as you live every day by faith, for the just shall live by faith.



## #RealityCheck~19528

There’re people who often don’t behave wisely, even though they’re born again. The reason for this isn’t farfetched; the Bible says the one who isn’t disciplined by a wise and understanding person will grow up to be foolish. God’s Word is the cure for foolishness, because the Word of God is the wisdom of God. Don’t ever let the Word become too common to you. Never be casual with your study times and meditation on God’s Word. The Word is what God uses to mould your personality, form your character, create your habits, and chart your course in life in order for you to arrive at your divine destiny.



## #RealityCheck~19547

God’s Word—imbibing it— is more important than the air you breathe. If you stop taking in the Word, you’ll find yourself walking at cross-purposes with God. If you ever want your life to be balanced, full of excellence, grace and glory, the Word of God is the key. Job said, “I have cherished your Word more than my necessary food” (Job 23:12). Just as food is necessary for your body’s physical growth and development, your human spirit must feed on the Word. Colossians 3:16 says, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly” Inundate your entire being with the Word. Think through the Word; train yourself to reason only by the Word, and not only will you please God, your life will be full of His glory.



## #RealityCheck~19560

One of the beautiful and amazing benefits of having the Holy Spirit in your life is that He makes you creative and innovative. He opens your eyes to see what others don’t see and your ears to hear what others don’t hear. He anoints your eyes to see the right things, and your mind to understand and conceive lofty ideas. What God tells you to do may not be as sophisticated as the tools and strategies others are deploying, but rest assured that it will win. He’s the extraordinary strategist. He can guide you to come up with something new from something old, from an existing idea. Take advantage of the person, power and ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life. He’s your advantage. He causes you to see, think, say and do things at a superior and supernatural level. His ideas are unbeatable and the best; they win all the time.



## #RealityCheck~19576

The Bible says, “The earth is the LORD’S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein” (Psalm 24:1). Hallelujah! This means the whole world belongs to us, because we’re heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ: “And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ” (Romans 8:17). It’s the reason we can tame this world and keep it under our dominion, in line with God’s purpose. It’s the reason we can completely forbid Satan and his cronies of darkness from wreaking havoc upon the nations. We’re the restraining force against Satan and his antichrist activities, and we’re very much in office. We’ve taken our place. Maintain your focus on the Word of God; let nothing move you. You’re on the winning side.



## #RealityCheck~19587

Proverbs 18:21 says 'Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof'. When sickness attacks your body, that’s death attacking your body; you have to wake up to it and say, “No; in the Name of Jesus, I refuse to be sick!” You have to speak life to your body, for the Gospel we have received is a gospel of life; life has come to us. Words are so important in the Kingdom of God. By your words you can consistently chart your course in victory and success; you can recreate the circumstances of your life and walk in health perpetually. Hallelujah!



## #RealityCheck~19632

For the Gospel to have gotten to us in our day, some people had to pay the ultimate price.There's too much at stake to be quiet; use your position of influence to preach the Gospel to everyone. Think of what others went through fighting for the opportunities you now have all around you today. The time is short, and the return of the Master is at hand. Ensure you take advantage of every opportunity the Lord has given you to witness to others. Don’t hold back; get wild with the Gospel.



## #RealityCheck~19674

No matter what God does through us, He never wants us to be proud. Be proud of Him and what He’s made you. Be proud of His glory in your life, but never exalt yourself above someone else. Romans 12:3 says, “For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.”

The Bible lets us know that the end of all things is near; the coming of the Lord is so close: “But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer” (1 Peter 4:7). The question is, are you watching for His return? Are you expecting Him? The events and happenings around the world today are clear indications that His appearing is imminent. Don’t be caught “sleeping.” When the Apostle Paul in 1 Thessalonians 5:6 admonished us not to sleep, he wasn’t talking about physical sleep. He was talking about spiritual sleep, when you’re so deep into worldly things that you become unaware and oblivious of the spiritual realities around you. Jesus told us to watch and pray, “for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh” (Matthew 24:44).



## #RealityCheck~19697

We’re in the last days, and you have to learn to walk in the knowledge of God’s Word. We’re in what the Bible shows as “difficult or perilous times.” There’re those who are going to compromise and make decisions because of money and earthly favours. As a result, they’ll do the wrong things; things that aren’t consistent with the Christian walk. That shouldn’t be you. Don’t make a decision in life because it’s popular opinion; never follow the crowd. Remember what Jesus said: “Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it” (Matthew 7:13-14). This is very instructive.



## #RealityCheck~19710

Let the knowledge of God’s Word—the wisdom of God—guide the choices and decisions that you make. It makes no difference that you’re the only one taking a stand for Jesus Christ and for the Gospel in your estate, neighbourhood, school or place of work; keep at it. Refuse to compromise. Rather, remain “steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord” (1 Corinthians 15:58).



## #RealityCheck~19729

Christianity is a life of the spirit, lived from the inside out. Therefore, learn to worship the Lord in the spirit, with your spirit, and by the Holy Spirit: “For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh” (Philippians 3:3). Worshipping in the spirit brings about a divine exchange; as your spirit passes words in the spirit to God, the Holy Spirit imparts information to your spirit. When you’re through with such sessions of worship and fellowship, you’re full of the Spirit and are in dominion. At that point, nothing moves you. You’re more than certain of your victory. Your spirit has the dominion!



## #RealityCheck~19761

Be fervent in spirit, and preach the Gospel anywhere and everywhere. Let the light of Christ shine through you continually. Lead people to Christ. His message that we bear is filled with divine power to save and transform men’s lives. Therefore, proclaim it with intensity. Challenge, warn, and urge those around you who haven’t received Christ to do so. We’re in the time of great harvest, and the grace of God for salvation has been poured out upon all men.



## #RealityCheck~19830

Titus 2:13 says "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ". It’s easy for some to be carried away by the activities of this world and just go on like the world will always be the way it’s been. When we talk about the Rapture of the church, there’re still those who think it’s a ruse. The Rapture of the Church will be in an instant—in a flash and it’s all done—we’re all gone; but it’s for those who are waiting for Him, who are expecting Him. So, if you haven’t been living right like one who’s expecting Him, repent, because there isn’t much time left. Take your fellowship with God very seriously. Be like the wise servants the Bible talks about, who are waiting for and expecting their master (Luke 12:36-38).



## GDOP June 23rd 2023~13963

Rev Chris Oyakhilome Dsc Dsc DD


These Globalists are thinking about how to have another lockdown of nations. 
One of the attempts will be a "Climate lockdown". 

There is of course also the forced currency crash.
They want to crash the currencies of many nations so that they can reset the economies to bring in a one world economy.

These are not in pursuit of some kind of solution to a problem. They are not trying to do some good. They are psychopaths. 

Thirdly, there want to make transhumanism more attractive. There is a move to make us believe that that's what's needed in the hour
Remember, the antichrist will be a transhuman; that's why the bible will call him a beast. 


Fourth , the increased roll out of 5G. 
The lockdown would achieve many things! It provides an opportunity to lay the cabling and set up their 5G networks. 
What we have now is about 3.5 Gigahertz for the 5G. They want to take it to about 40 Gigahertz and eventually about 60 Gigahertz which will destroy people. 
What we already have is bad. It's affecting people's health. 
They want to increase it to military weapons grade.
If that's brought into the streets, then we could as well have what Mrs. Gates said in 2020 of people falling down and dying in the streets. That's Genocide. 

Fifth: International land grab: Larcerny of the greatest sort masquerading as Globalization. We are watching the emergence of 8th century feudalism. Are the people somehow journeying to serfdom without knowing it in the hands of these plutocrats?

We have to remind ourselves of some of the most brutal and wicked dictators/despots of History. If they couldn't resist them then, they somehow believed that they could not be resisted.
The dictators will never let go and the people will never be able to change it so we have to pray.
They don't respond to protests rather they threaten them with the army. 

Listen to the language of the WHO officials and the sec gen of the UN. They don't speak like you. They speak like despots. And you can tell where they are coming from and you realize why nations in Africa or Asia have become victims of their trepedicous gunboat diplomacy. But in our prayer, we will get them to where they should be in this our church age. 
The Lord told us FEAR NOT.
They belong in another lineage. We cannot fear them. 

1 John 4:1-6 MSG
Don't think about preachers in the house of God when you see "lying preachers". 

There is a crop of leaders- a group among world leaders that are dedicated to Eugenics. They've been at it for a long long time and they are deceiving others with their Philanthropy. 
Same people who are advocates of population reduction come to nations and do you believe they will help you with drugs to save your children from measles and malaria? Are you serious?
May God give you the insight and the wisdom to understand what's going on.
I pray that the blindness of your mind and heart will be removed so that you can see. 
I pray God will open your heart, your mind to know what's going on.
They will not save you or your children from measles or malaria. They will bring you drugs and vaccines to make your people sterile and kill them. That's what they will do. 

(Documentary on Depopulation Agenda)

Psalm 37: 35-36, Provs 29:2.KJV/NIV

Each one of us as children of God, we've got to have some empathy. We have to think about the poor and oppressed. 
You may be doing fine for yourself, but what about others? 

(Prayer session)



## Fresh Dew~14341

Be unapologetically bold this week. You never have to apologize for your strength and how it scares people. Use rejection as the fuel to power self improvement. The moment you allow yourself to be treated like anyone else, it is too late. You are swallowed and digested. Release your fears and embrace the new. Keep your temper. A decision made in anger is never sound You were born with greatness in you. You are amazing and worthy of the life you dream of. You just have to work for it a little longer, and it'll soon be yours! Never dull your shine for somebody else. May your week be filled with endless opportunities and infinite possibilities.



## Fresh Dew~14347

Give yourself another day, another chance. You will find your courage eventually. Don't give up on yourself just yet. Start on your goal first thing each morning, before you have a chance to overthink it. Own your actions. You're the only one responsible for taking steps to achieve your goal. Believe in yourself and you'll be okay with not knowing the outcome. Be realistic about what you can accomplish in a given timeframe. Your uniqueness is your greatest asset when you go after your goals. Choose the goals that you want to achieve ,not the goals that others want for you. Don't accept excuses from yourself. The only way you'll achieve your goal is by working for it. Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishments. You've got to get up every morning with determination if you're going to go to bed with satisfaction.



## Fresh Dew~14372

Relax. You'll live longer and perform better. The true strength of a man is in calmness. Learn to calm down the winds of your mind, and you will enjoy great inner peace. Nothing in life can create stress for you. Instead, stress is a product of how we perceive the situation. Everything is fine untill you believe it's not. When adversity strikes, that's when you have to be the most calm. Take a step back, stat strong, stat grounded and press on. You can maintain control despite uncertainty. Your peace of mind is waiting on the other side of self doubt. When we are unable to find tranquility within ourselves, it is useless to seek it elsewhere.



## Fresh Dew~14410

You can't really disappoint yourself. You can do stupid stuff that can lead you to bad consequences, but knowing that you are who you are can ease the pain. You cannot grasp tomorrow's dreams if you are holding on to yesterday's disappointments. One's best success comes after their greatest disappointments. Laughter is a cure to the bigger disappointments in life. When you are sad, look for laughter to ease the pain. Don't let little things take up too much room in your heart or you will spend your whole life being upset. Don't regret what could have been, get excited for what will be. Be thankful for things that break, because they are an opportunity for you to build something better.



## Fresh Dew~14414

If you believe, you will get anything you ask for in prayer. Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement. Nothing can be done without hope and confidence. When your heart is broke , you plant seeds in the cracks and you pray for rain. Let us not pray to be sheltered from dangers but to be fearless when facing them. We are twice armed if we fight with faith. There are two ways of spreading light. To be the candle, or the mirror that reflects it. Never give up. None of us knows what might happen even the next minute, yet still we go forward. Because we trust. Because we have faith. Sometimes life's going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. Today, know that God is there with you through all of it. The good days and the hard days.



## Fresh Dew~14430

Don't believe what your weaknesses whisper to you. They don't know the depths of your strength. Laugh at yourself. Life is too short to live with shame. Focus on the journey, not the destination. Joy is found not in finishing an activity but in doing it. When admiring other people's gardens, don't forget to tend to your own flowers. You have so much power within you, let it guide you through this. Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal, nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude. Face your challenges this week with a calm mind and a fierce heart. Don't give up. Don't lose hope. Don't sell out. Channel your energy. Focus. Either you run the day or the day runs you. The world only exists in your eyes. You can make it as big or as small as you want. Believe in yourself and your potential. Be strong in body, clean in mind and lofty in ideals.



## Fresh Dew~14434

Don't be too quick to shut the door against anyone. Don't be too quick to conclude that someone can not add value to your life again. Don't be too quick to end friendship because you don't know what the future holds.Don't be too quick to hold grudges and more importantly don't be too quick to draw a battle line with someone, for you can never know how battle will end and you might end up fighting your helper. And you know what? The bridge you burn now might be the one you need to climb to your destination. The ladder you break now out of anger might be the one you need to climb to that your desired height just as the friendship that you yanked off from because of small offence can make you stranded for the rest of your life. Even if you need to back out from an organization or friendship, it should be done politely not aggressively as if you will never need the person again. No one knows tomorrow and no one can exist alone except God. We need ourselves so let's tread with caution and respect. You have to understand that everybody is important in your life no matter their level now, tomorrow they might become your savior because the only constant thing in life is change.



## Fresh Dew~14440

Your life is like a breeze that blows and vanish away. We won't be here for too long. Our sojourn here on Earth is for a little time. I don't know why you keep living as if your end will not come one day. You'll behave to people as if you are the one that knows it all. You will abuse people as if you can't make mistake. When people come to you for help, you won't render the help even when you know the needed it. Why do we only rest in peace, why don't we live in peace too? We shed crocodile tears when people die even when you know that you were not good to them when they were alive. Someone offend you and you kept the offence in your heart for many years. You forgot that we don't stay here for long. One day we will pass away and we will be left with our works. Give people their flowers now not when they die. Spread happiness and make life a pleasant journey.



## Fresh Dew~14447

It doesn't matter if they understand you or not, Most times people count your good as evil, Many times people see your efforts in making them better as disturbance, Most times people fight the ones they should love, But it's alright and fine, Bible tells us not weary of good doing for in due season, GOD will reward us, Don't expect that anyone would see the way you see, Don't expect anyone to understand why you helped them in disguise, People don't even want to understand again, they only want to judge and hold conclusions, So whenever your good is being spoken of as evil, Rest for GOD will reward you bountifully .



## Fresh Dew~14479

Choose to forgive and let go of anger. Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil; with them forgive yourself. One sincere apology is worth a thousand fake compliments. You will never be able to move forward untill you forgive yourself and let go. A life lived without forgiveness is a prison. To be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it. I don't forgive people because I'm weak, I forgive them because I am strong enough to know people make mistakes. Love the sinner and hate the sin. Forgotten is forgiven. There's no love without forgiveness, and there is no forgiveness without love. Forgive everyone from your past so that you will have the gift of starting over. Those who are free of resentful thoughts surely find peace.



## Fresh Dew~14499

When you believe in yourself, you believe in possibilities. If you have confidence, you can make anything look good. You're perfect the way you are, you got to believe in yourself. Look nice and be radiant just for yourself today. You can have pride in what you do each day, but not arrogance in what you were born with. When you start to lower the volume of the inner voice that's making you feel bad, the more of a melody starts to play in your head with good thoughts. We all have internal struggles and personal challenges. Do not let anyone make you feel bad about yours. Any transition is easier if you believe in yourself and your talent. Radiate the light that is inside of you.



## Fresh Dew~14519

There is great beauty in going through life without anxiety or fear. Half our fears are baseless, and the other half discreditable. Free yourself from all worry and fear. The day you decide you are the master of yourself, no outside influence can control you. You are the only one who holds the power to your fears. When you notice negative things in your environment shift your attention to a positive point, it takes practice but will enhance your well being. There's nothing outside of yourself, look within. Everything you want is there. persistent, non-specific anxiety is the result of wanting so much, talking so much, and doing so much that you lose touch with the quiet joys of solitude. Never let your anxiety stop you from living life to the fullest. There's an ocean of awesomeness in front of you. You just have to be brave enough to jump in.



## Fresh Dew~14558

We are all travelers in the wilderness of this world, and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend. People are lonely because they build walls instead of bridges. When you cultivate quality relationships, not only do you feel better and help your friends feel better, but you contribute to an increase of joy, love, and peace in the world. Never be afraid to ask for help, especially when you have good friends or family who are likely more than willing to help out. The beauty of friendship is loyalty.  If you lose a friend because you're honest, it wasn't a good friend. Positive times happen with positive people. There can be no friendship without confidence, and no confidence without integrity. A true friend stabs you in the front not at your back. Hold a good friend in both your hands. Fragile egos make for fragile friendships. Surround yourself with electric people. Be true to your work, your word and your friend. Life has no blessing like a prudent friend. If you can't get one please be one.



## Fresh Dew~14569

Let no man pull you low enough to hate him. Don’t have time, energy or interest in hating the haters; be too busy loving the lovers. People who use other people as stepping stones will one day lose their balance. The enemy is fear. We think it is hate; but, it is fear. If you find yourself constantly surrounded by drama, it’s probably because you’re creating space for it. Close the space by walking away. Don’t let anyone walk through your mind with their dirty feet. Don’t let anyone destroy your dreams. Remember new levels bring new devils. No one can defeat you until you defeat yourself. Being judged by others means you’re so important that they have the time to think about you and talk about you. When you refuse to let a negative person frustrate or anger you, you take away their power over you. Live a life filled with such positivity it drowns out the negativity that surrounds you.



## Fresh Dew~14598

Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right. The doors of wisdom are never shut. What you’re supposed to do when you don’t like a thing is change it. If you can’t change it, change the way you think about it. Don’t complain. Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are. Don’t waste your time with expectations: people only hear what they want to hear. Do unto others as you would have them do to you. I know the world is bruised and bleeding, and though it is important not to ignore its pain, it is also critical to refuse to succumb to its malevolence. Sometimes life’s going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. The good you did yesterday will bring you happiness when you wake.



## Fresh Dew~14609

Never, never, never give up. Don’t let doubt extinguish your potential. Stop wishing. Start doing. Nothing is impossible when you believe in yourself. Sometimes you win. Sometimes you learn. A good day starts with a  good mindset. Don’t watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going. No one is you and that is your superpower. You will be tested, but don’t quit. Take responsibility and initiative for yourself. Life is not one big rehearsal. The last call may be today, live your life to the fullest. Focus only on the things you wish to see. Keep doing the right thing, even if it scares you. Keep being you, no matter who the world is pushing you to be. Stay true to your soul. Your best is yours, you don’t have to measure it based on the values of others. You are worthy.



## Fresh Dew~14631

Our best-laid plans are defeated by thinking too much. When you know what you want, take action. Each action you take guides your next step. Nothing in the world can bother you as much as your own mind, I tell you. Our experience of life is defined by the thoughts that we hold. A crowded mind leaves no space for a peaceful heart. Let the little things go, don’t keep them bottled up in your heart. The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation, but your thoughts about it. Be aware of the thoughts you are thinking. Overthinking is the quickest way to make a situation worse than it actually is. There will always be difficult people and situations. For your own sake, choose to be at peace with them.

Prolific morning first flight team. You are fruitful and productive.



## Fresh Dew~14641

if you don’t control your temper, your temper will control you. Most people don’t have that willingness to break bad habits. They have a lot of excuses and they talk like victims. Not all wounds are visible. Your journey to freedom is when you remove the baggage weighing you down. If you move past the hurt, you’ll bleed all over someone who didn’t cut you. If they talk at your back, don’t react. They know they can’t dare to say it at your face. People show their true colors when times get rough, remember that. The best way to move forward is to let go of the people holding you back. The saddest thing is to be a minute to someone, when you’ve made them your eternity. Don’t waste moments waiting and wondering.



## Fresh Dew~14649

Even if you cannot see it from where you are, someone somewhere loves you for you. Just because someone stumbles and loses their path, doesn’t mean they’re lost forever. A man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears. A certain darkness is needed to see the stars. When you expect the best, you release a magnetic force in your mind which by a law of attraction tends to bring the best to you. Nothing can stop you when your mind, body, and soul align. Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do. People will always try to push you down with their negativity. Stick to your path and show them the magic of positivity. Start each day with renewed hope.



## Fresh Dew~14669

When you learn, teach. When you get, give. Do unto others as you would have them do to you. You are your choices. Some of life’s greatest lessons are learned from its worst moments and biggest mistakes. The experiences of life offers you what flows from you. Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat. No great thing is created suddenly. Be a master of the mind, not mastered by the mind. The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person who is doing it. Wear your wisdom with silence in front of fools. Those who flow as life flows know they need no other force. Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.



## Fresh Dew~14677

If I can see pain in your eyes, then share with me your tears. If I can see joy in your eyes, then share with me your smile. I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. It’s the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death. Our death is not an end if we can live on in our children and the younger generation. For they are us; our bodies are only wilted leaves on the tree of life. The day which we fear as our last is but the birthday of eternity. Pain and death are part of life. To reject them is to reject life itself.



## Fresh Dew~14696

Focus on the positive so you can live your life to the fullest. The worst times can be the best if you think with positive energy. If you weren’t happy yesterday, do something different today. Plan some time for yourself every day to unwind. Do it for the younger version of you who couldn’t. Whatever is happening in your life, you must remain encouraged. Life becomes easier and more beautiful when we can see the good in other people. Celebrate the good times and forget about the bad times. Positive mindset makes way for a life full of adventure.



## Fresh Dew~14717

Inner thoughts are powerful. They create emotions, which in turn, cause ACTIONS. We have to TAKE OWNERSHIP of our INNER DIALOG. It is so easy to be negative, anxious, angry, doubtful, bitter or carnal in our thinking. Instead, we NEED to be RESPONSIBLE for what we THINK and DELIBERATELY FOCUS on TRUE, HONORABLE, RIGHT, PURE, LOVELY, ADMIRABLE, EXCELLENT and PRAISE WORTHY THOUGHTS. This would bring discipline to your LIFE. When you take control of your attitude, you take control of your life. Be the kind of person who dares to face life's challenges and overcome them rather than dodging them. The life you want is just within your grasp.



## Fresh Dew~14720

When life knocks you lower than you've ever been, the Universe will help you stand back up taller than ever before. Your comeback is on its way! Picture the end. When the world says, Give up, hope whispers, Try it one more time. When life breaks you, find a glue inside of yourself and rebuild. The solution to most of our deepest troubles is simple, human courage. The courage to look inward. The courage to take those first bold steps. The courage to find the thing you fear most and charge heroically toward it. The struggle you are in today is developing the strength you need tomorrow. Pain is only temporary. Stay patient, stay strong, and know that this too shall pass. The undertaking of a new action brings new strength.



## Fresh Dew~14746

You are never given anything in this world that you can’t handle. No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn’t trying. Don’t compare yourself to anyone, you are unique. Don’t give up. One day you’ll look back and be glad you didn’t. It’s okay if life isn’t sunny right now. You can create your own sunshine. You’re amazing like that! If what you have isn’t what you want, you have the power to identify what needs to change and to change it. In a gentle way, you can shake the world. The universe will never let you run out of chances. Start over as often as you need. You’ve got this! Fight for what you want the most. You are ready for a new phase in your life. Keep going to keep growing.



## Fresh Dew~14752

Let your soul be filled with creativity. Happiness radiates through your body. You are a great person. You are blessed with an abundance of health. Learn to trust yourself more every day. Cherish the time you take to refill. You will overcome any challenges. You are capable. Focus on the one thing you can do now. You can get through any period in your life. Always make sure to make time for yourself every day. Make positive choices for yourself. Always see the best in others. Do things that make people happy. Be rich in divine ideas, wealthy in divine abundance. Find light in the darkest places. EVery thing is happening perfectly for you. Let go of all tension and stress. You are going to do amazing things this week. Abandon your old habits and take up new positive ones. Choose love as your response to others. Be in harmony with divine guidance. Start every day off on the right foot. Find joy and pleasure in the simplest things in life. Is well.



## Fresh Dew~14758

Surround yourself with people who want to see you win and are willing to help you get there. It’ll happen when it’s meant to, but only if you’re working for it. Stay connected to those who bring out the best in you. Set both short and long term goals. Reaching the short term goals will encourage you to keep going to that long term goal. Things are flowing and moving in your direction, stay on the path. If you can’t find a solution Io a challenge, try changing your perspective. Talk to a mentor or someone who’s already been through it for a fresh opinion. Starve your distractions. Give yourself permission to set new goals and transform your life. Celebrate the milestones along the way, not just the victory at the end. Harness the power of optimism.



## Fresh Dew~14765

Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful. Bravery comes from being vulnerable. Trust in your abilities. Trust the process and let it flow. Don’t trust words, trust actions. You have to trust that the dots you create will connect to your future. Trust everyone but don’t trust the devil inside them. Trust the wait that is needed for your growth. Turn your worry into wonder. Faith gives you the opportunity to watch uncertainty turn into sureness. Never let anyone talk you into not believing in yourself. Trust your instincts. Never trust a person that has let you down more than twice. Once was a warning, twice was a lesson, and anything more than that is simply taking advantage. You don’t need validation from others who don’t even trust themselves. Everyone and everything that’s meant for you is coming your way, even if it has to make its way back.



## Fresh Dew~14772

Words spoken can not be recalled so think twice before you speak. When you do something beautiful and nobody noticed, do not be sad. For the sun every morning is a beautiful spectacle, and yet most of the audience still sleeps. Silence is a fence around wisdom. The eyes are useless when the mind is blind. Certain things catch your eye, but pursue only those that capture the heart. A man is but the product of his thoughts what he thinks, he becomes. Life has meaning only if you do what is meaningful to you. Don’t be pushed by your problems. Be led by your dreams. Care about what other people think and you will always be their prisoner. Sometimes you have to shut your eyes, so you can see the real beauty. Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.



## Fresh Dew~14797

Healing is hard, staying wounded is harder. When you don’t have the strength to walk through the darkness. Reach for a hand. Own your strength and wear it proudly. Never make yourself seem smaller just to make others more comfortable. Be strong enough to refuse to let other people steal your joy. The most beautiful views come after the most challenging climbs. There’s a future version of you who’s proud you were strong enough. Keep going. Ignore the sweat, tears and doubts. You are stronger than you think. Falling down doesn’t define failure; staying down does. Brush yourself off and start over. Keep your fears to yourself, but share your inspiration with others. Every struggle in your life has shaped you into the person you are today. Be thankful for the hard times, they can only make you stronger. In the middle of a difficulty lies opportunity. Stay on course when others are trying to drag you down, fight for yourself. You are strong!



## Fresh Dew~14814

With the right attitude anything is possible. You can accomplish anything. The only limits are the ones you create in your head. Don’t dwell on what went wrong. Instead, focus on what to do next. Spend your energies on moving forward toward finding the answer. Life is tough but so you are. Tell yourself that you can, even when you feel like you want to give up. You’ve done it before and you can do it again. Enter every activity without giving mental recognition to the possibility of defeat. Concentrate on your strengths, instead of your weaknesses, on your powers, instead of your problems. Expect problems or challenges and eat them for breakfast. Be patient. Remember that big things are not achieved all at once. They are achieved day by day and week by week. If you think you can do it, you can. Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.



## Fresh Dew~14832

They laugh at you because you are different; you laugh at them because they are all the same. Plants need to be buried to grow. You’re just going through a planting phase, waiting to grow. Stop being who you were and become who you are. If you’re not failing, you’re not pushing your limits, and if you’re not pushing your limits, you’re not maximizing your potential. Every opportunity to begin again is a chance to grow and learn. Outstanding people have one thing in common: an absolute sense of mission. Uncertainty breeds change. If you want to fly, you have to let go of everything that’s holding you down. Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction can be the biggest step of your life. Much effort, much prosperity.

Remove “Shoulds” from your vocabulary this remaining months. Start your journey of self love now. Embrace and love your body. It’s the most amazing thing you will ever own. Rather than beating yourself up for what you are not doing, appreciate and celebrate the things you are doing. Loving yourself will make you unstoppable. You were born an original work of art. Stay original always. Originals cost more than imitations. People who live themselves, don’t hurt other people. The more we hate ourselves, the more we want others to suffer. A link doesn’t concern himself with the opinion of a sheep. Level up your life by honing in on your heart.



## Fresh Dew~14933

Your life will get easier when you become more disciplined. Challenges are presented for you to learn. Be patient with yourself and trust the process. Remember the tortoise won the race, not the hare. There’s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that’s your own self. Life is surely the guide that you never knew you always needed. Remain steady during challenges. Remember why you began in the first place, what your vision is, and keep going. A year from now, you won’t believe how far you’ve gone. Stop being a prisoner of your past. Become the architect of your future.

Good morning beloved. Blessed week



## Fresh Dew~14941

It’s not about how long your life is, it’s about how well you lived it. The things you do either give you energy or drain you. Choose wisely. The only power that exists is inside ourselves. You are far greater than your negative thoughts. You are capable of happiness and peace at this very moment. Fresh air, movement, and laughter are the most underrated remedies for sorrow. Do not allow the energy of negative people to affect you. Keeping a quiet mind will help you control your emotional chaos. Do every act of your life as though it were the last act of life. Stop your thoughts for a minute, only focus on what is right now.



## Fresh Dew~14947

You can do anything as long as you have the passion, the drive, the focus, and the support. Love what you do and do what you love. Passion is the key that opens the door to joy and abundance. Pursue your passion, and everything else will fall into place. This is not being romantic. This is the highest order of pragmatism. These are the signs of someone who lacks passion for life. Life has become a monotonous, droning chore that they get no joy out of any longer. Chase your passion, not your pension.



## Fresh Dew~14953

Whether you think you can, or think you can’t. You’re right. Not all success comes from hard work, it also requires a vision of the end goal. Never give in and never give up. Behind every successful man there’s a lot of unsuccessful years. It’s not where you start but how high you aim that matters for success. The elevator to success is out of order. You’ll have to use the stairs. One step at a time. Pick battles big enough to matter, small enough to win. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit. The road to growth isn’t always an easy journey, but it’s the most rewarding one to drive on. The difference between who you are and who you want to be is what you do.



## Fresh Dew~14980

Wake up. Hope is not found in the mind. It comes from the heart and is fueled by the soul. You might not realize it right now, but there are so many people watching you and drawing inspiration from you. Do it for them. There is value in you as you are today. Do it for yourself. Base your decisions on your hopes and dreams and not on your fears. Everything always works out in the end. Start with the end in mind. Don’t wait. Life goes faster than you think. Go do something great. Move forward to new paths in life.



## Fresh Dew~15002

When the pressure mounts, take time out to reset and relax. You owe it to yourself to engage in activities you love. Let your optimistic thoughts outnumber your anxieties. Focus on the good in each situation, even when it is hard to find. A calm and modest life brings more happiness than the pursuit of success combined with constant restlessness. Don’t hope that events will turn out the way you want, welcome events in whichever way they happen: this is the path to peace. Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without. Just for today, try to live in the world outside of your head. It’s beautiful out here. We don’t realize that, somewhere within us all, there does exist a supreme self who is eternally at peace. Relaxation comes from letting go of tense thoughts.



## Fresh Dew~15009

Everything is created twice, first in the mind and then in reality. When you are feeling down, never fake it. Let it go and let it flow. Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, have few desires. You must never be fearful about what you are doing when it is right. Overthinking causes unnecessary stress and worry, and tends to blow things out of proportion. You must learn to silence your mind. This allows you to clear the clutter that occupies it daily. Sky above, earth below, peace within. Fearlessness presupposes calmness and peace of mind.



## Fresh Dew~15033

Let go of what doesn’t work so your hands are free to hold what’s meant for you. The past doesn’t want you to let go of your old self, so sometimes it will keep bumping into you to see if you are ready for change. Sometimes you have to unfollow people in real life. Courage is learning to let go of what was once familiar. We attract into our lives that on which we focus. The life that you desire is created by giving your attention to what you want. May be it’s time to say goodbye to everything holding you back and allow yourself to fly. Whenever you hold on to something, you prevent yourself from receiving new things in life. Forgive yourself for putting yourself through this. You can only lose what you cling to. If you can’t fix what is broken, it may be time to walk away. You wouldn’t put weights on your ankle if you were trying to swim.



## Fresh Dew~15041

Make your dreams a reality. Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people. Take a break. Sip on something. Breath. Listen to your favourite song. Today is your day. Either you run the day or the day runs you. Life is waiting for you once you let go of the old one. Every relationship you have is a reflection of your relationship with your self. Go make your life the one you have always wanted, knowing you have the power to make it happen. Think like a proton, always positive. Do you know who you are? Don’t ask. Act. Action will delicate and define you. Until you are happy with who you are, you will never be happy with what you have. You were born to win, but to be. Winner, you must plan to win, prepare to win, and expect to win.



## Fresh Dew~15049

A man who doesn’t trust himself can ne really trust anyone else. Trust, honesty, humility, transparency, and accountability are the building blocks of a positive reputation. Trust is the foundation of any relationship. Forget what people say to your face. Look at their actions. Never tell the truth to people who are not worthy of it. Your expectations forcany giveb situation will greatly influence the end result. What you are doing this very week is amazing. Give yourself some credit. You deserve it. Make sure you fill your mind with happy thoughts for every moment it tries to bring you to the sad ones. Conquer your fears and remind yourself that you are a warrior. You always have been, even if you had temporarily forgotten. Know your worth and believe in it. If only our eyes saw souls instead of bodies, how very different our ideas of beauty would be. If you don’t like the music life plays you, write your own symphony.



## Fresh Dew~15111

When you know what you want, and you want it badly enough, you’ll find a way to get it. If you are not where you want to be it is because you are not grinding hard enough. What’s the first step you need to take to reach your goal? Write it down and look at it everyday. If you look at what you have in life, you’ll always have more. If you look at what you don’t have in life, you’ll never have enough. Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve. Some people don’t like change, but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster. Stay out of your comfort zone. This week, concentrate all your thoughts upon the work in hand. Either you run the day or the day runs you. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too. What you do today can improve all your tomorrow. Am sending major good vibes your way. For every challenge encountered, there is opportunity for growth.



## Fresh Dew~15132

Wise is he who collects the wisdom of others. Every positive change in your life begins with a clear, unequivocal decision that you are going to either do something or stop doing something. Problems only exist in the human mind. The energy of the mind is the essence of life. If there’s a book you really want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it. Don’t let the noise of other people’s opinions drown your inner voice. Maturity means realizing that everyone has a story worth telling.  Take charge! If you are easily provoked you are easily controlled. There are two days in the year that we can not do anything, yesterday and tomorrow. Life is full of adventure. There’s no such thing as a clear pathway. Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors. Life begins where fear ends. You were born an original. Don’t die a copy.



## Fresh Dew~15145

It’s okay to hurt. It’s okay to be mad. It’s not okay to stay where you aren’t wanted, loved, and cherished. Your broken heart is just screaming to be seen and loved anyways. Ending a relationship is just that, finish it by deleting any type of contact. If they want to come back, they will have to work for it and you get to decide whether or not to open up again. Don’t be afraid of losing someone who is willing to lose you. The person you’re meant to be with will never have to be chased , begged or given an ultimatum. Love has a way of creating space in your life even when you refused to love again. If someone treats you like an option, make yourself a priority and let them go. If you can’t change it, let it go! It’s delicious to have people adore you, but it’s exhausting, too. Particularly when your own feelings don’t match theirs. One day, someone will walk into your life and make you see why it never worked out with anyone else.



## Fresh Dew~15157

Never let your anxiety stop you from living life to the fullest. I believe that fear of life brings a greater fear of death. Putting yourself out there will be the most freeing thing you have ever done. Spending time thinking about what you have no control over is a waste of your time. Work on what you do have control over. If you’re always thinking about what can go wrong, you miss out on all the things that could go right. Don’t let the fear of failure stop you from doing what you care about. Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be. The fear of being laughed at makes cowards of us all. You have so much to offer to the world. Remove all doubt, remove all fear, remove all worry. This is the way to release anxiety. Stop worrying and start enjoying your time. Balancing time you spend with or without people is crucial for mental health. It’s not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it. You must try every day to become better at not letting your mind run away from you. No one on the entire planet knows what’s best for you more than you. Be your own biggest fan. Love yourself and give yourself the things that you need.



## Fresh Dew~15162

Thank God is Friday. Some days you need to take a break and relax. Learn to do so without feeling guilty. You don’t need anyone’s permission to go after  your goals single mindedly. Share the love that was missing during the week. Favour the moment. Don’t live your Friday wishing it was Saturday. Hang out with friends. Have fun. Good vibe, don’t frown and let the monster see you smile. Don’t be pushed by your problems. Be led by your dreams. Open your heart and share time. Live life to the fullest and focus on the positive. Always turn a negative situation into a positive situation. Don’t let technology follow you throughout your weekend. Take a break, you will be more refreshed. You’re on the verge of something amazing. You need more kindness, more compassion, more joy, more laughter. Appreciate the moments you have today because by tomorrow they’ll be gone. Take responsibility if your own happiness, never put it in other people’s hands. NO PRESSURE! NO DIAMONDS.!



## Fresh Dew~15201

The only person who can pull you down is yourself, and You are not going to let yourself pull you down anymore. Happiness is a direction, not a place. Each day, do your best and let go of the rest. Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around. Don’t limit your challenges. Challenge your limits. I took my bruises and my humps, fell down and got right back up. Open your heart to miracle. Love the life you live. Lead the life you love. Stop replaying it in your mind and start something new. Failure is less painful when you enjoy what you do. Nothing valuable comes fast. Happiness and confidence are the prettiest things you can wear. People like to be around those who give off positive energy. Follow your soul.



## Fresh Dew~15207

Most of us have two lives: the life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands Resistance. We may not choose our circumstances but we do choose our attitude and our response. You can control your attitude. Set it each morning. Take a simple view of life: keep your eyes open and get on with it. This life is what you make it. Your only regrets will be what you didn’t do, so live your life to the fullest. Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities.



## Fresh Dew~15219

The Universe has its process. Give in and let it occur naturally. It will work out for you if you let it. There is only one meditation - the rigorous refusal to harbor thoughts. When you feel anger beginning to build up inside of you, let your whole body droop and relax to the best of your ability while beginning to breathe slowly from the diaphragm. Breathing in this way helps to calm both the body and the mind which leads to letting go of anger before it takes a hold. Choose optimism. You’ll be happy you did. Let the mind come as it wants; just you don’t go with it. The greatest salesman in the world cannot sell you if you don’t buy. Be careful how you are talking to yourself because you are listening. Choose happiness and happiness will choose you. You should not be carried away by the dictation of the mind, but the mind should be carried by your dictation.



## Fresh Dew~15226

Don’t worry about being cool. Worry about being the best. They may have their opinion, but you know your reality. Remember who you are and celebrate that person, no one can dim your light. Be confident, strong and deserving. Everything and everyone meant for you needs you to be yourself so that it can find you. Sometimes the strongest weapon of all is your mind. Let it protect you, not hurt you.



## Fresh Dew~15231

As riches increase and accumulate in few hands, the tendency of things will be to depart from the republican standard. When it is a question of money, everybody is of the same religion. We have always believed that it’s possible to make money without being evil. Time is money. Money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. Don’t stay in bed unless you can make money in bed. Money is a way of measuring wealth but is not wealth in itself. Money moves from those who do not manage it to those who do. Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil. Rich people stay rich by living like they are broke. Broke people stay broke by living like they are rich.



## Fresh Dew~15259

Challenges are facts of life, they are everywhere. Everyone has one challenge or another they are trying to solve. At any point in your life you either have the things you want, or the reasons why you don't. Stop blaming your circumstances and environment! No more excuses, make it happen! Excuses are useless, results are priceless! There's o such thing as being too busy, if you truly want something. You'll truly make time for it. Stop the glorification of busyness! Wake up! Listen, there are only two options; make progress or make excuses. Which ever you put up with, you end up with! This is your week. Do big things and you will be overwhelmed with what comes back.



## Fresh Dew~15273

Feeling betrayed ? Have you been hurt by someone you trusted? Are you holding onto a grudge for something someone has done to you? Though these are natural and instinctive emotions, these feelings ultimately never lead to what God truly desires for us. In God's word, we find true forgiveness, healing, comfort and peace that we so desperately need. God wants you to be at peace, fearless, full of faith, hope and love, right? He wouldn't want you anxious or full of anger. Tempers flare, frustration takes root, we end up saying things we don't mean. When you feel yourself getting hot under the caller, seek God's guidance and find a calming spirit. Christ died for you, so that you may come to know his unending love and share that love with others. Don't be full of hate, anger, resentful. It will destroy you.



## Fresh Dew~15278

Don't be judgemental, avoid judging people. The only person who remains worthy to make judgement is God Almighty. No one is perfect in this world. Learn to remove the speck in your eye before removing the speck in another person's eye. Be very vigilant and meticulous in your dealings with your fellow man. Stay with the word of God, pray and always get closer to God. Your word is a reflection of you, if you want to change the way you live, change your way of thinking! To have the mind of Christ, we must break the paradigm and patterns in ourselves that are resistant to change! God has good things for you! His plans are for you to prosper and not harm you. Open your heart and mind to be sensitive and receive what He has for you!



## Fresh Dew~15291

Remember to do everything with an abundance of love, so that one day you will remember the beauty of every moment lived. Follow your soul. It knows the way. The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. Everyone's story ends in death, what makes it a tragedy is not letting yourself have a great life while you are here. Enjoy all the moments of your life to the fullness. We never remember days, only moments live without doubts. Live without limits. Life is a journey not a race. Live in the present, forget the past and don't worry about the future. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.



## Fresh Dew~15297

Let your words be kind and affectionate. Refuse to have itching ears for gossip, and don't be company with those who are fond of discussing the affairs of others. And besides they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and not only idle but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not to say. Clean out your social life, clean out your fridge, clean out your house and focus on your future. The solution to most of our deepest troubles is simple, human courage. The courage to look inward. The courage to take those first bold steps. The courage to find the things you fear most and charge heroically towards it. There is no limit to your possibilities.



## Fresh Dew~15383

Write down where you want to be on the future. Then write down the steps you need to take to get there. Choose success. By creating a mental picture of yourself successfully completing a job, you can increase your chances of success. Try your best and reach for the stars. But do not try to reach without stretching or you would be disappointed. Make your goal public. If you tell someone or write down your goal. You’ve essentially made a promise to keep your word. There are abundant opportunities for you, if you’re willing to put in the work. Be ruthless in cutting out distractions. Your dreams need your energy right now. Make sure your goals have a time frame, not just some day. Having an end date will help you keep on track.



## Fresh Dew~15423

Inner Peace begins when you focus on the present. Be happy in your stillness. Training gives us an outlet for suppressed energies created by stress and thus tones the spirit just as exercise conditions the body. The conditioning of your mind says a lot about where you are in life. What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow. Our life is the creation of our mind. Energy is contagious, positive and negative alike. You will forever be mindful of what and who you are allowing into your space. Remain balanced and confident in yourself.



## Fresh Dew~15430

To acquire knowledge, one must study but to acquire wisdom, one must observe. When the well is dry, we know the value of water. The ability to be patient created the fertile soil from which the crops of our dreams will later be harvested. Give out what you want to get back. We cannot become what we want by remaining what we are. In the end, the treasure of life is missed by those who hold on and gained by those who let go. Be swift to hear, slow to speak. When the winds of change blow, some people build walls and others build windmills. close both eyes to see with the other eye.



## Fresh Dew~15448

Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self. There is something which you can do better than another. Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. Do the things at which you are great, not what you were never made for. I think the best role models for women are people who are confidently themselves, who bring light into the world. There’s clarity in deciding your values for yourself. You don’t have to value things because someone else does, and you are allowed to value things that others don’t. Be a rainbow in someone else’s cloud. Faith in oneself is the best and safest course. The better you feel about yourself, the less you feel the need to show off. Don’t forget to tell yourself positive things daily. You must love yourself internally to glow externally.



## Fresh Dew~15457

You don’t love someone for their looks, or their clothes or forvtheir fancy car but because they sing a song only you can hear. Real love is that which ennobled the personality, fortifies the heart and sanctifies the existence. Extraordinary love requires extraordinary souls. There are people who wish to love more and give more of themselves. They find out that the highest form of love is unconditional. Find a heart that will love you at your worst and arms that will hold you at your weakest. You don’t just meet your soulmate, your heart recognizes them. Distance is just a test of how far love can travel. It is hard to compete with unconditional love. When two hearts are meant to be together, nothing can keep them apart. Couples that go through challenging times come out stronger. When two soulmates come together, their electricity could light up the room. Know what  you are feeling.



## Fresh Dew~15509

The human body is the best picture of the human soul. You are motivating and inspiring others with your strength and determination. Try to spend a few minutes outdoors everyday. Fresh air and sunshine can renew your soul. If you’re healthy all around, you’ll feel better, and if you feel better, you’ll have a more positive outlook. It’s all connected. Do it for you: for your body, your mind, and your soul. Your body hears everything you say to it. Make sure the words you speak are encouraging and inspiring. Take care of your health. Establish good habits that will serve you for the rest of your life. The right attitude does more for your health than time at the gym. Keep good company, read good books, love good things and cultivate soul and body as faithfully as you can.

Blissful morning saints Have a prolific week with lots of love.



## Fresh Dew~15522

Protect your energy, reserve it for those who’ve earned it. We don’t get to choose our family, but we can choose our friends. With courage, we can weed out narcissistic people. We can focus on those who do appreciate us, love us, and treat us with respect. The only people who deserve to be in your life are the ones who treat you with love, kindness and respect. Crocodiles are east. They try to kill and eat you. People are harder. Sometimes they pretend to be your friend first. If the people in your circle aren’t contributing to your growth, then you’re not in a circle, you’re in a cage. Stop worrying about what others think of you. Their opinions don’t pay your bills. Know your worth, and make sure others know it too. Be around those who realize it and value you. It’s not about who is real in your face, it’s about who stays loyal behind your back. If you sit at a table where they talk about others, you’ll be the next topic if conversation when you get up. Be wise!



## Fresh Dew~15534

Celebrate your strength, you’ve fought hard to achieve them. The sky is not the limit. Your mind is. Gratitude lights a fire in your soul that not even a bad day can put out. You’re hanging in there and fighting your way through. You should be proud of yourself for not giving up. If you’re always wishing for a better tomorrow, may be its time to enjoy the best of today. Stop the overthinking and watch how easily the good vibes will overflow. There are millions of ways to love yourself. Make sure you do one every day. Remember, no matter what this week brings, you can handle it. Your thoughts will change your life. Choose them wisely. Hard days are what make you stronger. Even your worst days only have twenty-four hours. The sun will set, and a new day will begin.



## Fresh Dew~15547

Keep moving forward towards your dreams, even if that means leaving your current job behind. Never stop believing in your goals even if job duties temporarily pause them. Even a job you hate has something to teach you. Learn what you need to learn and take your lessons with you to the next one. This page might not be your favourite, but the next chapter of your life will be incredible. You don’t always get what you wish for. But you always get what you work for. Never make a negative decision in the low time. Never make your most important decisions when you are in your worst moods. Wait, be patient. The storm will pass. The spring will come. Your time is coming. Just do the work and the result will handle themselves.



## Fresh Dew~15555

Just because you’re not talking about it doesn’t mean you are not feeling it. To suffer some anxiety, some depression, some disappointment, even some failure is normal. Look for the light in your darkest times. This feeling will pass. The fear is real but the danger is not. You’re going to look back at this and be so glad you kept going. Keep it up, you’re amost there! Destructive thoughts wear masks of concern and care. Free your mind from anything that causes you pain. Hope is the bridge to life that allows you to cross into something new. The pain is an opportunity to resurrect our true selves. You must always do your best every day,  even when you are feeling defeated. Always do your best.



## Fresh Dew~15586

Just as your body is nourishes by the food you eat, your brain is nourishes by what you feed it. Life can be stormy. Hold your umbrella high and be patient. The skies will clear for you soon. Even if things don’t get better, you will. You’ll get stronger, braver, and more resilient. Never forget that you’re a warrior. The body achieves what the mind believes. Just like food feeds your body, what you hear and see feeds your mind. It might seem like you’re fighting this battle alone. But there are so many people rooting for you and in your corner. You are watched over and protected more than you know. Treat your mental and physical health as top priority, you only get to live once. This is your week. Take advantage of it. Having a healthy mind is just as important as a healthy body. Remember this: you are strong enough to make it happen.

Blissful morning first flight team. Have a wonderful week. I love you.



## Fresh Dew~15594

When your heart and your brain are at war, listen to the one that urges you to keep going. Overcoming your negative self thoughts is one of the most important things you can do for yourself. When you focus on what’s blessing you, you’ll forget what’s depressing you. Be thankful even for your struggles. They won’t break you, they will make you. Don’t worry about what you can’t control. Our focus and energy needs to be on the things we can control. Attitude, effort, focus—these are the things we can control. Put aside worry and doubt and just enjoy where you are now. Do what is best for your heart, even if that means leaving. Even when all the news is negative, there’s always something positive to be found. Even if you have to look a little bit harder for it. You don’t need anyone else in your life to be happy. Date yourself. Take yourself to a nice dinner. Go see the latest movie. But yourself flowers. Make yourself happy. When things change inside you, things change around you.



## Fresh Dew~15601

You’ll only make progress when you get the courage to step outside of your comfort zone. The past is just a lesson. The present is your gift. The future is your motivation. The transformation might not happen overnight. But small, daily changes will still get you to wherever you want to be. You were born with the power to change your life. Once you realize that, the whole game will change. Doors are closed for a reason. Find a new door, find a window, climb a wall. Your options are limitless if your desire is endless. You know those big dreams you have? The universe put them into your heart for a reason. If you want something you never had, you have to do the things you’ve never done. Train your mind to see solutions, not the problems. Your destiny is so beautiful. Have faith in it and in yourself.



## Fresh Dew~15608

Bad things do happen how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness, immobilized by the gravity of my loss, or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I have —life itself. One of the things that pains me is we have so tragically underestimated the trauma, the hardship we create in this country when we treat people unfairly, when we incarcerate them unfairly, when we condemn them unfairly. Recovery is a process. It takes time. It takes patience. It takes everything you’ve got. The mind replays what the heart can’t delete. If the wounds on her heart and the bruises on her soul were translated on her skin, you wouldn’t recognize her at all. What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.



## Fresh Dew~15617

May you have an amazing day, you deserve it. Since you’re already on your phone, why not make a positive post on social media? Encourage others and spread positivity! You give loyalty, you’ll get it back. You give Love, you’ll get it back. Respond to difficult people with patience so you will know you did your best. Good things will flow into your life today. Let the players play, let the haters hate, and let karma handle their fate.



## Fresh Dew~15656

When one door closes, look for the one that opens. There are always other opportunities open to you, you just have to look for them. Stop poking at your emotional scars. Like any other wound, they need to be left alone to heal. Give yourself grace and time. Let go of grudges. They make you sad and resentful. Accept the apology you never received and let go of negative emotions so you can find your happiness once more. Stay positive. Talk to yourself in positive, uplifting ways even when you feel “Stuck” or unmotivated. The strength isn’t in avoiding the storm, it’s in rising above it. Stay hopeful. Stay motivated. Stay strong. Your week is blessed.



## Fresh Dew~15659

You must tell yourself, no matter how hard it is, or how hard it gets, I’m going to make it. This is your reminder that yes, you are strong enough to overcome anything and everything that life throws at you. Your mental health is a priority. Your happiness is an essential. Your self-care is a necessity. Whatever comes your way today: stay calm, stay focused, stay strong. Be kind to yourself. What you may see a flaw is what others admire as your strength. Let your feelings flow. Some days are happy days, some are sad days. Both are valid. My dark days made me strong. Or maybe I already was strong, and they made me prove it. Reset, restart, refocus. But don’t you dare give up on your dreams. When you start to appreciate your life, you’ll see how much you have that’s worth living for. Inhale determination, exhale doubt.



## Fresh Dew~15672

Embrace your flaws and your imperfections, for they make you unique and beautiful. Work on yourself every day and become the best version of yourself.

When the alarm bell of the emotional brain keeps signaling that you are in danger, no amount of insight will silence it. A great loss brings up an emotional storm that opens up a hidden reservoir of childhood pain. Trauma is a fact of life. It does not, however, have to be a life sentence. The problem with having problems is that “someone“ always has it worse. Talking openly about your mental illness is not seeking attention, you are seeking help. There are wounds that never show on the body that are deeper and more hurtful than anything that bleeds but When you can tell your story and it doesn’t make you cry, you know you have healed. Don’t let pain, turn your heart into something ugly. Surviving can be beautiful.

Your time is priceless, don’t waste it on endless scrolling. Life is a marathon, not a race. Take your time. If you don’t enjoy the moments, you will have to settle for enjoying the memories. Take time every day to appreciate what you have. Time is money. Waste it now. Pay for it later! All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us. Some time in your day today, try to turn off all the noises you can around you, and give yourself some “quiet time”. In the silence, let yourself think about something. Or if possible, think about nothing. Spend more time doing things that make you forget about the time. Don’t sit around waiting for the perfect moment to happen. Take this moment and make it perfect.

The worst kind of hurt is betrayal because it means someone was willing to hurt you just to make themselves feel better. Cheaters don’t think cheating is wrong until they get cheated on.

The universe loves balance. For everything and everyone you lose, you’ll get back something or someone so much better. You deserve someone who is terrified of losing you. You deserve a person who’s willing to fight for you all the way, every day, for the rest of your life. Some people will see your flowers and call them weeds. Others will see your weeds, and think you’re the most beautiful flowers in the garden. It’s amazing how quickly things can turn around when you remove toxic people from your life.surround yourself with positive people who believe in your dream, encourage your ideas, support your ambitions and bring out the best in you.

Time is the precious thing we have. Don’t waste yours. Nothing is so dear and precious as time. Remember that time is money. Use your time wisely, consciously, and productively. Taking crazy things seriously is a serious waste of time. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done. Enjoy the little things, for one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. Not tomorrow, not next month, the time is now. Everything happens in the universe’s timing. Stop rushing and let yourself breathe. You don’t get paid for the hour. You get paid for the value you bring to the hour. Lack of time is actually lack of priorities. The most important time in the world is the time you make for yourself. Your time is valuable. Every moment counts, try not to waste it. You only have 24 hours in a day, so your life depends on how you use your time.

Together, we can rise above their duplicity and build a community grounded in trust and sincerity.

The power of the mind is a force that knows no bounds. Within each of us lies the potential to achieve greatness, to conquer challenges, and to surpass our limitations. It is the mind that shapes our reality, that drives us forward in the face of adversity, and that ignites the flame of ambition within our hearts. Every accomplishment, every breakthrough, begins as a mere thought in the mind. It is through the power of belief, determination, and unwavering focus that these thoughts are transformed into reality. So I urge you, to harness the power of your mind. Cultivate a mindset of positivity, resilience, and unwavering determination. Believe in your abilities, visualize your success, and take bold action towards your goals.

In a world enamored with appearance and quick fixes, the concept of lying vanities serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of seeking what is truly valuable. One of the most pervasive lying vanities in modern society is materialism. The constant bombardment of advertisements and social media influencers glorifying a life of luxury creates an illusion that happiness is directly tied to possessions. While there is no denying that financial stability can alleviate certain stresses, the relentless pursuit of more—more money, more gadgets, more status symbols—often leads to a hollow existence. Recognizing the deceptive nature of materialism, social status, and pleasure helps redirect efforts toward enduring and fulfilling pursuits, enriching our lives and fostering a meaningful, compassionate world.

So, when faced with difficulties, dig deep into your inner reserves of strength, tap into your determination, and face each obstacle with unwavering resolve.

Remember that the truth will eventually prevail, and your response to adversity will speak volumes about your character. Stay focused on your goals, maintain your dignity, and rise above the false accusations with grace and determination.

By nurturing a mindset of resilience and self-discipline, you can overcome unwholesome thoughts and cultivate inner peace, clarity, and fulfillment.

## Welcome to August ❤️

Declare these words on the 1st day of the 8th month of the year!~14515

I have the codes for supernatural victory. Supernatural victory over all enemies and contrary circumstances. I have overcome the world. I have overcome all contrary situations.

Angels are at work even now. I live in financial abundance now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ! Amen.



## August The Month Of Dominion!!!~14588





## AUGUST GLOBAL COMMUNION SERVICE~14592

6th, August 2023.

Romans 5:17
In a broader teaching of this subject, I've explained that when God says this, thatbthey shall reign BY Jesus Christ, it means "Through". Thats different from when He is in this world during the millenial reign, we will reign WITH him. 
There is a great difference. 
This verse is talking about reigning by him or through him; using his name 
In other words, Reigning in his place.

2 Corinthians 2:14
Notice 
- He ALWAYS causes us to triumph. Not sometimes. He makes it happen. He propels us to triumph. He orchastrates us to triumph ALWAYS!!!

-He makes the aroma of his presence known through us everywhere. 
How can a verse like this go unnoticed?

Psalm 110:1-2
David was talking about Jesus.
How that the Lord would be seated at the right hand of God...and He is there today. 
While he is seated in Heaven, God said to him "rule in the midst of your enemies". 
His enemiws are not in Heaven
He rules in the midst of his enemies through his church.
"Out of Zion"

These scriptures, in no way, suggest that the christians have some sort of beggarly life or subjected to ridicule. 
No! We are honored in Christ Jesus.
The church of these last days must xome to the understanding of our place..of our rights...of the authority given to us in christ Jesus. 

The message of the month is something you carry along with you. You keep living that life. Make is special to you tou. Internalize it. Live it and grow in it. You'll be amazed what will become of you. How things fall into place. They have to! 
Remember he says "all things work together for good to them that love God..."
You have no reason to worry irrespective of circumstances. 
You just keep saying "it is turning out for my good".
There couldn't be any other result 
It's impossible for you to be disadvantaged.
The more powerful your enemies are, it is an indication of your growth and of what God is doing in your life. 
So never be scared about anything.
Its just a sign.
You are so powerful thay it takes all those forces to come against you 
So, you rejoice and say "Wow! God is blessing me so much".

Never be moved when you face troubles, trials, challenges. 
It just means God is blessing you so much the devil has taken notice of it.

This month is the month of DOMINION.

You have to exercise dominion.

Three important things in the exercise of dominion

Through prayer: James 5:16-17 KJV, AMPC. The fervent prayer of a righteous man is effective. 
Romans 5:17, he gave you the gift of righteousness. In the mind of God, you are as righteous as Jesus is righteous. 
Elijah prayed ernestly. It is heartfelt, Continued, persistent. 
He prayed that way because of the sins of the nation. He prayed for a change. He wanted the rain to cease to get the people's attention
He got their attention.
He went after the prophets of Baal. 
He prayed again and the heavens gave rain
He is teaching about being fervent in prayer and expectations.

In dominion, you can make remarkable change through prayer. 
The heaven gave rain after Elijah prayed. Heaven responded and fhe earth brought forth her fruit.
Is there anything you want a change in this month? No matter what you are going through or confronted with, understand that you can pray and effect the change. 
God gave us Elijah's prayer as an 
Example.

Secondly, faith proclamations 
Your faith must be connected to God's word. It is different from positive thinking or positive talking. Some people make positive declarations that are not connected to Gods word. That's just being positive in the flesh...it works sometimes, but when push comes to shove, when it really matters, it fails. Its unable to resist the forces of the spiritual when demons get involved in it. There is no promise to it. Otherwise, the natural man would have been completely successful in all things.
For us, we talk according to what he says.

👇👇👇

I hail from God and I’ve overcome the devil and the cohorts of darkness. I am born of the Word of God; therefore, I’m impregnable to everything that hurts or binds because the Greater One dwells in me! Glory to God. 

Dear Heavenly Father, I am grateful that You made me a peculiar treasure unto You, and called me to a life of glory, excellence, and dominion. 

Thank You for setting me on the path of life: the path of righteousness and glory, in Christ Jesus! 

I walk in divine wisdom, today and always. Thank You for giving me Your Word to live by. 

I affirm the Lordship, majesty, honour, and glory of Christ over everything that concerns me: my health, academics, family, finances, and ministry.

Therefore, I experience continuous victories, absolute peace, joy, prosperity, and divine health. 

I am born of the Spirit, and I am fully yielded to His leading, guidance and control; His truth and wisdom are the forces of my life, propelling me from glory to glory as I walk in the paths prearranged for me by God.

I am fulfilling His perfect will and living out my destiny in Him. God's inherent ability is in me to prosper in all that I do. 

As the seed of Abraham, everything that is connected to me is blessed—my finances, business, job, family, etc. I walk in the consciousness that I am blessed to be a blessing.

My words are spirit, and life, infused with power and divine energy to prevail over circumstances. 

The words of Christ dwell in me richly, in all wisdom, and my words are filled with inspiration, healing, comfort, hope, love, and power, in Jesus' Name. Amen.

I affirm that my entire being is completely yielded to be taught, inspired, and strengthened under the ministry of the Word. 

My heart is flooded with wisdom and spiritual understanding, not just to know, but also to walk in God’s perfect will.

I’ve been equipped me with all things that pertain to life and goodness and I am filled with the fullness of God. 

My spirit, soul, and body are in sync with God’s perfect will for me. I do not struggle or respond in fear because God had not given unto me the spirit of fear.

I have in me the spirit of love, power, and of a sound mind. My mind is sound, and I am excellent in all things! 

Even now, my spiritual antenna is raised and I am receiving the right signals. Hallelujah! 

Nothing is missing or lacking in my life! I am a custodian of divine verities; down in my DNA is the ability to be a blessing to my world.

I am grace personified; there’s no man or institution with the capacity to disfavor me in life. Before I ever show up, favour speaks loud for me. Hallelujah! 

I am not ordinary; God had handpicked and package me with all it takes to be a source of blessing to my world. 

I am exceptional; in all that I do, I am noted for excellence. Today I go out with joy and I am led forth peace. Glory to God. Hallelujah!

## COURAGE OF CONVICTION

PASTOR BIODUN LAWAL~15050

Joshua 1:8
This is the only place in KJV Bible where SUCCESS is used. This is because he wants us to associate SUCCESS with the Word of God.

God told Joshua to be courageous... 3 times.
He told Moses to encourage Joshua... 3 times.

COURAGE is a product of conviction and commitment.

PURPOSE defines your every move.

TIMING must be tied to your giving, the time is now.

REJECT DISTRACTIONS. Don't be moved by natural, physical things.

INSPIRATION comes to others because of your giving/faith.

PAY THE PRICE. Any great thing calls for a price. Be ready for it 

BE A CHAMPION. God wants us to be champions, break records, set new records.

## Global Rhapathon Sunday Service~15106

Rev Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DSc DD

It's been a beautiful week. 
We've been on since Wednesday night and it's just been amazing. 
Wonderful exhortations, testimonies, time of fellowship with Gods word and beautiful times of prayer and praise.
And all these have a lot to do with the conditioning and development of our spirits. 
There are things that the human spirit requires for real spiritual growth and development.
For most of the world, their life is based on what they were taught in school, and of course, newspapers.
But you can't live that way. 

(October,Friday 27th to Sunday 29th, we will have the HLSLHS.)

Everytime you want a better result than previously, you review what you prepared before and improve on it. 
The future belongs to those who prepare for it. If you let it just come, it will come with all the 'weeds' (unwanted events).

Jesus said "Ask and it shall be given to you...."
Don't let things just happen.
The forces of nature will not work in your interest without control.
That's why when God created everything, he brought Man as the last and He told man to "Subdue the earth" . Control it. Because it won't just do things nicely for you. 
You have your own world.
How things run the way it affects you... in the midst of all that, you can prosper. 

Remember the prophetic word given to the Messiah "Sit at my right hand. Rule in the midst of thine enemies" .
Jesus said he send us out as sheep in the midst of wolves but " I am with you always".
It is not a promise. 
He is with you till the end of the age. 
There is no day that you wake up and think "where are you Lord?"
He is there all the time. 

This is a very special time in the kingdom/calendar of God. I hope you realize it? 
In the spirit, there's so much that's happening. The angels are doing a lot of work in the realm of the spirit. They have their work cut out for them; we have ours cut out for us.

The messiah was told after his resurrection where he is seated by the right of God, He was told by the Father "Rule in the midst of your enemies" .. How will he do that?
Through us!

(Remember that little guy during the French Revolution who was given to a witch who was to teach him how to curse before they killed him so that his mind would be polluted. He responded that he couldn't say those things because he was born to be King. He was already taught. He knew what kings were supposed to say)

You were born to rule!
The earth was willed to Abraham and his seed. If you belong to Christ, you are Abraham's seed and an heir according to the promise. 
(Imagine if you've been ruling all these years)

 There are several accounts of those who were raised from the dead just from the use of ROR. 
If Rhapsody can be used in performing these things, what do you think is God's plan?
If the Shadow of Peter could get the sick healed.... what do you think of Peter himself? Where was the power coming from? It was coming Peter him.
The power of Rhapsody is not the paper. 
It is the spirit of the word that's inside. That's what makes it different. 

A second thing that's very important is called mandate.
Remember John the Baptist was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb. 
Jesus was also filled with the holy ghost but not from his mother's womb.
John's mother was filled the Holy ghost when she was pregnant with John. 
The Holy ghost entered into you and filled all of your body. If a woman was pregnant when she got filled with the holy ghost, the baby would be filled with the holy ghost. 

Most Christian women were never taught that their children are filled with the holy ghost right from the womb. Knowledge is important. 

Mary didn't receive the holy ghost when she was pregnant with Jesus. But when Jesus was baptized by John, the holy spirit came upon him and he was filled with the holy ghost.

I refuse to succumb to sickness, disease, and the darkness in the world because God has made me superior to all these. The Lord keeps me in perfect peace because my mind is focused on the Word. Daily, God’s Word produces in me what it talks about.



## FAITH’S PROCLAMATIONS OF HEALING AND HEALTH~15475

In the Name of Jesus, divine health is mine. I've got Zoë – the divine life – in every cell of my blood. Therefore, I do not get sick. Sickness is not a part of my nature. I am what God says I am, I have what God says I have, and I can do what God says I can do.

The Word of God is working in me; it is producing what it talks about in my body. That Same Spirit that raised up Christ from the dead gives life to my mortal body.

I know who I am! I am not the sick trying to get healed. No! I am the healed living in divine health. No sickness can successfully fasten itself to my body.

## DECEMBER 2023 GLOBAL COMMUNION SERVICE~16001

December is the month of Thanksgiving and it is important for us to recognize what God wants us to do. Did you know that He actually wants us to live a life of thanksgiving? 
It's one of the ways to be in perfect health, absolute health. Don't let anyone deceive you that nobody can be perfectly healthy

Colossians 1:10-12
Being fruitful in every good work is an excellent life. A true Christian life is worthy of the Lord, pleasing to the Lord, fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. 
No matter what you are going through, you can be patient with endurance and at the same time with joyfulness. 
He doesn't want you going through some kind of situation without joy. 

He wants your life to be a life of thanksgiving. I am a partaker of the inheritance of the saint in light and part of that inheritance is the divine life which comes with divine health. 

So begin this month to live a life of thanksgiving, so when you get into January it's still thanksgiving. 
I am living a life of thanksgiving, I am giving thanks to God always for all things. 

Colossians 1:13-14
I live in God's kingdom now, that's my life; it's got to be your consciousness. 
It's God's will for you to be in health. 3John 1:2
Your soul is prospering through the Word of God and the Spirit of God. 
God wants us to be in health, so it's not true like some people say that God use sickness to tempt us or test us, He doesn't use Satan's tools to test us. 

James 1:13
Sickness doesn't come from God in any form
Acts 10:38, Acts 3:15, 
Matthew 10:8
When you heal the sick you're giving them healing, when you cleanse the lepers you're bringing them freedom from leprosy. 

James 1:4, Romans 8:2, 10-11, 
Hebrews 13:15 AMPC

How do you pray, what words do you say to Him? That's why we study the scripture, we look at what the prophets say, what did Jesus say, what did the Apostles say, what's written for us in the New Testament, how are we to express ourselves to God, what do we say when we talk to Him? 


Prayers

2 Samuel 11:1- KJV, DOUAY

"At the return of the year": The ending part of the year/beginning of another. 
There was a period of the year that these Kings planned for war. 
When you think of the fact that a lot of those wars were Satan Inspired...(Because God is a God of Peace). Sometimes, when you are at Peace, the Enemy can lay eyes against you.

In our world today, there are those who have an agenda. Their plan is to run this world on their terms but that wouldn't have been a problem except that they have a sinister agenda, and this is why we cannot agree to let them do as they choose. Their plan includes extermination of so many and decimation of whole nations. 
We can't let that happen. 
They want to reduce the population of the world by force and they complain that there's not enough resources as though the world is asking them for help.
This world is bigger than their minds can conceive. We cannot let them just do what they choose. Like the wickedness of the vaccines. Now millions of people around the world have died through vaccine injuries but no one cares. They are quiet. Fact is, not enough people died as compared to their plans. Their plans were for billions to be exterminated. 

At times like these, Satan and the cohorts of hell have their plans. They have things they want to do in January or the first quarter of the year. That's why it's important for us as God's children to pray. In prayer, we are able to change things in the realm of the spirit. 

In studying the scriptures you discover, you can't just sit down and say what will be will be. Only bad things happen in such situations.
There is a times Kings go forth to war.
There are regulations some are planning to spring on their people. These regulations at times only bring more pain. The people are less free. It's like a chokehold on their own people.
We can't just sit by.
A lot of these evil things don't have political solutions. They require spiritual solutions. Because these regulations are inspired by spirit beings, that's why the ideas being further poverty and pain.

Psalm 2:1-9, 1 John 5:4 KJV, AMPC
We are born of God. We are victorious over the world. 
The church is born of God. The scriptures are born of God. 
Our Faith Conquers the world. 
Why? 
We are not trying to use our Faith to conquer the world or to conquer the world. 

How does our Faith conquer the world?
John 16:33
He said Be of good cheer because he overcame the world for us. If he did so, we don't have to overcome the world.
It's our Faith in his work of Victory; his finished work!
We don't have to try to "re-conquer". 
He says "Cheer up. I have overcome the world for you". 
We have overcome the world in Christ Jesus. 
We are victorious over the world. 

1 John 4:4-6
You can never forget this! 
All of those wicked spirits of evil that mastermind the evil things in the world...all the plans they have planned for 2024, WE HAVE CONQUERED THEM!
The greater one lives in us!!!!!
We are saying this so he will hear us and hear us good.
WE ARE OF GOD! THEY ARE OF THE WORLD!

When it says "You are of God", it doesn't mean you are on God's side. It means you hail from God. Your origin is of God. 
It's those that are born again that the scripture is referring to. It is those who have received Him into their hearts. 

Those guys can only speak from the world's point of view. That's all they know. And the world listens to them. That's why many of them were misled into taking the vaccines. 
Now the Doctors are telling us that the structure of the blood of those who took the vaccines are different. 
What might this mean in the next few years?


At this point, we are going to pray with your eyes on 2024. 
Remember the words of Jesus.



## GLOBAL PRAYER & FASTING SERVICE~16309

30TH DECEMBER 2023

REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DSC DD

This is our second day of the fasting and prayer program that we have, just leading up to the coming year.
Tomorrow will be 31st of December. 

Ephesians 6:10-12
The word translated "wrestle" in verse 12 is very informative. It's the only place the word is used in the New Testament. 
Meaning to Vibrate, to throw... 
In some translations, the word "struggle" is used. 
This is connected to what he began to tell you in verse 10. 

Since yesterday and some other previous occasions you would have heard us say "Pray against the influence of Satan on the leaders of nations". Someone once thought "Is the Devil that powerful that we have to pray against him all the time?" 
I want to explain to you why you do this.

Luke 11:14
A dumb spirit makes his host dumb.
V15-16: They were saying that Jesus had a devil 
V17- "a house divided against a house falleth"
That means that the division is within the house. 
(When He talked about the signs of the end, he said there would be rumors of war, and "nation against nation". It means fightings within the nation. Like a house divided against itself. He isn't referring to multiple nations fighting).

V18-20. What a sign! Casting out of devils is a very important sign of the Kingdom of God. 
None of the prophets before Jesus cast out devils until Jesus came. 

V21-23. He is so far dealing with casting out demons. 
V24- 
Take these things I tell you seriously. They are not things you find easily. They are rare to come by in books. Many don't even know what Unclean spirits are. They are not defined in any book. 
An unclean spirit is a spirit that came from the relations between fallen angels and human beings. 
In Genesis from Chapter 6, it informs you that the offsprings became Giants, the nephilims. 
The spirits that were reproduced (remember human beings are not mere animals. They have a spirit. A child has a human spirit that occupies a human body)... They produced Children who had these unclean spirits. They were not pure human spirits. 
When that person dies, they would need a body to possess. Normal human spirits would either go to Heaven or hell. But these impure spirits could not go to Heaven and could not be taken to hell because they are not yet Judged. 
They are impure and they do Evil things because of the satanic nature of these fallen angels. These fallen angels themselves are being reserved for Judgement, but these unclean spirits cannot function without a body.... That's what Jesus was referring to.

V24-28
When you cast an unclean spirit out of a man, that spirit looks for where to go and when he doesn't find, his first option to return to the place from where you cast it out. He comes back to more spirits that are more wicked than him to possess that man. 

When we rebuke evil spirits and cast them out, the people that we are praying for don't necessarily become Christians just because we cast the devil out. The fellow has a right to invite the demons back because he isn't under your authority. 
So it's a struggle. We cast them out and then He brings them back, Until we exercise authority over that place and seize the grounds. We really have to take over. 
This struggle continues until we successfully bring the word into that place and have dominion. 
It's just like healing the sick. We can heal you but we can't keep you healed. You have to keep the word in you. 
We can lead you to salvation but we can't keep you saved. It's up to you to live the life that Christ got for you. 

So it's a struggle until we win. 
How does Christ comes into your heart? How do you receive the holy spirit? THROUGH WORDS .
How do demons enter into people? THROUGH WORDS.

We are going to pray and as we do, we will use God's word. 
Let the nations look beautiful to you. 
Satan wants to have dominion over these nations but NOT YET. Not while we are here. We have the dominion.

Prayers for the nations

## NEW YEAR EVE'S SERVICE~16320

REV. CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DSC DD


Redemption: Dictionary Definitions...
Make amends for, obtain the release of something from captivity by paying the ransom..etc
To turn in vouchers/coupons for actual value
To release from blame or debt.

The four most important ones that are relevant our discussion for this year. They are very simple

1. To deliver from sin and it's consequences by sacrifice: Jesus paid the redeeming sacrifice for everyone and that's what the gospel of Jesus Christ is about. Salvation for man's soul/spirit. In this salvation, he gives us something. A lot of times, we talk of what he took away (my sin, my condemnation). Most people don't mention what he gave. 
The death of Jesus was only a means to an end. The death of Jesus was not the ultimate. It wasn't God's ultimate plan.
His death paid. Satisfying the claims of Justice for all men. His death settled the debt. But there was much more...
Christianity does not begin with the death of Jesus. It begins with the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Until a man believes in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, he cannot be saved. (Of course the lesser is Included in the greater). Through his death, he brought us Justification. This means to be acquitted or declared NOT GUILTY.
When Jesus died, he died in our place. He was crucified in the place of sinners. He paid the penalty for Sin. Because He paid, you don't have to pay again. There is no such thing as Penance. No man could ever pay for his sin. 

Justified doesn't suggest that He paid for you. 
Imagine that you were owing a debt and they are trying to pay the debt but you couldn't pay. A man comes to pay your debt for you... You paid, even though you didn't pay by yourself! 
Think about it...you actually paid for your sins in Jesus Christ.
But Justification means to be declared Not guilty. It's something completely different from what Jesus did. The payment does not make you Justified. 

In Justification you are said to be without guilt. You are discharged and acquitted. Why? Because the resurrection gave you a new life. It made you a new creature. One that never existed before. That's why you are Justified. You are Not the same man who committed the sin that was remitted. His resurrection gave you a new nature. 
That's what it means to be born again.
Romans 5- Read the whole chapter


2. The second one is to turn in vouchers or coupons for actual value. Did you know the scriptures that talk of Jesus vicarious death and resurrection are vouchers for redemption? Did you know that those verse are vouchers/coupons?
You can take those coupons and present them for actual value. 

3. To release from Debt or Bondage: This I find to be very interesting. Today's few masters must release their serf's. There are nations and organizations that are holding others in bondage today and holding them with debts that are unjustified. They must let them go. If they don't let them go in 2024, it will turn to an unrest; those who have found themselves in these illegitimate debts and bondage must extricate themselves from these detrimental associations and treaties.(i am speaking to individuals and to nations... Because this year is the year of Redemption).
You must extricate yourselves. You must become Bold. 
I speak to African and Asian nations. You must now Extricate yourselves and come out of this Bondage. It takes boldness, leadership and decisiveness. 
There are many of you at various levels. Don't wait for government.because sometimes, the government may not speak for you.
An idea: Sue the Government for making those payments. And sue with proof that the debts are illegal. You will win for country, your organization and for yourself and your future. 
Wake up! There are answers. 
A group of you can sue that government. You can make them stop making the payments.

## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16396

~ January 6th
 
I’m marked for success and victory; I produce excellent results. I’m chosen for a life of fruitfulness and ever-increasing productivity, bringing honour to Christ, through my labour of love and fruits of righteousness. I’m born again; I’m not of this world. I’m a citizen of Heaven, seated with Christ in the place of authority, over and above every earthly power and demonic influence. I’m functioning above all circumstances. Christ in me makes me a victor for life. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16411

- January 7th

I’m the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus, His workmanship, created to produce fruits of righteousness. I’ve crucified the flesh with its passions and desires; Satan has nothing in me! I live and function above and beyond the systems of this world; I’m independent of the hardships, corruption, evil and deceit in the world because I live in Christ, in His Word, and in the dominion of the Spirit, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16440

- January 8th

My life is a message; a message of the divine life, of God’s love, goodness, righteousness and true holiness; these are expressed unreservedly to my world. I’m fully yielded to the Word to culture my life and character, giving me the right mindset. I am in Christ, I can never be disadvantaged because the Father has given me all things that pertain to life and godliness. I’m walking in glory and excellence, manifesting the graces of God to my world, in victory, success and advancement, in Jesus Name. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16469

~ January 11th

Great ideas, pictures of success, possibilities and victories continuously brew in my mind. I take charge of my thoughts and refuse negative thinking, for the Holy Spirit causes me to have wholesome thoughts, say the right words and act the right way. My sufficiency is of God, who has lavishly endowed me with tremendous abilities and uncanny skills to make me fit for any task. He’s the One at work in me both to will and to do of His good pleasure. Therefore, I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me, in Jesus's Name. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16477

~ January 12th

I’m the manifestation, the out-shining of the glory of God. His splendour, excellence and perfection are expressed through me. And despite the darkness and hardship in today’s world, I’m more than a conqueror, for Christ in me is the hope of glory. With boldness and an undeniable faith, I reign in this life. It makes no difference what I face, I refuse to be anxious or afraid. I declare peace and calmness over  circumstances; I’m bold and confident to face life and win, because greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world. Hallelujah!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16535

~ January 13th

My prosperity is unlimited, for I was born with wealth untold. I lay up gold as dust, and the riches of the nations gravitate to me. The Word of God inspires faith in my spirit. With my faith-filled confessions, I have taken hold of eternal life and the blessings that my salvation in Christ has consummated for me. Nothing can cheat me of these blessings because I have possessed them with my spirit. In the Name of our Lord Jesus. Amen!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16554

~ January 14th

I’m full of God; His glory is in me and expressed through me. I’m the reflection of the grace, wisdom, and righteousness of God. I’ve received of His fullness; therefore, my life is a continuous manifestation of Christ and the supernatural! I’m an associate of the God-kind, and I’ve got the indestructible life of God in me. I was born with the resurrection life that’s beyond sickness and disease. Therefore, I walk in divine health every day! Hallelujah!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16568

~ January 15th

I am a king and I consistently declare who I am in Christ Jesus. I was born for the glory of God, and my life continually is glorified by His Word. I’m a child of God, with the nature of God in my spirit. I’m justified before God, without guilt, fear, inferiority or condemnation. Sin has no power over me and I can’t be entangled by any yoke of bondage. I’m conscious of my nature of righteousness and walk accordingly, in Jesus Name. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16573

~ January 16th

I’ve been transferred from the domain of darkness to the Kingdom of God’s Love-son. Though I’m in the world, I’m conscious of the heavenly Kingdom. I function from the realm of the spirit, and nothing in this physical world matters to me. God has glorified Himself in me; now, I carry that glory everywhere. There’s no shame in my life; I walk in glory, and my life is full of honour, splendour, greatness, beauty, favour! I walk consistently in divine health, prosperity, and impact my world with His glory. Praise God!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16593

~ January 18th

My life is for the glory of God. I’ve been divinely commissioned to display the virtues and perfections of divinity. I manifest the power and excellence of Christ to everyone in my world. Thank you blessed Lord, for bringing me out of darkness into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, where I reign and rule in life, in the Name of our Lord Jesus’. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16612

~ January 19th

I affirm that I am making progress and moving to the next and higher level of success. The Spirit of God is guiding me to make the right and necessary changes required for my next level of success and promotion in life. Through the Word, wisdom is granted me to function excellently, and I live a fruitful and effective life in righteousness. I’m full of joy, peace, love, kindness, and continually filled with the Spirit, as I walk in the light of Christ, in the Name Of the Lord Jesus’. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16633

~ January 20th

My gaze is fixed on the Lord and His eternal Word. I refuse to be moved, deterred, distracted or influenced by situations or circumstances that are contrary to the provisions of God’s Word. I soar above circumstances, and walk in perpetual victory, because I live by the Word. Blessed be God!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16644

~ January 21st

I walk in prosperity, for I’m the seed of Abraham. I have access to wealth untold, and I’m supply conscious! The love of God floods my heart through the Holy Spirit; His love controls and conditions my heart and mind, causing me to see others as God sees them. There’s no one, and there’s no wrong I can’t forgive. I have the capacity to absolve others of their faults, and demonstrate the God-nature in me; the nature of love, through my words and actions, in the name of our Lord Jesus’. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16652

~ January 22nd

Christ has been made unto me wisdom; therefore, I’m wise, and I make Word-based choices. I’m precise and accurate in all that I do, walking in God’s perfect will and purpose for my life. I’m born of God; therefore, I’m a living epistle, a letter from Christ, known and read by all. I live the life of the Word, full of glory, virtue and honour. I express the divine nature, living the Kingdom life of victory, prosperity, peace and joy now and always in Jesus' name. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16672

~ January 23rd

The Lord is the strength of my life, and I fear nothing and no one. In Him I triumph gloriously always and in every situation, reigning in righteousness, and growing in grace, wisdom and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. The glory of God is seen and manifested through me to my world. My life is a continuous manifestation of Christ and the supernatural. Glory to God!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16680

~ January 24th

I am strengthened in my spirit and positioned for the life of excellence. I am working in God's timing for my life; thus, none of my steps shall slide. My going out and coming in is preserved by the Lord. I move in the Spirit, and of my increase, progress, and prosperity, there shall be no end, I live the transcendent life of endless possibilities and victories unlimited! Hallelujah!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16702

~ January 26th

I affirm that the Spirit of God is mingled with my spirit in inseparable oneness, making me a champion at everything I do. I win always, because the greater One lives in me. I am full of power, by the Holy Ghost in me. I am indomitable, indestructible and invincible-unconquerable, and unlimited by circumstances. I do not have a spirit of fear, but of love, power, a calm and well-balance mind, discipline and self-control. I am up to any task and equal to any demand on my capabilities in Jesus Name. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16748

~ January 29th

Blessed Father, you’ve blessed me with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ; I’m conscious of this truth and the authority I have over all principality, power, and the rulers of the darkness of this world! I walk in blessings only; I’m secure in Christ, fortified against all machinations and stratagems of the adversary, in the Name of our Lord Jesus’. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16773

~ January 31st

I have a joint-sitting with Christ in the  place of glory and power. As long as I’m in the world, I’m the light of the world! I exercise dominion over circumstances and the spirits of darkness, and I bring them under subjection to the Name of Jesus. There’re no uncertainties and confusion in my path, because Christ is my light, my wisdom, and my strength. I’m walking in, and fulfiling God’s perfect will for my life, established in the path of greatness and excellence forever, in the name of the Lord Jesus’. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16797

~ February 1st

I’m an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ; all things are mine. I’m in my place of divine inheritance in Christ, and it’s a large place a place of wealth where I lack nothing. I flourish like the palm tree; I’m fruitful and productive. I grow like a cedar in Lebanon; majestic, stable, durable and incorruptible. I’m bearing fruits unto righteousness, established on the path of success and glory forevermore, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16814

~ February 2nd

I affirm that I’ve been called to a life of triumph, favor, and victory in Christ Jesus. It doesn’t matter where or the situation I find myself; I win always! I record great and notable achievements, enjoying my days in success, progress, peace, joy, and unending prosperity. The glory of the Word is revealed and made manifest in my life, as it transforms me, causing God’s grace and peace to be multiplied in my life, bringing me favors and blessings. Hallelujah!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16840

~ February 4th

The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from death, and the law of sin; I live and walk by the law of life, because I dwell in the realm of life. There’s no darkness or death in my path. Life is at work in every fibre of my being. I was recreated in righteousness and true holiness, to express the will and nature of the Father. In every matter, in every place, at every opportunity, I give expression to the righteousness of God. Hallelujah!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16876

~ February 5th

Dear heavenly Father, I thank you because your Word has given me understanding and knowledge of my victory in Jesus Christ over Satan and the powers of darkness. I am so happy that I can live to serve you without being afraid of the devil and the wickedness of this world!  I go out today knowing that no evil will come upon me, and that I am delivered from wicked and unreasonable men, in the name of our Lord Jesus. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16889

~ February 6th

I have the capacity for excellent and creative ideas to change my state and estate. My success, prosperity and greatness are not determined by the geographical location or by the economy of the nation where I function. The plans I carry are of God and, are thus characterized by fruitfulness and productivity beyond human comprehension. I attract wealth untold. I’m walking in glory and excellence, manifesting the graces of God to my world, in victory, success and advancement in the name of our Lord Jesus. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16933

~ February 8th

Irrespective of the tribulation, distress, persecution or peril in this world, I’m more than a conqueror through Him that loved me—Christ Jesus, my Lord! I’m persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor anything, shall separate me from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus. I remain steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of spreading the Gospel to the ends of the earth. Hallelujah!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16948

~ February 9th

I’m what God says I am! I’m like a tree planted by the riverside, bringing forth fruits in and out of season! I’m more than a conqueror, because the greater One lives in me. Christ is my life, and His glory is revealed in, and through me. My life is for the glory of God; I’m called to show forth His praise and express His righteousness on earth. I’m a light in a dark world, living out the divine life that I have in Christ, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16957

~ February 10th

Christ has been made unto me wisdom; therefore, I’m wise, and I make Word-based choices. I’m precise and accurate in all that I do, walking in God’s perfect will and purpose for my life. My sufficiency is of God, who has lavishly endowed me with tremendous abilities and uncanny skills to make me fit for any task. He’s the One at work in me both to will and to do of His good pleasure. Therefore, I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16967

~ February 11th
 
I’m an ambassador, a conscious representative of Jesus Christ, living in His Name! My communication and actions aptly depict my union and oneness with the Lord. And as God’s Word gets into my spirit, I’m transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit lives in me today in His fullness! He’s working in me mightily, helping me become the best, and produce excellence only, and always. There’s no limit to my abilities and potentials, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~16993

~ February 13th

I am like a tree planted by the rivers of water and I bring forth fruit always. I do not know when the heat comes because the Lord is my shepherd. The grace of God is superabundance in my life; therefore, when men experience a casting down, I am continuously lifted up. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yes, I have a goodly heritage. Goodness and mercy are my constant companions. Glory to God!



## #MYDAILYPROCLAMATION~17007

~ February 14th

I’m not ordinary, for the Greater One lives in my spirit, soul and body! I’m full of God! I’m strong, sound, full of His love, wisdom and divine essence. My life is full of grace. I’m a member of the glorious and triumphant body of Christ, therefore, I’m indestructible; no matter what happens, I win, because the Word puts me over and guarantees my victory. Greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world. I reign and rule with Christ, now and always, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

I thank you gracious heavenly Father for the excellent life that I have in Christ! I’m planted on the rock that’s higher than I am, Christ Jesus! Therefore, I’m not moved by circumstances. I’m a victor forever, because Christ is my riddance. He rids me of any trouble and leads me triumphantly from glory to glory.

Say in the name of the Lord Jesus, I'm done with this cult and our of this agreement because it's devilish. You will be out! And nothing will happen to you. The name of Jesus Christ is greater than all names. When you proclaim the name of Jesus, the demons responsible for that Covenant will all bow. 


Pst. Deola Philips 
This year you will find yourself being moved by the spirit of God. 
For example, David was moved to get to the camp just in time to hear Goliath's boasting. Then it dawned on him that he was the redeemer. This year we will come to problems as the solution. We must speak and declare. Satan has no power over me. Jesus Christ is Lord over my life. We must be bold to declare who we are like Jesus did. Circumstances, situations, policies have no power over you. 
David declared that he would defeat Goliath even though he had no weapons, and he did. 
In one moment, the destiny, state and estate of Israel was changed. 
We must locate ourselves. 
We have a message for the world. We are ministers of reconciliation declaring to the world that God is not counting their sins against them.
We must preach the gospel to the world that Jesus paid for all their sins. 
Today, being communion service day, we are showing forth the death of Jesus. Righteousness, eternal life, wealth is ours. 
Every promise is fulfilled.

It plays very clearly into what I was talking about on the 31st.
The African countries borrow money that they don't need. They sign agreements to not grow their own seed. Why are you importing chicken, rice when you don't need to. They are different ways of destroying what you do. They sponsor terrorism to get the farmers away from the farms. So you are dependent on your creditors in their currency. They are growing their country at the expense of their country. 
Our leaders know this. But the fear of the CIA killing them stops them from changing anything. It's a shame. 
BUT, this year, we will pray, speak God's word and Use the word. 

On that Occasion when David was going to see his brothers , he was sent by his Father. He didn't know what was going on and he wasn't old enough to go to war. While he was there, he heard Goliath threatening the army of Israel (like those afraid of the CIA). Even king Saul was afraid. 

The Philistines had a relationship with Israel (just like the world bank and the IMF). They made sure that Israel had no weapons. Only King Saul and His son, Jonathan, had swords. So they were allowed to have that as long as they were subservient to the Philistines. 

You have to prepare for the unimaginable..beyond expected...the impossible...the only way to prepare for this is filling your life and heart with the word of God. Only with your heart full of the word will you know what to do When you arrive at the place of the unexpected, the unimaginable and the impossible. 

One of the benefits of David defeating Goliath was having his family free from taxes. Don't underestimate what God can do through you. He can use you at the place unexpected for victories unimaginable and for those things thought to be impossible. 
Think what God can do through you. He can give you wisdom and guidance. Bexome tough. God wants more Davids...Giant Killers. 
There were other Giants apart from Goliath Of Gath but they were all brought down by David's men
Be tough for God. God wants to use you.

## HEALTH TIPS~16785

7 WAYS TO BOOST YOUR IMMUNITY

The immune system comprises many organs and processes that act as the body’s natural defense against infectious organisms. A healthy immune system protects the body against infections and diseases. There are several ways to boost your body’s immune system, and extensive studies have shown that nutrition and other lifestyle choices influence the strength of one’s immunity. Here are some great ways to do that naturally.

1) WATCH YOUR DIET:
A low-fat, plant-based diet is great for boosting immunity. Incorporate large amounts of fruits and vegetables into your daily diet because they are rich in antioxidants and provide much-needed vitamins and minerals, which are essential to helping your body develop proper immune responses and eliminate free radicals in the body.

2) DRINK PLENTY OF WATER:
Water carries oxygen throughout your body to the cells, thus promoting proper body system functions. Also, water prevents build up of toxins by lushing them out of your system, so that they cannot harm the body. Drink plenty of water and, as much as possible, avoid cafeinated drinks, sugary beverages, and energy drinks; these leave you dehydrated and rob your body of minerals and vitamins needed to combat infections and diseases.

3) EXERCISE REGULARLY: 
Exercise regularly to help mobilize T-cells – a type of white blood cell that guards the body against infections. Exercise also improves blood circulation, meaning that these immune cells roam the body at a higher frequency and in higher numbers. Studies have shown that people who regularly engage in moderate exercises (such as brisk walking) generally have a more functional immune system than those who don’t.

4) SPEND TIME OUTDOORS:
Spend as much time outdoors as you can. Outdoor recreational activities alleviate stress and promote physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. Walking, running, cycling or playing basketball with friends and family is a great way to spend time outside the house. However, just sitting under the shade to relax outside will still do your body a whole lot of good.

5) SLEEP WELL & RELAX:
In a relaxed state, your muscles release tension, blood pressure lowers, and breathing and heart rate slow down. All these cause shifts in hormone levels that are very beneicial for your immunity. Adequate sleep is also vital to a healthy immune system. Production of cytokines – a substance secreted by immune cells to ight infections, inlammation and stress – occurs during sleep. The amount of sleep required by individuals vary based on age, activity levels and so on, but usually range from 5 to 10 hours every night.

6) LAUGH MORE:
There’s a popular saying that “laughter is the best medicine,” and the Bible conirms it in Proverbs 17:22, which says that a joyful heart is medicine. Laugh often to improve your resistance to infectious diseases. Hearty laughter boosts immunity by strengthening resilience, relaxing your muscles, diminishing pain and protecting the body against the damaging effects of stress.

7) CARE FOR YOURSELF:
Enjoy the things you do and do the things you enjoy,and spend time with your loved ones. These encourage the body’s secretion of health-boosting hormones, which in turn improve the immune system. An active lifestyle promotes physical health, and the happier you are, the healthier and stronger you will be. Staying healthy and immune depends on choices that become habits, which eventually become your lifestyle. Start making healthy choices today to improve health and wellbeing for you and your loved ones.

## WATER - A HEALTHY DRINK FOR ALL OCCASIONS~16834

Clean water is essential, as it is the basis of fluids in all living organisms, and is absolutely necessary to sustain life. When discussing vital factors that are key to achieving optimum health, consuming clean water should be at the top of the list.

Many common health problems can be avoided by simply drinking more water. Staying hydrated and drinking plenty of water helps to expel wastes from the body. Water is also a transport medium for the nutrients our bodies need. Body temperature is regulated by the amount of water in the body. Water also regulates the pH balance and supports a multitude of physiological processes.

Being well-hydrated elevates energy levels and can help alleviate headaches. Water helps the cells in your body to absorb nutrients. Other not-so-well-known advantages of drinking clean water regularly include:

1. Refreshing youthful looks: Drinking plenty of water will keep your skin moisturized and will also reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

2. Speedy and more effective weight loss: Drinking water also helps your body burn stored fat. If your daily water intake is not enough, your liver will be forced to help your kidneys detoxify your body, therefore reducing the rate of metabolism in your body. Water also suppresses your appetite, so that you eat less.

3. Muscle building: Another benefit of drinking water is that it makes your muscles stronger, because water carries oxygen to the cells of your body, including the muscles. Drinking plenty of water enables your muscles to work harder and longer before they feel tired, and this can help you build muscle.

4. Smarter cognition: Clean water in your system can increase cognitive functions. Your brain needs a lot of oxygen to function at optimum levels. Drinking plenty of water will ensure that your brain gets as much oxygen as it needs. Water also supports nerve function by ensuring that your nerves relay messages to and from the brain in the way they were meant to.

5. Flexible joints: One little-known benefit of drinking water is that it helps keep your joints strong, healthy, and lubricated. Your joints have to be moisturized to remain strong and flexible so that your movements are smooth and pain-free.

Severe dehydration causes many problems, not the least of which are fatigue, depression, diabetes, high blood pressure, weakness, and loss of energy. When you feel thirsty, it is infinitely healthier to drink water, rather than juice, carbonated drinks, or other beverages. Clean or safe water, simply put, is water that is all right for human consumption. This means the water is free of germs, is colorless and odorless. Simple techniques for water purification include chlorination, filters, and solar disinfection.
There's always plenty of clean water around, no matter the occasion, so take advantage of it; drink lots of water every day and stay healthy!

I am anointed to succeed; I don’t believe in failure and I can never fail. The Lord has given me grace for that which He’s called me to do. I recognize that grace, and function in it. Everywhere I go; the grace of God brings me favour, prosperity, health, and supernatural increase. Watch out world; It doesn’t matter how I start, I will end up as the best. Glory to God!”

## FEBRUARY 2024 GLOBAL COMMUNION SERVICE~16872

2 Timothy 2:4-5
Phillipians 1:27

It's the Month of Conglutination
It's like when broken bones come together, growing together, coalize together around a vision and move together.

It will bring forth a consolidation and when we mass up together our forces, nobody can beat us.
When we work together, there's no force in the world that can beat us, no power on earth can defeat us, it's impossible.
We will all the time, irrespective of the forces and adversaries, makes no difference who they're and what they got, it doesn't matter who they defeated before, when they come to us they fall.

They may have won all the time wherever they were but not with us, once they decide against us, that's their doom and fall.

Read our history, we have come a long way, we have only known one thing VICTORY. There were those who thought of annihilating the church, those who made the efforts, our Bible tells everything, this  book cannot lie, we Win only.

1 John 4:4
He told us to have no fear whatsoever.
Our Victory has been signed, sealed and delivered, the scripture cannot be broken.

This week we were going to be sharing quite a lot, we got much to do and we are fasting and praying.
You need to know God's plan, and what is happening around the world, and the direction of the Spirit and also how to take actions.

It is important for us to know what our role is and what His role is, He can be trusted to play His role but we must play our role.

Psalm 33:5



## Pray-A-Thon 2024 - Mon Feb 5~16878

Our February Global Communion Service was exceptional, and we've received marching orders for a glorious season of Conglutination, all through February and beyond. You can watch the full service again to relive the moments, via the ceflix app.

'In Christ Jesus, anyone who believes is brought into oneness with God, into a life that’s beyond the earthly plane, where you’re not limited by any factor or the elements of this world. You become a partaker of the divine nature, no longer subject to sin, sickness, disease and death, because you received the God-life.' Powerful words culled from this Monday's Rhapsody. Go all out in reaching many for the Lord today.

At times of prayer today, we'll pray fervidly in tongues of the Spirit for all 15min prayer sessions.

Remember we're fasting and praying today, as we begin Your Loveworld Specials Season 9 Phase 1, starting with prayers from 6pm GMT+1. God bless you.



## YOUR LOVE WORLD SPECIALS~16885

SEASON 9, PHASE 1,
DAY 1 5TH FEBRUARY 2024


REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DSC DD

I want to welcome you to this special season 9, phase 1, and this is Day 1 in 2024.
I thank God for he's guided us into this hour by the holy Ghost. 
There's a lot for us to know; a lot to learn.
So much is Happening in the world but a lot also in the spirit and we must be more attuned to what's happening in the spirit. 
While of course we watch what's happening in the earth, because we have divine responsibilities. 
There are many voices in the world.
It matters what voice you are listening to..because your life will go in the direction of the voice that you follow. 
Who are you listening to?
What voice are you listening to?

I want to show you a documentary as a reminder of the world in which we live, So you can make the right decisions in a moment like this. Not many know the world in which they live. They don't know the timing or the season. They are not aware that there is such a thing as the calendar God or that God has a timeline. No surprise because you don't find that in the academic institutions or all of the worlds press. It takes the spirit of God to know and yet it's all in the scriptures.

Where is the voice of truth? Jesus made a startling statement. He said "I am the way, the truth and life". Who could ever make this statement and be right? But Jesus declared himself to be the truth...with a definite article.

DOCUMENTARY: PAID TO LIE.

Let's not act like the rest of the world and be deceived. Remember the words of Jesus "You are not of the world....I have chosen you out of the world$.
We have to think differently. We have to use God's word to analyze what happens in our world. Turn the search light of God's word on the things we are told and don't allow others to gaslight us into the same conditions that they have put many into. 

E.g. the WHO has been raising so much dust about misinformation while they are coming up with a "Pandemic preparedness treaty". 
They know that people generally don't read. And after the world leaders deceive their aides who are lured into convincing their principals to listen to these powers from somewhere, they don't realize that those treaties are a subterfuge for global government. That's why praying, for us at this time, is so important.
The world hasn't really changed from the Colonizing mentality of yester years. They still have the same thinking. 
The imperialist thinking is still there. 
Don't for one moment assume that imperialism is gone. .they just laid aside the military campaigns and replaced them with kleptocracy with which they deceived the world. 
Many think they have a democracy but no, they just have kleptocratic technocrats sent on gaslighting missions to capture unsuspecting minds of African leaders. 

We have a taxonomical difference from the world. You are born again. You have the nature of God in you. You have the spirit of God. You come from another place. You belong in Christ Jesus so your thinking must therefore be different.
His word is the light in which you walk. 
Don't think like the world. Don't be ignorant like the world. 

"My people are destroyed for lack of (revelation) knowledge". He is talking about truth.

From tonight, I want to begin sharing some very important things with you.


In some countries, they have bills waiting to be passed while some have passed them already into law, to prosecute those that they judge to have not told the truth. 
They have arrogate to themselves the powers of the truth police. They are the ones deciding that if you say something that is not true on any public platform...some say, if you intended to (if it found in your device), you will be held liable. They have arrogated to themselves to decide what is truth, even though they are the perpetrators of falsehood. 
Those who belong to their establishment media, would not be prosecuted because they are said to not have intended to lie... because they are duly registered with the truth police.



## Pray-A-Thon 2024 - Wed Feb 7~16914

Did you know that the Name of Jesus is your ticket to every blessing? Learn more in this Wednesday's Rhapsody. 

Isaiah 45:8-9 says, 'Drop down, ye heavens, from above,
and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it'.

At our times of prayer today, we'll pray much in tongues of the Spirit as we continue to intercede for our nations and all people.

Your Loveworld Specials Season 9 Phase 1 continued for Day 3 at 6pm+1.

Remember to attend the Midweek Service today in Church onsite or online. God bless you.



## YOUR LOVE WORLD SPECIALS SEASON 9 PHASE 1 DAY 3~16922

(Documentary: The deceptive Tentacles of Climate Change).

REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DSC DD 

I want to welcome you to today's program. This is Day 3, season 9 and phase 1. The Lord is guiding our minds in the direction of his thinking. He is leading us. Guiding our spirits. 

What you just saw is part of Science for hire. Data manufacturer. Fake researches. We have fake scientists who are paid to manufactured data and make up resources that they never had; of course sent by technocrat psychopaths to pay them to do these things and device the unsuspecting and ignorant. 
They hate the fact that the world is seeing more and more successful people. 
They watch nations and you have to understand the reason for poverty. 
Not because your country is poor, but because there are those who are committed to promoting poverty. 
And of course speaking a clean language on poverty alleviation to give you the impression that they want to help you. 
For example, COVID vaccines. How much help did the world get because of the vaccines?
They won't tell you that many have died because of the vaccines. 

The collaborators and their contortionist mendacious media... With their help, how can truth be known? How are you going to know when the one whose supposed to tell you is the chief faker. 

The Bible tells us of the deception in the last days. Jesus warned. Don't let anyone deceive you. There is no better source of truth than the bible; the word of God. 
If you know the word of God, the spirit that inspired the scriptures will help you know how to distinguish between truth and falsehood

The climate change is a hoax and they know it. 
There are lots of questions they dodge because they have no answers but they have to support their lies with more lies. .that's why they want to rob others of their ability to say anything and they cry that they want to protect others from misinformation. When they are the chief misinformants. 
They say they want to protect children from online misinformation.
They want to stop you from being able to speak or to ask the right questions.
Dictators don't like questions 
Even God allows questions.
Jesus was asked questions.
When you tell the truth you're not afraid of being asked questions. You've got answers for them
One of the hallmarks of democracy is supposed to be debate...but that is something they now hate. That used to be the beauty in Democracy; in houses of parliament; in the courts. 
That's why they hate the courts and want to have activist judges on the benches. 

You've got to pray. You can't just sit back and watch these things happen. When we pray, we can change things. 
If we pray, everyone else will be able to do what they need to do to stop wicked things from happening.
These are spiritual things 
Those who do these things don't do it empty handed. They consult demons and spiritualists. And unless you have spiritual power that's above them, you can't subdue them.

Don't enslave the people. 
They are using fake science. When did science become law?
Development must be allowed. 
Questions must be allowed. 
Just remember, the dictators of yester years are not extinct. 
They have the same mind. They are just not in uniform..
When we say Uniform...we know that sole soldiers are also badly treated 
( A lot of the development of this world were actually done by soldiers)
Your life doesn't change because you are in mufti or uniform. It's about the state of your heart. 
For us christians, we are soldiers. So you have to have the heart of a soldier. Be tough like soldiers. 
These dictators are so not because they are in the army but because they have a satanic mind. 
The Creator gives us the power of choice. 
Let's not stand back and allow things that we don't have.

The scriptures tell us what to do in all circumstances.
"When you are oppressed, Pray.."
If you are sick, it tells you what to do.
So we shouldn't allow ourselves be deceived.



## TALKING SESSION 9TH FEBRUARY 2024

KINDLY SAY THESE WORDS OUT LOUD~16944

Dear Heavenly Father, I thank You for the wisdom to act on Your Word always, and follow the guidance and promptings of the Spirit! Through Your Word, I have increased wisdom, and spiritual understanding, knowing and walking in Your perfect will at all times. I live a prosperous, healthy, and vibrant life in Christ. I rejoice greatly because I know that You care for me, and all of my needs have been entered into Your supply system. I don't lack any good thing, and I owe no one, for I am abundantly supplied; I am prosperous, and in all circumstances, self-sufficient, requiring no aid or support.

Precious Holy Spirit, I’m grateful for the privilege of fellowship with You. You’ve set me on the path of consistent progress, unending success and recurrent victory. You brought fruitfulness and productivity into my life, making my Christian walk one of beauty and joy. Christ lives in me through the Holy Spirit, and Christ in me is the hope of glory! The glory is revealed in my finances, health, business and family! Christ in me is my assurance of prosperity, success, victory and dominion. Hallelujah!

Thank You, Father, for all things are mine. I am growing stronger by the day, like a cedar in Lebanon, and flourishing like the palm tree! I move in the Spirit, and of my increase, progress, and prosperity, there shall be no end! I live the transcendent life of endless possibilities and victories unlimited! Christ is alive in me and I am in Christ. I acknowledge and walk in the light of my heritage, origin, and glory in Christ, in Jesus' Name. Amen.

SPEAK IN OTHER TONGUES NOW



## POWER FOR CHANGE~16954

One of the biggest things Christ brought to us is the possibility to receive the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit takes residence in a believer, He changes everything. If a man were weak and timid, he’d immediately receive strength and boldness. If he were sick and infirm, his body would be vitalized. If he were in the dark about a particular situation, he’d receive the guidance that he required. 

There’s absolutely nothing in the world compared to the presence of the Holy Spirit in a child of God!
In Acts 1:8, the Bible says, “ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you” The moment you received the Holy Spirit, you received the power of God into your life.

Now, the word translated “power” is from the Greek word “dunamis,” which means the dynamic ability to cause changes. It’s from this word that we get the English word “dynamo” – an inherent power generator.

Jesus never exaggerated! When He spoke, He spoke absolute truth. When He said you would receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you, He meant exactly what He said. He carefully chose the expression to communicate the quality and potency of the power that we would have.
After the Holy Ghost came to live within you, you received inherent power. This power resides in you and functions independently of any other power. With this power of the Holy Ghost in you, you don’t need to call for power from above. You have inherent power within you to effect any change you desire. This means you can actually effect changes in your body.

It isn’t God’s desire and purpose for you to be a victim of sickness, disease, or infirmity. In Romans 8:37, the Bible says, “Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.” However, many Christians live as victims and suffer infirmities in their bodies. But that’s not the life Jesus brought.

Some Christians haven’t learned how to put the power of the Holy Ghost in them to work, so they’re constantly looking for help and seeking someone to pray for them. It’s important to understand that if the Holy Spirit lives within you, you don’t need any other outside power; He is the power-giver! Therefore, you should never live as a victim of sickness because you have all that you require within you to change any condition in your body!

Speaking in tongues is one sure way to activate the power of the Holy Ghost in you. The Bible says, “For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries” (1 Corinthians 14:2). Through speaking in tongues, we communicate with God and speak forth mysteries or secret truths. The word “edify” here means “to embolden” or “to charge up”, as you would a battery.

If you were weak and felt overwhelmed by a condition in your body, spend quality time speaking in other tongues. It won’t be long before the power of God will rise within you and prevail over that condition.

Understand that the power of the Holy Ghost in you is greater than anything in this world (1 John 4:4). When His power is at work in you,no infirmity can stand a gainst you successfully. You may have been born with a deformed heart; it doesn’t matter anymore; you don’t have to suffer any more crises. Now that you have the Holy Ghost residing in you, you can cause a change! Speak in other tongues and activate the power of the Spirit. Be edified through the Spirit and see the change you desire come to pass.



## YOU DON’T BELIEVE WITH YOUR MIND OR WITH YOUR BRAIN, YOU BELIEVE WITH YOUR HEART~16956

"When you read the scriptures, it’s addressed to the human spirit. There are things that you can’t grasp with your brain but your spirit can receive because God’s Word was addressed to the human spirit. And the bible says in Rom 10:10 “ With the heart man believeth unto righteousness.” You don’t believe with your mind or with your brain, you believe with your heart. ~ Rev Dr. Chris Oyakhilome DSC DSC DD



## POWER IN THE WORD~16970

When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick (Matthew 8:16).

Someone might be in a precarious health condition and gripe, “I’ve prayed about this sickness, I’ve cried, I’ve fasted, and nothing has changed. I don’t know what else to do!” Well, that’s because you haven’t acted on the Word, which is what God expects of you. When you act on the Word, things change.

For example, when the world says an ailment is incurable, that limitation doesn’t include us because when we lay our hands on the sick, they get healed, irrespective of the condition. We can heal all manner of sicknesses and make diseases dematerialize.
It’s like what happened with Jesus in Bible days; they brought to Him many that were possessed with devils, and He cast out the spirits with His Word, and healed all that were sick. Notice that He did it with His Word.

When He said, “Receive your sight,” the man that was born blind began to see. When He said, “Rise up and walk,” the lame got up, walking and running. His Word restored even those that had their limbs amputated! There’s something about the Word of God!
The Word of God is everything; that’s what gave birth to you and, therefore, what will sustain you. 1 Peter 1:23 says, “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.” James tells us the same thing: “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruit of his creatures”
(James 1:18). In Acts 20:32, Paul writes, “And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.” The Word is your life, so you must yield yourself to the Word to build and nourish you. 

Study the Word voraciously. 
Meditate on the Scriptures.
That way, you’re submitting yourself to the Lordship of the Word. The Word of God is the only ingredient that can transform and build our lives on all three levels: spirit, soul and body. When God’s Word gets into your spirit, it produces in you what it talks about. As you read this, it’s possible you have been diagnosed with cancer in your body. All you need do is speak the Word! Say, “My body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and cannot cohabit with sickness.” Call the name of that disease or condition and address it, saying, “I cut you out and I command you to die, in the Name of Jesus!” It doesn’t matter what the condition is. Whether it’s lameness, blindness or some disability, the power of God is available in His Word. Use the Word against it.

Make the important decision to keep improving your life by being a student of the Word. It’ll cause you to have an efectual life of constant victory over sickness and infirmity. No sickness can thrive in your body because of the impact of the Word of God on your physical body.



## STAY IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF FAITH~16977

“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith” (1 John 5:4).

If you’ve ever seen an orange seed, I’m quite sure the one you saw didn’t have leaves, branches, and fruits on it. I’m also certain it wasn’t crying, “Help me, I need a stem and branches; I need roots and leaves!” When you saw it, it was just a little seed, and if you wanted to grow it, all you had to do was put it in the right environment. 

Everything it requires to produce a tree with roots, leaves, branches, and fruits (with many more seeds in them) is inside that little seed. All a seed requires to grow is to be placed in the right environment. The environment you need for that change you desire to take place is the environment of faith. If you’re outside the environment of faith, you’re in trouble because that’s where fear, failure, and defeat thrive.

Hebrews 11:6 says, “But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”

The Bible says in 1 John 5:4, “and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith” Faith is a leap on God’s Word. It’s taking a stand on God’s Word and insisting on its reality.

Many of God’s children live too much on the natural level of life. They see everything at this level. They feel something in their bodies and they conclude they’re sick. They look around and they figure they can’t make it. They look around and see all the difficulties of life, then they say, “Oh God, see what I’m going through!”

“But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh” (Romans 10:6). The truth is, you’re not supposed to say what you’re going through. Rather, tell what God’s Word has done for you; testify of the Word. Get to the Word of God and discover for yourself what Christ accomplished for you, then accept it and say it!

There may be a medical report that shows something has gone wrong with your physical body. Your first reaction shouldn’t be to find someone to share that negative report with; you ought to declare the Word of God concerning you, which you believe in your heart. And when you stick to the Word, you’re sure to have a testimony!

Let God’s Word become the light by which you see. Then, you’ll discover that the condition is a mirage; it’s not real. The doctors may have said, “There’s no way out, you’ll never get well,” but the reality is what the Word of God gives you.

When you function in faith, it doesn’t matter how lwhat you go through, your life will be tops all the time! Even when change seems impossible, you’ll know that you can only come out victorious! Hallelujah!



## LIFE IN IT’S FULLNESS~17004

“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).

Jesus was God’s sacrifice for the redemption of the world. I always like to say that if you were the only person on earth, Jesus would still have come to die for you. Isaiah 53:10 says, “Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.”

Jesus humbled Himself unto death for you. Philippians 2:8 says, “And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.” This understanding is vital because, being a man, He had a will and mind of His own; He could have decided against it, but He chose to do the Father’s will (Matthew 26:39&42).

This dispels the idea some have that Jesus was a martyr. Jesus wasn’t a martyr; He wasn’t crucified for Himself or His beliefs. He was a sacrifice. Jesus bore our sins and became sin on the cross. Thus, when He died, He became the prisoner of Satan in hell.

In Matthew 12:40, He said, “For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” As soon as the righteous demands of justice were satisfied, Jesus was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father (Romans 6:4).

Isaiah 53:11 also says, “He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.” The fall of the first Adam had given the devil authority over the earth, and the freedom to afflict men and women with sickness and death at will. He had the keys to hell and death. All of God’s creation was enslaved under the bondage of the fear of death (Hebrews 2:14-15).

However, Jesus overcame death and Satan, triumphing over all of hell. The Bible says, “And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it” (Colossians 2:15).

He rendered the devil helpless and powerless, and took away from him the keys of hell and death (Revelation 1:18). Hallelujah! That’s why you should never fear the devil or his demons. Now, following His triumphant victory, Christ opened the cells of the ancient departed saints in Hades and brought them out (Matthew 27:52-53). Then, an angel descended from heaven, rolled the stone away from the grave, and the Son of man came out victorious! (Matthew 28:2-9).

The Gospel is about the death of Jesus Christ as man’s substitute, His burial and resurrection for man’s justification, and His ascension for man’s glorification. Romans 4:25 says, “Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.”
When Jesus rose from the dead, He was born again; He came out with a new life (Acts 13:33; Hebrews 1:5). 

Anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus can receive eternal life by believing God raised Him from the dead and confessing His Lordship (Romans 10:9). This is the reason for healing and divine health. It’s the reason sickness or demons can’t dwell in your body. Understand that Jesus didn’t only come to die for our sins; He also came to give us life in its fullness. We who were crucified with Christ are dead to sin and alive to God. If you are born again, you need not fear death, for it’s been defeated by Jesus.
Now, you have the nature of God in you. You’re qualified to inherit all the glorious and precious promises in the Word that have come through Christ. Healing and health are yours today. Believe, accept, and make them yours.



## FAITH PROCLAMATIONS OF HEALING AND HEALTH~17006

I live in dominion every day, for God has given me power to tread over serpents and scorpions. I refuse to live in fear of what the devil can do to me; Jesus rendered him powerless and useless.

The same Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead lives in me; it’s impossible for me to be brought down by sickness. The healing power of God is working in my bones, tissues, tendons, ligaments, and in every cell in my blood.

I live healthy and strong by the Holy Spirit. Divine life is at work in me. I manifest the virtues and perfections of your righteousness, walking in the glory and dominion of the Spirit, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## GOD’S PLAN FOR YOU~17027

"I will bless you with a future filled with hope-a future of success,
not of suffering." (JEREMIAH 29:11 CEV)

One truth that resounds through the Scriptures is God’s desire for His children to dwell in health. He never intended for them to be victims of sickness or adverse circumstances.

God always wants His children well! When you study the Scriptures, you’ll find how He constantly sought ways to bring succor to His children in their times of affliction. He never left them without help. In the Old Testament, He gave them laws to obey, and their obedience guaranteed their health and well-being. All they needed to do was obey, and they were sure to enjoy a lifetime of peace and prosperity. In Isaiah 1:19, God declared, “If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.”

In the New Testament, we see the same awesome demonstration of love. When our Lord Jesus walked the earth, He wanted to give succor and life to a hurting and dying world. Acts 10:38 says, “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”

Through Christ’s sacrificial death and His subsequent resurrection, it has become possible for everyone to enjoy a life free of sickness and infirmity. This is God’s purpose and desire; for everyone to always live a balanced, healthy, and prosperous life.

3 John 1:2 says, “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.” Some people are wont to think that you can’t always be healthy. Well, that’s not what the Word of God says. Healing became yours when Jesus took your place on the cross. It’s important to know that what He accomplished for you is not a partial healing, such that you could be sick sometimes and well at other times.

In truth, the Lord Jesus successfully bore your infirmities on His own body and died, so that you may continually enjoy a life of perfect health and never be brought down by sickness. This great truth becomes your vital experience when you believe and endorse it.

The Bible says, “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation” (Romans 10:9-10).
In Romans 10:17, the Bible also says, “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.



## SAY THIS ALOUD!~17039

I am loaded, my life is like a well-watered garden. I am fruitful and productive; making progress in every area of my life. I am complete in Christ, and every facet of my life is perfected for excellence. The Spirit guides and inspires me to take actions that are consistent with the Father’s will; actions that guarantee evident, and unstoppable progress, increase and blessings for me. Glory to God. Hallelujah!



## TREAT GRACE LIKE A LADY~17051

*️⃣Something very important about grace that you must be conscious of, is that it craves recognition.

*️⃣If you fail to recognise grace, it’ll cringe; it’ll withdraw and cease to function. 

*️⃣It’s part of the reason some Christians aren’t seeing the manifestation of grace in their lives as they should. 

*️⃣Learn to celebrate grace. 

*️⃣Consciously acknowledge that you’re full of grace, surrounded with divine favour everywhere, and every day. You’ll be amazed at the increased blessings and manifestations of the Spirit you’ll experience in your life.

*️⃣Recognise and celebrate grace.

📖 James 4:6 MSG 

“It’s common knowledge that “God goes against the willful proud; God gives grace to the willing humble.”

*️⃣Grace gives you greater ability and opens doors for you. 

*️⃣When God promotes you, He increases His grace on your life. With that increased grace, you’re able to accomplish much more. 

*️⃣Grace craves recognition.



## SAY~17053

'My body is the temple of the living God. Therefore, only divine health is permitted to function in my members.

## USE GOD’S WORD FOR HEALTH AND HEALING~17059

Matthew 8:16 AMPC “When evening came, they brought to Him (Jesus) many who were under the power of demons, and He drove out the spirits with a word and restored to health all who were sick.”

Someone might be in a precarious health condition and gripe, “I’ve prayed about this sickness; I’ve cried; I’ve fasted, and nothing has changed; I don’t know what else to do!” Well, that’s because that one hasn’t acted on the Word. That’s what God expects of that person. When he or she acts on the Word, things change. There’s reality in the Word of God that’s beyond science and the senses. For example, when the world says an ailment is incurable, that limitation doesn’t include us, because when we lay our hands on the sick, they’re healed, irrespective of the condition.

We can heal all manner of sickness and disease with the Word. When we speak the Word, diseases dematerialise. It’s like what happened with Jesus in Bible days; they brought to Him many that were possessed with devils, and He cast out the spirits with His Word, and healed all that were sick. Notice that He did it with His Word. 

When He said, “Receive your sight,” the man that was born blind began to see. When He said, “Rise up and walk,” at His Word, the lame got up, walking and running. His Word restored even those that had their limbs amputated! There’s something about the Word of God!

Even as you read this, it’s possible you might have been diagnosed with cancer in your body: All you need do is, speak the Word! Therefore, call its name and say, “I command you to die in the Name of Jesus.” Say, “In the Name of Jesus, I cut you out!” It doesn’t matter what condition it is; perhaps it’s lameness, blindness, or some other disability; the power of God is available in His Word. Use the Word against it. No sickness can thrive in your body because of the impact of the divine life on your physical body. Hallelujah!

Confession
Divinity is tabernacled in my physical body! I’m a new creation, not subject to the elements of this world. I live the transcendent life! Divinity flows in every fibre of my being, in every cell of my blood, and in every bone of my body! I reign over sickness, disease, poverty and lack! I’m superior to satan. Glory to God!!

## HOW TO APPLY GOD’S WORD INTO YOUR BODY~17060

My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh” (Proverbs 4:20–22).

The Word of God is His gift to us to keep our bodies according to His design and desire. It is His answer to all human problems. God can’t help anyone outside of His Word, for it is His power to save (Romans 1:16).

You can take God’s Word on any subject, apply it to a corresponding situation, and rest assured that it will produce the results that it talks about. Our opening Scripture gives us God’s recipe, as it were, for applying His Word to our physical bodies and having it produce healing and health in us always.

The first step in applying God’s Word is to attend to it. Regardless of all that you do, God wants you to step aside and incline your ears to His Word. You may even feel very weak, with a lot of things weighing on your mind, but God is saying, “Step aside from all those things and listen to Me.”

The truth is, if you don’t know what the Word says, it would be impossible for you to apply it. Ignorance of God’s Word has been the bane of many Christians. Hosea 4:6 says, “My people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge”

The next step in applying God’s Word to your body is to say what God has said. Joshua 1:8 says, “This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.”
The importance of speaking God’s Word can’t be over-emphasized in the life of a child of God. The Scripture above tells us that if you keep the Word on your lips, you are sure to prosper and be successful in every area of your life, which, of course, includes your physical body. You speaking God’s Word is more potent and effective than any drug or medication you may take. You can cut down any infirmity with the Word of God on your lips.

The next step is to do the Word. It means that, regardless of the circumstances around you, you take hold of the Word concerning a particular situation and do what it says. Jesus was preaching one day in Capernaum and three men brought their friend who was paralyzed to Him. 

The Bible records that Jesus simply said to him, “Arise, take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house” (Mark 2:11). God’s Word carries His divine ability. When Jesus spoke those words, the man heard it and immediately got up, made his bed, and went home. He acted on the Word of the Master. That Word lifted him and the paralysis couldn’t hold him down.

Acting on God’s Word is key to experiencing the miraculous. If there’s been a lingering condition in your body, instead of hoping that things will turn out right someday, take hold of God’s Word concerning your divine health in Christ and act on it. For instance, 3 John 1:2 says, “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health” When you hear that, what you ought to do immediately is act like someone who is in health. If you were weighed down by some symptoms before you read this, you shake them off, get up, and begin to do what you couldn’t do before.

Acting on God’s Word has nothing to do with your feelings. It’s an act of faith. Faith is taking a stand on God’s Word and insisting on its reality. The Word of God is all you need to be that glorious, radiant, and successful you. As you choose to act consistently on the Word, it’s only a matter of time before your whole life aligns with what it says.



## THE POWER OF OBEDIENCE~17079

And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross (Philippians 2:8). 

God has His structures and systems, and operates by principles, but there’re those who always choose their own way. The Bible says there’s a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death (Proverbs 14:12). It pays to listen to God and follow His ways. Never walk in disobedience. For example, as a result of Adam’s disobedience, the Bible tells us “Death ruled like a king” (Romans 5:17 CEV). 

The Amplified Classic translation puts it this way: “because of one man’s trespass (lapse, offense) death reigned through that one” Well then, as one man’s disobedience led to condemnation for all men, so also did Christ’s act of righteousness lead to eternal life and divine acquittal of all men. Jesus, the second and last Adam, did this by obedience. We also read in our opening verse that He “being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.” Remember that Jesus is Himself God, but nothing was going to make Him rebellious against the Father. He was going to be obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross. God had to respond to the obedience of Jesus: 

“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name” (Philippians 2:9). He was given the highest title that could be conferred, because of His obedience. Glory to God!

Obedience is a great blessing in the realm of the Spirit. Being born again, you have an obedient spirit; the Bible calls us obedient children (1 Peter 1:14). So, it’s natural for you to walk in the light of God’s Word, and be completely yielded to spiritual instructions. 

PRAYER 
My life is consecrated to you, dear Father; thank you for your love for me, and for your glory in my life! Today and always, I live to glorify you, serving you with whole-hearted devotion, keeping your Word, fulfilling your purpose for my life, and producing works of righteousness, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.



## DIVINE HEALTH IS YOURS~17080

There’s something more than receiving divine healing; it’s dwelling in divine health. Someone may say, “Is it possible for anybody to always be healthy, without ever falling sick at any time Emphatically yes! The Bible shows us that the quality of life we received when we were born again is superior to all manner of sickness, disease, and infirmity.
In John 1:12-13, the Bible says, “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.”

The man who is born again is born of God in reality. He has the very life and nature of God within him. When you were born again, this life completely supplanted the human life with which you were born. The human life, which is the life of the first Adam, was subject to sickness and death. However, now that you’re born again, the life of God in you transcends sickness and disease.

Sickness can no longer hold sway in your body; the life of God in you is greater. You’ve got to settle this truth in your heart: because you’re born again, you don’t get sick. The new creation doesn’t get sick. This means it’s not in his nature to get sick. He shouldn’t be infected by anything, nor should any disease be found in his body. Just as cats don’t bark because it’s not in their nature, a child of God doesn’t get sick because it’s alien to his divine nature.

In Isaiah 33:24, the Bible says, “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.” What God wants to give you is not a healing; what He wants to give you is His Word in your spirit.

With the Word in your spirit, it doesn’t matter what symptoms show up in your body, you’re sure to have victory over them. However, this comes through meditating on the Word of God. Meditation drives the Word into your spirit

“And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick” (Isaiah 33:24) and produces in your life the harvest of what the Word talks about. So, have specific times for meditating on the Word. As you do this, you’ll find that the Word will literally take charge of your entire being and transform your mind, making it impossible for you to think sickness.

Even if symptoms show up in your body, you’ll know they only came to pass; they have no dwelling place in your body. You’ll understand that, not only have you become one with God, but your body has also become His dwelling place. No Spirit-filled Christian should ever be subject to any form of sickness. This is what the Word of God shows us. In 1 John 4:4, the Bible says, “Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”

You have already overcome everything that is in this world, and that includes sickness and disease, in whatever name it may be called. “What about a Christian who is suffering from cancer?” you ask. That malignant growth is not the reality. Reality is in the Word of God, and the Word of God declares that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. The growth you see is not real; it’s a lie from the devil.
If you believe in your heart all that Jesus accomplished for you through His death, burial, and resurrection, and confess His Lordship over your life, you’re saved (Romans 10:9). 

Automatically, divine health becomes vitally yours. You don’t have to struggle for it. It comes with the salvation package. Don’t live with infirmity any longer; you don’t have to suffer anymore; divine healing is yours in Christ now.

I encourage you to live every day conscious of the reality of your heritage in Christ Jesus. Let the Word of God fill your heart so you’ll always talk right because, the truth is, your body becomes what you say it is. If the devil tries to play his tricks on you, refuse to fear. Insist on the reality of your divine health through your confessions of faith, then go ahead and enjoy your life.



## TODAY'S DECLARATION~17099

Dear Father, thank you for my faith in Jesus Christ that’s unwavering and unshakable. 

I walk in the light of your Word and of my salvation, passionate about the expansion of your Kingdom in the earth, and the reign of your righteousness in the hearts of men, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

I affirm that I belong to Christ; therefore, I’m the seed of Abraham, graced for greatness and ordained to be fruitful and productive in every good work. 

My life is for the glory of God. I affirm that I am fruitful and productive. My financial investments in the gospel are multiplied and they bear fruits that abide and live forever.

I am like a tree planted by the rivers of water that brings forth fruit in its season, and whose leaves will never run dry. 

In any kind of environment, I produce the same glorious results, for I come from Zion where prosperity comes from the Spirit of God. 

My prosperity is appearing for all to see. I am well-decorated financially. I am not of this world; I am from above! 

I am from the wealthiest family and I have an inexhaustible inheritance in Christ Jesus. I am connected to an endless stream of prosperity, riches, and glory. 

I am seated with Christ in the realms of power and glory; far above all principality, power, might and every domain of darkness!

I can never be broke because I am an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ! The life of God is at work in me, in every fibre of my being, in every cell of my blood, and in every bone of my body.

My whole being is immune to death, decay, and the corrupting influences of the world.

Every day of my life is full of God’s glory, beauty, excellence, and grace. Every day God loads me with great benefits. 

In His favour, my horn is exalted. Eternity is alive in me. 

I live above infirmities and the harsh elements of this world because the One who lives in me is greater than he that’s in this world.

I’ve been brought into life and immortality. I’m fearless, for death has been paralysed—defeated by Jesus, and when He did it, I was in Him! 

I boldly exercise my divine rights in Christ, taming my body and environment with my faith-filled confessions. No evil shall befall me.

Nothing shall by any means hurt me because the Lord Almighty is my defence and fortress. 

I affirm that I go out with joy, and I am led forth with peace, the mountains and the hills break forth before me into singing. 

I am an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ. I have been given access to the inexhaustible, unfathomable, riches of Christ.

I affirm that I am a man of influence, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. 

I declare that I am rich and full of grace, my source is divine, therefore, my transformation is beyond the standard of this world. 

I rise daily above the economic systems of my country and the world at large; no matter how high the inflations go, they will always meet me at the top because I ride on the wings of the Spirit and my prosperity is mesmerizing and confusing to the belittling elements of this world for greater is He that is in me than he that is this world. I am rich, rich, rich, rich. Hallelujah!

Remain blessed 🙏👏😃



## BE SPECIFIC IN PRAYER~17139

For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, Be removed and be cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says.
Mark 11:23

A story of a woman in the Bible. Her name was Hannah. Hannah didn't have a child. So, she went to the temple to pray for one. While she was praying, she didn't just ask the Lord for a child, she was very specific in her request: she asked the Lord for a son. Sure enough, she got her miracle (1 Samuel 1: 10-20).

Like Hannah, when you're praying to the Lord about something, be specific in your request. Hallelujah!

## JOY OVERFLOW~17210

📖Today's Word!📖

RESTORATION IN PROGRESS!

Joel 2:25 AMPC “And I will restore or replace for you the years that the locust has eaten.”

If you ever find yourself in a quagmire or in some unpleasant situation, don’t fret or think you’re helpless. Don’t ever say, “This is the worst time of my life!” Christ lives in you, and that is what matters. He’s the restorer of wasted or lost time, effort, resources, energy, etc. He’ll make up for it. No human being or government may ever be able to give back to you what you’ve lost in life, but God can! He’s the God that “quickens the dead,” that is, He gives life to the dead. He can bring back everything and more! Thank the Lord for moving you forward irrespective of the time you may have lost.

🗣️SAY THIS🗣️

By the power of the Holy Spirit, I’m making progress, far ahead of my competitors, detractors and adversaries. I’m guided by the Holy Spirit, who also has made my life beautiful and made me the testimony of God’s righteousness and grace, in Jesus’ Name. Amen. I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!



## JOY OVERFLOW~18668

BE FULL OF JOY ALWAYS

1 Peter 1:8
Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory


You're to live happy every day, and your happiness and joy should be independent of circumstances. Nothing, and no one, was created to make you happy; you're responsible for your joy and happiness. Never find yourself looking gloomy, and confused. Never carry on through the day with a disconsolate and restless attitude. Confusion and depression are the handiworks of the devil. Never allow them in your life. Instead, always allow the joy of the Lord well up in your heart. Be full of joy always!


SAY THIS

I’ve been brought into the life of unending joy, the joy that comes from the inner man and transcends physical circumstances. My joy is of the Spirit, and independent of circumstances; I’m ever strong and alive, for the joy of the Lord is my strength! Blessed be God!I am a well-watered garden. Streams of healing waters flow from me to all in my world. I don’t contract or transmit sickness. The good life is mine. Health is mine. Joy is aglow in my spirit. My life is a complete testimony that there’s a higher life in Christ. Praise God! *I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!


Go forth in Joy, you are loved by God!



## JOY OVERFLOW~18679

APPRECIATE YOURSELF!

That the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. (Philemon 1:6)


There are some people that find it hard to take compliments. No matter how good they look, they’ll always find something to point out that’s wrong with them. “My ears are too small”, “my nose is too pointed” they’d say. This shouldn’t be so.

You were made in the image and likeness of God and everything about you is perfect. Therefore, learn to appreciate everything about you. You’re unique and there’s no one like you in the world. What’s more, God loves you.


SAY THIS

I rejoice with joy unspeakable knowing I’m made in the image and likeness of God. I celebrate my identity in Christ. Hallelujah! *I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!


Go forth in Joy, you are loved by God!



## JOY OVERFLOW~18726

ALWAYS STAY JOYFUL AND IN PRAISE!

The Bible says, “Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully” (1 Peter 5:7 AMPC). And then He says, “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6-7).

Someone might say, “I only get anxious when the issues get very serious.” No, Jesus said, “Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me” (John 14:1). Nothing should ever trouble you. That’s why it’s important to meditate on the Word of God. When you do, you’re conditioned to have the right mindset, and you can’t help but be joyful!

The Prophet said, “I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God” (Isaiah 61:10). The Psalmist said, “My soul shall be joyful in the LORD; it shall rejoice in His salvation” (Psalm 35:9). The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 21:16, “Have you never read, “Out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants You have perfected praise”?” Always learn to joyfully praise the Lord.

SAY THIS
My heart is bursting with the laughter and joy of the Spirit today, Father. The joy of the Lord in my heart is not dependent on external conditions. It doesn’t matter what news or circumstance tries to bring me down; I am always joyful in the Holy Ghost, with whom I am always victorious. Hallelujah! I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength! 


Go forth in Joy, you are loved by God!



## JOY OVERFLOW~18771

JOY IN THE REALMS OF SALVATION!

For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Romans 10:10). 

In the realms of salvation is joy. That’s because all the blessings of God, all the blessings that exist in Christ, are in salvation. So, we’re full of joy all the time because we have all things. The Bible says, “For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost” (Romans 14:17). There’s no room for frustration in our lives. We don’t give vent to sadness, anger or bitterness. We give vent to the joy of the Lord—joy unspeakable and full of glory.

Consider what the Spirit says through Paul to the saints in Thessalonica: “And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost” (1 Thessalonians 1:6). Despite the affliction, they were full of joy.


SAY THIS
Righteous Father, I’ve put on the new man which, after you, is created in righteousness and true holiness. Therefore, I'm full of joy and strengthened by the Holy Spirit today. My life is the testimony of your grace and goodness, and I rejoice always with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Hallelujah! I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!*  

Go forth in Joy, you are loved by God!

BRIMMING WITH JOY!

Psalm 16:11 “You will show me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.


Joy is a product of the recreated human spirit. Some people haven’t understood the power of a joyful and merry heart; otherwise, they’d always let the joy of the Lord that’s in their spirit gain the mastery. It’s possible to experience indescribable joy, every day. Our opening scripture says, “You will show me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore,” meaning that the divine influence of God upon your life—the presence of God in your spirit brings indescribable joy to your life. That’s what the Bible describes as joy unspeakable and full of glory (1 Peter 1:8 KJV).Practice this: Stand in front of your mirror and laugh continually, till joy bubbles up from your spirit. Hallelujah!


SAY THIS
Righteous Father, I’ve put on the new man which, after you, is created in righteousness and true holiness. Therefore, I'm full of joy and strengthened by the Holy Spirit today. My life is the testimony of your grace and goodness, and I rejoice always with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Hallelujah! *I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!

TAKE HIS JOY TO YOUR WORLD

Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? (1 Corinthians 3:16)


God has filled your heart with His joy. He doesn’t want you to keep that joy to yourself but to share it with everyone around you.

When you get into a place, if that place was dull or full of sadness, the atmosphere should lighten up because you stepped in. You’re the temple of the almighty God and you carry all of Him in you. Therefore, speak joy, blessings and peace everywhere you go. This is how to take His joy to your world. Glory to God!

SAY THIS
I am full of the joy of the Lord, and I bless my world with His joy, goodness and blessings as I speak faith-filled words. Hallelujah! *I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!   

Go forth in Joy, you are loved by God!



## JOY OVERFLOW~18860

NEVER GET FRANTIC

And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm (Mark 4:39).

The Scriptures show us how to respond when we’re confronted with challenges. Always, the Lord tells us not to fear. Never get frantic or flustered. We’re creatures of faith and not fear.

In Mark 4, Jesus was in the boat with His disciples and there was a tempest: “And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full” (Mark 4:37). Rattled by fear, the disciples cried out to the Master who was peacefully asleep at the rear of the boat. He wasn’t one to be flustered by circumstances.

When He woke up, He didn’t say, “This storm is quite tumultuous and a serious threat to our lives! I need to talk to the Father.” No! His amazing and inspiring response to the storm was, “Peace, be still!” Hallelujah! Some Christians find themselves in similar situations and respond in fear. They start speaking in tongues out of panic; no. Speak in tongues, but never out of fear.

Praying out of frenzy negates your faith; it’s ineffective. It’s not wrong to immediately start speaking in tongues when you’re in certain situations, but you must know why you’re speaking in tongues at such times. It should be to stir your spirit to pick the right words to deal with the situation.

While speaking with tongues, the Holy Spirit will also give you utterance in spiritual incantations which are coded words for the circumstances. Hallelujah! Refuse to fear, and remember who you are; then speak as the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!

SAY THIS
I live by faith in the Word of God, and I keep my mind steadfastly focused on Christ and the realities of the Kingdom of God! No matter what happens around me, I refuse to fear, because I’m born of God and I’ve overcome the world. Greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world. Hallelujah! I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!

Go forth in Joy, you are loved by God!



## JOY OVERFLOW~18878

Brimming with Joy!

The good thing about joy is that it never comes alone. When it comes into your spirit, it comes with laughter, gladness, and happiness. It removes heaviness and gloom from you, such that when people see you, instead of asking, “What’s the problem?” they’ll say, “you’re looking radiant; share the good news with us.” Choose always to be joyful! It’s your responsibility to keep the joy of the Spirit bubbling in your life. Whenever something tries to bother or depress you, don’t submit to it. Rather, consciously subdue it with the joy of the Lord from within your spirit by laughing your way to victory.

Remember, laughter is one of the characteristics of a joyful and merry heart. So when the laughter of the Spirit wells up in your heart like that, don’t try to stop it. Keep laughing till you saturate your spirit with joy. That way, not only are you declaring your victory, the devil and his demons will be discomfited because they can’t stand an atmosphere of joy, love, and gladness.

SAY THIS
I live in the presence of God where I experience joy unspeakable and full of glory. Today, my life is filled with indescribable joy, and my mouth is filled with laughter. I’m strengthened because the joy of the Lord in my spirit is my strength, in Jesus’ Name. Amen. *I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength.

Go forth in Joy, you are loved by God!

JOYFUL IN TRIBULATION!

Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation (2 Corinthians 7:4).

Is it possible to be joyful in tribulation? Emphatically yes! That’s our life in Christianity; it makes no difference what we face, we’re unruffled and full of joy because we know the end from the beginning! We always win.  

2 Corinthians 4:17 says, “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.” This is God’s Word; it can’t be overturned. No wonder James said, “Count it all joy when you go through diverse tests” (James 1:2).  

It doesn’t matter how severe the pressures get, we never say, “I can’t take it anymore.” Rather, we stand strong and unmoveable. We never get flustered, because it’s our nature to triumph. We endure hardness with cheerfulness; we’re “Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness" (Colossians 1:11). Glory to God! 


SAY THIS
I live the transcendent life, a life of absolute victory, success and excellence! I have an ever-winning, joyous life, with power over crises and dominion over circumstances. The adversities of life are for my promotion, for I’ve been built to overcome. Hallelujah! I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!

In the Darkest Hour, Sing Your Praise to God!


Acts 8:7-8 “For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed. And there was great joy in that city.”

Philip, the evangelist, had preached Christ in the city of Samaria, and the power of God’s Word prevailed so much that many were healed and set free from demons. The result was that the city erupted in great joy. Another time, Paul and Silas were cast into prison, persecuted for preaching the Gospel. Nevertheless, “at midnight,” (it doesn’t get darker than it gets at midnight), they prayed and sang praises to God, and the other prisoners heard them (Acts 16:25). They expressed their joy in the very early hours of the morning, and the result was a supernatural jailbreak. God shook up the prison, broke their bands and flung the gates open. They remained joyful in adversity and gave expression to their joy.


SAY THIS
I thank you Father for making my life a bundle of joy and happiness. Your joy in my heart is my strength, and with joy, I draw out prosperity, peace, success, health and other blessings from deep within me today, in Jesus’ Name. Amen. I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!

Learn To Give Expression To Your Joy!

Job 5:22; At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

 2 Chronicles 20:22; And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

Isaiah 12:3; Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.


What are the expressions of joy? Well, laughter is an expression of joy. Praising God—being jubilant and enthusiastic with praise to Him—is another expression of joy. Singing songs of praise in thanksgiving is an expression of joy. The Bible says, “Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms” (James 5:13). Joy is one of the fruits of the recreated human spirit (Galatians 5:22); therefore, your joy as a child of God should be independent of circumstances. It shouldn’t be based on what’s happening to you or around you; it shouldn’t have anything to do with what others say or do to you.

You can be joyful in the midst of trouble. You must learn to give expression to your joy. Always be cheerful and exuberant with praise, knowing that it takes a joyful and happy person to make others joyful and happy. If you’re not joyful, you can’t effectively preach the Gospel and win others to Christ. Spend time having a good laugh today; don’t worry about who’s watching, just enjoy yourself in the Spirit.


SAY THIS
I thank you Father for making my life a bundle of joy and happiness. Your joy in my heart is my strength, and with joy, I draw out prosperity, peace, success, health and other blessings from deep within me today, in Jesus’ Name. Amen. I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!

Go forth in Joy, you are loved by God!

IT’S COMING FROM INSIDE!!


But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness Galatians 5:22 

Is it possible for you to be full of joy all the time? The answer is a resounding YES!  

For every child of God, our joy comes from within. While some people would have to watch something funny or get tickled to laugh and be happy, it’s natural for us to always be joyful and excited! 

You can laugh and keep your smile on always regardless of what’s happening around you. Isn’t that exciting?

Therefore, live everyday bubbling and full of joy and laughter “for the joy of the Lord is your strength” (Nehemiah 8:10).

SAY THIS
I am full of the joy of the Lord. Therefore, I am full of strength and excitement every second of every day. Glory to God! I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!

Have A Light-Hearted Approach To Life!

Philippians 4:4; Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice!” 

Proverbs 17:22; A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. 

Psalm 28:7; The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.

You’re a spirit being, and your spirit rubs off on anything that concerns you. There’s a connection between you and your shoes, the clothes you wear, and everything about you! Your personality rubs off on anything that belongs to you. And so, when you allow sadness into your heart and face, it has a negative impact on the things connected to you.


It’s one reason the Bible enjoins us to be happy always (1 Thessalonians 5:16). Think happy thoughts; centre your mind on things that make you happy. Stop focusing your mind on whatever makes you sad and unhappy. It’s a choice you must make. Your life depends more on you than you realise. To be successful, you must let go of unhappiness and a sad look. Choose to be lighthearted. Lay off the burdens. Lay aside every weight. Choose to be happy all of the time. Set your mind on and rejoice about the things the Lord has done for you today. Keep a warm smile on your face all through your day.

SAY THIS
Dear Lord, thank you for the joy that’s in my heart. I’m strengthened and energized for increased productivity and effectiveness by your Spirit today, who fills my heart with rejoicing and my mouth with laughter. You’re my strength, my joy, and my song; I love you with all my heart. Hallelujah!. I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!

STAY HAPPY AND EXCITED!

Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice! Philippians 4:4

Do you remember how happy and excited you were when you received that gift that was special to you? Well, that's how the Lord wants you to be every day.

Each day is a gift, and the Lord wants you to enjoy it. Is it possible to be happy and excited every day? Of course, yes! That's how I am. I don't focus on bad or sad news; rather, I think about how much God loves me regardless of what's happening, and joy is stirred up from my heart, and then I'm smiling again.

So, refuse to focus on those things that make you sad. Stir up the joy of the Lord in you and keep your smile on. Remember that God loves you very much and wants you happy all the time.


SAY THIS
I smile everyday because I'm full of joy. I'm strong every day because the joy of the Lord is my strength. *I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with.

LAUGHTER HEALS!


A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit saps a person’s strength. Proverbs 17:22 NLT


Laughing is one of the ways to keep your body healthy and strong. Laughter is an expression of joy, and as God’s child, you should be joyful, for joy is in your spirit (Galatians 5:22). 


Refuse to let sadness, anger or bitterness into your spirit. These are negative emotions that can make one sick. Rather, stir up the joy of God in your spirit, and choose to remain cheerful, and joyful no matter the situation before you.

SAY THIS
I am healthy and strong because I am full of joy and laughter. Hallelujah I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!

The Lord Wants You Filled With Joy And Laughter!

Psalm 126:1-2 TLB “When Jehovah brought back his exiles to Jerusalem, it was like a dream! How we laughed and sang for joy. And the other nations said, “What amazing things the Lord has done for them.”


Can you remember your reaction the last time you got a pleasant surprise? Your reaction was definitely the reward for whoever surprised you. Think about this for a second: the children of Israel standing before the Red Sea, with the armies of Egypt in hot pursuit behind them. Then imagine the expression on their faces as God parted the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21-31)! 

Remember Paul and Silas? They were beaten and thrown in jail for preaching the Gospel, yet in prison, they prayed and sang praises and suddenly, there was a supernatural earthquake that shook only the prison! The entire prison was shaken to its foundations, all the doors were opened and the prisoners’ chains loosened. 

The warden of the prison woke up and was about to harm himself, thinking that all the prisoners had escaped. You could literally see the look on his face, as it turned from terror to deep relief, on learning that the prisoners were still there, and then he had a personal encounter with the Master. He fell down on his face and gave his life to Christ. Then he took Paul and Silas home, cleaned them up, fed them and had his family saved and baptised in water (Acts 16:16-34). Wow! 

Some people only need to see the spectacular, and their lives would experience an undeniable change.

SAY THIS
Dear Lord, you are the center of my joy; you fill my heart with gladness and my mouth with laughter. You have done all things well, and I glorify your Name today. I thank you that your blessing and favour, your goodness and mercy are my companions today, in Jesus’ Name. Amen. *I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!

JOY FROM WITHIN!

Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength (Nehemiah 8:10).

Some people never laugh unless they’re listening to some jokes by a comedian. A comedian may say or do some funny things to make you laugh, but all that is transient; true joy is inside you. Having received the Holy Spirit, God expects you to generate joy and excitement from within. 

Always learn to release joy from inside you. Never allow anything take away your joy. Our opening verse says, “the joy of the LORD is your strength.” It’s not talking about the joy you get when you receive some good news or when something you’ve been expecting pulls through for you; no, it’s the joy of the Lord! That joy comes from the Holy Ghost; it comes from the Word. And you’ve got to express it, because as you do, the power is released and your challenges bow. 

SAY THIS
I go out with joy, and I’m led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills break forth before me into singing, and all the trees of the field clap their hands. I rejoice exceedingly in the God of my salvation, irrespective of what comes my way, for His mercy endures forever. Hallelujah! *I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!



## JOY OVERFLOW~19626

NEVER GIVE THE DEVIL A PLACE, STAY JOYFUL!


Romans 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. 

James 1:2-3 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 3 Knowing [this], that the trying of your faith worketh patience. 

2 Corinthians 4:17-18 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding [and] eternal weight of glory; 18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen [are] temporal; but the things which are not seen [are] eternal. 

Every time, and in every place where the Holy Spirit manifests Himself, there’s always great joy. And where there’s joy, it’s difficult for Satan to penetrate. This is why when Satan wants to destroy a family, one of the things he does first is to destroy their joy. Everybody becomes sad, angry, long-faced, and frustrated. Even the children return from school looking sad and gloomy. Therefore, because there’s no joy in the home, the devil can take over. So, never give him a place in your home, for whatever reason. 

In the midst of trouble, in the midst of dire challenges, release joy from within. As you do, the challenges will crumble before you; the tumour will pass out of your body; the debts will be settled supernaturally! This is the reason the Bible says, “My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations” (James 1:2). If you’ve lost your joy to circumstances of life, it’s time to take it back. Stir it up from within. Glory to God!



SAY THIS
I go out with joy, and I’m led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills break forth before me into singing, and all the trees of the field clap their hands. I rejoice exceedingly in the God of my salvation, irrespective of what comes my way, for His mercy endures forever. Hallelujah! *I'm Alive, I choose Joy, I have Joy like a River, I'm full of Joy, I have Joy to an overflowing measure, I dispense Joy to everyone I come in contact with. The Joy of the Lord is my strength!



## GREATNESS IS GOD’S DREAM FOR YOU~17273

Everyone that’s born of God has in him or her, the seed of greatness; we were born great

And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great (Genesis 26:13).

Galatians 3:29 says, “And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” God had said to Abraham, “And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice” (Genesis 22:18). This is also your heritage, because you’re the seed of Abraham; you’ve been set apart for greatness; you’re a blessing to your world.
God chose all of us—His kids—to be great and desires to use each one of us mightily in our own unique ways to fulfil His purpose in the earth. Everyone that’s born of God has in him or her, the seed of greatness; we were born great. 

Never suppose that your greatness in life is dependent upon your works, for the Bible says, “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9). Get to know who you are in Christ, and walk in that identity.

Observe again, God’s idea: He said to Abraham, “I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing” (Genesis 12:2). It wasn’t Abraham who pleaded that God should make him great. Rather, it was God’s choice; your greatness is God’s choice.
This means that whether or not you intended it, greatness is God’s dream for you since you’re the seed of Abraham. You don’t need to struggle to be great; greatness abides in you now! Live every day with the mentality of greatness and excellence. Let it reflect in the way you think, talk, walk, and live.

## LIFE WITHOUT LIMITS!~17305

And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life (1 John 5:11-12).

Society may place limits on you; your family background, the nation where you live, your education, job description, business, or finances could place limits on you. But there’s a life without limits; that’s the life Jesus brought to us; it’s the transcendent life of glory where there are no limitations.

Many know nothing about this kind of life, and so they think it doesn’t exist. That they know nothing about it doesn’t make it unreal; after all, there was a time people thought it was impossible to fly an airplane, but that, however, has become common place today. The Word teaches of a life without limits, and that’s the life to which everyone who’s born again has been called. A life unlimited by sickness, disease, failure, the devil or anything!

Jesus proved it was possible to live this triumphant life when He walked the earth. He lived a life that was greater than anything that existed on the terrestrial plane. He refused to be limited by the circumstances of this world. He tamed nature. The Bible tells us how He defied the laws of nature by walking on water (Matthew 14:25), and hushing the sea to sleep (Mark 4:39).

Not even satan, death, or the grave could limit Him. When He died, the Bible says through that death, He paralyzed him that has the power of death, that is, the devil (Hebrews 2:14). Thereafter, He rose triumphantly from the grave. This is the life to which you’ve been called where nothing can hinder or place limits on you. According to our opening scripture, you received this life when you were born again.

Now that you have this life in you, refuse to function according to your natural human abilities and take up God’s limitless power that’s been deposited in your spirit! The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 3:5, “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God…” The word “sufficiency” is translated from the Greek, “hikanotes,” which means ability or competence. Thus, your ability to perform is of God; that means it’s unlimited. God gave you His ability so you won’t have to function with your own limited abilities but with His limitless and exhaustible strength.

Confession
I’m born again; therefore, I’m not ordinary. As the Father has life in Himself, even so has He given me to have His kind of life; life without limits. Thus, I function with supernatural strength and abilities today; nothing and no one can hurt or harm me for my sufficiency is of God! Hallelujah.

## My Daily Confession...~17497

I declare in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ that my faith is working and producing results. The Word of God is working mightily in me, building up my faith and producing in me what it talks about! It's working in my spirit, in my mind, and in my physical body! I set my gaze upon Christ Jesus, the author and perfecter of my faith! I refuse to be moved, or swayed by the physical circumstances all around me, because I am founded upon the rock that is Christ! I am set on the course that I must follow, in the Name of Jesus! 

The Bible says concerning me in Colossians 3:4 that Christ is my life! Hallelujah. That means that my physical body is infused with the very life of Christ. I refuse sickness and disease; I refuse to accommodate infirmity in me because Christ is my life. Eternal life cannot share the same living quarters with sickness! I declare that my body responds to the Word of God, and not to sickness! There is disease-destroying energy in my blood that devours bacteria, viruses, germs and all agents of sickness! 

Glory to God! I am not ordinary! I may look like the rest of the world, but the life in me is different! I am separated, sanctified, demarcated, and partitioned from the corrupting forces of the world, unto the glorious life that is in Zion!

Thank you, Lord! Thank you for this glorious life you have called me into! A life of rest, of dominion, of victory, twenty-four hours everyday! Thank you Lord for pouring your very self into me! I will live unto you, as a witness of your manifold wisdom and power. Thank you Lord, for making me a champion in this life, an overcomer and more than a conqueror, in the Name of Jesus! Amen.



## FAITH’S  PROCLAMATIONS OF HEALING AND HEALTH~17503

The Holy Spirit leads me from glory to glory. I follow Him in the Word, by the Word, and through the Word. God’s Word gives me light and direction and holds the solution to every problem. 

Irrespective of what signs or symptoms may appear, the Word ministers health to my body. The Holy Spirit lives in me and I live in Him. I am always in the presence of God, the Father of Lights, with whom there is no shadow of darkness, disease, or death. I am ever surrounded by the light and life of God.

I have the life and nature of God in me; I’ve put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. I’m excited about my new life in Christ. I’ve passed from death to life; from sin to righteousness; from sickness to health; from poverty to wealth. Praise God!

Dear Father, thank You for the glorious and triumphant life in Christ that You’ve brought me into – a place where there’s no sickness, disease, and infirmity. I thank You for Your indestructible life that flows in every fiber of my being, making me unsusceptible and impregnable to the attacks of the devil, in Jesus' Name.
Amen.

## SPEAK LIFE~19807

My body is God’s house; the Holy Spirit perambulates every fiber of my being and every cell of my blood. In the presence of God is fullness of joy and at His right hand are pleasures evermore. No illness can abide in my body because I carry God. Everything about me exudes the life of Christ; therefore, my health does not fail, rather, it is ever radiant and ever flourishing. I cause healing and health to prosper in my environment and in the lives of those I come in contact with. I am a dispenser of eternal verities.



## SPEAK LIFE~19828

I have the incorruptible life of God in my spirit. This new life is in every cell of my blood, every bone of my body, and in every fiber of my being! Today, I walk in the reality of the new life of righteousness, which I’ve received in Christ. I affirm that I am alive unto God! The eyes of my understanding are flooded with light, and I’m conscious of the spiritual realm always. As I speak in tongues, I’m filled with the Spirit and my spiritual alertness and sensitivity are at their peak. And with the Word of God in my mouth and the Name of Jesus, I reign over circumstances, Satan, and the world! Hallelujah!



## YOUR LIFE IS SHAPED BY YOUR THOUGHTS~17525

👤PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME

Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life (PROVERBS 4:23)

It’s not every thought that comes to you that is from God. The only way you know the source of your thoughts is through the light of God’s Word, and the ministry of the Holy Spirit. It’s very important what you think about, and how you think, because your life is shaped by your thoughts. Our theme verse in the Good News translations says, “Be careful how you think; your life is shaped by your thoughts.”

Screen and filter your thoughts; mount garrison over your heart, because out of your heart are the issues of life! You have to be the policeman of your heart; take charge of your heart. Don’t allow every thought. Allow only God’s thoughts, righteous thoughts and thoughts of love in Christ Jesus.

The Bible specifically lets us know the kind of thoughts to allow: “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things” (Philippians 4:8).

You’re the character of your thoughts. What you think about, you become. The Lord Jesus actually related this in His teachings in a most enlightening way. He said, “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart” (Matthew 5:27-28).

Your thoughts can deliver to you a glorious life or keep you on the sidewalk of life. If you’d let the Word dominate your thinking, it’ll create the right thoughts in you and give you the right mindset. You’d think victory, success, dominion and possibilities only.

Romans 12:2 says, “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind” When your thoughts are consistent with the Word, your life will be a reflection of His glory, for the glory is in the Word. So, discipline your mind to accept only the right thoughts.

PRAYER
Dear Father, I consciously think the right thoughts and meditate only on things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of a good report, virtuous and praiseworthy. Therefore, I fulfil all your plans for me, by your Word, I make my way prosperous, and walk in absolute victory, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.



## TIME IS AN ASSET~17583

INVEST YOUR TIME WISELY

Time is an asset, which you must learn to invest wisely. Investing your time wisely means investing your time in spiritual things. Moses had this on his mind when he prayed to the Lord to "Teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom" (Psalms 90:12). Each day you live is an opportunity to accomplish so much, but the question is: How well do you schedule your day?

When you wake up in the morning, don't just roll off your bed and stumble blindly into the day. Spend quality time first to fellowship with the Holy Spirit in prayer and in the Word. Ask Him to guide you as you schedule your activities for the day and prioritize your activities. Ask Him to help you save time, and you'd discover how much you're able to accomplish for the Kingdom on a daily basis. Then, you'll become more productive, effective and progressive.

LEARN TO INVEST YOUR TIME WISELY.



## Speak it Loud~17676

I am walking in divine health every day of my life; sickness cannot prevail over my body because eternal life is working from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet. I’m a new creation in Christ Jesus. Old things are passed away and all things are become new for me.



## WHAT MAKES MUSIC GOOD?~17682

WHAT CONSTITUTES GOOD MUSIC FOR THE CHRISTIAN?

*️⃣Well, there are several things to consider:

1️⃣What’s the message of the music?

2️⃣Who’s the messenger of that music?

3️⃣What does all of these represent, and what is it they’re really telling you?

— Do you read between the lines when you listen to what’s being said, or you’re just having fun listening to the beat?

— Does the song make you worldlier or godlier? 

— Does it stir in you worldly, carnal inclinations or godly inspirations? 

*️⃣You see, the result of this inquiry is what tells you whether or not you should be listening to a song.

*️⃣If you know the message and the messenger aren’t from God, then, of course you should reject it all together. 

*️⃣Remember the Word says: “Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable— if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things” (Philippians 4:8 NIV). 

— And in the case of music, listen only to such things. 

*️⃣So, it’s time to clean out your playlist and re-load with godly, wholesome, inspiring music!

📖Proverbs 4:20-23 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. 21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. 22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh. 23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.

📖Luke 8:18 CEV “Pay attention to how you listen! Everyone who has something will be given more, but people who have nothing will lose what little they think they have.”

ACT NOW— Look through your music collection to identify which songs don’t fit into the category of good music, and get rid of them.

GOD BLESS YOU

## THE EFFECTS OF GRACE~17963

The grace of God on its own can’t be seen until you see what it produces. So, the Lord impresses on your heart, through His Word and the Holy Spirit

Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord (Acts 11:23).

Luke, by the inspiration of the Spirit, explains in the verse above, how Barnabas and Paul went to visit the brethren, and they saw the grace of God. What does it mean to “See the grace of God?”

“Grace” is from the Greek word “charis”; it refers to the divine influence on the heart reflected in the life of a man. It’s the outward expression, or the outworking of an inward divine influence in your heart. Simply put, it’s the inner working of the glory and the power of God in your life that radiates, shines, and reflects on the outside. So, what these Apostles saw was an outer reflection of the inner working of the power, and life, and nature of God in them—they saw the effects of that grace.

You only see the outworking of the grace of God. It’s like saying “We saw the winds blowing.” You really don’t see the wind; what you see are the effects of the wind. The effects could be moving objects, or the branches of a tree moving to and fro; then you can immediately decipher that it’s a strong wind. You don’t see the wind; what you see are the effects!

It’s the same way with the description in the opening verse. The grace of God on its own can’t be seen until you see what it produces. So, the Lord impresses on your heart, through His Word and the Holy Spirit, and whatever is deposited by that influence, is seen on the outside; it shows or reveals itself on the outside. Then we can say, just like the early Church, “We saw the grace of God on them.”

That’s why it’s important to grow in grace. 2 Peter 3:18 tells us, “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ” The word “grow” is taken from the Greek word “auxano”; it means “to give increase to.” To grow in grace is to increase in the workings of the power of God in your life. And as you grow in grace, more of the glory of God shines, radiates, and is seen through you. Halleluiah!

## THE WORD ON YOUR LIPS~17987

I am a master over Satan because my spirit, soul, and body are now infused with divinity. I am a product of God’s Word, for my origin is the Word of God; therefore my words and actions are backed by divine authority. I am born of the Word and Spirit of the Lord; therefore, I’m impregnable to everything that hurts or binds because I hail from God! I’ve overcome the devil and the cohorts of darkness, because the greater one indwells me. I declare that my body is under obligation to respond to the Word of God at all times; my body is regulated by God’s Word and every part of my body aligns to what God says. I am not one who continually requires healing; I am born of the life-giving Spirit of God; therefore, I am also a life giver. I’m born of God; therefore, I’m a living epistle, a letter from Christ, known and read by all. I live the life of the Word, full of glory, virtue and honour. I express the divine nature, living the Kingdom life of victory, prosperity, peace and joy now and always. My life is an absolute manifestation of the glory of God! I live from inside out; the glory of the Lord in my spirit is expressed in my body with excellent and perfect health.

Say these with me, ‘I am a success forever; the life of God is at work in me. I live in health: 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.

Irrespective of daunting challenges, persecutions, hardships, and troubles, I remain steadfast, courageous, and bold in my commitment to the Gospel, and its spread around the world. The Spirit of God strengthens me in my inner man and my youth is renewed like the eagles. I refuse to get old in my mind; rather, I open my heart and mind to fresh ideas from God’s Spirit.

Everything and everyone that’s connected to me experiences the grace of God and is influenced by God's righteousness, glory, and grace that I bear. Thank You, Lord for the glorious life of abundance and dominion that I have in Christ. I refuse to be discouraged or overwhelmed by the challenges of life; rather, I see them as opportunities to exercise my faith and prove the power in the Word. My faith is the victory that overcomes the world. I neutralize, quench, put out, and extinguish the fiery dart of the adversary. The Word of God on my lips prevails in my health, finances, life, and family

I don’t function in my ability or strength, for my sufficiency is of God. My strength is renewed daily and I’m divinely energized at all times for victory and all-around success. I’ve been granted unrestricted access to the unending, boundless, fathomless, incalculable and exhaustless riches of Christ.

Thank You, blessed Father, for the immeasurable, limitless, surpassing riches of Your grace, Your kindness, and goodness of heart directed toward me in Christ Jesus. You’re the only true and wise God, who reigns and rules in the affairs of men; the One who is the blessed and only Sovereign. To You, Lord, be all glory, honour, majesty, dominion, and praise, to You belong all greatness and might. All in heaven and earth are Yours. You’re exalted above all. I love You Lord; and I thank You, for You’re gracious, holy, righteous, and true. My faith in the Word and its integrity is unyielding, and the Word produces the health, strength, vitality, and all the blessings and provisions that it talks about in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.

## SPEAK IT~18030

I am deeply grounded in the Word; therefore, I am immune to the failures, sicknesses, and defects in the world. I am a product of the Word. I dwell in Zion, the city whose builder and maker is God. I walk with the Spirit of God and I’m constantly transported by Him into the glorious and higher realms of life, far removed from death, defeat, destruction, sickness, poverty, and failure. My eyes of understanding are enlightened; I see the invisible and I’m empowered to do the impossible.



## HIS SPIRITUAL CLOUD~18043

Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go (Nehemiah 9:12).

The opening verse brings to mind what happened to the children of Israel as they journeyed out of Egypt. The Bible tells us in Exodus 13:21-22, that they carried their own atmosphere through the wilderness for forty years.

Nehemiah also referenced this atmosphere of bliss in which the children of Israel lived. Nehemiah 9:21 (AMPC) says, “Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clouds did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.”

The Lord hasn’t changed. The Father’s loving-kindness didn’t end with the children of Israel; it’s even better with us today. When you were born again, you were born into God’s glory; born into God’s spiritual cloud; that’s the Holy Spirit. You live in His presence, in a divine atmosphere of joy, bliss and glory, where you’re nurtured by Him, absolutely independent of circumstances. You’re fully at rest.

Those who live outside this atmosphere of bliss are the ones who face disappointments, anger, frustration, and discomfort; always agitated from within because nothing seems to be going on right. 

But in Christ, which is the supernatural environment you were born into, your joy and satisfaction overflows. His presence in, with, and about you makes you an oasis of love in a troubled world. Be mindful of this always. There could be chaos or anarchy everywhere, but in Him, you’re at peace and in safety. Hallelujah!

DECLARATION
Dear Father, your presence in, with, and about me makes me an oasis of love and grace in a troubled world. I’m born from above; I live the heavenly life here on earth, nurtured by your divine love, and enwrapped in your kindness, glory and righteousness. Hallelujah!

The driving force behind every accomplishment is the intrinsic motivation to pursue goals, overcome obstacles, and fulfill aspirations. It's the burning desire within us that propels us forward, igniting our passion and determination to achieve greatness. Whether fueled by ambition, curiosity, or a sense of purpose, this driving force pushes us beyond our limits, inspires perseverance in the face of adversity, and fuels relentless pursuit of success. With unwavering commitment and unwavering dedication, the driving force within us empowers us to turn dreams into reality and create a meaningful impact on the world around us.



## PRAISE NIGHT 18
APRIL 14TH, 2024~18243

REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DSC DD

We are gathered today everywhere to honor Him, to give Him praise according to the scriptures

Psalm 147:1 KJV, 
Psalm 33:1 KJV

What does He mean by praise is comely? He means praise is customary for the upright, it's the custom of the upright to praise God. 

Praise is actually offering thankful homage to God. 
Hebrews 13:15 AMPC

Every Christian should be raised to have the custom, the culture of Praise. 
The only way you know what true praise is, is just what I shared with you and following what the scriptures tell us. 
Praise is a spiritual sacrifice. 

Psalm 69:30-31 AMPC
This spiritual sacrifice please God better than material sacrifices. 

1 Peter 2:5
The only way you know what is accepted by God is what He already said in His word.
You don't know that a sacrifice is accepted to God by your assumptions, you only know because He is said so. 

In the Old Testament, they just couldn't bring to God any sacrifice; you couldn't just say I rear camels and I am going to offer camels as a burnt offerings, He would not take that because He was specific as to what to be used as burnt offerings. 
He was specific, He told then what kind of animals to use, they couldn't just offer something because they had it. 

In the New Testament, He also specified for us what is True Praise. 
We are instructed in His word, informed and taught, and so we use what He's taught us to guide our spirits in offering acceptable sacrifices, spiritual sacrifices of praise to God. 

Lift up your hands and thank Him

LABOURING IN INTERCESSION

Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God (Colossians 4:12).

Some Christians are committed to interceding for others; they just know it’s their job to do so. We all should be that way, because God needs such people. It’s possible the reason you’re able to study the Word today like you’re doing right now is the dedication of such people. It could be the reason you’re growing in the things of God and standing in the faith today.

You may not know it, but many are Christians today because of someone else who laboured in intercession, praying fervently, for their lives. The Bible says woe to that man who is alone; when he falls, he has no one to lift him up (Ecclesiastes 4:10). It’s important we support and lift others through prayer.

This doesn’t mean you become “a prayer collector,” enlisting “prayer warriors”; the local Church takes care of that. It’s the Pastor’s responsibility to train the Church to pray for one another.

Those who were around the Apostle Paul, one of whom is Epaphras, understood this message. As read in our theme verse, Epaphras interceded for the Church, God’s people in Colossi, to come to maturity. How inspiring!

When you take up the ministry of intercession, you’re siding with God as a labourer in the Kingdom. You’re working with Him to improve and impact the lives of others. Hallelujah! Jesus said, “The harvest is plenty, but the labourers are few” (Matthew 9:37). He needs those who would labour in prayer like Epaphras for the souls of men. Be that man or woman that He’s found to stand in the gap, to pray for people to come to Christ, to pray for fellow Christians who are yet to come to maturity in the things of God, and also for ministers of the Gospel to fulfill their call and destinies in the Gospel.

ANYONE CAN PROPHECY

“For ye may all prophesy one by 
one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted” (1 Corinthians 14:31). He let us know that everyone of us can prophesy. But everybody who prophesies is not necessarily a prophet. To be a prophet, you have to be called into that ministry office. However, you can be given a prophetic utterance without being a prophet. That’s up to God; anybody can speak for Him when He enables them to. After all, He made a dumb ass speak. The gift of prophecy is for exhortation, comfort, and edification. Unlike the operation of the prophetic office, this utterance doesn’t necessarily have to do with a revelation or have a revelation behind it. In Romans 12:6 Paul says, “Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;” This means the one who prophesies should speak according to the proportion of faith. This kind of prophecy is a faith utterance; it’s quite different from the revelation-based utterance of a prophet. Another child of God can make a prophetic utterance to you and say, “Thus saith the Holy Ghost, I am with you; therefore, be strong my child.” He doesn’t have to have a vision or a special revelation of your situation to do that. But he has a Word of faith, and by faith, he declares that Word unto you. And while he’s doing that, he doesn’t have to act like something has come over him and he doesn’t know what’s happening to him. In using the gift of prophecy, you speak according to the proportion of faith. That’s why a minister of God can tell you, “You’re going to receive a special blessing this week!” Then he realizes he uttered the word by faith, and says, “That’s a prophecy; you’re going to get it!” He didn’t need to have any special revelation to say that. Glory to God!

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.

THE VALLEY OF DRY BONES

“The hand of the Lord was upon me, and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord, and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones, And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very dry. And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God, thou knowest” (Ezekiel 37:1-3). God took Ezekiel to a valley full of dry bones. There were dead men’s bones everywhere, as far as the eyes could see all over that open valley. And in Ezekiel’s description, the bones were very dry indeed. Then God asked Ezekiel a pointed question, “Can these bones live?” In other words, “Can things change here?” Ezekiel looked around and probably thought to himself, “It looks really bad here, I doubt that they can,” but he replied, “Well, Lord, Thou knowest!” He was telling God in other words, “You only know if they can live or not. It’s up to you to decide! If you want them to live, they’ll live. If you don’t want them to live, they won’t.” He threw the ball right back in God’s court! The Lord’s response was very instructive. He told him, “It’s not up to Me, Ezekiel; it’s up to you to do something about these bones and see to it that they live!” God then told him what to do. He said, “Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:” (Ezekiel 37:4-6). God told Ezekiel to prophesy to the bones and tell them, “Oh ye dry bones, hear the Word of the Lord. God’s going to cause breath to come into you and you shall live!” God was teaching Ezekiel how to change things through prophecy, and He taught him exactly what to say in his prophecy.

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day!

CHART YOUR COURSE WITH YOUR 
MOUTH!


The Bible says the captain of a great ship controls that massive ship with a small helm, and compares that helm to the tongue. It says though the tongue is a little member, it boasts great things (James 3:5). 

Put your tongue to work and let it bring forth great things in your life. As small as your tongue is, it’s the most powerful member in your body. Your tongue can take you either to heaven or to hell. It can make you rich or poor, put new clothes on your back or dress you up in rags. It all depends on how you use it. 

You see people in the streets, homeless and destitute—their tongues kept them there. It doesn’t matter how you got into the situation you’re in, you don’t have to stay there. Your tongue can stop you from receiving what you ought to have or bring it to you. It all depends on how you use it. Now if you don’t use your tongue at all, don’t think nothing will happen, something will still result from that. 

You know there’s no such thing as a clean piece of farmland waiting to be cultivated. If the farmer doesn’t sow something in the farm, it would grow something by itself, something unwanted—weeds. So when you say, “Whatever will be, will be,” that’s like you saying, “Well, I’ve cleared this piece of land, whatever can grow there should grow.” You can be sure what’s going to grow there won’t be nice. You can use your tongue to programme yourself for a successful, tremendous life or for a life full of grief and regrets. 

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.

SPEAK TO THAT SITUATION!

Like every great truth in the Kingdom of God that the Church should learn and walk in, prophesying to your future takes its root from the book of Genesis. When you study from Genesis chapter 1, you’ll read, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” (Genesis 1:1-2 ). Then it shows you something very powerful in the third verse: “And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.” God’s beautiful earth had became a chaotic mass, but the Spirit of God began to hover over (or incubate upon) the waters of the earth. 

Then God spoke up and said, “Let there be light!” and there was light! This was what God did to make the change He wanted—He spoke light into the darkness. Maybe there’s chaos in your life; it could be in your finances, your family, your job, business or academics. The Spirit of God can brood over that situation as you meditate on the Word.

Speak to that situation the outcome you want to have and the Spirit of God will swing into action to ensure you have what you say.



## TODAY'S INSPIRATION~18837

YOU ARE YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY

Why would a man grow and move forward only for his life to suddenly begin to spiral downwards and end up in a ditch. Don’t blame it on his family, society, economic forces, or the government. I’m not saying these are not influential, but they can only affect us to the extent that we let them. Your faith and knowledge of the Word will put you over them. 

The government of any nation should not dictate your prosperity, joy, happiness or success, because these things are not citizens of any particular country. Assuming you were fired from work, two years ago you didn’t dream you could be fired. You were doing well on the job. You did everything right and to the best of your ability, and yet you were fired. Now you’re wondering how you could have been responsible. Maybe you weren’t responsible for getting fired from your job, but you’re responsible for staying without one. 

It’s not what you’re faced with that’s the problem, it’s what you do with the situation. Your experience is not the important thing; what really matters is what you do with your experience. All right, you’ve been fired, what do you do now? Where do you go from here? Are you looking upward or downward? Do you think it’s all over or are you determined to do better and get greater? Where you go from here is what matters, and it’s all up to you. Are you going to sit at home and have people come to you and sympathize with you? 

When Abraham and Lot were about to separate, Lot chose the best part of the land for himself and left the parched part for Abraham. After he was gone, God spoke to Abraham and asked him to look to the north, south, east, and west; as far as his eyes could see, He had given to him, and that included all the land Lot greedily chose for himself! (Genesis 13:10-17). Are you going to think and see like Abraham, who God told that as far as his eyes could see was his, or are you going to continue wondering where to start? Yes, you’ve worked faithfully for that company all these years and you still can’t understand why they laid you off. 

But it’s time to quit wondering where you’re going to start from. Don’t see yourself going down, because if you do, you’ll surely go down. It’s time for you to start putting to work the things you’ve learnt in this book. It’s time for you to make your move! Prophesy your future. Locate the Word of God concerning you and speak it out. Speak forth the Word.

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.



## TODAY'S INSPIRATION~18859

MAKE YOUR MOVE

Is there something God has told you to do, or something in your heart you want to achieve? You must make a move! There are things God has declared concerning you; prophecies that have gone forth about your life, but they will not be fulfilled while you’re sitting down with folded arms. Decide today to do something about the dreams and visions that God has given you. As you pray in the Spirit, listen for the guidance of the Holy Ghost within you. As the Spirit ministers back to your spirit, you will be instructed on the particular step to take. When you receive that, you must act.

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.

ALL YOU NEED IS WITHIN YOU

Everything you need is inside you. All the capital you need is inside you. When you take a tiny orange seed in your hand, it has all the potentials to produce roots, a stem, branches, leaves and many orange fruits with many seeds in them. All you need to do is put that little seed in the right environment (the soil) and its potentials will be released. Just like that seed, everything you need to become the “you” that God has destined you to be is inside you. 

I say it all the time that I can never fail, I can never be sick or poor. It’s impossible; I just can’t. I know who I am; I’ve found my place; I’ve found my roots! You say, “Now you’re boasting, Pastor Chris.” Yes I am! I’m boasting in God’s Word, because I’ve found out His Word works. The Word of God is living and active. If you put the Word inside you, He’ll make you a master over circumstances of life. You will never live in fear or defeat anymore. With the Word inside you, there’s no telling how far you’ll go. All the limitations will be taken out of your life and your potentialities will be let loose.

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.

SPEAK RIGHT ABOUT YOURSELF

There’s a beautiful prayer of David in Psalm 16 that inspires me so much. David had such insight and revelation of God’s purpose for him, and it showed in the way he prayed and prophesied here: “Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. O my soul, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee; But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips. The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage” (Psalm 16:1-6). This is the way to pray. Hold your Bible before you and begin to prophesy these words about your life. Don’t ever be cast down. You’ll never find me cast down. You say, “Well, Pastor Chris, if I don’t ever see you cast down, that doesn’t mean you don’t get cast down sometimes.” The truth is that I don’t get cast down. It’s not just because I don’t want to (and of course, I don’t want to), but more than that, I can’t be cast down. You see, I’ve put God’s Word inside me so much that it’s just not possible for me to be cast down. What could it ever be that would make me feel dejected? I know the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places, and I have a goodly heritage. I’ve come to find out what God has done for me. He said He divided the land for an inheritance, and I found out the borders of my land have fallen in the choice parts. He has given me a good land; actually, He gave me the best; Hallelujah!

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.

Let the Holy Spirit Guide You

“And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him” (Joshua 6:3-5). 

The strategy given to Joshua was obviously strange (but supernatural), because no human mind would’ve thought of bringing down those walls through the mere sound of trumpets and the shout of weary men. But the walls miraculously came down because Joshua and the host of Israel acted on the instruction of the Holy Spirit. 

It’s sad that many Christians have had promises from God that they never enjoyed, and prophecies that never came to pass, just because they didn’t know what the Holy Ghost would have them do. When the Lord told Joshua, “I’ve given you the city; I’ve given you the king and all the men of valor there. I’ve given all into your hand,” Joshua could have shouted, “Wow, thank God, Jericho’s mine!” and just gone to sleep. The next day he would have woken up to see those walls looming as defiantly as ever, and he would have wondered, But God told me He had given the land into my hand; why can’t He bring to pass what He promised? That’s just like someone who says, “I thought God said the job was mine. I went there and they didn’t give me the employment letter; in fact, they threw me out!” Yours can be a different story. 

You can confidently declare God’s Word in faith and get the results you want, as long as you’re poised to follow the leading of the Spirit on that matter. To accomplish this, you need to fellowship with the Holy Spirit and find out the strategies to employ in order to have what you want.

Don’t Stop At The Prophecy, Turn Your Closet Into A Courtroom!

“And Elijah said unto Ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain” (1 Kings 
18:41). I’ve seen people who received anointed words just like this one but didn’t do what Elijah did. And when the prophecy they got didn’t come to pass, they wondered what had happened. Well, it didn’t come because they didn’t follow it up! 

Notice that Elijah didn’t stop at prophesying an abundance of rain; he did something more. He prayed! When King Ahab went up to eat and drink, Elijah didn’t join him to feast. Instead, he went to the top of Mount Carmel to pray. Though the prophetic word he’d received assured himthere’d be abundant rain, Elijah still went to pray. Remember, it wasn’t God who shut the heavens, so He wasn’t obliged to determine when to open it up. It was Elijah who prayed to shut the heavens, and now he had to pray with just as much intensity for the heavens to be opened. 

Many Christians often make the mistake of stopping at the prophecy instead of using the prophetic word to continue in prayer. Too many times, people have their desire just within reach and somehow still don’t get it. This is the reason someone may have the contract he bid for approved, without ever getting the approval letter. Then he begins to wonder what in the world happened. Yes, he heard the sound of the abundance of rain all right, but he didn’t follow-up with the right kind of prayer. This is where many stop and their dreams become stillborn. The prayer of petition is rendered with tenacity and strong purpose.

You don’t take “no” for an answer! If you don’t get a note of victory the first time you pray, it only means “Case Adjourned!” You can go back again to pray about it, just like a plaintiff goes to a higher court to appeal an unsatisfactory decision. Your prayer closet becomes a courtroom where you plead your case. And when you know you’ve gotten what you wanted, nothing in the world can take it from you!

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.

Principles Of The Prayer Of Faith (1)

1) THERE MUST BE A SPECIFIC DESIRE
 
Specific desire is paramount in the prayer of faith. Jesus said: “For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith” (Mark 11:23). 

Jesus emphasized the need for specificity of desire when we pray. Observe in the Scripture above that He didn’t say, “Whosoever shall say to any 
mountain,” but “Whosoever shall say to this mountain.” Thus, in the prayer of faith, it’s highly imperative that you have a clear and specific desire in your heart. You just can’t be vague in your communication. You can act on God’s Word in simplicity and faith and always expect results. 

If you’re a pastor, for example, and you wish to double the membership size of your church, you’ve got to know the exact number of people you have in church presently. So if you’ve got a fifty-member congregation at the moment, it means you’re expecting to have a hundred members at a set time. This is what it means to be specific! Or perhaps, you want an increase in your finances. Then you should ask such questions like: What is my average annual income currently? How much more do I want to receive in the coming year? Specificity is an essential principle if you must get effective results through the prayer of faith. Remember, Jesus said, “whosoever shall say unto this mountain.” That means you’re not going to be talking about the mountain, or telling God to do something about the mountain. You’re to address the mountain and tell it what to do; the content of your prayer must be directed towards your specific area of need, otherwise you may not get the desired outcome.

Praying According To The Will Of God

Another passage of Scripture that talks about ‘petition’ is 1 John 5:I4–15: “And this is the confidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.” 

Since praying according to the will of God is the key ingredient for success n the prayer of petition, it is important for us to understand exactly what it means to “ask according to God’s will.” 

Many Christians have assumed, mostly as a result of their misconception of the Scriptures, that the reason they didn’t receive answers to their prayers was because such prayers weren’t in line with God’s Will for them. They assume God didn’t want them to have what they were asking for. But this is an erroneous interpretation of God’s Word in the context of prayer. Let’s look at the Scripture again: Read: (1 John 5:14-15). 

Those who hold that mistaken notion that their prayers weren’t answered because they didn’t pray according to God’s will fail to understand that the Holy Spirit’s emphasis in this scripture isn’t primarily the consistency of their request with God’s will, but their exclusive privilege of having a hearing with God. Furthermore, when He tells us to ask according to God’s will, He isn’t talking about “WHAT” we ask for, but “HOW” we ask for it. In other words, the way and manner we present our petitions ought to be consistent with God’s stipulated pattern. It’s important to know, therefore, how to ask the Father according to His will for asking. Read: (John 16:23-24,26).
 
Jesus, at this instance, introduced the exclusive deal—the new, acceptable way of asking from God. When you make requests to the Father in Jesus’ Name, you’re actually functioning in Jesus’ stead. It’s as though Jesus were the one making that request. You know, some religious folks consider praying directly to the Father a sacrilege; they’d rather resort to intermediaries such as Mary, or the Apostles, or some “saint.” Some others think the best they can attain to is commune with Jesus, who will then intercede for them with God. But that’s exactly what Jesus said He won’t do: Read: (John 16:26-27). 
The Father doesn’t need anyone to plead with Him before He does something for you or grants your request. He loves you unconditionally! And all He wants is for you to ask according to His will—in the Name of Jesus— and it’s yours. His will for asking therefore is in the Name of Jesus. (For further teaching on praying in the Name of Jesus, get my book titled Praying The Right Way.)

Earnest, Heartfelt, Continued Prayer

“The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]” (James 5:16b AMP).
 
The prayer of petition is earnest, heartfelt and continued. Some Christians don’t understand earnestness in prayer, so they miss the benefits of its impact. To be earnest means to be intent and specific in purpose; to be zealous and fervent; marked by a deep feeling of conviction.
 
Thus, an earnest prayer is specific in purpose, filled with zeal and fervency, and marked by a deep feeling of conviction. It touches your heart and gets a hold of your emotions as you render it. Furthermore, it entails much persistence and continuance; that means you maintain your stance in a consistent manner and solemn attitude. This is the kind that makes tremendous power available; and such power is dynamic in its working; in other words, it works like dynamite.

The Prayer of Intercession!

The Holy Spirit has an intercessory ministry which He carries out through believers.But there’s also the intercessory ministry of the believer, which is quite different from the former. The Holy Spirit does carry out His intercessory ministry through you. The Lord may tell you to pray for someone or minister to someone by the leading of His Spirit. Sometimes, you may just be praying about personal issues and the Spirit of God suddenly begins to work within you, prompting you to intercede for an individual you never even planned to pray for. However, you don’t always have to wait for that prompting before you pray for others. As a child of God, you have a responsibility to intercede for others. 

You can decide by yourself to pray for someone without the Holy Spirit necessarily prodding you to do so. When you intercede for others this way and in accordance with the Word, it will be heard by God in just the same way as though the Holy Spirit inspired the words you spoke. It would just be as though the Holy Spirit Himself carried out that particular ministry. 

Through the prayer of intercession, God bestows on us opportunity, ability and inspiration to make great impacts in our world. He has set us on the earth in these extraordinary times for the purpose of changing lives. “if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise... from another place;...and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14).
 
Recognize that it’s your priestly responsibility to intercede for others, and it’s always a blessing to function in that office. Through prayer, we hold sway over satanic forces that seek to influence governments and nations for evil.
 
Circumstances move in favour of God’s plans and purposes for His people as they did for Deborah and Barak of old: they fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought on their behalf against their adversaries. Rules For Intercessory Prayer: 
1. You don’t intercede for yourself, because intercession is always for 
others. 
2. You can continue to pray about the same thing over and over again until the change comes.
 
In the prayer of intercession, your objective is to prevail on someone else to align with God’s will. You’re concentrating the influence of God’s power towards others for their good, and that requires some persistence in prayer. That means you must be willing to continue in prayer for as long as is required until you get that note of victory in your spirit and are certain that you have what you asked for, you don’t stop praying.

Don’t Become Callous, Intercede For Others!

You may have used the Word of God successfully in many areas of your life, but there’re people who are yet to walk in the reality of God’s blessing and God wants you to be of help to them. This is why you need to intercede. There’re many people who are hurting and if you can’t be touched by their suffering, you can’t be moved to pray for them.
 
Some Christians have become quite callous. The sinner’s condition doesn’t move them; the plights of the poor, the sick and the downtrodden don’t touch them. They say, “Well, it’s because they wouldn’t receive God’s Word.”
 
They’ve become so cold-hearted that it’s rare for the Holy Spirit to move them to pray for such people. Yet the Bible says of the Lord Jesus that He was touched with the feeling of our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15). Prayer, sometimes, is the response to the impression of the Spirit in our hearts, or the impression the circumstances of others makes on our hearts, which compels us to want to cause a change.
 
I remember the testimony of a young girl who had been retarded and imprisoned by juvenile arthritis. She could only move in a wheelchair and was kept in bed most of the time. The only thing she could move freely was her neck, as this evil disease had stiffened her body. She was taken to a healing service, and while in that meeting she wept and called on the Lord to heal her.
 
Some others saw her and began to pray for her too. As they interceded for her, she told the lady beside her she wanted to get up. Though her hands and legs felt very heavy and painful, she managed to stand up with help from those around her. They encouraged her to move her arms and legs, and, inspired by their faith, she took her first few gingerly steps. The congregation was very excited and they kept on praying for her and encouraging her. Her faith was strengthened, and she took firmer steps. Before long, she was running around the room.
 
Those people weren’t moved by pity but by the compassion of Jesus, and they interceded for her. There’s so much we can do and change if we’d learn to intercede for others.

Prophetic Prayer

Prophetic prayer refers to the prayer in which you speak the will and purpose of God into being by the divine inspiration of the Holy Spirit. 

When you worship the Lord in Spirit and in truth in the place of prayer, the Holy Spirit causes His Word to come forth from you with power and authority.
 
A classic example of prophetic prayer is Jonah’s prayer to God when he was in the belly of the fish. “Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly, And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice. For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple” (Jonah 2:1-4).
 
Jonah was as good as dead, but in his hour of desperation in the fish’s belly, he refused to give up. Instead, he called upon God, because he wanted to see His glory again. He wanted to see Jerusalem again, the city of the great King, where the temple of God was.
 
Jonah understood perfectly what he was doing. He was in a terribly hopeless situation, but then he prophesied: “I will look again toward thy holy temple!”
 
This is prophetic prayer, and it’s important for the believer to pray this way. In prophetic prayer, you put to work the gift of prophecy by which you speak forth the mind of the Father. You speak the will of God into being by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, and it becomes.

TRAVAILING IN PRAYER

My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you (Galatians 4:19).

In the 3rd chapter of Paul’s epistle to the Galatian Christians, he calls out their outright repudiation of the message of faith. They had left the simple message of grace in Christ to keeping the Law of Moses in order to be justified. Having learnt that they had accepted the teachings of false teachers, Paul chided them, “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth” (Galatians 3:1).

There’re some like that in the church today; they started well but went on listening to wrong doctrines and were misled. They became argumentative, confrontational, disorderly, rude and unruly in the house of God, and some even stopped fellowship with the church altogether.

When you have a brother or sister in the Lord or a whole family disobeying the truth of God’s Word, obstinate, and walking contrary to the instructions of the Spirit, it’s because the spirit of foolishness has taken over their minds; thus, it’s time to travail in birth again until Christ is formed in them, as Paul the Apostle did.

Why did Paul have to travail in birth again for the Galatians? He travailed in birth previously, by which they came to Christ. He determined to do so again now that they were falling away from the truth. This travail in birth is intercessory prayers that leads to salvation and deliverance of one who’s lost or fallen out of the way.

That’s what you do for such people; you pray again and again, in intercession and fasting—that the Christ-life gains the ascendancy in them, and they be fully yielded to, and established in God’s truth and righteousness.

The words “travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you” show that the life of Christ wasn’t being manifested in them; they had become worldly, living on the wrong information that was destroying their faith. So, learn to pray fervently in the spirit for new converts and new members in the churches of Christ around the world. Pray that they’ll increase in the knowledge and revelation of Christ, and be established in the faith through the ministry of the Word and the Holy Spirit, fulfilling their purpose and leading others to Christ.

Also, pray for those who may be facing difficult times and persecutions, or wavering in their faith, that they be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man, rooted and grounded in love, pleasing Him in all things, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

CONTINUE IN PRAYER

Pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17).

There’re certain situations you may face and all you have to do is pray once, and that’s it. But there’re other situations that call for persistence in prayer. The Word of God teaches us about different kinds of prayers and what rules apply to them.

For example, when dealing with things about other people, especially when it has to do with their wrong choices and beliefs, you don’t just pray once and go away. You continue in prayer, interceding for them, rebuking the adversary that’s deceiving them. You have to repeatedly mount pressure against the adversary until he lets go and there’s a change.

There’s so much evil going on in the world today and the plan of the enemy is to set up the world of the antichrist before the time. But we have to prevent that. The Bible says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available. We will keep pressing in the spirit, overturning the decrees and activities of darkness.

God has never thought, and doesn’t think, Satan is a problem, because He gave us authority over demons and the powers of darkness. The problem, for the most part, has been that some of God’s children focused more on personal gains instead of the faith to save men. Our world would surely be a better place if we would focus more on the souls of men in fervent prayers, intercessions, supplications, giving of thanks and preaching the Word.

That’s what He charged us to do, and He told us the outcome and why we should do it: “I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth” (1 Timothy 2:1-4). Follow the Word and pray like this.

Jesus said, “men ought always to pray, and not to faint” (Luke 18:1). If we’d follow the order and pray as the Spirit indicates, we’d take this whole world for Jesus Christ. Glory to God!

A PEOPLE OF PROPHECY

God’s people are a people of prophecy. God called us out by prophecy, builds us up by prophecy, sends us out by prophecy, and blesses us so much through prophecy. This is why prophecy is such an important subject in the Kingdom of God and in this book I’ll be teaching you how prophecy affects your life—indeed how it has affected your life up to this point and is already shaping your future.
 
I’ll also be showing you how you can take advantage of this powerful gift of prophecy given you by God to create the kind of future you want to have.
 
You’d learn in this timely book that your future is not just in your hands but in your mouth, and it’s up to you to speak it into existence. You’ll discover that your mouth has been fashioned by God as the compass of your life; you can use it rightly and arrive in the future of your dreams.
 
I hope that not only would you read but you’d also receive into your spirit all I share with you in this book about prophecy, and begin to consciously and consistently order the course of your life and your future in the direction you want through the power of prophecy.

Foretelling And Forth-telling

I said in my introduction that God’s people are a people of prophecy. We are made by prophecy, but a lot of us don’t understand what prophecy really is.
 
When I say we are a people of prophecy, it’s the same as saying we are a people of promise. In Romans 9:8 Paul said, “They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.”
 
What the promise refers to here is the Word. Now, the prophecy I’m talking about is the prophecy of the Word, and it has a two-fold application: foretelling and forth-telling.
 
“Foretelling” is not the same as fortune-telling, palm-reading, star-gazing, crystal-gazing or zodiac sign reading. To foretell, according to the scriptures, means to tell ahead of time things in the mind of God concerning a person or people, places or events.
 
“Forth-telling,” on the other hand, means to speak forth, tell out or tell forward what is in the mind of God. It’s the declaration of events in the mind of God or the declaration of a particular Word from God to an individual, people, place, or event for a particular time.
 
Prophecy, therefore, is in two categories. The one category is the ministry of a prophet, while the other is the use of the gift of prophecy, which is given to any believer who has the Holy Spirit, as the Spirit wills

CARING FOR YOUR BACK

Amongst other functions, your back provides support, movement and flexibility for the body. The back is a large structure descending from the back of the neck to the top of the buttocks. It’s easy to strain your back because it does so much for you, and a little pain in the back can cause a lot of discomfort. That makes it imperative for you to always take care of your back. Here are a few tips to help.

1. Lift Correctly: When lifting objects, (a) Eye-weigh the object; get help if it is too heavy. (b) Stand close to the object and bend from your knees–not the waist. (c) Gently turn around with the load, rather than twist, as you lift, and (d) Stand upright holding the object.

2. Sleep Right: Reduce pressure on your back by sleeping on your side, not on your stomach or back. Invest in a supportive mattress and pillows, especially ones that promote correct neck and back alignment.

3. Stretch Out: Stretch to keep back and neck muscles active and flexible and also reduce the risk of back injuries.

4. Exercise: Walking, biking, swimming, and several gym routines help to avert back pains, etc. The best back exercise routines should combine stretching, strengthening and aerobics.

5. Work Smart: Keep a healthy, ergonomically sound workspace. Set up work tools and equipment to meet your functionality. Invest in a work chair that supports your lower back. Take short breaks often so you can stand and stretch, as staying in one position for a protracted period stiffens back muscles.

6. Maintain a Healthy Weight: Being overweight or obese may cause strain on the back. So, this is one more healthy reason to consciously watch your Lifestyle choices, as this impacts your weight.

7. Stay Hydrated: Drinking a lot of water aids tissue elasticity and flexibility, while dehydration causes the spinal disc to shrink and leads to backache and other conditions.

8. Pay Attention: Never play down back pain, it tends to worsen over time if ignored. Don’t exert too much pressure on your back, and don’t self-medicate to relieve symptoms.

9. Maintain the Correct Posture Always: While walking, maintain an upright stance. Use a good chair to support your back and lower spine when seated, and keep mobile devices at eye level to reduce neck and back stress.

10. Be Cautious: Avoid twisting your torso when mopping or vacuuming. Sit on a small stool or kneel while cleaning lower bathroom fittings. Take frequent breaks when bending for a task.

MASTERING SPINAL HEALTH: FIVE ESSENTIAL PRACTICES FOR A PAIN-FREE BACK

Maintaining a healthy spine is essential for overall well-being, yet it often requires conscious effort and attention to various aspects of daily life. From sleep habits to footwear choices, each decision can impact the health of your spine. Here are five essential tips to support a healthy spine and alleviate discomfort.

1. Ensure Your Spine Rests Properly During Sleep: Give your spine the chance to rejuvenate by investing in a supportive mattress and pillows. Opt for a firm or medium-firm mattress to maintain spinal alignment, and consider using pillows strategically—under the knees for back sleepers or between the knees for side sleepers—to reduce strain and promote comfort.

2. Strengthen Your Core Muscles: The muscles in your lower back and abdomen play a crucial role in supporting your spine. Incorporate core-strengthening exercises into your routine to alleviate pressure on your lower back. Consult with a healthcare professional to determine which exercises are suitable for you, and explore various options to find what works best.

3. Choose Supportive Footwear: The shoes you wear impact the alignment of your spine, especially during activities like walking. Opt for shoes that provide adequate support and fit snugly around the heel to prevent excessive rolling of the foot.

4. Reap the Benefits of Massage Therapy: Regular massages offer therapeutic benefits such as improved blood circulation, muscle relaxation, and stress relief. While professional massages are beneficial, investing in a massage chair at home can provide convenience and help reap some of the rewards of massage therapy.

5. Practice Ergonomic Sitting and Limit Prolonged Sitting: Sitting for extended periods can strain the discs in your lower spine, exacerbating back pain. Opt for an ergonomic office chair that supports the natural curves of your back and maintains good posture while seated. Additionally, take regular breaks to stretch and move around, minimizing the negative effects of prolonged sitting on spinal health.

By incorporating these simple yet effective strategies into your daily routine, you can promote spinal health and reduce the risk of discomfort and injury. Remember to listen to your body and make adjustments as needed, as even small changes can have a significant impact on the health of your spine over time.

BECAUSE JESUS LOVES YOU

Jesus healed all that were sick and the reason He did this was that He loved them. This very Scripture concerns you; He took your infirmities and bore your sicknesses.

Throughout the New Testament, God’s Word clearly shows us that sickness has no place in our lives. But some people, because of their inordinate craving for the care and sympathy of others, attribute all sorts of diseases to their bodies. Others base their lives on their feelings. Once they feel a headache, they say, “I have a fever.”

Others base their lives on their feelings. Once they feel a headache, they say, “I have a fever.” They always voice their feelings. They even become angry when you try to correct their careless utterances. This is really sad because they are walking contrary to God’s Word.

Jesus told a paralyzed man to rise up, pick up his bed and go home (John 5:8-9). The man could have remained in his bed saying, “That’s just what I can’t do; I’m sick and I can’t move.” But by faith, he received the Word of healing Jesus pronounced and was instantly made whole.

So many need the Lord in their lives today; they need help beyond what mortal men can do. This is why I’ve committed myself to telling the whole world that Jesus is still the same, and He still performs miracles. You don’t have to stay home feeling sorry for yourself, wondering when, how, and if you’ll ever be healed.

Hear this truth: the Creator is still alive and ready to heal you now! He wants you to see His blessings and then fill you with the Holy Spirit to enable you to lay claim to everything that’s rightfully yours in Christ Jesus. God wants you to live in health. He’s not only interested in your spiritual prosperity but also in your physical well-being.

The Bible also says in 3 John 1:2, “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.” God loves you and wants you to prosper. He wants you to prosper in your health just as you prosper in your spiritual life. He is concerned about you and He wants you to experience health today.

He wants to strengthen and bless you; that’s why He anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him (Acts 10:38). The last part of this Scripture lets us know it was God who sent Jesus Christ to do all that He did, and that included going about healing all that were oppressed by the devil.

From this, we can safely conclude that it couldn’t have been the same God who sent Jesus to heal the people that also afflicted them with sickness and disease. No, it’s the devil who makes people sick, but God makes them well. He gave Jesus the power and the ability to make you well. In fact, He made you well over 2,000 years ago. Now, you only need to accept what He’s done and walk in the light of it. When your light breaks forth, your health shall spring forth speedily (Isaiah 58:8). Hallelujah!

APPLES & A DOZEN ADVANTAGES
🍎🍏🍎🍏🍎🍏🍎🍏

The familiar expression “an apple a day keeps the doctor away” is not a myth or an exaggeration. Apples are super fruits, power-packed with various vitamins, dietary fibers, phytonutrients, antioxidants, flavonoids, and more. 

This sweet, edible fruit is greatly beneficial to the human body. There are many benefits of eating apples every day but we have highlighted a dozen of them for you.

1. Reduces the risk of diabetes: Apples are rich in soluble fibers that aid in fighting off oxygen-free radicals that cause diabetes and are key to blunting blood sugar swings.

2. A cure for irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: Apples can help regulate and in time, completely cure IBS symptoms, which include constipation, diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain.

3. Helps to detoxify the liver: In today’s world, we are constantly consuming or coming into contact with toxins. The liver’s primary function is to flush out these toxins and apples are great for detoxification due to the vitamins, minerals, and fiber it contains.

4. Aids in preventing cataracts: Some studies indicate that people who daily consume fruits containing antioxidants like apples are 15% less likely to develop a cataract.

5. Helps prevent hemorrhoids: Hemorrhoids are the result of swollen veins in the anal canal due to excessive pressure on the pelvic and rectal areas. Pregnant women are commonly at risk of this, but a daily intake of apples reduces the strain and effort.

6. Promotes weight loss: Apples are filling due to the high fiber content, so you fill up faster with fewer calories. The fiber stimulates bowel movement, which also aids in shedding that extra pound.

7. Promotes heart health: Apples contain soluble fiber that helps lower blood cholesterol levels and flavonoids that reduce blood pressure and lower the risk of stroke.

8. Helps fight asthma: Antioxidant-rich apples help protect lungs from oxidative damage. Also, some compounds in apples reduce airway inflammation and allergenic responses in your body.

9. Promotes healthy hair: Apples contain a compound called procyanidin B2, which stimulates hair growth as well as thickens the hair. This also alleviates male baldness and prevents hair loss.

10. Good for skin care: Raw apple pulp and apple cider vinegar can serve as an organic toner that aids in tightening facial skin and stimulating blood circulation to the skin surface. Apples also have collagen and elastin, which are great for flawless, youthful skin.

11. Prevents Cell Damage: Apples contain quercetin, an active phytonutrient that promotes cellular health. They also contain properties that can help prevent neurological defects.

12. Helps regulate the body’s immunity: Apple skin is rich in the antioxidant, quercetin, which can help regulate your immune system and reduce inflammation.

KEEPING HEALTHY LUNGS

You breathe in and breathe out. It’s intrinsic, so you do it without thought or hesitation. Most of the time, you take no note of your lungs that are always working hard to ill the body with much-needed oxygen. Like every other organ in the body, your lungs require care.

Protecting your lungs, keeping your lungs healthy, and maintaining optimal efficiency in lung function and capacity should be a part of your healthy lifestyle. Read on for tips.

Clean Your Environment
The state of health for your lungs depends on how much clean air is getting in. Consciously reduce or avoid exposure to toxic air such as secondhand smoke, exhaust from motor vehicles, etc. Take safety precautions if you work in an environment that exposes you to pollutants. Clean your home and make it a dust-free and smoke-free zone. Also, open windows often to increase ventilation and use natural cleaning products as much as possible.

Maintain Good Habits
Keep your hands clean by washing them regularly with water and soap to avoid infections. Eat fruits and vegetables to maintain and boost your immunity, and drink plenty of water.

Don’t Smoke
Smoking is very bad for your health and has been linked to most lung diseases, including cancer. Smokers inhale toxins that damage their lungs. This leads to increase in mucus secretion and makes it harder for the lungs to clean themselves. Eventually, this will cause the airways to become narrower, making breathing more difficult.

Exercise More
Regular exercise keeps your body in shape, and that includes your lungs. Exercise increases your heart rate, making your lungs work harder to take in more oxygen and feed your muscles. Exercising consistently will make your lungs stronger and more efficient.

Do Breathing Exercises
Most people only use a small portion of their lungs with regular shallow breaths from the chest. So, one exercise you can do for your lungs is to practice breathing deeply; this involves breathing from your stomach. Slowly inhale while deliberately expanding your belly, hold the breath and then slowly exhale by letting the chest fall. Try to balance the time of inhaling and exhaling, and you can improve lung capacity by increasing the length of this exercise. This exercise clears your lungs and allows more oxygen into your body, thus increasing lung capacity.

Watch Your Posture
The lungs are made of soft tissue and fold into only as much space as they’re allowed. Slouching compresses your lungs, so sit and stand taller to give your lungs more room to expand. Also practice leaning back in a chair and stretching your arms up often.

Laugh More
Laughter works well for your lungs. It’s an exercise that works your abdominal muscles and forces stale air out of the lungs, thus letting in more fresh air. Actively work on maintaining and improving your lungs’ functions. Like every other healthy practice, it’s the small things that make a big difference

HEALTHY EARS, HAPPY HEARING: TOP TIPS

Our ears are important for hearing and for augmenting our beauty, especially for women thus caring for your ears is very important. Hearing loss can be gradual and sudden in some cases, so here are ways to care for your ears:

• Studies have shown that teenagers and young adults worldwide are at risk for noise-induced hearing loss as a result of the unsafe use of audio devices. Follow the 60/60 rule which suggests you listen with headphones at no more than 60% volume for no more than 60 minutes a day if you like to enjoy music through headphones or earbuds. Earbuds are especially dangerous, as they fit directly next to the eardrum. If possible, opt for over-the-ear headphones. Don't forget that any loud music, not just music played through headphones, presents a risk for noise-induced hearing loss.

• The common use of cotton swabs to clean wax out of the ear canal is not advisable. A little bit of wax in your ears is not only normal, but it’s also important. The ears are self-cleaning organs, and wax stops dust and other harmful particles from entering the canal. Plus inserting anything inside your ear canals could risk damaging sensitive organs like your eardrum. If you have excess wax, you can clean around the canal with a damp towel—gently. You could also use an ear wax removal solution for a few nights. This softens the wax so that it will eventually flow out on its own.

• Excess moisture can allow bacteria to enter and attack the ear canal. This can cause some types of ear infections, which can be dangerous for your hearing ability. Ensure you gently towel-dry your ears after bathing or swimming. If you can feel the water in the ear, tilt your head to the side and tug lightly on the ear lobe to coax the water out.

• Exercise is also good for your ears. Cardio exercises like walking, running, or cycling gets the blood pumping to all parts of your body, including the ears. This helps the ears’ internal parts stay healthy and work to their maximum potential. Make sure to stay safe! When cycling, always wear a helmet. If you fall and hit your head, a concussion can harm your hearing.

• Stress and anxiety have been linked to both temporary and permanent tinnitus (a phantom ringing in the ears). High levels of stress cause your body to go into fight or flight mode, which is an instinctual reaction that fills your body with adrenaline to help you either fight or flee from danger. This process puts a lot of pressure on your nerves, blood flow, body heat, and more. It's commonly thought that this pressure and stress can travel up into your inner ear and contribute to tinnitus symptoms.

10 FRUITS FOR HEALTHY LIVING

A healthy, balanced diet consists a variety of different food types that provide adequate nutrients necessary for good health. One type of food needed to maintain a healthy diet is fruits, which are rich in minerals and vitamins. Forget supplements and fancy superfoods, these ten fruits are power packed for a healthier you.

1. Peaches & nectarines: Two small peaches or nectarines have more potassium than one medium banana. Potassium boosts nerves and muscle health. The skins also provide a great source of antioxidants.

2. Pineapple: Regardless of how it's prepared or served, this tropical fruit is chock-full of bromelain, a powerful anti-inflammatory enzyme that reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

3. Grapes: A little grape bulb (preferably red/purple) contains potassium and iron, which help prevent cramps and anemia. Grapes are also proven to be heart healthy and help to prevent heart disease and lower cholesterol levels due to the large amounts of antioxidants like quercetin and resveratrol they contain.

4. Kiwi: This is a low-calorie, high fiber, easy snack that's great for weight loss. Loaded with vitamins C and E, kiwis help protect against cancer and improve optical health.

5. Mangoes: Mangoes are more popular than ever due to their high levels of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A to promote bone growth and a healthy immune system. Even more, mangoes have over fifty percent of daily vitamin C requirement.

6. Apples: Possibly the lightest on the calorie counter, apples make a great choice for weight watchers. They're also heavy on quercetin, which shield against brain cell degeneration and reduce risk of developing high blood pressure.

7. Pomegranates: As a beverage of choice, pomegranate juice contains at least twice the antioxidant capacity of red wine or green tea, and also sustains energy and controls blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and improves cardiovascular health.

8. Grapefruit: Orange is a great vitamin C source, but you want grapefruits because bigger is better. Half a grapefruit is a vitamin C powerhouse, and also has high levels of fiber, potassium, and vitamin A. Some studies suggest that grapefruit can alleviate the symptoms of arthritis and repair damaged or oily skin and hair.

9. Bananas: A banana makes the perfect grab and go snack, seeing as it's already wrapped. Its potassium and fiber content promote long-lasting energy and keep you alert all day long. Without the fat or salt, bananas are healthier than granola bars or pretzels.

10. Blueberries: Considered as superfoods, the blueberry's vitamin C, anthocyanin and other antioxidants help fight diseases and boost brainpower. According to research, people who eat more blueberries are less likely to develop macular degeneration in later years.

UNLOCKING VITALITY: THE POWER OF QUALITY SLEEP AND REST

For a truly amazing day where you feel so wonderful, full of energy, and mentally sound with no stress-inducing chronic illnesses, you have to sleep and rest.

The human body is an intricately designed marvel, capable of remarkable feats and productivity. Yet, amidst all its capabilities, it also requires periods of rest and rejuvenation to function optimally. Sleep, in particular, plays a crucial role in ensuring the body's vitality and overall health. Indeed, many health challenges stem from a lack of sufficient sleep, depriving the body of the opportunity to recharge and regenerate its cells effectively.

Moreover, sleep contributes significantly to mental faculties such as focus, memory retention, and mental acuity. There are instances when prioritizing sleep over late-night study sessions proves to be the wiser choice, as adequate rest ultimately enhances performance and productivity. Therefore, it's essential to plan ahead and organize tasks efficiently to avoid sacrificing sleep for last-minute endeavors, ensuring optimal performance in various endeavors.

While the recommended sleep duration is 6-8 hours per day for optimal health, achieving this consistently may pose challenges in today's fast-paced world. However, making sleep a priority most days is crucial for overall well-being. For individuals struggling with insomnia or difficulty falling asleep, there are often underlying reasons behind their sleep disturbances.

In such cases, two primary factors warrant consideration: the prompting of the Holy Spirit for prayer and the quality of one's sleep hygiene. Sleep hygiene encompasses various daily habits and practices that influence the quality of sleep. Improving sleep hygiene involves simple, yet impactful adjustments to daily routines.

firstly, it's advisable to avoid working in bed, as this helps the brain distinguish between work and rest environments, promoting better sleep onset. Additionally, maintaining consistent sleep schedules by sleeping and waking up at the same times each day reinforces the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, preventing disruptions that can lead to fatigue and sleep deprivation.

Furthermore, limiting caffeine intake, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime, aids in facilitating restful sleep. Short daytime naps, ideally lasting 20 minutes or less, can provide a quick energy boost without interfering with nighttime sleep patterns. However, excessive or prolonged napping can disrupt the sleep cycle, leading to grogginess upon waking.

Avoiding long-term use of sleeping pills is advisable, as they can create dependency and disrupt the body's natural sleep mechanisms. Addressing sources of stress and anxiety is also crucial, as these factors can contribute to insomnia and sleep disturbances. By cultivating a serene and stress-free environment, individuals can promote better sleep quality and overall well-being.

In essence, prioritizing adequate sleep and rest is essential for maintaining optimal physical and mental health. By adopting healthy sleep habits and addressing underlying factors affecting sleep quality, individuals can enjoy more energized, fulfilling, and productive lives.

MAINTAINING A STRESS-FREE LIFE

Stress is the body’s way of reacting to difficult situations. It is a state of tension that may have damaging mental, physical, and spiritual effects on a person.,

The symptoms vary on an individual basis and range from physiological to psychological. Daily life in today’s world is fraught with circumstances and activities that may cause stress, regardless of age, gender, or status. The workplace, however, is by far one of the most stress-inducing environments for many people. So, it is typical that the topic of reducing or eliminating stress is one for fierce debate and much discussion.

As God’s children, the Bible cautions that we should be anxious for nothing (Philippians 4:6). The following tips will go a long way to helping you enjoy the peace that the Lord has granted you and maintain a stress-free life.

• Make God’s Word paramount: When God’s Word is your focus, you’ll keep calm and stay in control in tense situations. You have an excellent spirit and function in the dominion of our Lord Jesus. Being consistently conscious of these truths will negate stress. Even when you receive negative feedback, God’s wisdom will give you the right outlook and propel you to greater levels of excellence.

• Worship the Lord in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs: Music is a powerful relaxant. When paired with lyrics exalting God, it becomes doubly effective. As you praise the Lord with songs of the Spirit every day, you apprehend the “bigness” of the One in charge. In worship, you submit to His Lordship over you and all the matters making you worry become insignificant and easy to deal with.

• Don’t stress yourself: Sometimes, stress can be self-imposed. The realization that you have more to do should not cause you to impose unrealistic schedules upon yourself. This would most likely force you to burn the candle at both ends and impact your health negatively. Rather, objectively assess what needs to be done and create tenable plans that will ensure better performance in the future.

• Act or respond, don’t react: You may not control what others do or say, but you are in control of your actions and responses. Knowing this, focus on what you can control. This will help you take reasoned, corresponding actions and reduce the stress that comes from feeling helpless or powerless. When you get worked up about what others think, say, or do, you tend to be less creative.

• Manage interruptions: Persistent interruptions at work can fray tempers, slow the creative process, and induce stress. Because you need most of these interactions to get the work done, plan for them. You can create time slots in your daily schedule for consulting with others, use noise-canceling headphones to discourage idle chatter, and so on. Find a plan that works best for you.

• Schedule breaks throughout the day: Walk, stretch, or do breathing exercises. Staying on the same task for too long increases tension, so learn to divert your attention and energy to other things at intervals. When you feel stressed or come out of a tense meeting, take a minute to pull in deep breaths to restore calm and balance.

• Eat right and sleep well: A good night’s sleep and good food positively affect outlook, temperament, and confidence in myriad ways. Intentionally observe a regular sleep cycle and adhere to a healthy and balanced diet to eradicate stress.

The Lord has given you all things to have and enjoy. Let nothing make you fret or stress or panic. Relax and remember that in all things, we are more than conquerors through Him who loves us.

YOU CAN CHANGE IT THROUGH PROPHECY~18667

Prophecy is the spoken Word of God; it is the revealed Word of God by which He leads and guides His people. The man who prophesies speaks with the ability of God’s Spirit. When God said in Joel 2:28, “Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,” He meant that everybody in the Kingdom will have this ability of God to prophesy, to speak forth God’s Word and cause it to come to pass. We’ll all be able to bring about changes that will affect our lives and the lives of others around us positively. What power, what great knowledge this is! How exciting to know you’re not at the mercy of life’s circumstances. If the life you have is not appealing to you, you can change it. You can control your destiny by the power of God made available to you through prophecy!

PROPHECY AND TONGUES~18681

In verses 3 and 4 of 1 Corinthians 14, Paul went on to say “He that prophesieth speaketh unto men to 
edification, and exhortation, and comfort. He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.” When you speak in other tongues you edify your spirit. It doesn’t edify others because they don’t know what you’re talking about. Paul actually said later in verse 11, “Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.” However, the one who prophesies edifies the Church, and Paul encourages us in verse 12: “Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.” Paul was saying in other words, “Seek that you may excel in prophecy,” because the one who prophesies edifies the Church.

Prophecy is very important; it edifies the Church. And if it edifies the Church, it will edify you because you’re a part of the Church. When you’re prophesying, you’re doing it in your understanding, and by that I mean you’re speaking in a language you understand. That way, those listening to you are blessed because they can hear you and understand what you’re saying. You’re blessed too because you also understand what you’re saying. Now, the Bible says if you speak in other tongues (that is, if you have a message from God to His people in other tongues), you can pray and ask Him for the interpretation, because when you speak in other tongues and also interpret, that equals prophecy. God’s people will then be blessed by your words of prophecy. 

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.

Chart A New Course For Your Life, Prophecy!

Every time you speak about your life or your future, you’re actually prophesying. The only problem is you may have been a “false prophet.” Romans 3:4 says, “God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.” So if God has said something about you and you’ve been saying something else, then you’ve been lying. You’ve made yourself a false prophet over your own life! For instance, if God has said you’re a new creature (2 Corinthians 5:17) and your path is as the shining light, that shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect day (Proverbs 4:18), and you say, “I don’t feel like one, I don’t think I am. I think I need to be born again all over again. I don’t understand my life anymore. My future looks so bleak and hopeless. I’m not living; I’m merely existing,” then you’re lying. You’ve made yourself into a false prophet. I wish you would understand the power of prophecy. Did you know that from that “zero point” where you are, you can chart a new course for your life and determine your future through words of power? Yes, you can! You can prophesy about your life and declare the future you want to have from now. You might feel like the most neglected person on the face of the earth. You may be all alone in your room, crying because you feel like everything has gone bad. In the midst of your tears, you can begin to prophesy to yourself and say, “Thus saith the Lord unto you, I am with you, son. I am your Shepherd; therefore, you shall not want!” You may be in pain, but you call your name and declare to yourself, “You’re coming out of this pain in the Name of Jesus. I prophesy to you, you’re coming out of this!” Hallelujah! 

Many times we’re waiting on somebody to utter a word for us to be blessed, but we’re the children of the Word, and the Word concerning us has already been given. You don’t have to wait for someone else to come and declare that to you. You can tell it to yourself. That’s the way I’ve been talking all these years and that is all I have experienced, no ups-and-downs, just the upward and forward life. Glory to God! 

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.

TALK MORE THAN YOU EAT

You talked yourself to the place you’re in right now and you can talk your way forward from here. Your mouth was given to you to say what you want in your life. Stop talking about the things you see in the physical; they won’t change that way. Say what you want instead! When you say what you want, you’re functioning rightly and using your mouth for the purpose for which it was designed. 

In Romans 10:10 Paul declares that “With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” This means that with your mouth, you make the “confessions” (in Greek, this is “Homologia” which means “saying the same things as God”) that catapult you into salvation. That’s how to enjoy the benefits of righteousness. It’s all in your mouth!

With your mouth, you catapult yourself into that position that you’ve seen in your spirit. This is a spiritual principle in the Kingdom of God. If you want to move from point A to point B, you’re going to have to talk yourself there. You’ve got to keep saying it. In fact, you’ve got to “talk” more than you eat and drink! 

I told you your mouth wasn’t given you just for eating, drinking, and talking to and about other people. Use it to talk your future. Keep talking and let no one stop you. Keep on declaring who you are in Christ Jesus. You may have been denied promotion or some benefits that were due you in your office. Don’t worry. The Bible says promotion doesn’t come from the east, west or south; it comes from God (Psalm 75:6). What you’re going to do is talk yourself to the top! Use your mouth, for that’s where the miracle is. It may be in the night time or during the day; you may be at work or in your home, it makes no difference; just make sure you’re talking.

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day

When you hear a word of prophecy that concerns you, you should do what Daniel did. Israel was in captivity and Daniel had been fasting and praying for their freedom. As he studied the scrolls of the Prophet Jeremiah, he found out that the time of Israel’s deliverance had come, yet there was no deliverance. So he set himself to pray. You have to set yourself to pray in order to bring those prophecies into reality. 

As you pray in the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of God will guide you into knowing the set time for their fulfilment. This doesn’t mean that the times you pray in the Spirit are the only times He guides you. It just means that your spirit becomes very sensitive and easily picks up signals transmitted from God’s frequency at such times. He can let you know, “This is the time for that word!” and when you get that signal, you’ve got to act, because if you don’t act, you may lose it! Don’t say, “Oh God, bring it to pass.” No! Understand God’s ways. The Psalmist said the children of Israel knew the acts of God but Moses knew the ways of God (Psalm 103:7). What I’m teaching right now is one of the ways of God.

Stay Blessed, Stay Happy and Enjoy a blissful Day.

KINDLY SAY THESE WORDS OUT LOUD~18717

Dear Father, I thank You for my new life in Christ; Your divine nature in me has made me a master over circumstances, with dominion over the systems of this world. I serve You always with joy unspeakable and full of glory, unencumbered by sin or reproach! Thank You for making me righteous, holy and irreproachable in Your sight. You've made all grace, every favour and earthly blessing come to me in abundance; therefore, I’m self-sufficient.

I was born into an incorruptible, inexhaustible inheritance. Christ is in me, and He’s my all! With Him, I have all things. Thank You precious Holy Spirit for being my peculiar atmosphere and advantage in life; You’ve made my life very different and beautiful. I rule and dominate my world with the atmosphere of joy, peace, success and victory.

Daily, as I speak in tongues, the grace to prophesy comes on me strong; I declare that the wisdom of God and His glory are evident in my life and in all that I do. His righteousness is established in the hearts of men around the world; and through the truth of the Gospel, salvation, healing and health, prosperity and success, deliverance, wholeness, preservation, peace and joy spread in the nations of the earth, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

SPEAK IN OTHER TONGUES NOW



## RHEMAFORTODAY MAY 19TH~18761

Say these after me, ‘God has granted me favour, peace, and ensuring fruitfulness, prosperity, and productivity in every area of my life! Everything in my world conforms with God’s will and destiny for me. The Father has counted me faithful to commit unto me the ministry of reconciliation. I am chosen and anointed by the Holy Spirit to preach the Gospel with power and impact my world with His divine presence. I have the supernatural wisdom and ability to always do things right the first time.

The grace for perfection is at work in me, as I diligently carry out the responsibilities which have been committed to me. I refuse to be quiet about the Gospel, for it is the power of God unto salvation. That power is released to turn men from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God as I proclaim the Gospel today. Hallelujah! I am full of God’s might; for Christ, the embodiment of all knowledge, wisdom, and power is alive and exalted in me, working and touching lives through me! Hallelujah!

I’m continually filled with the Spirit to be effective in the ministry of the Gospel, communicating God’s divine presence to my world and bringing in a great haul of souls to the Kingdom, I live the higher life in Christ; I walk in absolute victory and dominion over this world! I live above, reign over, and subdue life’s circumstances and situations, to the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal King of glory. Hallelujah!



## PROPELLED BY WISDOM~18779

The Word of God is the wisdom of God. It makes no difference how educated you are, how many books you’ve read, or what you think you know in life, or about life; if you don’t have the Word in you, you can’t function in the wisdom of God. All you’d have is the wisdom of men, and the wisdom of men can only take you so far because of its limitations. The wisdom of God is what takes you all the way, so that’s what you need. With wisdom, you have it made.

With wisdom, you’re set up for a life of endless victories and unlimited possibilities, where the miraculous becomes your daily experience.

For example, in Exodus 14:16, God instructed Moses saying, “Lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.”

This was the wisdom of God in action; this beats human imagination. The wisdom of man can’t accept that anyone could divide the sea, the Red Sea at that, with a mere rod; but this was God’s science. He knew it would work. He wasn’t ‘trying’ to perform a miracle. In fact, He instructed Moses to do it, and Moses acted on His Word and it produced results.

Again, the Lord Jesus says that the believer will lay hands on the sick and have them recover (Mark 16:18). Sickness is usually inside the body, not outside. How then do you touch somebody on the outside to repair what is broken inside? There’s no scientific explanation that makes this possible. Only God, in His infinite wisdom, can direct power for healing through contact.

2 Corinthians 5:17 says, “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”
Now that you’re in Christ, you have a new culture: the Christ culture. Until you let this reality dominate every aspect of your life, you’ll live like an ordinary person and not experience the sublime blessings of the life in Christ. You would still get sick when you ought to walk in divine health and you might be broke when you should be thriving in abundance.

“The LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding” (Proverbs 2:6). You can’t be more successful than the level of wisdom that you have in you. As a Christian, it’s important how you think and what you think about.

You’re not of this world; therefore, you shouldn’t think like an ordinary person. Because your spirit is recreated, you should only think the Word-way. God’s Word must form the basis for the thoughts you process and allow.

Through God’s Word, wisdom is not only imparted to your spirit, it is also increased. As you meditate on the Word, your mind is programmed to think accordingly. You’ll begin to talk differently and act in line with your confessions of faith.

You’ll always be glad about your decisions and choices because you’re propelled by wisdom to be in the center of God’s will all the time. The Word of God is the only material that can energize you for success, position you for greatness, and sustain you in the transcendent life.

Tune in to  daily to hear God’s undiluted Word concerning you. Go for the Word; go for wisdom today!



## RESPOND WITH THE WORD~18796

The sower soweth the word. And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts (Mark 4:14-15).

Matthew 13:1-23, Mark 4:1-20, and Luke 8:4-15 record a simple story Jesus used to illustrate and teach spiritual lessons: the parable of the sower. In explaining the parable, Jesus said the seeds that fell by the wayside represented those who hear the Word of God and don’t understand it. Thus, Satan comes immediately and steals the Word from their hearts (Mark 4:14-15).

This means Satan is watching out for the Word. When the Word of God comes to you, Satan comes also. Recall that the first time the Word of God came to Jesus openly, Satan came also. In Matthew 3:17, God said from heaven, “this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”

Immediately, Satan also came and tempted Jesus, saying, “If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread” (Matthew 4:3).

He challenged the Word that came to Jesus. but Jesus responded with the Word, saying, “It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4). He affirmed scriptures back to Satan.

When the Word comes to you about the glory or the power of God for your life and future, receive it with your spirit, and through meditation, drive it deep into your heart. Refuse to allow Satan to steal or take the Word away from you; he will try. He’ll throw his darts at you like missiles. But do what Jesus did; respond with the Word!

The Word of God in your mouth is the sword of the Spirit that cuts the adversary in pieces and discomfits his agenda, stratagems and manoeuvres. Hallelujah!

DECLARATION
Dear Father, by your Spirit, I have an accurate understanding of the Word and apply it rightly to produce results in my life, family, ministry and all that concerns me. I hear and receive the Word into my heart with faith, meekness and gladness for it to take root in me and produce the fruits of what it talks about, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.



## DAILY INSPIRATIONAL~18904

How to get the best out of our daily inspirations:

Spend some time to speak in tongues, building up yourself on your most holy faith* (Jude 1:20). 

Study the inspiration for the day, write down your thoughts and share with others too


Use Your Evidence

According to Hebrews 11:1, faith is “the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” The prayer of faith thus requires you to use the evidence you’ve got. But you must be able to recognize that evidence before you can use it. You see, hope is a great virtue; it’s a fundamental spiritual principle that arrays the magnificent future. But faith is the substance of things hoped for; it’s the evidence that substantiates the future. 

If you had a piece of land, for instance, and you were told to prove your ownership of it, would you set out to move the property from it's location to show anyone making an enquiry about the house? Of course, you wouldn’t! In fact, you can’t. What you’d simply do is to produce the title deed to the property. In the Amplified Bible, faith is defined as “the assurance (the confirmation, THE TITLE DEED) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see \{and\} the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses]” (Hebrews 11:1). Now, when you seek to effect changes through the prayer of faith, you must be spiritually alert to recognize the evidence the Holy Spirit is bringing to your awareness.

Sometimes, you’d have a note of victory in your inner-man through a word of prophecy. The word may not necessarily come from someone else; the Holy Spirit can simply put the utterance in your mouth as you pray, or bring a song to your spirit that causes great rejoicing within you. Never let go of such words, for they’re the evidence of your victory. Meditate on them; talk them; be bold to let others know you’ve gotten it, and act the same way. 

If perhaps you’ve been sick, and you’ve prayed to be healed, you need to look inside you for the evidence of your healing. Study the Word of God and find out what He has said about your peculiar situation today. When you’ve located the evidence, use it!



## 5 CONSEQUENCES OF LAZINESS~18943

A direct consequence of laziness mentioned in the Bible
is poverty (Prov. 10:4).


The lazy person' needs remain unmet due to their inaction (Prov. 20:4).

## IRON-RICH DIETS: VITAL FOR HEALTH~19206

One of the most common issues with many meals that we eat is the very little iron they provide. Most of the time, when we choose our meals, we choose what we feel like eating or what we enjoy eating the most.

However we choose to do it, it’s important that we consider iron and this is because iron is responsible for helping the body carry oxygen to all organs. Iron is the crucial element the body uses to make the molecule haemoglobin, whose sole responsibility is to do just that. When the body doesn’t have enough iron, the person starts experiencing symptoms such as inability to focus, dizziness, constant tiredness, weakness and sometimes even breathlessness. If left unattended, it can even progress to heart failure.

Women particularly need to get good at taking enough iron for two reasons:

1. Monthly menstruation causes the body to lose blood frequently predisposing them to anaemia, low haemoglobin and low iron

2. Pregnancy increases the body’s demand for iron because now there are at least two people that need sufficient iron.

Here are things you can do to maintain good iron levels in your body: Ensure your diet is rich in iron: Red meat is a good source but rather, eat lean meat because of cholesterol levels. Other fantastic sources include beans, nuts, green leafy vegetables like spinach, dried fruits, beetroot, eggs, fish, sweet potatoes, etc.

Steer away from a “toast and tea diet”. You can have toast and tea but don’t make this meal your staple because the caffeine in tea and coffee and the bran in the bread don’t allow the body to absorb iron properly

If you can’t include enough iron in your diet and/or you feel any of the symptoms mentioned, you can use supplements. Iron supplements often come in combination with folate which is also very important for preventing anaemia.

This is especially important for all pregnant women and women who can’t sufficiently make up for menstrual losses. Keep making healthy food choices!

## 10 HEALTH BENEFITS OF TOMATOES~19220

Whether you consider the tomato a fruit or vegetable, the fact remains that it is a great addition to any meal.

With an extensive list of essential vitamins and minerals contained in them, tomatoes are loaded with many health benefits. Some key nutrients found in tomatoes include lycopene, calcium, potassium, and vitamins A, B, C & K. Tomatoes are also a good source of dietary fiber and contain about four percent carbohydrates.

Available in about 3,000 species that are ready to eat and easy to cook in multiple ways, this superfood adds flavor and great advantages to any meal. 
Let’s look at a few.

1. Your Skin Looks Greater: Your skin needs collagen for strength and elasticity, and also for replacing damaged cells. Biotin and Vitamin C in tomatoes enhance the production of various proteins, including collagen. Tomatoes also have lycopene, which protects the skin against damage from the sun.

2. Your Hair Gets Healthier: Taking tomato juice regularly will make your hair better by improving its texture and appearance. Its rich composition of iron and Vitamins A and K strengthens and revitalizes the hair, maintains its color, and adds shine.

3. Your Weight Stays Controlled: Low in fats and with zero cholesterol, tomatoes are ideal for weight control plans. Tomatoes can be eaten raw or added to other meals, and the stomach fills up faster with fewer calories because of the water and fiber in them.

4. Your Bones Become Stronger: Tomatoes contain calcium and Vitamin K that strengthen and repair the bones, as well as magnesium which works with a hormone called calcitonin to help the bones absorb calcium and potassium, thus preventing calcium loss over time.

5. Your Eyes See Better: Tomatoes are a rich source of Vitamins A & C, lycopene, lutein, and beta-carotene. 
These are powerful antioxidants that protect the eyes against light damage, cataracts, night blindness, and age-related macular degeneration.

6. You Sleep Better: Some studies show that increased levels of lycopene and Vitamin C in tomatoes promote better sleep. That means a salad with tomatoes or even tomato juice or soup may be just what you need if you haven’t been sleeping properly.

7. Your Heart Works Better: Tomatoes have Vitamin B and potassium which help to flush sodium from the blood, reduce cholesterol, and lower blood pressure. Also, properties like lycopene and Vitamins A & C work together to reduce the risk of stroke and heart disease.

8. Your Glucose Levels Are Optimized: Elevated blood sugar levels affect vital organs like the brain and kidneys. Tomatoes contain little carbohydrates and will help lower glucose levels in the blood. This also helps to prevent diabetes.

9. Reduces Risk of Cancer: Cooked tomatoes produce a high amount of lycopene, an antioxidant that slows the growth of cancerous cells. More lycopene works to reduce the risk of lung, colon, prostate, and stomach cancer.

10. You Strengthen Your Immune System: Tomatoes help to boost the body’s immunity levels. The vitamins and antioxidants work to reduce stress and increase energy levels. Eating more tomatoes will help prevent or manage various ailments like gallstones, urinary tract infections, anemia, Alzheimer’s disease, etc.

## FLU-PROOF GUIDE TO NAVIGATING THE COLD WEATHER~19237

It’s getting colder outside, so it’s time to break out the sweaters and turn on the heat where necessary. As the temperatures drop, staying as warm and dry as possible becomes a major priority to help counter the effects of the weather on one’s body. Eating a warm breakfast, taking hot showers, or wearing sturdy shoes in cold weather make the difference between toasty comfort and shivering discomfort.

Below are some proactive steps to help you stay warm and flush with health throughout the seasons.

• TAKE COVER: Dress for the weather by laying up your lovely outfits with cardigans, coats, hats, mittens, or a scarf when outside. Sturdy boots and other covered footwear will keep your feet warm and dry during this period, especially when caught in an unexpected downpour. It’s also handy to always have an umbrella with you.

• WARM SHOWERS ARE GOOD FOR YOU: A warm shower brings instant warmth and cheer when it’s cold. The steam allows the body to reach its average temperature while opening nasal passages and removing germs or bacteria. Don’t make the water too hot to avoid dry skin and hair breakage.

• EAT A BALANCED DIET: Warm homemade meals are always the best choice, so try as much as you can to avoid fast foods and unhealthy snacks this season. Consuming balanced and nutritious meals is essential, as they give your body all the support it needs to stay warm and fight off infections. Make your meals and snack time more colorful this season by increasing your quota of veggies and fruits, especially those packed with vitamins C and D. They are not only delicious but also great at boosting the immune system and quite effective against harmful bacteria. Also, consider adding more soups to your meals. Broths are a quick fix with great nutritional value that keeps you warm, hydrated, and sated. Chicken soup is particularly beneficial during cold weather and can quickly reduce upper respiratory infection symptoms.

• STAY HYDRATED: Water is called the nectar of life for a reason. Staying hydrated is essential because cold weather dries up the sinuses and narrows your blood vessels. Drink at least, six to eight glasses of water daily, even if you’re not thirsty. Doing so keeps the skin, nails, and hair hydrated, and also helps the organs work properly.

• REGULATE AIR-CONDITIONED ROOMS: To avoid lowering core body temperatures, regulate your air-conditioned room temperature to between 64 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (17 to 24 degrees Celsius) before you enter.

• CLEAN YOUR COMMUNICATION DEVICES REGULARLY: Many microorganisms can stay on the surface of your digital devices for up to 8 hours, and some can survive longer. Your phone, computer, keyboard, and ear pods need more cleaning than usual this season, so clean them at least once a day with disinfectant wipes; do it more frequently if you can.

• STAY ACTIVE: Intentionally find ways to exercise in warm spaces during this period. It will help you keep warm and boost your immune system by quickening the circulation of white blood cells that fight off the common cold and other infections. Exercising will also improve your mood and help burn up some calories from all that healthy food you may consume. You’re all set! But always be conscious that eternal life is at work in you, and you radiate divine health at all times.

## Pray-A-Thon 2024 - Fri Jun 14~19309

We have an important commission in this world, and it is to reconcile men to God. Learn more in this Friday's Rhapsody. Visit  

Acts 26:16-18 says, 'rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness... To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me'.

Habakkuk 2:14 says, 'For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea'.

At our times of prayer today, we'll pray fervidly in tongues of the Spirit, interceding earnestly for the unsaved around the world, that their hearts be opened to the gospel and they receive salvation in Christ; also declare that the earth is being filled with the knowledge of God's glory as the waters cover the sea. Hallelujah, Amen.



## SMILING ALWAYS: REASONS AND BENEFITS~19336

When you approach someone and they break out a welcoming smile, you will most likely respond with a smile of your own. That simple expression of joy and gladness is an invitation to a pleasant encounter and productive experience. 

Your smile is not just an expression, it is also a vent for the innate joy and life-giving light of God in you. With it, you dispense hope to the weary as you broadcast the assurance of triumph over all circumstances through faith in Christ Jesus.

Amidst the pressures and busyness of daily life, however, the desire to smile or laugh may become lost. Making a conscious effort to smile and laugh often should become a habit and consistent practice for you.

Here are some reasons to smile more.

• You are beloved and esteemed. God loves and values you highly. You are so important to Him that He sacrificed His only begotten son for you. Now, the Lord is determined that you enjoy perfect health, absolute safety, and peaceful prosperity. What is there to frown about when all things are working together for your good? • You have the code for perpetual victory. God’s Word is the sound code necessary for your triumph over all situations and circumstances you may face. As you meditate on the Scriptures day and night, the knowledge and revelations in your spirit will etch an indelible smile on your face every time. Wielding your smile always will yield myriad physiological and psychological benefits.

• Smiling triggers happy hormones and alleviates stress: 

When you smile, your face flexes muscles that release endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin – neurotransmitters that help you feel happier and reduce stress, while also dispensing happiness to all who come in contact with you.

• Smiling lowers blood pressure and the risk of heart disease, and strengthens immunity. 

Smiling improves heart rate and regulates blood pressure, thus lowering the risk of developing heart disease. One way to deal with high blood pressure is to smile and laugh more often. Take your mind off worrying issues and focus on your blessings.

• Smiling makes you attractive and slows ageing. 

Smiling negates worry and the wrinkles that come with it, causing one to look younger. It also causes an increase in the body’s production of HGH (an anti-ageing hormone). Moreover, smiling makes your face more attractive and can be as therapeutic as a massage or anti-ageing facial at a five-star spa. So, smile today and save yourself some bucks.

• Smiling reduces pain. 

Endorphins released when you smile contain moderate pain-relieving properties and act as a natural painkiller when you’re injured. Also, endorphins strengthen your body’s immunity. Think happy thoughts and find your smile to help alleviate pain and increase your capacity to endure.

• Smiling strengthens bonds and deepens relationships. 

People who smile a lot are more likable and more approachable. They tend to attract friendship from others, inspire confidence, and generally form better relationships. Smiling promotes the feeling of acceptance, enhances teamwork, promotes group bonding, and diffuses conflict.

• Enhances performance and productivity. 

Smiling can increase your productivity by boosting confidence in your ability to fulfill assigned tasks and diffusing pressure. Smiling can be a ‘creative thinking exercise’ because it creates a positive mood that makes you better at problem-solving. A more jovial team leader, for instance, can rally teammates and help them deliver assigned tasks optimally.

Practice Smiling

A simple way to get into the habit of smiling every time is to remember how much God loves you, the vast inheritances He has bequeathed to you, and the countless testimonies of His goodness in your life. Go ahead, smile right now, and keep at it from now on.

’S PROCLAMATIONS

He is in my feet! He's all over me! It is not possible for my blood to be infected, because that same Spirit causes divine vitalization in my body!

I declare that the presence of that same Spirit within me causes every disease germ that tries to get in my body to die, and pass out of my system! There is a disease destroying force at work in my physical body. It makes no difference how the sickness tries to get in, that Spirit burns up every trace of sickness! No infection can stay in my body! No tumor can successfully grow in my body!

## DON’T LOOK AT SCREENS IN THE DARK~19383

Every day, you are surrounded by amazing technology that enables you to work, learn, play, and connect with others in ways that were once impossible. This has led to new ways of living, working, and earning, and the possibilities are endless. However, with the advent of a technology-driven world with digital screens everywhere, gazing at them excessively has become a norm.

From using mobile devices and laptops/ desktops, looking at screens while walking to watching the news or your favorite movies on TV, and staring at LED screens on various gadgets and devices, the average person spends about seven hours looking at screens. This average gets to as much as 15 hours daily for gamers, creatives, administrators, programmers, CCTV operators, and others who need computers for work.

Digital devices emit blue light, a high-energy light that can be harmful to the eyes with prolonged exposure, and has been known to cause dry eyes, blurry vision, teary or watery eyes, migraine headaches, anxiety, and even loss of vision. Additionally, blue light exposure suppresses the production of melatonin – the hormone that regulates sleep cycles – and may cause poor sleep patterns and increase the risk of conditions like obesity, heart disease, stroke, and depression.

The harmful effects of exposure to blue light are multiplied when it happens in the dark. Some studies show that staring at your phone in the dark for as little as 30 minutes may cause irreversible macular degeneration. So, while it’s convenient to use your phone under the sheets or create an ambiance with the lights off or dimmed as you watch TV late at night, one must be mindful of what effects these choices may have on the body.

Avoid using screens in dark places as much as possible, and consider these tips to help you reduce screen time overall.

• Set reminders to give your eyes a break. Practice the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look away from all screens and focus on an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This helps to refresh the eyes and improve focus. You can set reminders on your devices for this exercise every day. Another exercise is to learn to blink often. This lubricates and cleans your eyes with tears, and protects against bright light, dust, and other irritants.

• Tone down the glare: Nearly all communications devices have an in-built adaptive brightness feature that automatically reduces the intensity of light it emits, depending on the amount of light in the environment. You can also use the blue light filter or eye protection setting to reduce blue light emission and eye strain.

• Use blue-light-blocking glasses and/or screen protectors: These filter out harmful blue light while allowing other wavelengths to pass through. By wearing these glasses or applying a screen protector, you reduce your exposure to blue light and protect your eyes.

• Use Nighttime Settings: Nowadays, many electronic devices also have a “night mode” option that reduces blue light at the set time, thus protecting your eyes from potential damage and promoting better sleep. Stay away from all digital devices (computers, cell phones, etc.) at least one hour before bedtime.

• Keep A Healthy Distance: For all screens, maintain an efficient distance that is comfortable for your eyes. For instance, consider keeping your mobile device at arm’s length and place your computer at an angle that makes you look downward to see it.

• Work in a well-lit room: Forcing your eyes to constantly adjust to varying degrees of brightness can cause strain. By properly lighting up the room, you eliminate that discomfort and prevent eye fatigue.

Also, remember to continuously speak God’s Word to your body. Drink a lot of water, eat healthy, and exercise. These work wonders for your overall health and your eyes.

## CAN THE DEAD SEE AND SEND SIGNS AND MESSAGES TO THE LIVING?~19398

QUESTION:
GIFT FROM SOUTH AFRICA ASKS:
Dear Pastor,
I want to know if dead people see what is happening to their loved ones on earth- if they are watching over us, and if they can send a sign or message to the living?

PASTOR CHRIS ANSWERS:
Well, it depends on where they (dead people) are. They are not in the cemetery; their bodies are in the cemetery or anywhere else where they were left buried in the sand or something. But, when a man dies, depending on the life he lived- toward God or toward Satan, in other words, did he know Jesus? did he have eternal life? was he a child of God? was he born again? - that will determine whether he goes to God or he goes to hell. Is he going to heaven or is he going to hell? So, the dead must be somewhere; heaven or in hell! 

Now, there are some who are roaming around awaiting their movement, howbeit it’s temporary. That’s where you talk about ghosts and so on and so forth, but they can’t hang around for too long! For how long? We can’t tell because they are over in the spirit realm where time is not the same as what we’ve got here. So, such people may do some things that those in the earth can be influenced by and say “well, I think a ghost or I saw a ghost”, or something happened and then they think it’s a ghost. Ghosts are real! The Bible shows us they are real. But do they try to contact the living? Of course! Those ghosts who are moving around, who have not been taken to their final place of abode try to make contact because they are yet to understand that they have passed over to the other realm, and so they are trying and it’s not working, until they are taken away to heaven or to hell.

If you’ve listened to certain people who passed out of their bodies, they say they tried to talk to someone because they could see their bodies. They didn’t feel like they lost something and they tried to make contact. Now, does that mean that, maybe, someone is trying to contact you, so you make yourself available so you can contact the dead? The Bible tells us it’s wrong! In the Old Testament, God specifically warned the children of Israel to not make efforts to contact the dead. He says it’s wrong, don’t do it! Saul, the King of Israel did it and he got into trouble for it. God doesn’t want His children doing it.

How can a man that didn’t know the future tell you the future after he has died? Don’t think he’s going to help you. Don’t expect help from someone who has died: it’s not going to happen. He doesn’t know the future. What about the angels, do angels even know the future? They don’t! The only future you know is the future revealed to you, and you don’t have to die to have that revelation. Jesus said when the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall show you things to come, so, why not depend on the Holy Spirit instead hoping that somehow, SOMEONE WHO HAS DIED WOULD TELL YOU SOME SECRET THINGS. HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING! He only knows those things he knew before. So that’s very important! Don’t be deceived by the dead.

There’s another thing- what about those who say that they actually had a revelation: they saw in a dream their father, their grandfather, their mother or so and so spoke to them? Make no mistakes about it; there are manifestations of the Holy Spirit in which He ministers to us in different ways. He can use the face of your pastor to talk to you, He can use the face of a brother or sister to bring you a message, a word. He does such things and He could also talk to you through the voice and the face of someone who has passed on to glory- he can do it. He is eternity. He’s not restricted! BUT HERE IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO LEARN: don’t try to make contact with the dead. Don’t do it! And everything you hear whether from a living person or from one that’s dead, the Bible says, even if an angel came to preach to you another gospel, he says let him be accursed! Don’t accept it! Which means, no matter what you hear from living or dead, CHECK UP WITH THE SCRIPTURES, WITH



## GATHER IN THE FRAGMENTS THAT NOTHING BE WASTED: RETENTION
PASTOR VALE ODU THOMAS~19407

1. Acts 2 : 47
1. One person that comes to your Church was added by God. 

2. 1 + 1 = 2 when the other one at the beginning remains. 
Growth is a result of retention. You must be responsible for new comers to deliver them to the Lord.
Growth is a direct result of your capacity to retain those who come to you.
John 15: 1 
Ensure that everybody that comes to You stays.
The scripture that talks about Son of perdition has been fulfilled. There wont be another one.

Compare the list of First Timers to the actual population of the Church...

If you Gather all the fragments, you will need an overflow.
Retention starts from the way you receive the people. We will keep everybody that walks through our doors.
From the first time, you prepare for them to stay. Prepare to keep them. That is where retention starts from. Who prays for them? No matter who calls them out, Pray for them.

Timing of the Visitation: if you visit me earlier than i expect, I am valuable to You.
What you do with them is very important. It must not be more than 36 hours. 
Who visits is very important.
The communication in that first visit is very important.

THE ADVANTAGES OF INTRODUCING THEM TO OUR STRUCTURES

1. Get them into our structures as quickly as possible. Let them kearn the things we do.
 SCHOOL: First class of foundation school changed my life.

3. Put them in a cell. The initiation into the Cell ministry is a family, a support system. Let them be groomed and raised . In a cell they suddenly acquire so much value. 

Purposely get them to change friends by putting them in an activity department.

RETURNING FIRST TIMERS
Dont pay casual attention to first timers.
1. Welcome them and give opportunity for salvation.
2. Fill them with the Holy Ghost. Otherwise thwy will go back to rhe way they were before thwy came foe your meeting.

3. Give them a physical material to stay with them for studies. Somerhing they can interract with beyond you..eg ROR. HtTN magazines
4. A definite person to be praying for them on a daily basis and to deliver them to the next cell meeting.
5. Hand them to Somebody that must be responsible enough to bring them back to Church.
All these will make them committed.



## MY LIFE IS FRUITFUL AT ALL TIMES…~19508

Say these with me, ‘There are blessings (untold blessings) all about me. I receive good things into my life today in the Name of Jesus! The right people are coming into my world today. I’ve got the ideas, the finances, and the personnel that are consistent with the life that God has called me to live. I am in God’s place for my life, my life is like a well-watered garden; I am fruitful and productive always, and at all times.



## LEARN HOW TO ARGUE 
-Pastor TT TEMISAN~19514

In preparing for a successful marriage as a single, you must learn & train yourself in the art of arguing. 

In marriage, arguments MUST happen. Unfortunately, arguments destroy relationships. So it's important to know how to argue in order to help & grow your relationship in marriage healthier & better. 

In every argument in a marriage, there are always 2 sides to it. It is extremely important to actually really listen to your spouse. This is respect. Everybody needs & requires to be respected. Respect breeds love & harmony. Always give it.

2. Never raise your voice. Even in the heat or passion of an argument, don't raise your voice. Don't try, deliberately or unknowingly, to intimidate your spouse. Don't use shouting or screaming or threats (direct or indirect) or ultimatums to win arguments. Remember this: You don't have to win an argument. Don't win an argument & lose your love. You've ultimately lost.

3. Always be conscious of this fact: You might be wrong. In life & in your opinions, you're not perfect. You won't always be right. You will sometimes be wrong. It's OK to be wrong & it's very important to admit it when you're wrong. Being right in an argument is a trophy; it isn't winning the Olympics. 

4. Don't gloat over winning an argument. Also, don't sulk because you didn't win the argument. Actually, I don't like the words "win" & "lose" in an argument with my spouse. Because the purpose of the argument wasn't about whose opinion is right or wrong. The purpose of the argument was & is to agree on the best decision for the advancement of our family & relationship. It doesn't have to be my opinion & if my opinion isn't good enough, whatever we conclude is still a win for me.

SO LEARN HOW TO ARGUE. KNOW HOW TO ARGUE. ARGUMENTS ARE HEALTHY AND GOOD FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP & YOUR FAMILY. 
ARGUMENTS ARE NOT A NEGATIVE. THEY CAN BE VERY HELPFUL. 
SO LEARN HOW TO ARGUE.



## SAY THIS WITH ME~19522

## JOY OVERLOW~19570

KEEP THE JOY ON!

1 Thessalonians 5:16; Rejoice alwys...

Philippians 3:1; Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord...


Understand that the devil (and all that he represents—sin, sickness, poverty, failure, death, etc.) has been defeated; so nothing he throws at you can stand against you successfully! The Bible says, “Without having seen Him, you love Him; though you do not [even] now see Him, you believe in Him and exult and thrill with inexpressible and glorious (triumphant, heavenly) joy” (1 Peter 1:8 AMPC). Refuse to allow anything make you sad; practice ‘laughing sessions.’ Don’t wait for a comedian to make you laugh; draw joy from your spirit, and rejoice each day of the beautiful life God has given you. Have you laughed today? Take out 5 minutes, go somewhere quiet and just laugh! Laugh your way through whatever challenges into your desired miracles.


SAY THIS
Dear Father, thank you for filling my life with your joy. I declare that the joy of the Lord is my strength, and that your joy daily fills my spirit so much that I burst forth in great rejoicing. Thank you for filling my heart with gladness and my mouth with singing.

I belong to Christ; therefore, I am the seed of Abraham and an heir according to the promise.

I am Christ's extension in the earth, His outstretched arm to a hurting world. 

I unveil His blessings and dispense His goodness, wisdom and love;  I am His light in a dark world. Hallelujah!

## Pastors Prayer Segment at The Communion Service~19707

Did you know God wants to bless? See, when you read the Bible, you'd be amazed at what you find. He has such a desire to do something extraordinary in your life. He desires to. You will get to find out at the healing streams. But there's something special today that's already working.

Did you know there's a grace at work, a special grace at work, right now? Something has been released in your life, a special grace. 

What you do is you thank Him for it. Thank Him for it. You are right now, right this moment functioning in an increased grace for your life. It’s working right now in your life. 

Thank Him for it. It’s working in your life right now.
It's working in you. It's working through you. It's working for you. 

Open your mouth and your heart and thank Him. Thank Him. Thank Him. Thank Him. 

Thank you Lord for this grace in which I stand right now, this grace in which I function right now. 
Thank you for this increased grace. 

Something that had been difficult for you before, now will be overcome easily. Now will be achieved easily. Something you need a solution for, now you can have it. It's easier now. With this greater grace, greater grace. 

It comes with ability, comes with speed, comes with favour, comes with power. Greater understanding, greater knowledge, greater wisdom.



## TODAY'S DECLARATION: TUESDAY 9TH JULY~19718

I’m a new creature in Christ Jesus, with the life and nature of God! I have the resurrection life.

I’m not the redeemed, I’m not the delivered; I’m a brand new man that never existed before, living the transcendent life of the Spirit. Blessed be God!

I affirm that the Lord is exalted and glorified in me today. His righteousness is revealed in and through me! 

The Word of God has increased my faith; I have a strong and prevailing faith.

Nothing is impossible unto me, and no level of success, victory and progress are unattainable for me because I live by faith in the Word.

I am energized for victory and positioned for the supernatural life by the Spirit of God!

I am a minister of reconciliation, and I am anointed to propagate the Gospel of God’s power with all fervour and dedication.

I am not slothful in this great commission but aglow, burning with the zeal of the Spirit to fulfil this great cause. 

By the ability of the Spirit, I labour, striving according to the working of His power that works within me mightily. 

I am excelling in every area of my life because the competence and excellence by which I function are by the Spirit.

At all times, my spirit is sensitive to God’s voice, and I am able to discern His voice and counsel to me because I am His sheep.

The ways of the Spirit have been manifested unto me, and I am guided from within and through the Word to know and walk in the paths of life.

I affirm the Lord has granted me the ability to speak words and create the kind of life that I desire. 

I declare that I function in supernatural prosperity and progress, I walk in divine health; I dwell continually in peace and safety. 

The Lord has granted me the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him; the eyes of my understanding are flooded with light to know and walk in His perfect will.

I have skill, discernment, rare understanding, and function with the spirit of excellence. 

I’m making progress by the Word, triumphing over adversities by the power of the resurrected Christ. Glory to God. Hallelujah!



## Lifestyle Of Gratitude~19770

Dear Father, thank You for the honour You’ve placed on my life. Thank You for Your grace, Your love, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit! I never lose sight of the truth of Your Word and who You’ve made me in Christ. My words are inspiring; I’m excellent in my communication, everywhere and every time. Thank You for setting up Your Kingdom in my heart. With my heart, I envision and apprehend the realities of the Gospel and of our Kingdom-life. Thank You for the glorious life You’ve given me.



## THE WORD ON MY LIPS~19809

God has put me in charge and control; I am winning every day. I’ve been called and chosen of the Lord. None of my steps shall slide; for my path is illuminated with the light of God’s Word. I do not lack direction. Life is at work in me. I’m full of life; my entire being is inundated with divine life and energy. I’ve passed from death unto life. I am the glory of God, a life-giver, and a dispenser of eternal verities! I am seated with Christ in the place of authority; far above all principality, power, might, dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come.



## TODAY’S INSPIRATION~19822

How to get the best out of our daily inspirations:


Spend some time to speak in tongues, building up yourself on your most holy faith (Jude 1:20). 


Study the inspiration for the day, write down your thoughts and share with others too


BE SPECIFIC!!
Hannah was specific in her request to God. She didn’t just ask for a child. She specifically asked for a son (1 Samuel 1:11). This was how she got her miracle. It’s wonderful to know that many years of barrenness didn’t becloud her mind; she knew exactly what she wanted. 

You must be specific in your desire. That’s the only way to get your miracle. Never be vague before God. Remember He is there listening to you and He is ready to fulfill your heart’s desire. 
 
Enjoy a most joyful day!
