My body is the temple of the Holy Ghost; God functions in it and I am its custodian. Therefore, my body conforms to my faith-filled affirmations. Body, you are not permitted to accommodate weakness, sickness, disease, or infirmity. You function for God. You are the tabernacle of the Holy Ghost. You are under obligation to respond to the Word of God. I command every fiber, every bone, and every cell of this body to comply with the Word of God. I live in Christ; therefore, I cannot be affected by the rules and corrupting influences of this earthly realm. I am from above and I live above all things in this world and its failing systems. I walk in righteousness and dominion, and I am conscious of the provisions of my divine life in Christ. This life is working in every fiber of my being, every cell of my blood, and in every bone of my body, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet!

I know my divine origin; I’m from Zion, the city of the living God. Therefore, I cannot be subject to the principles of this world’s system. I am a heavenly citizen, seated together with Christ in the heavenly realms! Therefore, I affirm that the power of the Word and the Spirit is working effectually in me today and always. This power destroys infirmity, and renders inoperative, ineffective, and useless the plans of the devil concerning my life and health. I act on the Word of God continually, causing circumstances to conform to His expectations for my life. I’ve got the life of God in me, and I win for Him always.

I’m the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus! Sin, sickness, disease, and poverty are under my dominion! I reign over them because I’m superior to this world, its systems, and the vagaries of nature! There’s no death, defeat or failure in my path because I live by the law of the Spirit of life, in Christ Jesus. I am the light of the world; there’s no darkness in my life! The law of the Spirit of life is working in me. There is no death in any area of my life or body. I’m full of joy, peace, love, and kindness. I’m continually filled with the Spirit of God. The Spirit of Him that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in me and He gives life to my physical body. I’ll never be sick in my life.

I am one with divinity and I have eternal life coursing through my being, as a result of this oneness. Therefore, no sickness, diseases or infirmity can stay in my body. I’m living a successful, healthy and victorious life because I’m one with God’s Spirit and death has no association with me. I refuse to be affected or limited by contrary forces around me. Daily, my body is quickened to do the impossible; it is energized to do the spectacular, and invigorated for an endless stream of the miraculous in the matchless Name of Jesus. Amen

You only respond to the Word of God and all that it says about you.

My body and everything connected to me align with God’s provisions. Christ’s glory is manifested in my body as I flourish in divine health every day.

Therefore, by the power and authority in the Name of Jesus, I reign in this life over all forms of evil.

The Lord has made me His prosperity hoarding, my prosperity is appearing for all to see. 

I am well-decorated financially. I am not of this world; I am from above! I am from the wealthiest family and I have an inexhaustible inheritance in Christ Jesus. I am connected to an endless stream of prosperity, riches, and glory. I am seated with Christ in the realms of power and glory; far above all principality, power, might and every domain of darkness! I can never be broke because I am an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ! The life of God is at work in me, in every fibre of my being, in every cell of my blood, and in every bone of my body. My whole being is immune to death, decay, and the corrupting influences of the world. Every day of my life is full of God’s glory, beauty, excellence, and grace. Every day God loads me with great benefits. In His favor my horn is exalted. Eternity is alive in me. 

I live above infirmities and the harsh elements of this world because the One who lives in me is greater than he that’s in this world. I’ve been brought into life and immortality. I’m fearless, for death has been paralysed—defeated by Jesus, and when He did it, I was in Him! I boldly exercise my divine rights in Christ, taming my body and environment with my faith-filled confessions. No evil shall befall me. Nothing shall by any means hurt me because the Lord Almighty is my defense and fortress. I go out with joy, and I am led forth with peace, the mountains and the hills break forth before me into singing. I am an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ. I have been given access to the inexhaustible, unfathomable, riches of Christ. I affirm that I am a man of influence, in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Speak in tongues.

Sickness, disease and infirmity have no place in my body, for Jesus has taken my infirmities and borne my sicknesses in His body on the cross. By His stripes I was healed, and I remain healed today! Everyday when I wake up, I am full of life and vitality! My mind is alert! My body is alert, and full of strength.Hallelujah!

## CONFESSIONS~17090

I confess that I have overcome the world, sin and the devil because I am born of God. I have His very life in me and that makes me invincible and superhuman. The Bible declares concerning me in Psalms 82: 5, “I have said, ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most high”. Glory to God! He has called me a god! When God gives birth, He can only reproduce after His kind. I am not living an ordinary human life because I'm born again, and so sickness, disease and death of any kind can't find place in me because I am a product of God's Word! Hallelujah!



## CONFESSIONS~17107

I live in this world but I am from above. I am a citizen of Zion, the city of God, the land where sickness is a foreign experience. I do not get sick, just as chickens do not bark, and dogs do not fly. It has ceased to be an issue of whether I can get sick or not; I DO NOT GET SICK because gods do not get sick! Hallelujah!

The life of God is in me, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet. I live the supernatural life of Christ naturally. Therefore, sickness, failure, defeat and death are alien to me, because I do not operate as a mere man. I function from the high realm of the spirit, where anything is possible! I look at the world from the mountaintop! I see as God sees! I look with the eyes of faith. I see the problems that people go through but I am not a part of them because I have overcome the world! Hallelujah!



## CONFESSIONS~17141

I am a saint of God, sanctified
and separated from sickness, failure and death, and separated unto God, and the divine life! I live in the world, but I am not subject to the world. I carry my own atmosphere everywhere I go; an atmosphere of divine health, peace and prosperity! The presence of God with me makes the difference in me, and separates me from the problems of the world. Glory to God! I know who I am! I've found my place. I've discovered the glorious life that Christ has given me; a life of success and victory twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred and sixty-five days of the year, and three sixty-six on leap years! It's success, health and victory all the way, all my days! Thank you Jesus!

The Word of God has made me wise unto salvation, and the forces of success, prosperity, and divine health are let loose in my life. I can never be disadvantaged, for I am connected to the true Vine. I am the light of the world; the salt of the earth. I was called and chosen to give purpose and meaning to the lives of men and women in my world and in the regions beyond. I was born as the answer to the cry of many, and I am responding to that call by impacting my generation with the knowledge of Christ’s salvation. I recognize God’s divine ability, efficiency, and might that is at work in me today, and by virtue of the divine life of Christ in me, I forbid the enemy from functioning and perpetuating evil in my sphere of contact.
