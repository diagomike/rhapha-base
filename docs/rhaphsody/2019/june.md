## HE’S ACTIVE IN AND THROUGH YOU June 1st, 2019

***While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word (Acts 10:44\).***


Consider what we just read in Acts 10:44; while Peter was yet speaking, the Holy Ghost was “working”; He “fell” on them to whom Peter was speaking. He didn’t wait for Peter to finish, showing that we’re never alone and we can always trust Him to do His part, as we do ours.


In Mark 16:20, after the ascension of the Master, the Bible says the disciples *“…went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.”* Observe that He was with them, not as a passive observer, but was actively working, confirming their words with signs, wonders and miracles.


Each time you go out to preach the Gospel, be conscious of the Lord’s presence and His power that’s manifested through the preaching of the Word. It makes no difference whether you’re on street\-evangelism, or you’re preaching in a bus, in an office, or in a mall, be assured that the Holy Spirit is working with you and through you.


Therefore, be bold to preach the Gospel. Preach Jesus Christ. Preach that He came into the world to save sinners and make them sons of God. Let the unsaved around you know that God isn’t counting their sins against them; rather, He’s made provision for the remission of their sins.


The ministry of the Gospel He’s committed to your trust is a divine one, which you can only fulfil by the power of the Spirit. It doesn’t matter what your efforts are, they’re in vain without Him. That means you can’t do anything of eternal significance without the help of the Holy Spirit. In John 15:5, Jesus emphasized this, saying, *“…for without me ye can do nothing.”*


Don’t go through life or ministry struggling on your own; work with the Spirit. Discuss your work with Him; if there’re challenges, talk to Him about them and He’ll grant you the wisdom you need to put you over. Trust Him, and there’ll be nothing you can’t do; His power will work through you in a tremendous way.

## TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS GRACE June 2nd, 2019
![June 2nd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/june2.PNG)

***Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery (1 Timothy 4:14\).***


In the scripture above, the Apostle Paul gave an important admonition to young Timothy, to take advantage of the grace of God. He emphasised the same thought in 2 Timothy 2:1, saying, *“Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.”*


When God gives you a responsibility, He gives you the grace to accomplish the task. To neglect that grace or not to know that you have it could render your work ineffective. For example, if you’re called of God to be a pastor, there’s the grace for that office; it’s the pastoral grace. Once you recognise and acknowledge that you’re called into that office and graced for it as well, it’ll produce results for the glory of Christ, as you walk in that light.


Some people struggle and experience frustrations in ministry because they’re working and walking outside of God’s grace. Working with the Lord and for the Lord is a walk in glory when you lean on His grace to pilot you.


If you’re a pastor, an evangelist, cell leader or you lead in whatever capacity in the Church, and you’ve been experiencing difficulties carrying out that ministry, it’s time to take advantage of His grace. The gifts of God and the power of God work by the principle of recognition and proclamation (Philemon 1:6\). Recognise that His grace is on you to function in that office, and keep proclaiming accordingly. This is also true for everyone who is called of God to fulfil any specific or significant role in the Kingdom.


Even now, activate the grace and power of God in your life. Affirm in faith, “I’m graced to excel and fulfil my destiny in Christ. I’m sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency, and His superabundant grace upon my life is sufficient for me in all things. I’m an able minister of the Gospel, because the grace and wisdom of God are at work in me mightily, to carry out the work of the ministry, in the Name of the Lord Jesus”. Hallelujah!

## TRUST THE HOLY SPIRIT June 3rd, 2019

***And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever (John 14:16\).***


The Holy Spirit is God’s gift to us—the greatest blessing in our lives as Christians. He’s God at work in us. As Christians, we need Him to live victoriously in Christ. That’s why the Lord Jesus said, *“...I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter...”* (John 14:16\).


The Holy Spirit came to help you live the Christian life, because no ordinary person can live the Christian life. It also takes the Holy Spirit to give you the understanding of God’s Word, awaken you to the fatherhood of God, and, amongst other things, help you accept the truth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; God in flesh.


When Jesus asked His disciples, *“Whom do men say that I the son of man am?”* (Matthew 16:13\), Peter, by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, spoke correctly. He said, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.” The Master’s response to Peter was, *“…Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven”* (Matthew 16:17\).


Peter wasn’t guessing; the knowledge of who Jesus is was imparted to him by the Holy Spirit. Jesus said in John 16:13, *“Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth….”* Think of the Holy Spirit as the revealer or unveiler of the secrets, mysteries and realities of the Kingdom of God to our spirits. He makes heavenly materiality tangible to our spirits.


Even in preaching and ministering the Gospel to others, He’s the One who helps to bring the understanding of the message to those to whom we minister. But for Him, they’d never understand the message of the Gospel that we preach. We talk on the outside, but He confirms the words and grants them understanding on the inside.


Perhaps you’re a minister of the Gospel, don’t try to build the Church by your own strength; depend on the Holy Spirit. Take advantage of His glorious ministry in your life and you’ll never be stressed. He makes the job easy, and sees to it that you’re triumphant every day. Trust Him with your life, and He’ll manifest Himself in and through you.

## YOU CAN TALK TO ANYTHING June 4th, 2019

***For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith (Mark 11:23\).*** 


The words of Jesus above reveal that not only are our words potent and would come to pass, but you also can talk to anything; yes, ANYTHING! This is because all creation, living or non\-living, has intelligence. This is so clear in the Word of God. Jesus talked to the wind, and the sea (Mark 4:39\); and even talked to a tree (Mark 11:14\).


When you study the first chapter of Genesis, you’ll understand why everything has intelligence. In the third verse, the Bible says, “And God said….” Throughout the chapter, we find many instances where God gave the Word and everything He said came into existence and retained intelligence.


For example, when He commanded the water to bring forth fishes from the sea, the water retained that memory or programming and produced the fishes. Both the water and the fishes that came out of it were connected to the programming of God’s Word.


By talking to those elements, God communicated and programmed energy into them, and they retained it. So, as a child of God, when you speak, make sure what you say is in sync with the Word. Remember, your words are impregnated with power and authority. Hallelujah!


Speak to your body, your car, your business, the tools you work with, your furniture, and everything connected to you; they all have intelligence. Speak what you want to see, and what you want them to bring forth, and it shall be so. Use your mouth, your words, to chart your way and programme your life in excellence; from victory to victory, and from glory to glory.

## FAITH IS BASED ON THE WORD June 5th, 2019
![June 5th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/June%205.jpg)

***But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him (Hebrews 11:6\).***


Faith is giving substance to the unseen. It’s the evidence of unseen realities. We deal with, or relate to the unseen through faith, and the only reason you know they exist is that the Word of God says so. Therefore, your faith is actually based on what God has said. Your faith comes alive when God talks.


For example, the reason we believe that when we pray God answers isn’t that we think or assume He does, but because the Word says He does. 1 John 5:14 says, *“And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.”* His Word is the basis and confidence for our faith. His Word is immutable and irrefutable; it’s called the infallible Word: perfect, dependable and ever sure.


When He told Abraham, “I have made you the father of many nations,” it didn’t matter that Abraham and his wife, Sarah, were already too old to have children. Sarah’s womb was already dead—non\-functional—and so was Abraham’s body.


Nevertheless, Abraham’s faith was in the infallibility of God’s Word. The Bible says, *“And being not weak in faith, he (Abraham) considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God”* (Romans 4:19\-20\). Blessed be God!


God’s Word never returns to Him void. Therefore, keep acting your faith on what He has said, irrespective of what the senses project. Don’t beg; don’t cower; don’t give up! Insist on your rights, privileges, heritage and blessings in Christ, as stated in the Word. Even now, boldly affirm: “I walk in divine health; I walk in financial abundance; I’m a success, a victor, and a king in this life, and all things are mine!”


Hebrews 13:5\-6 says, *“...He hath said…so that we may boldly say….”* His Word is the basis for our faith\-filled confessions.

My faith is alive, active and prevailing; circumstances align with my faith-filled confessions and I rule, reign and dominate my world by my faith.

## BE HAPPY ABOUT YOU June 6th, 2019

***Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures (James 1:18\).***


Did you know that you’re the most beautiful of God’s creation? After God created everything from the first to the fifth day, He looked at what He had made, and it was good (Genesis 1:4\-25\). But on the sixth day, after He made man, the Bible says, “*God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good …”* (Genesis 1:31\). Notice the emphasis; you’re the perfection of God’s creation; the most beautiful thing that the world ever saw.


Your life is full of beauty and excellence, because you’re created in the image and likeness of God. You look like Him, and function like Him. You might say, *“But my head is so big; how can you say I look like God?”* You’re looking at the wrong thing. Your spirit is so beautiful; your spirit is where God lives. Your spirit has the life and nature of God, and that’s the real you.


Live from your spirit; look into your spirit and see the amazing beauty of your personality. Be glad about you. Be glad about the fact that you’re created by God, because everything He made is a masterpiece. You’re therefore a masterpiece. You may never really discover the real you, how beautiful and excellent you are, until you start looking inwards, into your spirit, and refusing to let the flesh control you. Look inwards and see the life of righteousness that He’s deposited in your spirit. Your life is a life of righteousness. You exude and manifest the righteousness of God; this is who you are. You’re loving and kind, because the love of God is shed abroad in your heart by the Holy Ghost.


You’re not the angry, unhappy, frustrated person that your mind or Satan tries to depict you to be. You’re beautiful! You may be concerned because you think you’re overweight or at the fact that you haven’t been able to put on some weight. That shouldn’t make you an unhappy person. It shouldn’t make you give up on yourself. The bottom line is discipline; and then don’t try to look like someone else. Be happy about you, and treat yourself right.

## WE’RE LUMINARIES June 7th, 2019

***And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever (Daniel 12:3\).***


The word translated, “Shine” in the scripture above is “zahar” in Hebrew, and it means, “to admonish, teach, inspire, or send out light.” These all connote leadership, and light gives leadership; it gives guidance.


It parallels what Jesus implied when He said, “*Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost”* (Matthew 28:19\). “Go and teach all nations” means go and shine to all nations; inspire all nations.


This is our calling as God’s people: we make students or pupils of the nations. We show the world the true life. We show them true happiness and joy. We show them what the love of God is as we unveil the Gospel to them. We’re the light in a dark world, to lead men into Christ and His priceless inheritance.


When you arrive, illumination comes; there’s direction; darkness is dispelled and the light and righteousness of God are established. You’re like Paul, whom the Lord commissioned to open the eyes of the unsaved, and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God (Acts 26:18\).


Proverbs 11:30 says, *“…he that winneth souls is wise”*; put that together with our opening verse and see that, indeed, we’re luminaries. We take the light of the Gospel everywhere we go. We give direction and show the way; we bring fulfilment and joy. These are qualities of light, and we’re the light of the world.


In John 8:12, Jesus said, *“…I am the light of the world. If anybody follows me, he shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”* 1 John 4:17 declares, *“…as he is, so are we in this world.”* We have the light of life, and dispense the same to our world.


Sickness, poverty, discouragement, death and all other works of darkness and evil can’t, and should never find a place in your life. You’re a shining light; walk in this reality.

## CONTROLLED BY HIS LOVE June 8th, 2019

***Love bears up under anything and everything that comes, is ever ready to believe the best of every person, its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances, and it endures everything \[without weakening] (1 Corinthians 13:7 AMPC).***


The Holy Spirit helps you control your emotions and attitude, and build an excellent character. Through fellowship with the Holy Spirit, you’ll not be given to sudden or choleric temper; rather, you’d be love\-controlled.


Never let anger dominate you. Even when you feel you’ve been mistreated, don’t react in a negative way. Rather, say to yourself, “I’ll let it go for the sake of Jesus.” That’s the way His love controls us. Our theme verse says, “Love bears up under anything….” This is the triumph of love.


Did you know this wasn’t possible under the Law? They just couldn’t walk in love. But now that we’re born again, it’s our daily walk in Christ. We can walk in love; talk in love, and think lovingly about others. Letting yourself love people is letting God rule and work through you.


Loving others doesn’t make you a weak person; rather, it’s a demonstration of your God\-nature. Therefore, wherever you are, create an atmosphere of love, kindness, and grace. Let the liquid love of Jesus flow through you to others. They’ll see it in your eyes; you may not have to say or do anything before it pulls people to you. His love is that strong.


Consciously overlook the wrongs done to you. That someone doesn’t know enough to treat you right shouldn’t stop you from always responding in love. Make up your mind to always respond with love. Love is ever ready to believe the best of others and give selflessly too.

## OVERCOME EVIL WITH GOOD June 9th, 2019

***Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good (Romans 12:21\).***


Good is stronger, greater and more powerful than evil. Evil doesn’t have, and will never have a lasting dominion over good.


There’re those who say, “This world is too wicked; the level of hatred is unimaginable.” Yes, but love is greater and stronger than hate. It’s like light and darkness; darkness can never, and will never overshadow light. When light shines, darkness disappears.


What many have done is to talk too much about darkness instead of “turning on the light.” The solution to darkness is light. The solution to hatred is love. The solution to evil is good.


We all must re\-orientate ourselves to trust more than ever before, the power of good over evil. The more evil people do, whoever they are, and wherever they may be, the more good you respond with. Doing good makes you the champion.


No one is ever a hero for doing evil. When people take up arms, for example, to intimidate and hurt others, it’s a testimony of weakness. True strength, real power, is in how much love you exude, and affect others with. It’s in how much you’re able to lift and build others, and make them strong. Let God’s love regulate your life.


It’s been said that the only ingredient necessary for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing. Quash the works of darkness in and around you with your good works. You’re the light of the world (Matthew 5:14\). The 16th verse says, *“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”* Do this, irrespective of the prevalent darkness and evil in today’s world. Hallelujah!

Tunazidi kukaribia kurudi kwake Bwana wetu Yesu Kristo, na tunaingia katika awamu mpya ya huduma katika Kanisa hapa duniani; yaani kiwango kikubwa zaidi cha utukufu wa Mungu katika ulimwengu mbali na kile ambacho Kanisa limewahi kukishuhudia.


Kuna uachilio wa malaika wakuu wa Mungu katika dunia. Hili ni daraja la malaika ambao hawakuwahi kuwepo ulimwenguni hapo kabla. Wameachiliwa kuja duniani kwa ajili ya kazi ya siku hizi za mwisho, kwa sababu wakati ni mchache.


Dunia inakaribia kushuhudia ishara kubwa zaidi na miujiza ya kustaajabisha, kwa sababu ya udhihirisho wa malaika na msaada wa kimalaika ambao watu wa Mungu watakumbana na uzoefu huo katika siku hizi za mwisho. Kuwa tayari na mwenye matarajio. Ni awamu mpya kabisa, na kwa ufunuo, Mungu anatujulisha muhula tuliopo wakati huu.


Ni sawa na kile kilichotokea wakati wa Biblia; katika Kitabu cha Yoeli 2:28, Bwana alikuwa amesema, *“Hata itakuwa, baada ya hayo, ya kwamba nitamimina roho yangu juu ya wote wenye mwili; na  wenu, waume kwa wake, watatabiri…”* Miaka mingi baadae, unabii huo ulitimia, lakini watu hawakutambua. Watu walipokea ujazo wa Roho Mtakatifu katika ile siku ya Pentekoste, lakini hawakujua ni nini kimetokea. Hivyo Petro akawafafanulia vile ambavyo amefunuliwa (Matendo 2:13\-16\).


Vivyo hivyo, kwa hamasa na msukumo wa Roho, tunatambua kuwa Kanisa limeingia katika awamu mpya ya miujiza, awamu mpya ya utendaji wa Roho. Katika awamu hii mpya, tunashuhudia “udhihirisho wa Roho na nguvu” kama vile ambavyo tumesoma katika mstari wetu wa ufunguzi.


Hivyo, jitoe kikamilifu, katika kueneza Injili kuliko ulivyowahi kufanya hapo kabla. Kuwa moto na mwenye athari kwa ajili ya Injili; acha hili liwe ndo kila kitu cha maana kwako, nawe utashuhudia udhihirisho wa miujiza kupita kawaida katika maisha yako na katika kila kitu kilichokuzunguka.

## THE CHRISTIAN CAN’T BE POISONED June 11th, 2019

***…and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (Mark 16:17\-18\).***


Following the words of Jesus in the verses above, the Christian can’t be poisoned. It makes no difference how the poison is administered. Why is this so? The Bible tells us in Leviticus 17:11, “*For the life of the flesh is in the blood…”* When people are poisoned, the poison gets into their system through the blood vessels to wreak havoc.


However, being born again, and having received the Holy Spirit, your body doesn’t live by blood anymore. The life of the flesh, for the unregenerate man, is the blood, but now that you’re born again, Christ is your life (Colossians 3:4\).


Remember, when Jesus was crucified, while He was on the Cross, a soldier thrust a spear through His side, and the Bible records that blood and water gushed out, because His heart had ruptured. When God raised Him from the dead, there was no blood in His body. The Holy Spirit became the life of His physical body.


The Bible says in Romans 8:11, *“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”* The word “quicken” means to “make alive” or “give life to.” The day you received the Holy Spirit, He quickened your physical body. He became the life of your physical body. Your life doesn’t depend on blood anymore.


Understand this: anything that affects or destroys the blood can’t, and shouldn’t have any effect on you. This is what we mean when we say the Christian can’t be infected or isn’t susceptible to any kind of sickness or disease. The same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead has vitalized your body such that no infection can survive or thrive in your body.


The Holy Spirit perambulates in you to see to it that you’re in perfect health, warding off any anomaly that may or could occur with your physical body (2 Corinthians 6:16\). Hallelujah!

## ETERNAL LIFE AND OUR VITAL UNION WITH GOD June 12th, 2019
![June 12th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2012.jpg)

>By [Pastor Chris Oyakhilome](https://rhapsodyofrealities.org/en/pastor-chris-oyakhilome)


***And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son (1 John 5:11 NIV).***


There’s a legal union that we have with God that Jesus brought us into, but receiving eternal life brought us into a vital union with God. A simple illustration to explain and help you understand this is a marriage relationship between a man and a woman. Marriage between them is ratified on the basis of mutual consent and a duly signed contract as required by law.


Then, as man and wife, as a result of the marriage, they form a family, and now that they’re a family, they have a vital union. This is different from the “signed paper”; that paper documented the legal union.


The legal union only has authority; for example, if you had a problem and there was a question about inheritance, the courts will need the legality of that marriage to decide something about the inheritance; they’ll ask for the document of your marriage. They’re not going to be looking at something about your home per se; they’ll be more interested in something that can be tendered legally.


So, Jesus brought us into a legal union with Himself and with our heavenly Father. He also gave us something that brought us into a vital union with Himself and with our heavenly Father. So, we have both the legal and the vital. Eternal life brings us into a vital union with our heavenly Father.


 One of the great benefits of our vital union with God (the result of eternal life) is that eternal life also gives us divine health, which is better than divine healing. There’s a place for healing, but something far better is divine health. It’s a great thing to be healed, but never being sick is far better. Is it possible never to be sick? Absolutely! But you need to understand and acknowledge this life that you received through the new birth. It’s part of what we read in our opening verse, 1 John 5:11 (NIV). Verses 12 and 13 says, *“Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.”* (NIV).


2 Peter 1:3 says, *“…his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”* You’ve got to know Him, for only then will you understand and enjoy all that belongs to you in Christ Jesus.

## TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHRIST-LIFE June 13th, 2019
![June 13th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2013.jpg)

***For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16\).***


There’re two aspects of the Christ\-life: the legal and the vital aspects. These two aspects are illustrated in our theme verse. The legal aspect refers to all that we are, all that we have, all that we can do, and our position, rank and authority as granted us in Christ.


We read that God gave His Son and says whosoever believes in Him should not perish. That’s a legal declaration. Then, the verse concludes by stating what you would have upon believing in Him: “everlasting life.” To have everlasting life is the second part, which is the vital aspect of the Christ\-life.


The vital aspect of the Christ\-life refers to all that the Holy Spirit has done or is doing in your spirit, soul and body through the Word, developing you after the image of Christ and the Father. This vital aspect is activated by your confession. Meaning, it only works when you affirm it.


The legal aspect, on the other hand, gives you authority. You acknowledge the Word and act accordingly, because it’s about being informed of what belongs to you, who you are, and your inheritance in Christ.


Now, without an understanding of these two aspects, there can be a mix\-up, just as many have done. They haven’t been able to differentiate between the legal and the vital, and so, they’re unable to apply the Word rightly.


For example, divine health belongs to you; it’s not something to struggle for in prayer, trying to “claim.” It’s legally yours now; it’s not with God or the devil. However, you make it vitally yours through your confession of the Word. Praise God!

## DON’T HOPE FOR LUCK June 14th, 2019

***Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field (Deuteronomy 28:3\).***


Some people go through life groping in the dark, hoping that someday, they might just be lucky and things will work out for them.


You’d hear them make statements like, “Maybe, if I’m lucky, I’ll get the contract”; “maybe if I’m lucky, I’ll get the appointment I’ve been desiring.” They’re hoping for luck in their finances, in their businesses, and even in their relationships. Such people haven’t been exposed to the light of God’s Word.


Don’t hope for luck. Don’t hope that God might just do something, no! You’re already a blessed person. Do you know what that means? It means nothing is too good for you or beyond your reach. Being born again, you don’t function by luck; you walk in the Word. The Word of God is your light: *“Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path”* (Psalm 119:105\).


The light of God in your spirit will direct you to be at the right place at the right time, walking in paths preordained by God. The light of God in you causes you to walk in divine favour. God’s got everything fixed in your behalf. He has the right people to help you, at the right time, and in the right place.


The Bible says, *“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose”* (Romans 8:28\). With this understanding, say to yourself: “God has the right people to help me, at the right time, and in the right place; He’ll guide me to them, or He’ll guide them to me. One way or another, we’ll meet.” Hallelujah!


Remember, He’s already blessed you with everything you require for life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3\). He’s already blessed you with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3\). Live as a blessed man or woman. Be blessing\-conscious; don’t hope for luck.

## WHEN JESUS IS IN YOUR BOAT June 15th, 2019

***But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit (1 Corinthians 6:17\).***


On a particular occasion, the disciples of Jesus were ferrying in a boat. Certainly, they had been on several boat rides, but this one was different and more remarkable, because the Master was in the boat with them.


However, not long afterwards, the disciples noticed that water was coming into the boat. The wind became fierce and ferocious, with the tides getting higher. Though terrified, the disciples couldn’t accept the possibility of the boat capsizing with Jesus in it, and they and the Master drowning in the sea.


Thus, they went to Him only to find Him sleeping in the rear of the same endangered boat. The Bible says, *“And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm”* (Mark 4:38\-39\).


When Jesus is in your boat, there’s joy, peace, and prosperity. His presence in the boat with the disciples made the difference. Even though He chided them for their lack of faith, they needed power over the imminent crisis and He was right there to provide it.


The question today is, “Who is in your boat?” It had better be Jesus; otherwise, you’re sunk. And something better for us today is that, much more than having Him “in the boat” with you, He’s in you by the Holy Ghost. In Him, you’ll sail through life’s troubles triumphantly. In Him, you have power over every turbulence, crisis, and adversity. Irrespective of the tests, trials and persecution, you’ll always win.


No matter how dire the situation is, He’ll turn those seemingly tough times into your best times. The Bible says, *“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory…”* (2 Corinthians 4:17\). It makes no difference what the challenges are; because He lives in you, you’ll always win.


Christ in you is your assurance of victory against life’s stresses and troubles. He’s in “your boat”; therefore, refuse to fear.

## YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME June 16th, 2019

***And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you (Joel 2:25\).***


As a Christian, when you give yourself to the study of the Word and fellowship with the Holy Spirit, evident changes begin to manifest in your life. These changes should immediately reflect in your lifestyle, especially your speech, your communication.


True Christian maturity is the ability to speak correctly or wholesomely, in line with the Word, irrespective of the situation. For example, if you needed to get somewhere or complete a project and the time limit you’re given is closing in, don’t panic or get into a frenzy. Don’t start lamenting and complaining that you don’t have time. Don’t cut your time short with your words. Keep your composure. The God who lives in you is the owner of time.


Read our opening verse again and observe what the Lord said. He’s a restorer of time. He restores wasted years, which means He can restore wasted months, wasted weeks, wasted days, wasted hours, wasted minutes, wasted seconds, and wasted moments. Hallelujah!


So, don’t panic because of time. When you panic, you take actions in fear, and fear is of the devil. As long as you’re panicking, you can’t have a miracle. So, refuse to panic for “lack of time.” 1 Kings 18:46 explains how Elijah was transported by the Spirit of God to outrun horses. Philip was transported by the Spirit of God to another city, faster than any supersonic jet of our day (Acts 8:39\-40\).


Always remember that you’re not an ordinary person. You live a miracle life; whatever amount of time there is, is what you need! And because you live a miracle life—the supernatural life—if the task or project you’re on requires an hour, you can do it in a shorter time. Have this consciousness.


Every so often, say to yourself, “I have enough time in life to be all that God has destined me to be, and to do all He’s called me to do and finish my course.” Hallelujah!

## WISDOM AND FULL DISCERNMENT June 17th, 2019

***That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him (Ephesians 1:17\).***


“Revelation” in the foregoing verse is the Greek word, “apokalupsis,” which means an unveiling. “Knowledge”; on the other hand, is the Greek word, “epignosis,” which means a full discernment, an accurate knowledge of God.


The Amplified Classic Translation makes it a lot clearer. It says, *“\[For I always pray to] the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation \[of insight into mysteries and secrets] in the \[deep and intimate] knowledge of Him”* (Ephesians 1:17\). There are mysteries and secrets about life, and the anointing and wisdom of God are in you to guide and give you insight into these mysteries and secrets of God.


Psalm 25:14 says, *“The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him….”* Life for us isn’t a mystery anymore, because the Holy Spirit is in us, and part of His ministry in us is the unveiling of truth. He grants us spiritual understanding. We know why things are the way they are, and we always know what to do through the Spirit (John 16:13\).


For example, earlier in His ministry, the Lord Jesus met Peter cleaning and mending his net after a fruitless fishing expedition. He requested to use Peter’s boat to preach, and when He was through, He asked Peter to launch into the water for a great haul of fish.


Peter recalled how he and his colleagues had toiled all night to no avail. But at the word of the Master, he let down his net, and sure enough, it was the catch of his lifetime (Luke 5:1\-8\).


Jesus knew where the fishes were. That’s spiritual insight and understanding. He’s the creator of all things. He knows the mysteries and secrets of life. He knows where the businesses are. He knows where the money is. He knows what ideas to give to you to take your ministry and work to the next level.


Trust Him with your life. Make knowing Him more, and keeping His Word, your greatest passion. Through that fellowship, He’ll keep unveiling Himself and the greater mysteries of the Kingdom to you. This is God’s desire for you: that you function with the Spirit of wisdom, expressed in full discernment and accurate knowledge of Him.

## SPEND TIME IN THE WORD June 18th, 2019

***Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord (Colossians 3:16\).***


For the Christian, spending quality time to study and meditate on the Word, isn’t an option. God’s Word contains the wisdom and ideas you require for greater success and increased productivity in life. That’s where you receive insight into the realities of life, and mysteries of the Kingdom.


For example, God told Moses and the children of Israel to walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and they did. We read about that in the Word and see the wisdom and power of God. There was a secret, a mystery about water that man didn’t know, but God knew. In studying the Word, such secrets are unveiled; we see the possibilities of God and our vast and limitless potentials in Him.


As you study the Scriptures and see the miracles of God, they’re indications that the power to make such things happen resides within us today. He gave us the Holy Spirit, not only to show us these mysteries of the Kingdom, and secrets to the miraculous, but also so we could work miracles through Him. But the key is knowing Him; consistent study of the Word of God, and fellowship with the Holy Spirit.


 You must spend time with the Word. Ephesians 1:17 says, *“That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.”* Why is it the knowledge of God? It’s because everything in life is in Him. He’s the full embodiment of all knowledge and wisdom. The more you know Him, the more you know about life.


The way to know Him is revealed in Ephesians 1:18: *“The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know….”* When your heart is flooded with light, meaning an abundance of the Word of God in your spirit, then the seventeenth verse becomes a reality. You start functioning with such extraordinary amplitude of mind and comprehension.

## IT’S HAPPENING REAL-TIME June 19th, 2019

***For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure (Philippians 2:13\).***


Notice that the verse we just read doesn’t say, *“For it is God who used to work in you….”* Rather, it says, *“For it is God which worketh in you….”* The word, “worketh” is old English for “works”; it’s not in the past or future tense. It’s a present progressive tense. God is at work in you, NOW! It’s happening in real time. He’s effectively at work in you, strengthening, energizing, and creating in you the longing and the ability to fulfil His perfect will for His good pleasure. Aren’t you glad about that!


This means there’s no margin or possibility for failure or weakness, because the Almighty God Himself is the one propelling, inspiring, enabling and driving you to do His will! There’re those who are concerned and even scared about tomorrow; not being sure if they’d still be pleasing God, and walking in His light. No! Not when you’re conscious that He’s the One at work in you.


Yes, by your own strength you won’t make it; you might falter and fall. The Bible says *“He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength (natural human ability) shall no man prevail”* (1 Samuel 2:9\). He thus gave us the Holy Spirit, to live in us and help us live the God\-life to the full.


Walking in righteousness, participating in godly and productive activities, attending church meetings, preaching the Gospel, loving others, etc., are results of His effectual, real\-time work in you! All that time you had the thought to do something that’s good for God, and good for people, it wasn’t your mind or your flesh; it was God working in you.


Even now, He’s the One at work in you as you study this devotional. Through the teachings, prayers, further study, and the different daily Bible readings, He’s bringing you information and enlightenment. The intensity of His glory is increasing in your life, as you bask in untold blessings of His Word. He’s making necessary adjustments, transformations and changes in your life, to keep you a champion and a victor forever. And He’s doing this in real time! Hallelujah!

## HE SAVES THROUGH WORDS June 20th, 2019
![June 20th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2020.jpg)

***…Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter; Who shall tell thee words , whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved (Acts 11:13\-14\).***


In Acts 11, we read the very insightful account of the conversion of Cornelius and his household. Cornelius was a Roman centurion who was devout and prayerful. He was God\-fearing and regularly gave alms to the poor, yet he wasn’t saved. But on a certain day, an angel appeared to him, instructing him to send for Peter who shall tell him words, whereby he and all his house shall be saved.


God saw the man’s “goodness” and moral uprightness, yet those weren’t enough to save him. The angel specifically said to him, *“…Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God”* (Acts 10:4\). Yet, the man still needed to send for the Apostle Peter, who would lead him and his household to utter the words of salvation. This shows that God saves through words! But what words?


Romans 10:9 corroborates this principle. It says, *“…if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”* The word, “confess” is from the Greek “homologia,” and it means, “speaking the same thing in consent”; in other words, you have to speak words that are in agreement with what God has said, in order for you to be saved. That’s true confession, and principle for salvation.


Salvation is all\-encompassing. It refers to deliverance from sin and it’s consequences, preservation, divine healing and health, protection, prosperity and all the good things that the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ obtained for you. To be saved, therefore, means to be severed and totally disconnected from all negative influences and circumstances of life; and there’s more. The confession of His Lordship.


When you say, “Jesus is Lord over my life,” besides the fact that you’re immediately transferred from the domain of darkness into the kingdom of God’s love\-Son, you’re also affirming that He’s the Shepherd and Lord over your life, business, finances; therefore, you’ll never lack or be poor! He’s Lord over your body; therefore, you’ll never be sick or diseased! You’re also declaring that He’s your refuge and your fortress, and for that reason, you dwell in safety. Blessed be God!

## SEE WITH GOD’S LIGHT June 21st, 2019
![June 21st, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2021.jpg)

>By [Pastor Chris Oyakhilome](https://rhapsodyofrealities.org/en/pastor-chris-oyakhilome)


***Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path (Psalm 119:105\)***


God’s Word is the true Light that lights every man that comes into the world (John 1:9\); it’s the compass with which you navigate your way successfully through life. Life is filled with chances and choices; and in making decisions you need proper guidance, which only God’s Word can provide.


The Bible says, *“That which makes manifest is light”* (Ephesians 5:13\); meaning that light illuminates. Hebrews 4:12\-13, apart from highlighting the power and efficacy of God’s Word, also reveals its functionality as light. Part of it says, *“…Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.”*


The Word of God sees and knows everything; it touches every subject in life and discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. When you study the Word, you receive much more than inspiration; you receive divine light, insight, and wisdom to deal excellently in life.


No one can know what’s true or real except through the light of God’s Word, for the Word is truth (John 17:17\), and truth means reality. If, today, there seems to be darkness in any area of your life, perhaps in your family, health, academics or business, use the true light, God’s Word. The solution to darkness is light. If the true Light (God’s Word) dwells in you richly, as admonished in Colossians 3:16, fear, failure, lack, sickness and all other results of darkness won’t have any place in you.


See with God’s light. See from the perspective of His [Word](http://rhapsodybible.org). Interpret situations, circumstances and the conditions of your life from the standpoint of the Word. His light shows that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world. His light shows that you’re prosperous and have been brought into a wealthy place. His light shows that divine health is your present\-hour possession and right in Christ.

## WISDOM IS A GUIDING FORCE June 22nd, 2019
![June 22nd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2022.jpg)

***Yet wisdom is vindicated (shown to be true and divine) by all her children \[by their life, character, and deeds] (Luke 7:35 AMPC).***


True wisdom is the manifestation or revelation of the rightness of God in your spirit; it’s a guiding force that causes you to act, respond or speak beyond natural human reasoning. It’s also the expression of the power of God in thoughts, plans, purpose and decision\-making. When the wisdom of God functions in you, it becomes the power that influences your choices in life. That’s why it’s a guiding force.


Wisdom propels you in the right direction in life, and positions you in the place of advantage. For example, Genesis 39 tells the story of Joseph, who was sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers. Nevertheless, the Bible says he found grace in the sight of Potiphar, his master, and served him: *“…and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand”* (Genesis 39:4\).


In the course of time, Joseph was imprisoned because his master’s wife accused him falsely. But wisdom promoted Joseph, and gave him the advantage, such that even while in prison, he became the head of the prisoners. Joseph’s story is a very inspiring one.


Notice Pharaoh’s remarks to his servants as a result of the wisdom he saw and heard in Joseph: *“...Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou…See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt”* (Genesis 41:38\-41\).


The Egyptian Empire was preserved by the wisdom of God revealed in the thirty\-year\-old Hebrew prisoner, Joseph. Wisdom promoted him from being a prisoner to become Prime Minister of the most powerful empire overnight.


No wonder we’re admonished in the Word to celebrate and exalt wisdom (Proverbs 4:8\). When you do, wisdom will promote you and propel you in the path of honour and greatness.

## CHRISTIANITY—A FELLOWSHIP June 23rd, 2019
![June 23rd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2023.jpg)

***God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord (1 Corinthians 1:9\).***


Real or authentic Christianity is God alive and functioning in a human person. It’s the pulsating life of Christ in a human body; divinity at work in humanity. This is what many haven’t understood about Christianity; the fact that it’s a living relationship with a living God. This is what Jesus made possible for us: fellowship with God. That’s the biggest thing, the all\-inclusive word that Christianity is about: FELLOWSHIP; everything else is inside it.


The greatest glory of Christianity is our fellowship with God. Once you come into that relationship, everything changes for you. The Lord Jesus Christ brought us into oneness, communion, partnership, union, and comradeship with Almighty God! He died, was buried, and God raised Him up with a new kind of life.


The Bible says He was *“…crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man”* (Hebrews 2:9\). He did all He did to bring us into a divine, heavenly pantheon. Now, we’re partakers of the divine nature. The Bible says He has *“…raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus”* (Ephesians 2:6\). He brought us into Himself.


Now, from that place, in Him and through Him, you’re reigning in life. This is what Christianity is about; God’s work in a man. It’s a call to oneness with Divinity. You have the divine life of God, and you’re in an everlasting fellowship with Him. This is a real experience. He took up His abode in you for you to live in, and through Him.


Get to know the reality of this relationship and live beyond mere religion. Hallelujah!

Dear Father, I thank you for the wonderful life I have in Christ and the everlasting fellowship I have and enjoy with you.

## IT’S NOT ENOUGH TO BE “GOD-FEARING” June 24th, 2019

***Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again (John 3:7\).***


Sometimes, there’re those who are described by others as “godly” or “god\-fearing,” even though they’re not born again. But being godly or god\-fearing isn’t the same as being born again. In Acts 10, we find a most interesting case of conversion, the conversion of Cornelius, a very “godly” man. In fact, the Bible says he was a *“devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God always”* (Acts 10:2\). What an amazing description!


He was benevolent, liberal and “god\-fearing”; consistent and persistent in his prayer life. He was a just man (Acts 10:22\). And he even saw visions: “*He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him…”* (Acts 10:3\). Yet, he wasn’t saved; he wasn’t born again. An angel had to tell him, *“And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter…he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do”* (Acts 10:5\-6\).


In our opening verse, Jesus didn’t mince words when He spoke to Nicodemus. He said, *“Ye must be born again.”* He didn’t say if you’re “god\-fearing,” it’s okay. He used the term, “born again” to express the necessity for man’s spiritual rebirth. Sometimes we encounter such people as Cornelius. They have a good reputation and moral character; but being well\-spoken of by others doesn’t merit God’s salvation.


This is why we preach the Gospel. The Gospel is about Jesus Christ; it’s not about what you have done, or what you haven’t done. It’s about Christ and what He’s done for you, which if you’d accept was enough, then salvation is yours. The Bible says, *“And by him (Jesus) all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses”* (Acts 13:39\).


In case you’re like Cornelius today reading this, you need to receive words by which you can be saved. Those words are in Romans 10:9\. It says, *“…if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”* This is the Bible way to receive salvation.

## WE ALWAYS WIN June 25th, 2019

 >***And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him, And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour… (Acts 7:9-10).***

By [Pastor Chris Oyakhilome](https://rhapsodyofrealities.org/en/pastor-chris-oyakhilome)  

***And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him, And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour… (Acts 7:9\-10\).***


As God’s children, we’re never disadvantaged. Everything in life, every situation we find ourselves, can only work to our advantage. Consider the story of Joseph. Everywhere he went, he prospered. He was described as a prosperous man, despite being a slave in Potiphar’s house. What made the difference in his life was God’s presence.


Genesis 39:2 says, *“And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man….”* God’s presence, Christ in you, is your advantage; that’s your assurance for victory. 1 John 4:4 says, *“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”* The reason we win, and would always win, is Christ in us; the greater One in us. Hallelujah!


I mean, think about it: Joseph was eventually unjustly sent to prison, due to false accusations from Potiphar’s wife. Yet, in prison, the Bible says, *“…the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison”* (Genesis 39:21\). The Bible doesn’t say you might not get into trouble; but the Lord’s assurance is that in the midst of the trouble, you’ll prevail. He’ll rid you of that trouble, because He’s with you, and in you.


Nothing compares to Christ in us! That’s our confidence and assurance for a triumphant and prosperous life. Christ in you means you can never be disadvantaged, irrespective of the situation or circumstance that you may find yourself. Right in that seeming dungeon, He’d cause you to triumph.


The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 2:14, *“Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ….”* This is your life. This is your story: one of endless victories and persistent progress and productivity in Christ Jesus.


It makes no difference the challenges you might be facing at home, in your workplace, etc.; be comforted! Christ in you will put you over and turn things around in your favour. Therefore, rejoice, because come what may, you’ll always win.

***Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought (Numbers 23:23\).***


There’re Christians who have come to the conclusion that their predicament is the result of a curse working against them. They’re thus going around seeking deliverance from so\-called ancestral or other curses. Such Christians, consciously or inadvertently, have been deceived. The Christian is superior to Satan and everything of darkness, and therefore can’t be under a curse.


The Bible says, *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature…”* (2 Corinthians 5:17\). You’ve been born anew, called to inherit a blessing, not a curse: “…ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing” (1 Peter 3:9\). Read God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:3: *“And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”* Blessings are at work in you, because you’re the seed of Abraham. No one can bewitch you or cast a spell on you.


If you were told that someone was trying to charm you, you don’t even have to pray for it not to work. You can neither be charmed nor cursed. There’s no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel. This is your heritage as the seed of Abraham.


Did you say there’s someone somewhere scheming against you, your family, or your job? Don’t panic. Don’t fret. Their schemes against you can’t work. They should take a cue or learning from Balaam of the Old Testament. After several futile attempts to enchant and curse Israel, he submitted, *“No magic spells can bind Jacob, no incantations can hold back Israel…”* (Numbers 23:23 MSG).


Balaam couldn’t lay a curse on them, because they were God’s people; and today, we’re living out better promises. You walk in blessings only, and only the blessed Word of the Lord can come to pass in your life. Even the demons know who you are. There’s a mark on you; you’re branded for God; sealed for blessings. Glory to God!

## BORN INTO THE KINGDOM OF LIGHT June 27th, 2019

***But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light (1 Peter 2:9\).***


Jesus said, *“...Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God”* (John 3:3\). The Kingdom of God is the kingdom of light; it’s the kingdom of life. And until a man is born again, he’s not a part of the life or light of the Kingdom; he abides in darkness.


This is the reason Jesus said in John 3:7, *“…Ye must be born again.”* The one who isn’t born again is in Satan’s domain, and can’t see God’s Kingdom. He can’t even understand it, for He’s not in fellowship with God.


It doesn’t matter that two people are identical twins; if one is born again and the other isn’t, one is in the kingdom of light, and the other one is in the kingdom of darkness. For anyone to come into the light of God, have His life and nature, and become one with Him, he must be born again.


Being born again, Colossians 1:13 says God has *“...delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.”* From the time that Adam sinned against God in the Garden of Eden, darkness came into this world, and man became alienated from the life of God; completely cut off from the light of God. But the moment you proclaimed Jesus Christ as Lord of your life, you received eternal life and woke up in the kingdom of light, in oneness with God!


Our theme verse shows your present location: God’s marvellous light. Now you walk in the light, as He is in the light. His light has become your light, just as the psalmist prophesied: *“For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light”* (Psalm 36:9\). Hallelujah!


Being born into God’s Kingdom means you’ve been brought out of sin, sickness, disease, depression, poverty, frustrations and everything associated with Satan and darkness, into God’s eternal glory—where you reign in life by grace, through righteousness. No darkness at all. Glory to God!

***When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person (Job 22:29\).***


Christianity is a life of champions. We’re not of them that fail. No matter what happens in your life, failure isn’t a possibility, until and unless you let it. As long as you choose to win; as long as you choose to succeed; as long as you choose victory, that’s what you’ll have.


What you need is to set your focus on the Lord and His eternal Word. Learn to see God and God alone. See the invisible, and you’ll do the impossible! When your focus is on Him and His Word, you don’t see shadows. You see and hear Him only, and nothing else matters.


With the Word in you, you just know you’re different, and that circumstances and situations will always turn out in your favour. That’s because you’re peculiar. You’re not of this world. You’re not from the lineage of the fallen man, the “earthly” man; you’re a new “creature,” a new kind of man (2 Corinthians 5:17\); an associate of the God\-kind. But if you don’t know it, you’ll suffer what mere men suffer, and live like a servant, whereas you’re a king\-priest, and a prince of power with God.


When you know the Word, you’re able to walk in your inheritance, rights and privileges in Christ. You enjoy the greater glories and treasures of Christ. What has kept many bound and hindered them from walking in the riches of the glory of their inheritance in Christ is ignorance.


Refuse to be ignorant. Know the Scriptures for yourself. Study and meditate until the Word gains the ascendancy in you, instilling in you a new mind\-set. That way, irrespective of the challenges and adversities, you’ll respond with the Word. And when you respond with the Word, you win! That’s how God’s champions live; they live in and by the Word. We reign and rule by the Word. Hallelujah!

## HAVE THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF LIFE June 29th, 2019

***Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed (1 Corinthians 15:51\).***


Some people think death is from God; they think God created life and created death. But it’s not true. When they read such things as, *“I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things”* (Isaiah 45:7\), they get carried away by the words of the prophet, who spoke symbolically. When you want to understand the truth, you go over to the New Testament.


Hebrews 2:14 says, *“Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil. ”* The devil had the power of death! And in 1 Corinthians 15:26, the Bible says, *“The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”* Death is an enemy. So, it’s only those who don’t understand the Word that say, “We’ll all die one day.”


Our theme verse says, *“Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep ….”* The underlined portion shows that everybody isn’t going to die. This is a mystery to the world; it’s difficult for some people to understand. Therefore, they’re quick to quote Hebrews 9:27 which reads, *“And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.”* But God didn’t make this a promise. The next verse says, “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation” (Hebrews 9:28\).


In essence, it’s telling us that because it was appointed unto man to die, and afterwards, face judgement, Jesus Christ died once, for every man. So, man doesn’t have to die again and again. There’s no need for more sacrifices for sins.


Now that you’re born again, you have everlasting life; you’ve been brought from humanity to eternity, which means you’ve become incorruptible, indestructible, imperishable, not subject to failure, not subject to death! This should be your consciousness, a consciousness of life, not death. Glory to God!

## HE SPEAKS TO YOU IN “SPIRIT LANGUAGE” June 30th, 2019

***My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me (John 10:27\).***


Oftentimes, when we say God spoke to us, there’re those who wonder, “What language does He speak?” They want to know how they too can hear God. God is a Spirit, and He speaks to your spirit. What you have to learn is to listen to Him with your heart—your spirit.


Being born again, and having received the Holy Spirit, you’re one with the Lord. He’s come to dwell within you and has mingled with your spirit. The Bible says, *“But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit”* (1 Corinthians 6:17\). Thus, His voice in your spirit will be unmistakable. All you have to do is listen from within. He knows every language. He can talk to you in any language.


The most important thing about God speaking to you isn’t the language He spoke; it’s whether your spirit received the words. He speaks to you in “spirit language,” because He talks to your spirit. Your mind is what relates with language.


Language is created with sound for your intellect. But God isn’t a mind, neither does He appeal to your mind. He doesn’t need your reasoning faculties to communicate with you. As a result, He doesn’t need to put His message in a language for your intellect.


When He speaks to you in any human language, if you don’t receive the message from your spirit, it may have no impact or meaning. It has to get to your spirit. If you only got the words in your mind, you may even forget what He said, but your spirit can remember.


Moreover, when God speaks to you, your spirit will at once light up and bear witness that He’s the One talking to you. It’s like what Jesus said in our opening verse, ***“My sheep hear my voice….”***


Train your spirit to be a sure\-guide and a dependable receptacle of God’s words and signals. Activate your spirit by speaking in tongues frequently. Also, it’s very important that you learn the Word of God, because He never says anything outside His Word. Praise God!
