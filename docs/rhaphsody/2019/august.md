## CHRIST: OUR MEDIATOR AND RECONCILER August 1st, 2019
![August 1st, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%201.jpg)

>***For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus (1 Timothy 2:5\).***


In Romans 6:14, the Bible says, *“For sin shall not have dominion over you….”* The problem of sin has been dealt with. In the Old Testament, the Prophet Isaiah cried out, *“But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear”* (Isaiah 59:2\). But it’s not so anymore, because of Christ’s redemptive work; He’s the mediator between God and men. The Bible says God was in Christ, reconciling the world—the world of sinners—unto Himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them. God isn’t holding sin against you, because of Jesus; our sins were laid on Him. No one today should bear the punishment for his or her sins, because Jesus already paid the full penalty for sin. He was judged for our sake (Isaiah 53:5\).


Following His vicarious sacrifice in our behalf, He initiated and established peace between God and man; He reconciled humanity back to God. Man had become alienated from the life of God through Adam’s disobedience, but Jesus reconciled us with the Father in the body of His flesh through death.


Colossians 1:21\-22 declares, *“And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.”* The latter part of this scripture clearly reveals the reason for the reconciliation: “…to present you holy, blameless and above reproach in his sight.” Now, you’re qualified to live in the presence of God, without inferiority, guilt or condemnation; you’re free from all accusations, being justified by His grace. Blessed be God!


This is the Gospel! The reason you’re holy, blameless, and justified before the Father isn’t because of what you did, or didn’t do; it’s the result of what Jesus did. His death, burial, and resurrection reconciled you to the Father, and brought you into oneness and fellowship with Him. Hallelujah!

## NOT OF THIS WORLD August 2nd, 2019
![August 2nd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%202.jpg)

>***Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances (Colossians 2:20\).***


Some Christians don’t realize they’re in God’s Kingdom now. They live as though they’re in the world. Their actions and reactions, their thoughts, words and responses are like those of the people of the world. Instead of walking by faith, they walk by sensory perceptions; regulated in life only by that which they can physically perceive. But that’s not the life of a Christian; we live in a spiritual kingdom where faith is our lifestyle.


God expects you to live above this world. Jesus said in John 15:19*, “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world….”* No wonder the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, cautioned, *“Why are you still living as though you’re in the world, when actually you live in Christ, in the Spirit?”* Then, in Galatians 5:25, He tells us to walk in the Spirit, because we live in the Spirit.


Now that you’re born again, you live in two worlds simultaneously: the physical world and the spiritual world. You’ve got to be conscious of the spiritual realm into which you’ve been born, and function in it. Live the life of heaven on earth, because you’re a citizen of heaven. Your thinking, your response to circumstances, and outlook on life must be from a heavenly perspective, the Word’s perspective. Your contemplations should be different from those of the natural man.


You live in a spiritual kingdom with spiritual principles. You must have that consciousness. When you understand this, you’ll get excited when you face troubles or crises, because you’re certain they’ll turn out for your good. This is because, in our kingdom, we only know how to win and make progress from glory to glory. We dominate this physical world with the principles of our heavenly Kingdom. Hallelujah!

## IN LIKENESS OF HIM August 3rd, 2019
![August 3rd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%203.jpg)

 ---

>***You must display a new nature because you are a new person, created in God’s likeness – righteous, holy, and true (Ephesians 4:24 NLT).***


In Ephesians 5:1, we’re admonished to be “imitators of God” as His beloved children. This is possible because we have His life and nature in us. Therefore, we can talk like Him, love like Him, and walk in absolute mastery and dominion in the earth, as Jesus did, for as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17\).


Being born again, you’re born after the Second Adam, Jesus Christ; you were created after Him in righteousness and true holiness. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature….”* This new creature is born anew after the image of God (Colossians 3:10\). Thus, you’re a new person, with the God\-nature. This is the reason you can imitate Christ. No matter how much you train a monkey or a chimpanzee to act like a human, it can never be human, because it doesn’t have the human nature. To be human, you have to be born that way.


Recall the seven sons of Sceva, who attempted to copy Paul, by casting out devils, even though they weren’t born again. They didn’t have the Christ\-life in them. The Bible says, *“And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded”* (Acts 19:16\).


Only those who are born again and have the nature of God, have the right and authority to cast out devils in the Name of Jesus. Jesus cast out devils; and He gave us the authority to do the same. He said in John 14:12, *“Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do….”*


In addition, you’re to emulate Him in your love\-walk. Ephesians 5:2 says, *“And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.”* Express love to those in your world, whether or not you think they deserve it. That’s being like your heavenly Father. The Bible says, *“That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust”* (Matthew 5:45\). Hallelujah!

## SPEAK THE TRUTH ALWAYS August 4th, 2019
![August 4th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%204.jpg)

 ---

>***These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren (Proverbs 6:16\-19\).***


Some people can’t seem to put a stop to certain unpleasant habits, such as lying. But being born again, you have a different nature; you’re not in servitude to sin or Satan, because you’ve been made free from death and the law of sin. The very thing that makes people sin has been disabled in your life.


Therefore, you can say, “No” to any bad habit, and that’ll be it. All that’s required is your decision, and the discipline to stick to the Word. The Word says, “Put away lying”; therefore, say to yourself, “I tell the truth only, and always, no matter what!”


You can quit whatever it is you do that you know is wrong; you only need to make up your mind. Romans 6:14 says, *“For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.”* Sin can no longer keep you in bondage; it can’t make you do what you don’t want to do anymore, because you have a new nature—the God\-nature.


Our opening scripture counted a lying tongue and a false witness among the things that the Lord detests. So, put away lying; it’s not a part of your new nature in Christ. The Bible says, *“And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness”* (Ephesians 4:24\). Now that you’re in Christ, you’ve put on the new man; you’re different. Act accordingly. Speak the truth always.

Precious Father, I thank you for my new life in Christ. I’ve put on the new man, which is created in righteousness and true holiness.

Thank you for bringing me into the liberty of the Spirit, as I walk in the glory of my new life and nature in Christ, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## YOU OWN THE WORLD August 5th, 2019
![August 5th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%205.jpg)

 ---

>***And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise (Galatians 3:29\).***


Romans 8:16\-17 lets us know that as God’s children, we’re heirs of God, and joint\-heirs with Christ. Read our opening scripture again; it says, *“And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.”* You couldn’t read this and not shout for joy, for it means you own this world. God gave the whole world to Abraham and his seed. That seed is Christ; and if you belong to Christ, you’re Abraham’s seed and therefore an heir according to the promise.


Now you can better understand why the Bible says, *“Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth”* (Ephesians 4:28\). How could you steal when the whole world belongs to you? Don’t be among those who are fighting over lands and estates; you own this world! And the proof that you do, is the Word of God.


1 Corinthians 3:21\-22 says, *“…For all things are yours; Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours.”* Have this consciousness. Every so often, affirm with confidence, “I own this world; all things are mine!” There’s a legal document to that effect—God’s Word. Therefore, it makes no difference if anyone challenges you or sneers at you; you still own this world.


You actually dwell in the realm of superabundance. You have an inheritance, bequeathed to you by the One who said, *“The silver is mine, and the gold is mine…” (Haggai 2:8\). “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills”* (Psalm 50:10\).


All the wealth in this world: the precious stones, minerals, oil and everything that men believe they own, actually belong to the Lord, with whom you’re a joint\-heir. Your wealth, therefore, is limitless, inestimable, and unquantifiable. Declare every day that you’re rich and blessed beyond measure. Hallelujah!

## MINISTER GRACE WITH YOUR WORDS August 6th, 2019
![August 6th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%206.jpg)

 ---

>***Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers (Ephesians 4:29\).***


Corrupt communication is communication that’s worthless and unsavoury; unworthy of the Lord. Never allow foul or polluting language, evil, unwholesome talk find vent through you. I made up my mind a long time ago to be gracious and graceful in my communication, to speak the right words only.


The Bible says sweet and bitter waters don’t come out of the same fountain (James 3:11\). Being born again, you’re anointed to bless. Your words should, and must lift and inspire others, not beat them down. Make the decision that only the right words will come out of your mouth, even when you seem to be making a joke. Speak words that are consistent with your nature of righteousness.


The most effective way to keep your communication gracious at all times is filling your heart and mind with the Word, for out of that abundance, you’ll speak. Give greater attention to the Word, and when the need arises, at the time of crisis and tests, only words of wisdom, solution, blessing and love will come forth from you.


The Bible says, *“A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good…for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh”* (Luke 6:45\). If there’s no foolishness, hatred, bitterness, anger or pride in you, they won’t come out of your mouth.


Be gracious in your communication. People should enjoy being around you and listening to you, because of your invigorating words of wisdom and grace. Hallelujah!

## AN ASSEMBLAGE OF THE GOD-KIND August 7th, 2019
![August 7th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%207.jpg)

>***Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity… for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore (Psalm 133:1\-3\).***


Whenever we come together for corporate worship in church, it’s not an ordinary gathering; it’s an assemblage of the God\-kind; a real family gathering. It’s not a gathering of several individuals with different ideas, no! We’re united in spirit, of one mind in the presence of the Holy Ghost who Himself is God.


I don’t know what this means to you, but I think it’s the most beautiful gathering of all; better than any political rally, sports, entertainment or any other social event. In our theme scripture, David’s understanding and description of the blessedness of the gathering of God’s people is quite profound. He said therein, God commands His blessings, even life forevermore. Hallelujah!


How could anyone read that and miss a church service? That would be because they don’t understand the Body of Christ; they don’t understand the power released when we come together. Every time you come into church for worship, you’re in the place of blessings. Paul, by the Spirit, calls it the General Assembly and church of the “Firstborn” (Hebrews 12:23\). This is far more sublime and prestigious than the United Nations General Assembly.


Cultivate the habit of going to church, irrespective of your tight schedule. Every church service is specially designed with you in mind. They’re special times for fellowship, learning, cleansing, edification and glorification. Hebrews 10:25 says, *“Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is….”*


Be like David, who said, *“I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD”* (Psalm 122:1\). Always be excited to go to church, for that’s God’s place of appointment to bless you and touch your life in a special way.

## HE CAME TO HELP YOU WIN August 8th, 2019

>***But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things… (John 14:26 NKJV).***


I would to God that every Christian would realize the power and importance of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in their lives! He was sent to help you make a success of your life. He’s your Helper, and His help isn’t restricted; He helps you in all things. No matter what you’re going through in life, with Him, you’ll always win. That’s why there’s no position of disadvantage to you.


Don’t ignore Him. Even if the trouble seems too overwhelming for you as an individual, remember, He’s the One called to walk alongside you. You’re not alone. If you’d listen to Him, He’d grant you the wisdom that you need. If you’d trust Him, He’d rid you of every trouble, irrespective of the cause.


What you need is to train your spirit to listen and discern His voice. He leads you through the Word; therefore, He’d always bring you God’s Word. Activate your spirit by praying in tongues. That way, your spirit becomes more sensitive to His signals and promptings from within you.


The Holy Spirit is more passionate for your success than you could ever be, but He needs your cooperation. He said in Amos 3:3, “Can two walk together, except they be agreed?” He doesn’t do His work in you, without you. You have a role, which is to yield to His sway and influence. His work and ministry in your life is manifested and effective to the extent that you allow Him. The more you cooperate with Him and encourage His work in your life, the more He manifests Himself in, and through you.


He’s the wisdom you require. He’s the strength you need. 1 Samuel 2:9 says, *“…for by strength shall no man prevail.”* Never depend on your own abilities. Do all that you do with the help and power of the Holy Spirit, and you’ll always win.

## NO EXCUSES August 9th, 2019
![August 9th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%209.jpg)

 ---

>***And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it (Habakkuk 2:2\).***


One of the things you must ensure in your personal life is to get rid of excuses. Do what you ought to do, say what you ought to say—at the right time, and in the right way. When you want to live a life of glory, power, success, and influence, you shun mediocrity and excuses.


As long as you make excuses, you can’t be excellent. Be known for excellence, for glory, because that’s your calling in Christ. He called you to display His wonderful deeds, virtues, perfections, excellence, and wisdom: *“...that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light”* (1 Peter 2:9 AMPC).


What vision did the Spirit of God lay in your heart to have achieved by the end of the year? Review the current status and make up your mind there’ll be no excuses. Stay focused and disciplined; tell yourself it’s going to be nothing short of excellence. Be challenged and motivated by the joy and anticipation of an excellent finish.


 Many procrastinate, and give excuses for their poor performance or ineffectiveness. Choose to win. Choose to succeed. Success is measured at different stages. So, do your best now, and then move on to the next stage.


Do the right thing at the right time, for the right purpose. Be consistent. Be diligent. Don’t be that person who always starts things but never completes them. Persevere in transforming your vision into reality. You’re sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency (2 Corinthians 3:5\). In Him, you’re up to any task; you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you (Philippians 4:13\).

## “NO CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER” August 10th, 2019
![August 10th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%2010.jpg)

 ---

>***Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice (Ephesians 4:31 NIV).***


There’re people who are unhappy in their lives; there’s so much bitterness in them. Even when they’re counselled to forgive those who may have hurt or offended them, they’re unwilling to let go. They pray and make decisions on the bases of their hurt, offences, and bitterness, while stating they have forgiven. Refuse to harbour resentment. It makes no difference how callous someone may have acted towards you; holding on to the pain and grudge of such experiences would only wound your emotions further, and ultimately affect your health.


To be unforgiving is to allow circumstances rob you of your joy in life. Forgiving others isn’t so much about the one who offended you; it’s about your own life; it’s for your benefit.


As long as you hold that grudge against those who may have hurt you, you’re not free; you’re in more trouble than the one with whom you’re angry. But when you maintain a forgiving heart, not only will you live a happy and exciting life, you’ll continually enjoy the pleasantness in other people. When you free others, you become free.


 Yes, offences will come, according to the Bible; people will do things that may hurt or offend you, but never allow anger provoke and make you react negatively. Remember the words of Jesus: *“But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you”* (Matthew 5:44\). Stay in the Word and walk in love. Forgive easily. Hold no grudge. Be meek, kind, and not easily provoked. Let God’s essence within you flow out like a stream as you relate with others in love.


One of the beauties of God’s Word is its practicability; so, when our opening verse says, “Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger,” it’s practicable. Use the Word to deal with such and other negative emotions. If there’s anyone you’ve been holding a grudge against or has a grudge against you, take the bold step to make peace, irrespective of who’s at fault, for this is the will of God concerning you.

## WHEN YOU KNOW HIS WILL August 11th, 2019
![August 11th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%2011.jpg)

>***Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is (Ephesians 5:17\).***


The Word of God is the will of God. The more you study the Scriptures, the more you know the will of God, because you’ll be more acquainted with the author of the Scriptures. If you know His will through the Scriptures, you’ll know His will in everything, including the minutest details of your life.


Sometimes, when people face daunting or challenging situations and cave in under the pressure, it’s because they don’t know the will of the Father. Peradventure you lost your job or business and began to question, “Oh God, why? How could this happen to me?” Such a response shows you’re not sure where you are, with respect to God’s will. If you’re certain that you’re in the centre of His will, remain unmoved.


In Christ, we’re ordained of God to live as champions and reign as kings in life. The reason this hasn’t been the experience of many is that they haven’t learnt to walk in the knowledge of God’s will. Romans 12:2 tells us about the good, the acceptable, and the perfect will of God. The ultimate is walking in God’s perfect will, and that only results from fellowship with the Lord and His Word.


 As you fellowship with Him through prayer, the study of the Word and meditation, you’ll know His perfect will, intent and purpose. Through that intimacy, you’ll become more like Him, united with Him in thought and character. You’ll know what to do in every situation; all your efforts and resources will be constantly channelled in the right direction for the right results. When you know the will of God, you’re filled with divine wisdom; you have insight into the mind of God, into the mysteries of the Kingdom.


Just knowing that you’re in the centre of God’s will gives you a sense of absolute mastery and dominion. You’re unruffled, even when you go through diverse tests, because His Word is your anchor. Irrespective of the crisis or darkness, you’re full of joy, because you know that whatever you’re going through, “came to pass!” Great victories await you at the end of the story. Blessed be God!

## PERPETUALLY HIGH ON THE HOLY GHOST August 12th, 2019
![August 12th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%2012.jpg)

 ---

>***And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but ever be filled \{and\} stimulated with the \[Holy] Spirit (Ephesians 5:18 AMPC).***


Our opening verse talks about being perpetually high on the Holy Ghost, functioning under His sway and influence, twenty\-four hours every day. That’s the Spirit’s desire for each and every one of us, and He shows us how to make it happen in the ensuing verses 19\-21\.


Verse 19 says, *“Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.”* This is one of the ways to maintain a spiritual high. You sing spiritual poems to God in worship; you offer songs of thanksgiving and praise to Him; very often, these are prophetic songs that come to you from the realm of the spirit; and sometimes, they may come to you in spiritual tongues.


It also says to “Make melody in your heart to the Lord.” These are tunes of praise, worship, edification, gratitude, and joy, from your heart to the Lord, rendered in your understanding or in other tongues. Make it a conscious thing to get yourself filled with the Spirit every day. Your spirit will continually be energized for victory and success. You don’t have to wait till you get to church to be filled with the Spirit; you can be filled with the Spirit ANYTIME, ANYWHERE; it’s up to you.


Start from the known, to the unknown. In other words, start with the already written Psalms and read them out loud, such as Psalm 23, Psalm 27, etc. By the time you’re through reading, you’re super charged and inspired, and you can make your own psalms as God’s Spirit gives you utterance. Make this a constant in your life. Hallelujah!

## HE KEEPS YOU FROM FALLING August 13th, 2019
![August 13th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%2013.jpg)

>***Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen (Jude 1:24\-25\).***


Some Christians sing certain songs that dissipate their faith and don’t express the realities of our new nature. For example, someone sings, “Jesus loves me, and I love Him too, because every time I fall, He lifts me up.” That’s unscriptural; it sounds nice and wonderful, but it doesn’t express our place in Christ, and our inheritance in Him.


The Bible doesn’t say that Jesus lifts us up every time we fall. Rather, it says, “He’s able to keep us from falling,” which is more sublime. When you live with the mentality that every time you fall, He picks you up, you’re going to keep falling and expecting Him to lift you up; that’s not His ministry. His ministry is to keep you from falling. When you trust Him, as the One who’s able to keep you from falling, you’ll never fall. Glory to God!


He’s the Rock that holds you firm and secure, and He’s doing it for a reason: to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. Blessed be God! Every so often, declare, “The Lord is able to keep me from falling.” It’s a statement of faith; your faith in His redemptive work, which was perfect and of eternal significance.


There’s another portion of Scripture where the Spirit referenced a similar thought through the Apostle Peter in 2 Peter 1:1\-10\. There, the Spirit highlighted several virtues and factors for spiritual effectiveness for the Christian. Study the entire reference. Verse 10 says, *“…if you do these things, you will never fall”* (NIV). How comforting. How assuring!


We’re not of them that rise and fall. We’re forever standing strong. Ephesians 6:14 says, *“Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth….”*


Have the consciousness that in your journey of faith, you’ll forever be standing strong and courageous for the Gospel. None of your steps shall slide, because the Lord is your Rock and your Defence. Through His Word, He preserves you; He keeps you safe and from falling, until His return. Hallelujah!

## THERE’S TREASURE IN YOU August 14th, 2019
![August 14th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2014.jpg)

>***But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us (2 Corinthians 4:7\).***


The verse above was written to Christians; so, it’s talking about you; there’s a treasure in you. You carry the divine essence; you’re not ordinary. Acknowledge this, for the Bible says, the communication of your faith is effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing that’s in you in Christ Jesus (Philemon 1:6\).


Acknowledge that you’re a bearer of the divine order; a carrier of God’s divine presence. Therefore, the excellence of His power permeates through you, causing everything you do to prosper. Glory to God!


The Bible says the mystery of Christianity and the glory thereof is Christ in you (Colossians 1:27\). Your life isn’t empty; there’s a treasure in you; a treasure of power, love, light, and divine perfection. Your body may be an earthen vessel, but the glory of God is in your spirit, and that glory inundates and perfects your physical body.


Always affirm that through you, the light of God, His glory, power and grace are revealed to your world. Make such proclamations often, because the effectiveness of the Word in your life depends on your response to the Word of God.


Concerning what we read in our opening verse, your response should be, “Yes, I’m a God\-carrying vessel; I’m a package of divine blessings and treasures.” Hallelujah!

## LOVE NOT THE WORLD August 15th, 2019

>***As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy… (1 Corinthians 15:48\).***


Our opening verse refers to those who aren’t born again as earthy; that means they’re of this world. All they know is in this world; that’s their life. This is the reason for the failures of men; it’s traced to the fallen Adam. This is why Jesus said, *“...Ye must be born again”* (John 3:7\).


If a man continues with the life with which he came into this world from his parents, he’ll be a failure, no matter how hard he tries. It makes no difference what wealth he enjoys, he’ll still become a failure. There’re people who got to the zenith of their career; they became powerful and influential, but at some point, they realized there was more to life.


Jesus said to His disciples, *“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”* (Mark 8:36\). He was telling them to be careful not to put their attention in this world. This world may offer you everything, but it’s not enough. What God offers is the best and it’s all you need.


1 John 2:15 says, *“Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.”* Sadly, there’re those who love the world and the things of the world, even after they’ve become Christians.


 For example, in 2 Timothy 4:10, we read about Demas. He was one of Apostle Paul’s co\-labourers in the Gospel. But read his pathetic end in the words of Paul: *“For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica….”* Demas worked with Paul and saw the great miracles wrought by the Spirit through Paul, but he compromised along the line. He deviated from the way and life of the Spirit, because he loved the world. The same thing happens to many people today. Paul the Apostle declared: *“I am crucified unto the world, and the world is crucified unto me”* (Galatians 6:14\). This ought to be your persuasion and consciousness.


Come to that point in your life, in your spiritual growth, where your only passion is the expansion of God’s Kingdom; where Christ—His love and His soon return—is all you desire and live for.

## DIVINE WISDOM August 16th, 2019

>***Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding (Proverbs 4:7\).***


1Corinthians 1:30 says Christ has been made unto us wisdom; insight granted us by the Spirit of God to understand knowledge. We read in our opening verse: *“…with all thy getting, get understanding”;* that’s the insight of knowledge. By that, you’ll know how to judge the voices you hear and put the principles of God’s Word together and know what steps to take.


With this divine insight, it makes no difference what your field is—your business or profession—you’ll always be a success! You’ll always talk, act, and live beyond what you see, knowing exactly what to do at any given moment, irrespective of the situation.


Think about this: a group of prophets who had invited Prophet Elisha to come with them to Jordan to get house beams seemed to be in a dilemma. One of them, as he was hewing wood, lost an axe head; a heavy metal. It fell into the river. He cried out to Elisha and said, *“...Alas, master! for it was borrowed”* (2 Kings 6:5\). Then Elisha asked, “Where did it fall?” They then pointed out the exact spot where the metal fell and sank into the waters.


 Forthwith, Elisha did something most unusual and unexpected: He cut a stick off a branch, threw it at the spot where the axe head had sunk, and the heavy metal floated to the surface! How did Elisha know what to do to get the metal out?


He had insight of knowledge; spiritual understanding. It’s the will of God for every one of us to function with such divine insight. No wonder He prays that we be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding (Colossians 1:9\).

## BEYOND HUMAN ABILITIES August 17th, 2019

>***And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power (1 Corinthians 2:4\).***


That you have a gift of the gab or have your way with words doesn’t mean you’ll be able to persuade sinners to be saved or turn them to righteousness. Beyond one’s intellectual prowess, charisma or ability to persuade others with enticing words, there’s a spirituality of ministry that must be understood.


Being an effective Christian or minister of the Gospel has nothing to do with your human ability; your ability and competence must be by the Spirit! The Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, expresses this clearly for us in 2 Corinthians 3:5\-6: *“Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God. He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant\-\-not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life”* (NIV).


Life in the Kingdom, and our service to God, have to be by faith, through the power of the Holy Spirit. That’s why the greatest sermons in the world may never change anybody’s life. The wisest words may never change the hardest of hearts. The greatest communicators of the world may never be able to go into the deepest core of the human nature, no matter how smartly they communicate; no matter their choice of words! Without the Holy Spirit, it’ll all be lifeless.


It’s the Spirit that “quickeneth”; that means gives life. Zechariah 4:6 says, *“...Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.”* Hallelujah! 1 Corinthians 4:20 (NKJV) declares, *“For the kingdom of God is not in word but in power”;* the power of the Holy Ghost!


Prioritise fellowship with the Holy Spirit and meditation on the Word. That’s where you get more acquainted with Him to know His will, with power to walk accordingly, and be an effective witness for the Lord.

## THE TIME IS SHORT August 18th, 2019

 >***And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken (Luke 21:25-26).***

***And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken (Luke 21:25\-26\).***


Deliberate cruelty, violence, terrorism, man’s viciousness and inhumanity to his fellow man, are on the rise today. Statistics show that not only is the world more wicked and in a more desperate situation, the pressures of life are greater today than ever before.


This is a clear indication that we’re in the last days, which Jesus gave us a hint about in our opening scripture. World leaders remain perplexed and completely at a loss as to how to solve these myriads of problems. Sadly, more and more people are looking up to them for answers or for solutions, which they surely can’t provide. But we have the answer: the solution is Christ and His glorious Gospel.


Jesus said, *“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”* (Matthew 24:14\). He didn’t tell us that everybody will believe; but it’s our job to tell the whole world. We’ll be held accountable for the information at our disposal.


Therefore, we must, with unfettered urgency of the Spirit, preach the Gospel to the whole world. The dark places of the earth are filled with the habitations of cruelty, but we’re the light to a dark world. We bear the light of the Gospel. Therefore, light up your world with the Gospel.


Jesus said in Matthew 5:16, *“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father, which is in heaven.”* In Mark 16:15, He further emphasized, *“...Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.”* Take this mandate seriously.


Your dreams must go beyond yourself; take up the course of the Gospel. Put in your time, resources and energy, and preach it with much urgency until it reaches the ends of the earth!

## MAKE HIS WORD KNOWN August 19th, 2019

>***For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts (Malachi 2:7\).***


In Christ, we’ve been made kings and priests unto God (Revelation 1:6\). We have a ministry in Christ as king\-priests of God, and in our opening verse, we read that the priest’s lips should keep knowledge. That means your lips should flow with the knowledge of God, to teach others the ways and life of the Kingdom.


The Living Bible Translation renders the latter part of our opening verse beautifully. It says, *“...The priests are the messengers of the Lord Almighty, and men should come to them for guidance.”* Then in 1 Peter 4:11, Peter writes, *“If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man ministers, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.”*


If anyone wants to know something about God, they should come to you. They should find the Word of God and the knowledge of the Lord in your mouth. You’re the custodian of divine knowledge, and of Kingdom information.


2 Corinthians 2:14 says, *“Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.”* God spreads the beautiful and pleasant fragrance of His knowledge through us, in every place. It’s your ministry, calling, and responsibility to make His Word known to the world.


Therefore, in the marketplaces of life—in your neighborhood, estate, place of work, everywhere— preach and teach the Word. Make pupils of those in your sphere of contact; teach them about God and the Kingdom\-life.

## BUILD YOUR LIFE WITH THE WORD August 20th, 2019
![August 20th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/rhapsody%2020.jpg)

>***Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever (1 Peter 1:23\).***


Christianity is an exciting life—a life of victory through the Word. In true Christianity, you don’t need to struggle to please God, because the Holy Spirit helps you live the faith life that pleases Him. All you have to do is pay attention to Him through the Word. Live in, and by His Word.


When you live according to the Word of God, you won’t need to keep watching your life to know whether or not you’re pleasing God. It takes faith to please Him (Hebrews 11:6\), and faith is acting on the Word.


The Lord Jesus described for us the life and wisdom of the one who acts on God’s Word. According to the Master*, “He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock”* (Luke 6:48\).


It parallels what James 1:22\-25 says: *“But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.”*


When your life is built on the Word, you’ll forever stand strong and tall, even in the midst of the harshest of storms. The Word of God will make you what God wants you to be, without you having to struggle. Remember the words of Jesus in Matthew 4:19; He said, *“...Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.”* All they had to do was to follow, and He’ll make them a success. The Word will keep you in health, strength, and victory, and you’ll experience unprecedented progress, peace and prosperity in your life.

## IT’S ABOUT YOUR LOVE FOR HIM August 21st, 2019
![August 21st, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2021.jpg)

 ---

>***For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead (2 Corinthians 5:14\).***


The Apostle Paul, in our opening verse, wasn’t talking about Christ’s love for us, but our love for Him, and how that love compels us to stand in, and with the truth of the Gospel—no matter the opposition. The love Paul had for Christ was the drive behind his overwhelming passion to preach, and defend the truth of the Gospel.


Read Galatians 2:11\-21 NKJV and see how Paul defended the truth of the Gospel, even to Peter. He said, *“Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy…”* (Read the entire reference up to the 21st verse).


In the 20th verse, he submitted, *“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me”* (NKJV). What a conviction! It’s about your love for Him!


That love must be the controlling thought, the guiding principle of your life. It shouldn’t matter how intense or fierce the opposition is; you must, without hesitation, stand in defence of the Gospel of Christ!


How much do you love Him? If in your heart, you think your love for Him isn’t strong enough, what you need to do is simple: open your heart to Him in prayer, and tell Him, “Lord Jesus, I love you; I really do, with all my heart, and forever, this is what I want to do—loving you and doing your Word.” As you make that confession of your love to Him, you’ll experience a great motivation, and your passion for the Gospel will be increased.


Your love for Jesus Christ means more to God than anything you could ever give Him. So, love Him with all your heart, and prove it in keeping His Word. Hallelujah! (See John 14:15 \& 21\).

## ETERNAL LIFE: YOU HAVE IT ALREADY August 22nd, 2019
![August 22nd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2022.jpg)

 >***And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life… (1 John 5:11-12).***
---
***And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life… (1 John 5:11\-12\).***


The Lord Jesus said in John 5:26, *“For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.”* In our opening scripture, we read that God has given us eternal life. Many think of eternal life as a promise from God, but it isn’t. It’s your present\-hour possession in Christ. You have eternal life NOW!


When you were born again, you received the life and nature of God into your spirit; it happened in real\-time. That eternal life, which is the life and nature of God, ought to have an impact in your physical body. That’s what the Bible says: *“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies…”* (Romans 8:11\).


The verse above became a reality in your life the moment Christ took up His abode in you. Thus, your hitherto death\-doomed (mortal) body was vitalised. Oh, that the Church would major on this reality! This has to become something you’re conscious of every day.


 John writes in 1 John 5:13, *“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life….”* Eternal life is in Jesus Christ; it’s the life that He gives everyone who believes.


The reason some may be struggling with their health is their lack of understanding and consciousness of eternal life. Eternal life isn’t subject to sickness; it’s death and disease\-proof! Your physical body has become the living tabernacle of a living God. Do you know what that means?


The Word declares: if Christ be in you, though your body be dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness (Romans 8:10\). In Colossians 1:27, Paul declares: “…Christ in you, the hope of glory.” Blessed be God!

## APPRAISE YOUR SOUL-WINNING EFFORTS August 23rd, 2019
![August 23rd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2023.jpg)

>***Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you\-\-unless, of course, you fail the test? (2 Corinthians 13:5 NIV).***


The Message Translation renders our opening verse beautifully. It says, *“Test yourselves to make sure you are solid in the faith. Don’t drift along taking everything for granted. Give yourselves regular checkups….”* This is one of the things you must learn to do for yourself as a Christian; having an honest self\-appraisal of how far you’ve grown and are growing in your faith\-walk.


For example, you should be able to appraise yourself on your soul\-winning efforts. You ought to do this from time to time. Review your convictions about the Gospel. If you’ve been a Christian for a long period, and you’ve been receiving the Word, it’ll be inappropriate for you to require cajoling or “encouraging” to actively win souls for Christ. You should be self\-motivated through the Spirit.


Remember, the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the only hope for the world today, and no sacrifice could be too great for this course. Paul said, *“…woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!”* (1 Corinthians 9:16\). So, have an honest assessment of your involvement in soul winning. Don’t say, “It’s for the Pastors and leaders of the Church”; no! It’s the personal responsibility of every Christian. Therefore, set personal targets for the number of souls to win for Christ and do it.


 It’s like what we read in the parable of the sower; Jesus said, *“…A sower went out to sow”* **(**Matthew 13:3 NKJV). The seeds sown, which fell on good ground produced a harvest*: “…some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold”* (Matthew 13:8\). The Word that was sown “brought forth!” The question then is, at what level are you “bringing forth”; reproducing souls for the Kingdom?


Are you still at the same “thirty\-fold” level of soul winning that you were when you initially gave your heart to Christ? You should move to the hundred\-fold level. In other words, be all out for the Gospel as though it depended on you alone to reach the whole world. That’s the right attitude you must have for the Gospel.


Review and increase your commitment to the Gospel; and as you increase your commitment, the Lord will grant you more grace for greater effectiveness and capacity to win more souls to Christ. Hallelujah!

## KINGDOM LIFE THROUGH THE WORD August 24th, 2019

>***For the Kingdom of God is not just fancy talk; it is living by God’s power (1 Corinthians 4:20 NLT).***


God’s Word is so powerful; it enlightens and unveils the Kingdom of God to your spirit. As you study and meditate on the Word, there’s a communication between your spirit and the Spirit of God.


The more of God’s Word you have in your spirit, the greater the understanding of the Kingdom of God you’d have, and the more real that Kingdom would be to you. You’ll become Kingdom\-conscious, walking and living the Kingdom\-life “now.” Through the knowledge deposited in your spirit, you’ll function with Kingdom principles, and superimpose those principles upon this world and all its circumstances.


Always take the ministry of the Word seriously. Consciously invest time, energy, resources, in the education and training of your spirit. In our ministry, we have a vast reservoir of faith\-building teachings for the development and edification of your spirit. Order these materials, which are available in different formats. Subscribe to The [**Pastor Chris Digital Library**](http://pcdl.co) and have access to audio and video messages that’ll transform your life and teach you to have Kingdom\-consciousness, and help you live an ever\-winning, victorious, and triumphant life.


That’s not all! You must also help, and keep helping the lost in your world to come into the same divine experience—this Kingdom\-life of triumph. It’s our responsibility to spread this message around the world.


We’re called to pull men out of darkness, into the Kingdom of light, and this is what Jesus came for: *“For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost”* (Luke 19:10\). We’re the ones making His dream come to fruition today. Hallelujah!

## HE’S ALWAYS TALKING August 25th, 2019
![August 25th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2025.jpg)

 ---

>***Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me (Revelations 3:20\).***


Sometimes, perhaps in a fellowship meeting, there’re those who, in anticipation for a word of prophecy, a vision or the demonstration of the gift of the Spirit, become bemused when they don’t experience such.


However, reading 1 Corinthians 14:32 (NLT) gives an idea as to what the issue could be sometimes. It says, *“Remember that people who prophesy are in control of their spirit and can wait their turn.”* If you or someone had a word of prophecy and wouldn’t give it, God’s got nothing to do with that; He’s not to blame.


Often, people think, “If God gives me a word of prophecy, He’d by default take over my vocal faculties and let it out!” That’s not how it works; you have a role. That you have a word of prophecy to exhort, edify, and comfort others doesn’t negate your own will to either speak or choose not to speak.


We always have to be bold and smart spiritually to pick God’s signals and declare the same as He gives us utterance. He’s always talking, but you must train your spirit to become sensitive to Him and always attuned to His frequency. That way, as He’s talking, your spirit can easily pick up the signals from Him, with the will to utter the same in prophecy.


It’s not enough to know how to hear Him with your heart, you must also learn to speak forth those words. So, don’t keep quiet or suppress it when you have words of prophecy bubbling inside you. If it’s in a general meeting, wait for the appropriate time and indicate that you have a word, or, when the call is made for anyone who has a word, be bold to indicate that you do. You may be asked to write it. However, abide by the guidance of the leaders of the congregation.


Always remember that when you commune with the Lord, He’s sure to minister back to you words that are consistent with the Scriptures, but you’ll have to bring forth those words He put in your heart, by faith (See Romans 12\).

## SOWING THE WORD August 26th, 2019
![August 26th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2026.jpg)

 ---

>***A sower went out to sow his seed… (Luke 8:5\).***


The Lord Jesus gave a parable of the sower in Luke 8, saying, *“A sower went out to sow his seed…”* (Luke 8:5\). Then in the eleventh verse, He explained that the seed the sower sowed was the Word of God. However, something striking to observe is the fact that He didn’t say, “The sower went in to sow his seed.” Rather, He tells us “He went OUT to sow the Word!”


This lets us know that we have a ministry of the Word to those outside; we must go out to sow the Word. It reminds of the “great Go,” the great commission, in Mark 16:15\. The Lord said, *“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” Then in the 20th verse, it says, “And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.”* They went out to sow the Word, to preach the Gospel.


Out in the world is where the sinners are; that’s our mission field: the hedges, the busy crossroads of life—where you have the rendezvous of broken humanity. Our job is to take the Gospel to them, for that’s the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes.


Therefore, no matter what you do, sow the Word; preach the Word. Win souls now, more than ever, because the time is short. Be dauntless and resolute in your soul\-winning efforts. Let nothing dissipate your passion for lost souls.


You might say, “What if they don’t listen to me?” Don’t worry about that. Jesus already told us about the different responses we might get when He narrated the parable of the sower (Read Mark 4:4\-8\). There’re those who’d certainly listen to you, and the Word will produce fruits of righteousness in them. This should be your joy and focus.


It’s our responsibility, irrespective of the responses we get, to sow, and keep sowing the Word. The Lord has given you a bag of seeds—His words in your spirit; don’t keep it to yourself. Go out and persuade the lost; tell them about the great love the Father has bestowed on them through the Gospel.


2 Corinthians 5:11 says, *“Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men....”* You’re God’s agent of salvation—specially enlisted in His workforce—ordained to turn sinners from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.

## MAINTAINING ORDER August 27th, 2019

>***Let all things be done decently and in order (1 Corinthians 14:40\).***


John 6 records for us an amazing miracle Jesus performed. He had just finished teaching a crowd of about five thousand men (women and the children not counted). Seeing that the crowd had been with Him for long, some of the disciples requested that He sent them away, so they could get food for themselves.


However, Jesus asked, “What do you have?” Andrew answered, *“There’s a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish. But that’s a drop in the bucket for a crowd like this”* (John 6:9 MSG). Jesus ignored their doubts and, instead, told the disciples to have everyone sit on the grass and settle in for a meal.


Jesus couldn’t do anything for them in that rowdy condition; He requested for some orderliness. He said, *“…Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand”* (John 6:10\).


In your life, learn to maintain order. The Spirit doesn’t thrive in an atmosphere of chaos. As long as there’s disorder in your spirit, you can’t walk effectively with the Holy Spirit. He’s not the author of confusion (1 Corinthians 14:33\).


If you want to have a miracle, then you need order. This is the missing element in the lives of many, and they wonder why the miraculous eludes them. Never find yourself, in one way or the other, walking disorderly; that is, walking at cross purposes with the Word of God. Follow the prescribed order of things; follow the Word. Do things the Word way if you want divine results.


Consider that the Lord cautioned Moses to build the tabernacle, following the prescribed order (Hebrews 8:5\). You can’t do things your own way; God’s things must be done God’s way. He won’t honour you if you’re out of order.


Maintain order, and see things move. You won’t have to struggle to get things done. As long as you’re walking in the light of God’s Word, according to His mode of operation, you’ll always have His honour and grace.

## GLORYING IN TRIBULATION August 28th, 2019
![August 28th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2028.jpg)

 >***Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned… (2 Corinthians 11:23-25).***

***Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned… (2 Corinthians 11:23\-25\).***


The Apostle Paul experienced great deal of tribulations during his ministry. He was severely persecuted. Read our opening scripture again; He faced death at different times, and at a point, he was abandoned by all his friends while in prison (2 Timothy 1:15\).


Nonetheless, in spite of all that he suffered for the sake of the Gospel, he penned such inspiring words in Romans 5:3, part of which says, *“…we glory in tribulations….”* Blessed thought! Meaning that there can be hard times, but they’re for our glory. Hallelujah! It’s a reiteration of what James said in James 1:2, *“My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.”*


No matter the trouble, no matter the tribulation that you face, rejoice. Whatever challenge you may be facing today is tailor\-made for you; it’s for your promotion and glory. Therefore, let not your heart be troubled. Things may seem tough and difficult today. Outwardly, it may look as though your confessions of the Word and commitment to the Gospel aren’t yielding any result; remain unflustered! Keep your focus on Christ and His eternal Word.


I love the inspiring way Paul puts it in 2 Corinthians 4:16\. He said, *“For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.”* We’re indestructible. He continued in verses 17 and 18: *“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”*


Hold on to the Word. Like Abraham, against hope, believe in hope (Romans 4:18\), knowing that no matter what happens, you’ll win. Romans 12:12 tells us to rejoice in hope and be patient in tribulation. The night may be dark and long, but guaranteed: joy comes in the morning. Glory to God!

## YOU’RE A ROLE MODEL August 29th, 2019
![August 29th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2029.jpg)

 >***Brethren, together follow my example and observe those who live after the pattern we have set for you (Philippians 3:17 AMPC).***
---
Daniel 12:3 says, *“And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament….”* The word translated “Shine” here in the Hebrew is “zahar” and it means, among other things, to inspire. So, you’re called to inspire others; to give leadership. You’re a role model.


That’s what Jesus meant when He said, *“Ye are the light of the world...”* (Matthew 5:14\), and as earlier inferred, light gives leadership. This lets you know your calling as a Christian. But the question is, how are you inspiring others?


It’s something spiritual. It’s not about how many want to dress like you or wear your kind of hairdo. If that’s all that’s inspiring about you, it’s not good enough, because those are fleshly things. Let people be motivated by the move of the Holy Spirit in your life. Let those around you be inspired by the love of God and the wisdom of God that flow out of you.


For example, it was declared concerning Daniel that *“…an excellent spirit was in him…”* (Daniel 6:3\). He had excellent wisdom. It should be the same about you. Let the light of God and His wisdom be seen in you, so much so that when you speak, great drops of wisdom effuse from you to bless people.


The Apostle Paul made the profound and audacious statement we read in our opening verse. Can you say the same thing to those around you? Notice he didn’t say, “Pattern your life after God,” even though that’s implied; rather, he said, “Follow my example.”


Have the same consciousness, because you’re the God\-man, the Christ\-man in your world today. You’re a light in a dark world; so, shine ever so brightly. Inspire your world. You’ve been empowered for it. Train and inspire others in the way of the Lord; be an example and a mentor to others. Let men see your good works and glorify the Lord.

I’m the light of the world, sent forth to illuminate my world. This is my calling in life, and I know it. I’m a role model; everywhere I go, I shine like the brightness of the heavens, inspiring men and women to righteousness. Glory to God!

## RELATE IN LOVE August 30th, 2019

>***Be tolerant with one another and forgive one another whenever any of you has a complaint against someone else. You must forgive one another just as the Lord has forgiven you (Colossians 3:13 GNB).***


In today’s world, winds of intolerance are blowing strongly. It’s common to find those who can’t control their temper. Little things infuriate them and make them exhibit such anger that’s unbecoming of Christians. They’d make such comments as, “I can’t stand that brother or sister.” You could even hear their persistent complaints and whining about the Church premises: “I can’t stand this place; it’s just somehow; I don’t think I’ll keep coming to this Church.” They have people, places, and things they can’t tolerate. Don’t be that way!


But think about it: The Bible says, *“By his (God’s) spirit he hath garnished the heavens…”* (Job 26:13\). The Holy Spirit created the whole world and beautified the Heavens, yet He’s so humble and so gracious to come live in you. In all His greatness and magnificence, He considers you qualified to be His house, His living tabernacle. In spite of your imperfections and idiosyncrasies, He still loves you. Why then should you, for whatever reason, say you can’t stand someone else? Why should you resent or find anyone repulsive?


 If the Holy Ghost could come to live in you, then be humble. Emulate Him, for the Bible says, *“Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us…”* (Ephesians 5:1\-2\). Let Him be your focus. If you love Jesus, it’ll show in your relationship with others.


Our theme verse says, *“Be tolerant with one another….”* Be humble to accommodate and tolerate your brothers and sisters in Christ. The Bible says no one should *“...think of himself more highly than he ought to think...”* (Romans 12:3\). God expects you to think highly of yourself, but you’re not to exalt yourself above others.


If you found yourself exhibiting traits of resentment and intolerance, consciously re\-culture yourself with the Word. Be sure to only give vent to the love of God in your life.

## BUILDING THE CHURCH OF CHRIST August 31st, 2019
![August 31st, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2031.jpg)

>***And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matthew 16:18\).***


The Church is important to Jesus Christ. Ephesians 5:30 says, *“For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.”* The Church is His body. So, when He said, “I will build my church,” He was talking about the body of Christ, and that’s you and I; all our brothers and sisters around the world. But how can He build His church when He’s gone to heaven?


The Bible says, *“And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ”* (Ephesians 4:11\-12\). The word, “edifying” here is “building.” So, the purpose of the five\-fold ministry gifts is building the body of Christ. He’s building His body through us.


As we all commit to soul winning, leading men and women to Christ in our respective spheres of contact, we’re building God’s powerful super structure! Remember, when Solomon was building God a house, he sent a message to Hiram and said, “Please send me materials. The house that I want to build for God is a magnificent building” (Read 1 Kings 5\). But you know what? The magnificence of the body of Christ today is even greater. Hallelujah!


The Bible says we’ll not give Him rest until He makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth (Isaiah 62:7\); until the Church of Jesus Christ is shown to be the most beautiful living thing on the face of the earth. Glory to God!


Moreover, as a member of that body, it doesn’t matter where you’ve been; you’re being built strong; your faith is growing; you’re getting stronger by the day! He said in Acts 20:32**,** *“And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.”*

I’m a member of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones! My faith is built strong to repel the adversities of life, and I triumph gloriously today and always. The Lord is building His body through me, by my vital participation in the spread of the Gospel. Praise God!
