## TOO BLESSED TO BE UNDER October 1st, 2019
![October 1st, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%201.jpg)

>***According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust (2 Peter 1:3\-4\).***


Some Christians are forever asking God for one thing or the other in prayer. It’s either they’re sick, asking for healing, or they want a financial blessing. But if they’d study the Word of God, and truly receive it into their hearts, their lives will be totally different.


God chose you to be the helper, a blessing to other people. Never did He intend for you to be “needing” or asking anything of Him. He already gave you all things. We read it in our opening scripture. It’s wonderful to have a miracle of financial supply, but how about being in superabundance, such that you’re not conscious of need or supply?


That’s exactly our status and estate in Christ! We’re heirs of God, and joint\-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17\). 1 Corinthians 3:21 says, “...all things are yours.” Read 2 Corinthians 9:8 (AMPC) and see God’s desire for you. It says, *“...God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self\-sufficient \[possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].”*


The moment you say “Yes” to the scriptures we just read, you’d have a new mindset, and live the higher life in Christ. There’s a life beyond healing; it’s called divine health. That’s the life we have in Christ; you were born with it.


Understand who you are as a new creature; you’re too blessed to be under! The world truly belongs to you. Refuse the beggarly life. Why should you be asking God to give you something out of the world that He’s already blessed you with?


You have the advantage! Rather than seeking a blessing, come to the awareness and understanding that you’re the seed of Abraham, and you were blessed to bless the world: *“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ”* (Ephesians 1:3\). Glory to His Name forever!

## BE ACTIVE IN A LOCAL CHURCH October 2nd, 2019
![October 2nd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%202.jpg)

 ---

>***Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching (Hebrews 10:25\).***


Upon receiving salvation, one of the first things the Spirit of God does for you is to bring you into the house of God, to be a member of a church. Church membership is compulsory. You can’t be a “floating” Christian; you must be a stable member of a local church.


The Church is your place of refuge and security. The Bible tells us that the Church is the pillar and ground of truth: *“But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth”* (1 Timothy 3:15\). The only place to hear the voice of truth and encouragement is the Church.


The enemy knows the power and import of being an active member of a local church, which is why he tries to cut people off from the Church and sow hatred in their hearts against the Church.


Never allow the enemy or anyone pitch you against the Church, because that’s where your strength comes from; that’s where you have people always praying for you. Think about it: the first people that God uses in blessing you are people who know you, or who are associated with you, such as your brothers and sisters in the Lord. Even when they don’t know you personally, because they’re associated with you, God puts words of blessings in their mouths for you. As they pray in the Holy Ghost, they intercede for you, according to the will of God for your life (Romans 8:26\-27\).


Your membership in a local church is a strong support system for your spiritual growth and effectiveness in the Kingdom of God. Therefore, be a vibrant and active member of a local church.

## UNDERSTANDING THE RULES OF PRAYER October 3rd, 2019
![October 3rd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%203.jpg)

 ---

>***And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint (Luke 18:1\).***


Why does God want us to always pray? It’s because it’s His intention to always answer our prayers. This should excite you to always pray; to take advantage of the privilege and opportunity of prayer, which, essentially, is a Spirit\-to\-spirit communication in divine fellowship.


Sadly, what many know about prayer is asking God for things. They see prayer as an avenue to beg or “force” God to do something for them, as though He’s unwilling. But that’s not the purpose of prayer. God isn’t against us; so, when we pray, we’re not trying to convince Him to do something He’s not inclined to do. Rather, we’re siding with Him in bringing His will to pass.


Furthermore, the Bible shows that there’re different kinds of prayer, with different rules governing each kind. Most Christians are acquainted with the prayer of faith. The prayer of faith is quick; it’s the kind of prayer you can pray on the go. But there’re lots of issues and challenges in this world that won’t go away by the prayer of faith. Such situations or issues require some passionate supplication for the desired change to take place. We read about this kind of prayer in James 5:16\-18 (AMPC); it’s heartfelt and continued.


You may say, “But prayer is prayer”; no, prayer isn’t just prayer. You can’t apply the rules for the prayer of faith for the prayer of intercession; it won’t work. It’s one of the reasons people don’t have answers to their prayers; they’re praying the wrong way about their situation.


If, for example, any football player other than the team’s goalkeeper, within his own penalty area, deliberately handles the ball when in play, such a player will be penalized. The referee won’t overlook the infringement, because you can’t apply handball or basketball rules to football.


Study the Word to know, and apply the right rules for the different kinds of prayers and you’ll surely have results. Get our books titled, **“How To Pray Effectively”** and **“Praying The Right Way”** to learn more about the different kinds of prayer and their corresponding rules. They’ll enrich your prayer life.

## HIS POWER AT WORK IN YOU October 4th, 2019
![October 4th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%204.jpg)

 ---

>***Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen (Ephesians 3:20\-21\).***


The Holy Spirit is the creator; He’s the doer of God’s work. Everything God does is through the power of the Holy Spirit, who today, lives in us and is active in and through us.


From the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came to the earth to carry out His ministry, and He’s been here ever since. So, today, God isn’t working or “doing” anything for us from heaven; He does whatever you ask or desire of Him according to His power at work in you. The Bible says He has ceased from all His works (Hebrews 4:10\).


What about Jesus? Is He in heaven working? No; He’s seated; resting (Ephesians 1:20\). That means when people pray and ask God for things, and believe He’s “doing” something about it, He really isn’t. However, we do understand when a miracle happens that it’s His power at work.


Think about it this way: when the government of any nation does something, credit or blame is given to the president. But the president had nothing to do with it in essence; the designated offices were responsible for the work, based on the authority given to them by the president. However, we may give credit to the president, because it’s his policies and authority that effected it.


Likewise, the power of God is available to you, and through that power, God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that you can ask or think. He can do far beyond your requests, expectations, and imaginations, through His power inside you. Become God\-inside conscious. Recognize and use His awesome power at work in you to your advantage. Hallelujah!

## WORDS ARE “THINGS” October 5th, 2019
![October 5th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%205.JPG)

 ---

>***But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God (Acts 20:24\).***


Things” in the scripture above is translated from the Greek word “logos,” which is translated “word” in John 1:1: *“In the beginning was the Word….”* In the verses preceding our theme verse, there had been prophetic “words” about the fierce persecutions the Apostle Paul would face in Jerusalem. In spite of everything that had been said, Paul submitted, *“None of these things move me....”* He referred to the words that had been spoken as “things.”


He could have as well said, “None of these words move me.” That’s because in the Kingdom of God, words are things; they’re like spiritual particles; spiritual substance, and have spiritual tangibility. Every word that comes out of your mouth is a “thing” that’ll never be destroyed, because it’s of spiritual origin. When it goes out of you, it represents you everywhere. The only thing that can destroy and render it powerless is another word from you.


Jesus said, “Any word that you speak that’s useless, you’ll give account of it in the day of judgement” (Matthew 12:36\). That tells you the power and importance of words; they’re of spiritual value. How you form and use them is your responsibility for which you’ll give account.


So, as a child of God, your life is really up to you. You create your situation, either good or bad. If you know that the last ten years haven’t been as beautiful as God would have them, you can change things now, and recreate your next ten years to be what God has destined for you.


It makes no difference what your struggles in life have been; you can recreate your world, by your words. Jesus said you shall have what you say (Mark 11:23\). That’s where your life, and the power to shape it aright is—words! Speak the right words (God’s Word) about your life and situation.

## THE LIFE OF CHRIST AND HIS CALL ON YOUR LIFE October 6th, 2019
![October 6th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%206.jpg)

 ---

>***I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love (Ephesians 4:1\-2\).***


The word “vocation” in our opening scripture means “calling.” When you came to Christ, you answered the call. It’s a holy and high calling. You were separated from the world, unto Christ. That’s the reason the Church is called, “The called\-out ones.”


Now, the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, admonishes that you walk worthy of your calling in Christ. You’re to live in a way that’s befitting of someone God has chosen to be His. In other words, live like a Christian!


And who is a Christian? He’s one in whom Christ dwells! You’re to walk in the light of this truth. You’re not “walking worthy” of His call on your life if you permit sin, sickness or failure. You must say “No” to these, and all the works of the evil one. If you’re experiencing challenges in your health or other areas of your life today, it’s not prayer you need. Simply say, “No” to the devil and his works in your life. Insist that your life is for the glory of God, and maintain your confession.


The Bible says, “*That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus”* (Philemon 1:6\). Acknowledge the life of Christ in you, and His call on your life. 2 Thessalonians 1:11 says, *“Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power....”* Hallelujah!

## BE GOD-INSIDE MINDED October 7th, 2019
![October 7th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%207.jpg)

 ---

>***Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4\).***


The Christian is the God\-man; one in whom Christ literally dwells. Knowing this, therefore, you must be God\-inside minded; the greater One lives in you, meaning that you have nothing to fear in life. This was the Apostle John’s mentality, and it should be your mindset as well. In 1 John 5:4, he said, *“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world….”*


It doesn’t matter what’s out there in the world; you’ve overcome them all because you’re born of God, and Christ lives in you. You’ve overcome every force, every power—everything that’s against you.


In John 16:33, Jesus said, *“These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”* God’s Word is spiritual law. If He says you’ve overcome the world, with its troubles, failures, and darkness, then you have.


Acknowledge and walk in the reality of your divine life in Christ; who He’s made you, and all that He’s bequeathed to you. Reign and rule over circumstances. Refuse and reject anything that’s inconsistent with the life of Christ in you.


Let the evidence of the indwelling Christ be seen in the quality of life you live. Let it be a testimony to those around you that indeed, there’s a higher life in Christ, and you’re living and enjoying that life. Hallelujah!

## YOUR MOUTH AND YOUR DESTINY October 8th, 2019
![October 8th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%208.jpg)

 ---

>***For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say…and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith (Mark 11:23\).***


Of all the natural gifts given to us by God, the ability to speak or use words is the greatest. That’s what controls and determines everything else about your life. You’re what you say; your words locate you and determine your destiny.


In our opening verse, we read the words of Jesus; He said, “You shall have what you say.” Proverbs 18:21 says, *“Death and life are in the power of the tongue….”* Whether you live or die, depends on your mouth, the words you speak. The Lord Jesus affirmed the same thing. He said, *“…by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned”* (Matthew 12:37 NIV).


The primary reason for your mouth is to steer your life in God’s direction for you. Today, you’re either in prosperity, health and abundance, or in poverty, sickness and want as a result of the words you’ve been speaking. The Bible says a wholesome tongue is a tree of life (Proverbs 15:4\).


1 Peter 3:10 declares, *“For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.”* It’s that simple: you can have a great life and enjoy your days in God’s blessings and goodness if you’d use your tongue aright. It’s about what you say!


Speak wholesome words—words that are consistent with your nature and heritage in Christ. It makes no difference the condition of your life right now; you can recreate your world. The Lord already gave us precedence to follow. Read Genesis 1; He brought order and form to a hitherto chaotic world, through the power of speech, revealing what we can, and are supposed to do with words.


You’re made in God’s image and likeness. Therefore, if you think there’s darkness in any area of your life, proclaim the Word. The Word of God is light, and as you speak, the light of God will manifest and completely obliterate the darkness.

<details>
  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, I thank you for the gift and power of speech. My life is beautiful, excellent and full of glory. My words are wholesome, because I’m taught by the Spirit to speak life and wisdom all the time. I’m fulfilling your purpose for my life gloriously, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## A GOSPEL OF LIFE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS October 9th, 2019
![October 9th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%209.jpg)

 >***For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith… (Romans 1:16-17).***
---
***For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith… (Romans 1:16\-17\).***


From our opening scripture, we observe that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God to bring sinners out of sin, into the life of righteousness. His righteousness is revealed in the Gospel. Therefore, there’s no other way for man to be ushered into, learn about, receive, or understand the righteousness of God outside the Gospel.


Thus, the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the Gospel of righteousness. What is righteousness? It’s the nature of God, which you received at the New Birth, and it’s one of the cardinal gifts of God (Romans 5:17\). Furthermore, the Bible tells us that through the Gospel, life and immortality have been brought to light (2 Timothy 1:10\). What kind of life is it referring to? It’s eternal life, the God\-life.


1 John 5:11\-12 says, *“…and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life….”* This transcendent life, with the gift of righteousness, was imparted to you in Christ, through the Gospel. According to the Scriptures, you’ve passed from death to life, from mortality into immortality, from age into agelessness. How profound this is!


Eternal life is the life with agelessness. Age makes the body grow old, weak and die. But because of eternal life, your strength is renewed day by day; you’re growing, but not ageing. It’s part of the glorious impact and blessings of the life of Christ in you. Hallelujah!

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
I’m the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus and I have the life of God in me.

## WE HAVE THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST October 10th, 2019
![October 10th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2010.jpg)

 ---

>***And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power (Colossians 2:10\).***


When you received the Holy Spirit, you received the fullness of God. There’s nothing of God that’s supposed to be in you that’s not already in you. This is too sublime! No wonder, you’re unconquerable. You’re not a mere man. Your humanity was supplanted by the life and nature of God.


We have something in our day that the prophets and priests of the Old Testament didn’t have: The capacity to contain the fullness of the Spirit. You’re God’s living tabernacle; when you move, it’s the Spirit of God moving in you. Your hands have become His hands, and your fingers, His fingers; you’re immersed in Him and He in you. He sees through your eyes, talks through your mouth, and moves with your body. He changes lives through you! Hallelujah!


The Bible says in John 1:16, *“…of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.”* We have received in all fullness, everything that’s of deity in Christ Jesus. This isn’t just in measure, but in quality and in the variety of potentialities available in Him. All of His power, glory, might, strength and wisdom—everything that He represents, everything that’s contained in Him—we’ve received!


Imagine what your life would be if you lived every day with the consciousness that, indeed, you’re replete with God; full of Him! Jesus said in John 5:26: *“For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given   to the Son to have life in himself.”* Jesus didn’t need more life from God; He had inherent life. But recall our opening verse; it says, “Ye are complete in Him,” meaning, all that He’s got, we‘ve received.


You’ve received of His ability, wisdom, knowledge, glory, and have been made an associate of the God\-kind. No wonder John submits in 1 John 4:17, *“...as he is, so are we in this world.”* Glory to God!

## THREE IMPORTANT FACTORS FOR SUCCESS October 11th, 2019
![October 11th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2011.jpg)

>***Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches (Proverbs 24:3\-4\).***


Our theme verse highlights three vital elements for building a successful life: wisdom, understanding, and knowledge. It says with wisdom, a “house” is built; house here could be likened to your life, business, career, family, or any enterprise. It goes further to say that the house, once built, is established by understanding; and then by knowledge, you bring riches into it.


Wisdom is the insight of knowledge, insight into the secrets and mysteries of life. The Bible says in Proverbs 4:7 that wisdom is the principal thing, the capital you need for whatever you want to achieve in life: *“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.”*


Notice that it doesn’t stop at enjoining you to get wisdom; it goes further to say, “Along with wisdom, get understanding.” Spiritual understanding is just as important as wisdom in building a successful life. You may have the wisdom to start something, but you need understanding to establish it, and then knowledge of how to make consistent progress from glory to glory.


In Colossians 1:9, the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, prayed for us to be filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. Knowledge here is exact or full knowledge of God. Through this kind of knowledge, you make your life glorious: your life (the house) is filled with all precious and pleasant riches.


Wisdom, understanding, and knowledge go together. You need all three to be effective and to live the extraordinary life of success, dominion, victory and excellence that God has ordained for you.

## YOUR FAITH IS THE VICTORY October 12th, 2019
![October 12th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2012.jpg)

>***…and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith (1 John 5:4\).***


In life, there’re adversities. Jesus said in John 16:33, *“…In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”* It makes no difference what the situation is; take advantage of God’s extraordinary power in overcoming life’s adversities by expressing your faith. Your faith is the victory that overcomes the world.


However, faith not expressed, won’t prevail. James 2 verses 17 and 26 lets us know that faith without corresponding action is of no effect: *“For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also”* (James 2:26\). You express your faith in words and actions. An example is the account in Mark 10:46\-52 of blind Bartimaeus; he repeatedly cried out to Jesus for healing. You’d have expected the Master to heal him right away, but that wasn’t what happened.


When Jesus eventually came face\-to\-face with the blind man, He asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The Lord could see that the man was blind, yet He needed him to act his faith.


When you study the ministry of Jesus, you’d discover He always wanted people to express their faith. So, when the blind man said to Him, “I want to receive my sight,” the Lord went ahead and healed him. Don’t cry or complain to God about your situation; express your faith!


Jesus said if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you can achieve anything; nothing shall be impossible unto you (Matthew 17:20\). And you already have faith, for the Bible says He’s dealt to every one of us the measure of faith (Romans 12:3\). Act on the Word. When you pray, rejoice, knowing you’ve received. That’s faith!


God doesn’t mind challenges coming your way, since He knows He’s already made you an overcomer. 1 John 4:4 says, *“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”* Cheer up; the victory is yours already. Hallelujah!

Blessed be God! In Christ, I’ve got the victory; I’ve overcome the world, its systems, economies and economics. I’m galloping in a perpetual victory parade. Through me, the knowledge of Christ spreads everywhere; my triumphs of faith effuse exquisite fragrance of His glory in every place. And as I live in God’s Word, I’m guided and inspired by His wisdom to fulfil His perfect will for me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## A CALL OF HONOUR October 13th, 2019
![October 13th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2013.jpg)

 ---

>***Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified (Romans 8:30\).***


Being born again, God’s call on your life is that of honour. The Bible says, “For many are called, but few are chosen” (Matthew 22:14\). You’re among the chosen of the Lord. Therefore, don’t cast away the call of God on your life; it’s the only insurance for your future.


Many today are seeking honour from the wrong places. But Hebrews 5:4 says, “And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.” Only the Lord calls you to honour. It doesn’t matter what honour you try to get for yourself, and from where, it won’t work; you can’t honour yourself.


True honour is in serving the Lord, living for Him, and honouring what He honours. Therefore, always be glad and full of praise for the opportunities He gives you for service. Don’t treat them lightly, because your whole life is about that call.


If you do things that are inconsistent with that call, they’ll all turn to emptiness eventually. The only thing that matters to God is His call on your life and how you fulfil it. All the honour you have, and could ever get, is about that call.


Give attention to the Word of God, and His call on your life, that you fulfil it. Make the decision to follow the Spirit, not your flesh or the world, not your personal desires. Serve the Lord truly and wholeheartedly, and He’ll fill your life with His beauty, grace, glory and honour. Hallelujah!

## GOD’S SUPPLY SYSTEM October 14th, 2019
![October 14th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2014.jpg)

 ---

>***I lift up my eyes to the hills\-where does my help come from? My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth (Psalm 121:1\-2 NIV).***


When it comes to your finances, you must see the Lord as your source; otherwise, you’ll struggle financially. You must understand that being an heir of God and a joint\-heir with Christ, you’re plugged to an unending supply; never think or talk lack. Be supply\-conscious; not supply from men, your employer or the government, but from God. His supply system is nonstop. But if you focus on men or your salary, that’s a system that fails.


Many have gone into depressing situations because their “source” failed, and the supply stopped; but it’s not so with God’s supply system. Consider Elijah: God instructed Him to get away from Ahab and hide by the Brook Cherith, and commanded ravens to feed him every morning and evening. He also drank water from the brook.


However, after a while, the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land (1 Kings 17:7\). Imagine if Elijah’s trust or focus was on the brook and the ravens, and not the Lord Himself. He probably would have gone into frustration when the brook dried up.


At that time, God prepared a widow at Zarephath to take care of him (1 Kings 17:9\). This should tell you something: take your eyes away from men, your job or business; they’re channels. God is your source; focus on Him, because it’s up to Him to choose which channel to use.


If, for instance, your cable company or satellite TV service provider disconnects you, it doesn’t matter what channel you want to watch, it won’t work. But God is your “service provider,” therefore, focus on Him and not the channels. He’ll orchestrate things in your favour and see to it that you walk continually in abundance.


Use the Word for your finances. David said, *“The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want”* (Psalm 23:1\). You have unlimited access to God’s inexhaustible riches. Hallelujah!

  <summary>Prayer</summary>

## FULFILLING YOUR CALL October 15th, 2019
![October 15th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2015.jpg)

>***And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it (Colossians 4:17\).***


Every Christian is called of God and has a divine destiny to fulfil. This doesn’t mean we’re all called into the five\-fold ministry offices of Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers, but each of us is called to fulfil a ministry in the Gospel.


Jesus said in Mark 16:15, *“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”* Your union with Christ and partnership with Him in the Gospel is the greatest thing on the face of the earth; far greater than anything money can acquire.


That’s why it’s important that you know Him truly, and serve Him with your spirit. Pleasing Him, and fulfilling His destiny for your life should be your life’s pursuit. It’s like what we read about Moses; the Bible says he *esteemed “…the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward”* (Hebrews 11:26\).


Moses didn’t live in Jesus’ day, but he had a revelation of his divine call. Through him, God delivered (saved) the children of Israel from Egypt. The Lord is counting on you; He’s committed His glorious Gospel to your trust. He’s called you into the ministry of reconciliation. 2 Corinthians 5:18\-19 says, *“… and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.”*


Esteem His call to win souls and live for Him, irrespective of circumstances, more than the treasures of this world, and fulfil it!

## REFUSE TO BE OFFENDED October 16th, 2019
![October 16th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2016.jpg)

 ---

>***A man’s wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offense (Proverbs 19:11 NIV).***


Every day, we’re presented with opportunities to be offended. Offences will come, according to the Bible. People will do things that may hurt or offend you, but it’s entirely up to you to decide whether or not to be offended.


In Mark 7, the Syrophenician woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit could have been offended at Jesus’ statement. She had cried after the Master for help, and in their ensuing dialogue, Jesus said, “Woman, it’s not right for us to give the children’s bread to dogs” (Mark 7:27\).


The woman could have said, “How could He call me a dog, just because I’m asking him for help? Is this how He talks to people?” But no; she was smarter than that. In a remarkable display of humility, she replied, *“...Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs”* (Mark 7:28\). Consequently, she got her miracle!


Why wasn’t she offended by the Master’s statement? She had the heart of a true worshipper! As a true worshipper, you don’t care what anyone calls you, says to you or about you; you don’t care how anyone treats you. All that matters to you is your love for the Lord and your desire to please Him.


Always remember that it’s to your glory to overlook an offence. Don’t say, “I can’t take that insult for any reason!” You’ve been decorated with honour and kingdom dignity; no one, and nothing, can dishonour you.


This was the Apostle Paul’s understanding when he said, *“For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities…”* (2 Corinthians 12:10 ESV). Glory to God!

## AVOID WRONG ASSOCIATIONS October 17th, 2019
![October 17th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2017.jpg)

 ---

>***Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them (Romans 16:17\).***


As a Christian, it’s so important that you avoid wrong associations. Keep away from people that try to corrupt your spirit with negativism, because it’s poisonous to your spirit. The Bible says, *“…evil communications corrupt good manners”* (1 Corinthians 15:33\).


Oftentimes, your association could determine whether you’ll be productive or unproductive. You’d consciously have to put away those things or people causing you distractions, to make much progress in life. If you keep company with murmurers and complainers, you’re going to be where they are. So, don’t “sit where they sit”; be different. Be positive and excited about life.


There’re different ways Satan can come into people’s lives to mess things up; he can come through distractions, wrong influences, or wrong associations. It’s therefore important that you protect your spirit from corrupt influences.


Avoid people who peddle rumours, bad news, and only see the negative side of everything. When you separate yourself from distractions, you’re more focused and your fellowship with the Holy Spirit will be enriched. It’s like “refining gold”; removing the leftover impurities after the smelting process, so as to unveil the beauty of the pure gold.


As you identify and eliminate the sources of distractions in your life, your life becomes more inspiring. You become a source of progress and prosperity to others. Praise God!

## HE RESPONDS TO FAITH October 18th, 2019
![October 18th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2018.jpg)

 ---

>***And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us (1 John 5:14\).***


Our opening scripture isn’t referring to whether or not your request is consistent with the Father’s will. Rather, it’s talking about having a hearing before the Father. If you pray according to God’s will for prayer—His will for asking—you’ll be heard.


God has a will—a design or plan—for prayer. His will for prayer is that you pray in the Name of Jesus; otherwise, you won’t be heard, even if you cry day and night.


Recall the account in Matthew 9, of two blind men who followed Jesus, crying, *“Son of David, have mercy on us”* (Matthew 9:27\). Jesus didn’t say anything to them. They kept wailing and yelling, following Him; yet, He didn’t respond. Eventually, He asked them, “Believe ye that I am able to do this?” And they replied, “Yes, Lord, we believe” (Matthew 9:28\).


The Bible says, *“Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you”* (Matthew 9:29\), and walked away. You’d have thought because of their persistent crying, the Master would oblige them immediately, but no; He’s moved by your faith, not your tears.


On another occasion, a woman cried after Him until the disciples were disturbed, and said to Him, “Master, she’s crying after us; send her away” (Matthew 15:23\). Jesus ignored her, until she stopped crying, and started worshipping (Matthew 15:25\). It’s not about how much you cry; you have to act on the Word.


You can cry in worship and fellowship as you channel your emotions towards God; that’s okay. But crying from pain, sickness, or as a result of trouble in your job or business, hoping God would respond, won’t change anything.


The knowledge of His Word is what you need because His will is unveiled in His Word. The more you speak in tongues, and study the Word, the more His will is unveiled to you. Praise God!

## ENHANCE THE MINISTRY OF ANGELS IN YOUR LIFE October 19th, 2019
![October 19th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2019.jpg)

>***Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father (Galatians 4:1\-2\).***


Oftentimes, when people read the underlined portion of the scripture above, they think it only refers to human leaders. But no; it includes angels.


Angels protect and watch over you to ensure your wellbeing, and they report to the Father in heaven. However, when a Christian walks in the flesh and against the Word, angels also have the right to wield the rod of correction.


In the Gospel of Luke, the Bible describes for us the Archangel Gabriel’s visit to Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist. The angel told him he’d have a son, but Zechariah doubted him, saying, “*...Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years”* (Luke 1:18\).


The response provoked the angel, and he smote Zechariah with dumbness until the child was born. The angel disciplined Zechariah for daring to doubt his message. Angels minister for us; they run errands for us, but they have authority to take certain actions.


This is why, as a Christian, you must be careful in your life. Refuse to be rude, proud or arrogant. Don’t disregard spiritual authority and instructions. Angels frown at such things. The Bible specifically tells us to respect authority, because of the angels. Many are facing certain challenges in their lives that wouldn’t go away; and it’s because they’re walking against God’s Word. Until and unless they make a change, there’ll be no solution.


Walk in the wisdom of God by acting on the Word. Honour and revere those the Lord has placed over you to teach and raise you up spiritually. Be quick to act on spiritual instructions. Walk in love. These will strengthen your spiritual effectiveness and enhance the ministry of angels in your life.

## FEED YOUR FAITH, NOT YOUR FEARS October 20th, 2019
![October 20th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2020.jpg)

>***…It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God (Matthew 4:4\).***


In today’s world, people are more particular about what they eat. While some eat the right foods to stay healthy, there’re those who, from eating all the wrong things, have put their health in jeopardy. It’s the same thing spiritually. As a Christian, you must feed on the right information. You must feed your faith with the Word of God. Some Christians would rather feed their fears than feeding their faith. You feed your fears when you give attention to wrong or noxious information.


The food for the human spirit is God’s Word. Jesus said, *“Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God”* (Matthew 4:4\). Whilst God’s Word makes the human spirit come alive—buoyant with faith, hope and love—unwholesome words poison and destroy the human spirit.


The effect of feeding on wrong information in the life of a Christian may not be seen overnight; but with time, such a person gets weaker and weaker spiritually. Before long, he’s no longer as fervent in spiritual things as he used to be. Then, his life takes a completely different turn from God’s original plan.


Give attention to the right information. Fortify and energize your spirit for success with God’s Word. The forces of life are domiciled in your spirit; as you feed your spirit with the Word, you’ll be able to produce every good thing you want in life from within you. Jesus said, *“A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things”* (Matthew 12:35\).

## PRINCIPLES, RELATIONSHIPS, AND ACTIONS October 21st, 2019
![October 21st, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2021.jpg)

>***For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword… (Hebrews 4:12\).***


The human spirit is influenced by three important factors: principles, relationships and actions. These factors control your plans, your purposes, and your pursuits in life. What you’d be in life would depend on these three, one way or another.


Now, let’s examine each of them, starting with principles. A principle is a moral rule, belief or assumption that controls, influences or explains personal conduct or behaviour of a society. It explains how or why something works or happens the way it does.


People can have their own principles, which they created for themselves consciously or unconsciously as individuals. Sometimes, those principles could be from their families or society. For instance, some people don’t believe in God, because of certain ideas in their minds, principles they’ve imbibed that now run their lives. Whether or not they know it, those principles are going to decide their destinies.


 


The second factor is relationships. There’re different kinds of relationships: Biological, geographical, emotional, spiritual, etc. The family you come from, those who live around you—your association with them every day—has an influence on your life. This includes your relationship with your friends, those that make you happy or sad, your relationship with God or the devil, as the case may be. All these, whether or not you knew it before now, have already affected you either positively or negatively.


Lastly, your actions. Not many realize that their actions have consequences. You may do something today and think, “Well, I already did it; it’s over with; let’s move on.” But it’s not only about now; it’s about the impact that action may have on the rest of your life.


In all of these, employ the wisdom of God. Let the Word of God and the Holy Spirit shape your principles, inspire your relationships, and guide your actions. We read in our opening verse, the power and efficacy of God’s Word. It has the capacity to eliminate anything that’s inconsistent with God’s plan and purpose for your life, whether it’s a principle, relationship or action. Glory to God!

## REMAIN FOCUSED AND AFIRE FOR THE LORD October 22nd, 2019
![October 22nd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2022.jpg)

>***But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God (Acts 20:24\).***


Our opening verse above is as inspiring as it is instructive. It reveals the kind of mindset you must have in the face of adversities. 2 Timothy 3:12 says, *“Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”*


When you’re effective in the things of God, there’re those who’ll surely criticize you and say demeaning things about you. However, you must remain undaunted. Refuse to allow their criticisms or malicious acts quench your zeal for the Lord and His work. Remain focused and afire for the Lord and keep doing what He’s called you to do.


You’re a city set on a hill that can’t be hidden (Matthew 5:14\); that means you’re supposed to attract attention. While there’re those who’ll be inspired by your passion and commitment to the Lord, some may despise you for it; but it makes no difference. Just keep serving the Lord, and faint not.


The opinions of others about you don’t count; you should only be concerned about the Lord and His Word concerning you. He doesn’t want you bothered about the challenges that come your way. Rather, He says, *“Consider it wholly joyful, my brethren, whenever you are enveloped in or encounter trials of any sort or fall into various temptations”* (James 1:2 AMPC).


Like the Apostles in the early Church, relish every opportunity to be criticized or persecuted for your commitment to Jesus Christ. It’s an indication that you’re effective and making remarkable progress in the direction of His calling for your life. The Bible tells us that after the apostles were beaten and threatened, they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for Jesus’ sake (Acts 5:40\-41\).


Even the Lord Jesus was criticized by the Scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees, but He was unmoved. As you diligently serve the Lord, Satan will stir up trouble against you, but like the Apostle Paul, declare, “None of these things move me,” and keep pressing on from glory to glory. Amen.

## YOU’RE OF A DIFFERENT BREED October 23rd, 2019
![October 23rd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2023.jpg)

>***Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? (2 Corinthians 6:14\).***


In the verse above, the Apostle Paul used an interesting analogy to distinguish our relationship with unbelievers. He said, *“Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers….”*


When you have a situation, for example, where two cows are yoked to pull a plough, that’s an “equal” yoking. However, a situation where a cow and a horse are yoked is an “unequal” yoking. One will likely be dragged along and impede the progress of the other. This is what Paul tries to explain.


As a Christian, someone who isn’t born again shouldn’t be your strongest ally or most dependable confidant; that’s a wrong association; an unequal yoking*. “...what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness”* (2 Corinthians 6:14\)? The Christian is called righteousness, while the non\-Christian is called “unrighteousness.” To further make the difference clearer, the non\-Christian is called darkness, while the Christian is called light.


If you think that isn’t strong and differentiating enough, read the 15th verse; the non\-Christian is called “Belial,” which represents the devil, while the Church, of which you’re a part, is called Christ. Glory to God!


Aren’t you just glad you’re born again? You’re different from the rest of the world. You see with the eyes of God. You think the thoughts of God. You’ve gone past the carnal level of life. You’re God’s man; the bearer of His righteousness, glory and grace. You’re of a different breed; the divine breed.


Therefore, as the Bible says, *“…come out from among them, and be ye separate…”* (2 Corinthians 6:17\). You’ve been sanctified by the Spirit; separated to God for His divine use; holy and undefiled.


This is why we preach the Gospel and pray for non\-Christians around the world. It’s so they would be converted and translated into the same glorious life we have in Christ. Hallelujah!

## YOUR FOUNDATION FOR A GREAT LIFE October 24th, 2019
![October 24th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2024.jpg)

>***The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows) (John 10:10 AMPC).***


The struggles and stress that some Christians go through are unnecessary. Ponder on our opening scripture again; Jesus said He came so that you may have and enjoy life. What a consolation this is!


It means you can have a great day, every day, irrespective of the work you do and what the situation may be. It’s a choice you have to make. Moreover, there has to be a deep and intimate passion in you to know and understand God’s Word.


You’re not going to have a great life by you merely saying, “Okay, I’ve decided I’m going to live a good life,” no. This isn’t about positive\-thinking; it’s about the Word of God; your response to, and use of the Word in the simple matters of life. The Word has to be your basis or foundation for a great life; otherwise, it won’t happen.


Jesus gave the parable of the man that built his house on sand, and the one that built his house on the rock. The house built on sand couldn’t stand the harsh pressures of life; it came to ruin. But the house built on the rock was impregnable to the crises of life (Matthew 7:24\-27\).


The foundation of your life must be solid; be sure that it’s the Word of God. You couldn’t wish to be a medical doctor, and not study for it in a medical school; you’ll never be a doctor. Likewise, you must study, and understand the principles of life as revealed in God’s Word, to be a success.


The Bible says, *“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby”* (1 Peter 2:2\). That’s where it starts: growing by the Word. From there, you go on to maturity: *“Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God”* (Hebrews 6:1 NIV). Hallelujah!

## INDEPENDENT OF EXTERNAL FORCES October 25th, 2019
![October 25th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2025.jpg)

 ---

>***Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content (Philippians 4:11\).***


The Greek rendering of the word “content” in our theme scripture is “Autarkes,” from where the English word, “Autarchy” is derived. Autarchy is the policy of economic independence on external forces; to be self\-sufficient. In 2 Corinthians 9:8 (AMPC), we see that it’s God’s will for us to walk in this level of self\-sufficiency. It says, *“And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self\-sufficient \[possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].”*


This is easy to accept, believe and understand, when you truly know who the Christian is: he’s one in whom Christ dwells, and Christ is everything. When you have Christ, you’re full; you’ve arrived; you have it all. But not many have come to this understanding.


I came across the foregoing verse as a teenager and made up my mind to have it actuated in my life. I chose to walk in the light of it, and it’s been my life ever since. Make up your mind to live in blessings and abundance, because it’s the life God has given to you in Christ.


Refuse to allow the circumstances of life to dictate your response. Live by God’s Word. Be absolutely independent of circumstances, such that no matter what happens, you’re always on top. You’ve become an oasis of love in a troubled world. There could be chaos everywhere, but you’re unruffled; only making progress, and moving forward. Hallelujah!

## THERE’S MORE TO PRAYER October 26th, 2019
![October 26th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2026.jpg)

 ---

>***Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints (Ephesians 6:18\).***


There’s more to prayer than asking God for your needs. The word “Prayer” is a generic word, but many only focus on one of its synonyms, which is to ask or make requests. However, prayer is primarily fellowship with the Father through the Spirit.


Through prayer, we have the privilege and opportunity to exercise our authority in Christ; it helps us to activate and walk in the consciousness of the divine presence, and enforce the will of the Father in the earth. Thus, prayer is the exercise of the human spirit.


Due to the misconception of the purposes of prayer, many misunderstand Mark 11:24, where Jesus said, *“Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”* The Master didn’t say, “What things soever ye ask for, when ye pray”; rather, He said, *“...What things soever ye desire, when ye pray….”*


Jesus, in this verse, teaches us the power of faith, hope and love. The Father loves us so much, and Jesus wants us to trust in the Father’s love. At times of prayer, we can rest assured that our desires, borne by hope, are granted us, without even asking.


The Bible says, *“…for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him”* (Matthew 6:8\). He knows your heart. Really, why should you be asking Him for anything for yourself, when He already said, *“...all things are yours”* (1 Corinthians 3:21\)? Use your prayer times for intercession and other higher purposes of prayer.

## THE CONFESSION OF HIS LORDSHIP October 27th, 2019
![October 27th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2027.jpg)

 >***For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16).***
---
***For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life* (*John 3:16\).***


Ask some people, “How do you know you’re saved?” They’d say, “I confessed my sins”; but that’s not the Bible way to receive salvation. The principle for salvation isn’t the confession of your sins, but of the Lordship of Jesus Christ over your life. Nowhere in Scriptures is it stated that if you confess all your sins, you’ll be saved. How is that even possible, remembering all the sins you ever committed, and confessing them?


What you need is a new creation and that’s what you become upon confessing with your mouth, the Lordship of Jesus, believing in your heart that God raised Him from the dead. Romans 10:9\-10 says, “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” This is what ushers you into the new life in Christ.


One of the most remarkable salvation stories is that of Saul of Tarsus in Acts 9\. Before his conversion, Saul wreaked havoc on the early Church and persecuted Christians everywhere, until he had an encounter with the Lord. In 1 Timothy 1:13, he referenced his atrocious treatment of Christians before his conversion, calling himself a blasphemer, a persecutor and injurious. This same apostle, who later became Paul, gave us the principle for salvation in Romans 10:9\-10\.


The Ethiopian eunuch who was led to salvation by Philip in Acts 8:35\-39 wasn’t made to confess his sins, but to confess his faith in Jesus Christ. Therefore, we must help people understand that the affirmation of the Lordship of Jesus Christ is the Bible way to receive salvation.


Perhaps, you’re reading this and you’ve never been born again, turn to the Prayer of Salvation page at the back of this devotional and pray that prayer, meaning it with all your heart.

## EFFULGENCE OF HIS GLORY October 28th, 2019

>***Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17\).***


Jesus Christ is the effulgence of the Father’s glory; the express image of His Person (Hebrews 1:3\). And that’s exactly what He’s made us; we’re the effulgence of His glory, for as He is—the glory of the Father—so are we in this world (1 John 4:17\).


Jesus said, *“And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one”* (John 17:22\). This is extraordinary. If only you’d live with this consciousness every day! 2 Corinthians 3:18 explains it some more: *“But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”*


A mirror reflects whatever is set before it and the Word of God is a mirror. The image of you that it reflects is called “the glory of God.” What we read in John 17:22 is God holding up His mirror for you to see that you’re a partaker of His glory.


When Jesus walked the earth, He walked gloriously. He lived and manifested the glory of God. He walked on water, talked to the wind and the waves, unstopped deaf ears, opened blind eyes, healed lame legs, restored maimed limbs, and even raised the dead. We have the same ability within us to function likewise, because the same Holy Spirit that was the power and essence of Jesus lives in us today.


This has effectively removed you from the class of ordinary men; you’re an associate of the God\-kind. God chose you to be the one to show forth His praises and manifest His glory in the earth: *“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light”* (1 Peter 2:9\).

## EXPRESS LOVE NO MATTER WHAT October 29th, 2019

>***Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father (1 Thessalonians 1:3\).***


In expressing love to others, it’s not about what you stand to gain. It’s about your love for God and desire to do His will. So, even when it isn’t convenient, you have to walk in love. Even if those you love disdain you, continue to love them. Tell yourself, “I’m going to walk in love, no matter what.”


Ephesians 5:2 says, “And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.” To walk with God, you’d have to love like Him. 1 John 4:7\-8 says, *“Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”*


Walking in love is proof that you love the Lord. Therefore, let your life be the out\-shining of divine love.


Help those around you stand strong, and make their lives better. You’re called to be a blessing to your world. Today, consciously look out for opportunities to express God’s love.

## HEIRS OF ABUNDANCE October 30th, 2019

>***And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise (Galatians 3:29\).***


2 Corinthians 8:9 says, *“For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.”* What does this mean? First, understand that Jesus was never poor spiritually. Therefore, the foregoing scripture is referring to physical, material, and financial blessings. Jesus became poor for your sake so that you might inherit abundance.


This is simple to understand in line with the substitutionary works of Christ. God conferred our sins on Jesus on the Cross and conferred His righteousness on us at His resurrection. Likewise, Jesus took our poverty and made us heirs of His abundance.


All of God’s wealth and resources belong to you because the Bible says, *“…if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise”* (Galatians 3:29\). Romans 8:17 says, *“And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint\-heirs with Christ….”*


Read what the Lord said in Haggai 2:8: *“The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.”* If the silver and gold in the world belong to Him, then they belong to you; believe it, because it’s true.


In Psalm 50:10\-12, He said, *“For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine…for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.”* No wonder He said in 1 Corinthians 3:21, “…all things are yours.” How could anyone read this and still be living poor? You own the world and everything in it; let it dawn on you.


Reject poverty, and choose the joyful, prosperous life in Christ. Don’t see your job or business as your source of livelihood, but as a medium to bless others. Your prosperity is a settled fact. In Christ, you’ve been brought into the life of superabundance; acknowledge and enjoy your inheritance.

>***But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them (2 Corinthians 4:3\-4\).***


Sometimes, when we think of some people in certain conditions, we expect they’d want a change, but it’s not always the case. Some would tell you, “Please, let me be; I don’t need the Gospel; I’m okay.” But we know they’re not okay; so, we can’t let them be. We understand their problem; it’s clear in our opening text: *“...the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not....”*


They may do everything to stop us from bringing them the message, but we aren’t going to give up. We’ll keep praying for them and exploring every means possible to get the message to them.


In Ezekiel 3:17, the Lord said, *“Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore, hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.”* God has made you a watchman over the sinners in your world. Therefore, let the passion for soul winning be in your heart as a burning fire, shut up in your bones (Jeremiah 20:9\).


Never turn your back on those around you who are not yet saved. The Lord is counting on you for their salvation. Some may be hostile and unreceptive to the message, but don’t give up.


For many of them, all that’s required is a little more push; a little more preaching and time of intercession on your part! Surely, one day, just like the rest of us, they too would be catapulted from darkness to light, and into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. Hallelujah!

Gracious Father, I thank you for making me an effective minister of righteousness. I declare that Satan, the prince of the power of the air is rebuked, and his influence is broken in the lives of those to whom your children, all over the world, would be preaching the Gospel today. Thank you for testimonies of salvation recorded around the world, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
