## CHRIST OUR “REDEMPTION” July 1st, 2019

***In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace (Ephesians 1:7\).***


The word, “redemption” in the verse above is translated from the Greek, “apolutrosis,” which means deliverance, redemption, and more importantly, riddance. While these are synonyms of “apolutrosis,” it’s important to understand riddance in the context.


The Bible says, *“And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me”* (Psalm 50:15\). That’s God assuring His people of deliverance. But now, He has become your riddance, meaning that it doesn’t matter what trouble you get into; He plucks you out; He’ll rid you of that trouble.


Proverbs 12:13 says, *“...But the righteous shall come out of trouble”* (ASV). That means the righteous may or could get into trouble, but there’s a guarantee of deliverance: Christ! Christ is his deliverance! The mess you’re in could have been self\-inflicted or a result of misjudgements; Christ is your assurance that you’re coming out of the trouble, because He’s your riddance. Glory to God!


Christ being your redemption (riddance) means He makes up for your errors. Every mistake, every sin, has been laid to His charge. He’s obligated to save you. He’ll help you out of any quagmire, not because you earned it by your works or efforts, but because you have a ransom in Christ Jesus. He plucks your feet out of the miry clay (Psalm 40:2\). Hallelujah!


So, when you make a mistake or get into trouble, be bold to call on Him. He’s not intimidated by your troubles. No wonder the Psalmist said, *“But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble”* (Psalm 59:16\). He’s your deliverance and your Deliverer; your Rescuer; the One who plucks you out of trouble. Glory to His Name forevermore!

## YOUR SPEECH CONTROLS YOUR LIFE July 2nd, 2019
![July 2nd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%202.jpg)

***For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body (James 3:2\).***


Christian perfection or maturity is expressed chiefly in your mouth—your communication.


If you want to go in the right direction in life, your tongue is the compass. If you offend in words, that is, if your communication is unwholesome, your life will be in jeopardy. Your speech controls you.


Proverbs 18:21 says, *“Death and life are in the power of the tongue….” Jesus said, “…out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh”* (Matthew 12:34\). So, through your thoughts, your character is formed, but it’s expressed in your talk, in your words. Meaning, your thinking is your character; but your “talking” is your life. That’s how important your words are.


Romans 10:10 says, *“…with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”* It’s a principle. God said to Joshua, *“This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night…”* (Joshua 1:8\).


Meditate on the Word of God; keep it in your mouth. That means keep affirming the Word. No matter what’s happening around you, speak the Word. The Bible says, *“When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up…”* (Job 22:29\). Again, the emphasis is on what you say.


When things are rough and tough, you’re not to wait to be lifted; you have a lifting power; it’s in your mouth. With your mouth, you catapult yourself from obscurity to greatness! You lift yourself from the thraldom of inflation, austerity and lack to abundance. It’s about what you say! Declare that you’re supremely blessed, prosperous and walking in financial abundance, and your life will gravitate in that direction.


What is it that you want? It’s all in your mouth. Say it, and you’ll have it! That’s what Jesus said in Mark 11:23: *“For verily I say unto you…whosoever shall say…and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.”* Blessed be God!

## CHILDREN OF THE WORD July 3rd, 2019

***Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men (2 Corinthians 3:2\).***


Every Christian is born of the Word; meaning, we’re children of the Word. The Bible says, *“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”* (1 Peter 1:23\). So, you’re the Word in flesh!


This is what the Apostle Paul meant by us being “living epistles.” In 2 Corinthians 3:3, he said, *“Clearly you are an epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of flesh, that is, of the heart”* (NKJV). Today, anyone who wants to see the Word of God should look at you, for you’re the epistle of Christ! This is what the Church is—the Word in flesh!


The Lord Jesus was the Word of God tabernacled in human flesh. He was the epistle of God. He was the love\-letter sent to the world by God. The Bible says in John 1:14 that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.


The same Word that became flesh gave birth to us: *“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures”* (James 1:18\). We’re the offspring of the Word. We were born in the realm of the spirit to be like Jesus through the Word. Glory to God!


Your life is the life of the Word. You’re not an ordinary person. You may look like everyone else, but you’re different. You’re God’s message—His Word! Therefore, never look down on yourself.


You’re not born of the corruptible seed of man, but of God’s incorruptible seed. This is the reason the life in you is the God\-life; it’s the life of the Word. 1 John 4:4 says, *“Ye are of God…,”* meaning you’re born of God; you hail from Him; and God and His Word are one. Hallelujah!

## WE’RE ONE WITH CHRIST July 4th, 2019
![July 4th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%204.jpg)

***And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks (Acts 9:3\-5\).***


The scripture passage above is a clear reference to the inextricable oneness of Christ and the Church. Before his conversion, Saul wreaked havoc in the early Church and persecuted Christians everywhere, until he had an encounter with the Lord, who intercepted him and asked, *“...Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?”*


Jesus intimately identifies Himself with the Church. Read again, His words to the injurious Saul of Tarsus in our opening Scripture. The Master didn’t say, “Saul, why persecutest thou my followers?” Rather, He took it personal, because we’re of the same stock with Him. An attack on the Church is an attack on Jesus, because He’s the Vine, and we (the Church) are the branches. We have His very life; He brought us into union with Himself.


Always remember that anything you do for, or against the Church is unto Christ. Persecuting the Church is persecuting Jesus, because He’s the head of the Church: *“And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence”* (Colossians 1:18\). The head and the body go by the same Name—Christ! Thus, we’re members of the body of Christ.


Being born again, you’ve been baptized into the body of Christ. 1 Corinthians 12:27 says, *“Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”* As a member of the body of Christ, you don’t answer a name that’s different from that of the head or of the body, which is Christ. This is to help you see who you are, where you are, and what you have; you’re one with Christ.


When He was raised from the dead, you were raised up together with Him. Now that He’s seated on the throne, you’re seated together with Him in the place of dominion, glory and authority. Therefore, rule the world and dominate your environment with the glory of Christ!

## GET A “WORD-BATH” July 5th, 2019

***Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you (John 15:3\).***


Imagine a Christian waking up in the morning and turning on the TV to discover that the programme airing happens to be “Pastor Chris Teaching.” He gives it full attention till the end and then the next programme comes up, this time, it’s an unwholesome one for a Christian. Even so, he continues to watch.


When he’s done watching this, and several others after it (all with unwholesome contents), he’s too tired to pray or study the Word. He feels condemned and even begins to feel too “dirty” to go to church, thinking he’d need to “clean up” first. He could start praying, “Oh God, please revive me.”


For this Christian, it’s now very necessary to go to Church! His unedifying action could slow down his progress spiritually if it continues, but he needs an urgent Word\-bath! No one is ever “too dirty” for God. In our opening verse, Jesus said, *“Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you”* (John 15:3\).


It’s the ministry of the Word to cleanse you of sin, guilt, and all unrighteousness. So, don’t stay at home when you ought to be in Church because you thought you did something wrong that made you “too dirty” for God. Go to Church! He’ll clean you up! He does it through the Word.


 Jesus didn’t come for perfect men. Rather, He came to make men perfect. He specializes in changing imperfect people and bringing them to perfection. He raised an “unstable” person like Peter and transformed an injurious personality like Paul, who both became mighty apostles of the Gospel. If He’d do that, then He can cleanse and train you to become the best of you for His glory.


Submit yourself to the cleansing power of God’s Word. Study and meditate on the Scriptures. You might say, *“But I don’t know where to begin to even read the Bible.”* This devotional gives you a head start. Keep studying it, including all the indicated scriptural references.


In addition, meticulously follow either the one\-year or two\-year daily Bible\-reading plan. Before long, you’ll see a remarkable transformation in your life, and those around you will also attest to the grace and glory of God evident in your life. Praise God!

## “OGA-KATIKA-NENO” July 6th, 2019

>***Ninyi mmekwisha kuwa safi kwa sababu ya lile neno nililowaambia (Yohana 15:3\).***


Fikiria Mkristo anaamka asubuhi na kuwasha televisheni; na anakuta kipindi kilichoko hewani kuwa ni “Mchungaji Chris Anafundisha.” Anaweka umakini wake wote katika kufuatilia mafundisho hayo mpaka mwisho, na kisha kipindi kingine kikafuatia baada ya mafundisho ya Mchungaji Chris kuisha, mara hii kinakuwa ni kipindi chenye maadili mabovu na hakimfai Mkristo. Walakini, mtu huyo anaamua kuendelea kukitizama.


Pindi anapokuwa amemaliza kukitizama, na vipindi vingine kadhaa vilivyofuatia baada yake (vyote vikiwa na maudhui mabaya), anajikuta anauzito sana kuomba au kujifunza Neno. Anaanza kujihisi hukumu, na hata kuanza kujiona “najisi” kiasi cha kutokuweza kwenda kanisani, akifikiri kuwa anahitaji “kujisafisha” kwanza. Anaweza akaanza kuomba, “Ee Mungu, tafadhali nihuishe tena.”


Kwa Mkristo huyu, ni muhimu sana kwenda Kanisani Kitendo cha uamuzi wake wa kutazama vipindi visivyomjenga kinaweza kupunguza kasi ya maendeleo yake ya kiroho endapo tabia hiyo ataendelea nayo, kwa maana anahitaji kuoga kwa Neno haraka! Hakuna hata mmoja ambaye ni “mchafu kupindukia” ambaye anashindikana kwa Mungu. Katika mstari wetu wa ufunguzi, Yesu alisema, \*\_“Ninyi mmekwisha kuwa safi kwa sababu ya lile neno nililowaambia”\_\* (Yohana 15:3\). 


Ni huduma ya Neno kukutakasa dhidi ya dhambi, hukumu, na udhalimu wote. Hivyo, usikae nyumbani wakati ambao unapaswa kuwa Kanisani kwa sababu tu umefikiria kitu kibaya ulichokitenda na kuona kuwa kimekufanya kuwa “mchafu mno” mbele za Mungu. Nenda Kanisani! Atakusafisha! Analitenda hilo kupitia Neno


Yesu hakuja kwa ajili ya watu wakamilifu. Badala yake, Alikuja ili kuwafanya watu kuwa wakamilifu. Amebobea katika kuwabadilisha watu wasio wakamilifu na kuwaleta katika ukamilifu. Alimbadilisha mtu kama Petro ambaye alikuwa ni mtu wa “mashaka\-mashaka” na pia Alimbadilisha mtu aliyekuwa na utu wa kikatili kama Paulo \[Sauli], ambao wote walijakuwa Mitume wakubwa wa Injili. Endapo Aliweza kutenda hayo, basi anaweza Akakusafisha na kukufundisha namna gani ya kuwa bora kwa ajili ya utukufu Wake. 


Jinyenyekeshe katika nguvu ya utakaso ya Neno la Mungu. Jifunze na tafakari katika Maandiko. Unaweza ukahoji, “Lakini mimi sijui hata wapi pa kuanzia kujifunza Biblia.” Kitabu hiki kinakupa mahali pa kuanzia. Endelea kujifunza mafundisho ya kitabu hiki, ikiwemo na kumbukumbu zote za Maandiko zinazoorodheshwa.


Kwa kuongezea, kwa bidii fuata ama mpango wa kujisomea Biblia wa kila siku kwa kipindi cha mwaka mmoja au ule wa miaka miwili. Muda si mrefu, utaona mabadiliko ya kushangaza katika maisha yako, wale waliokuzunguka pia watashuhudia neema na utukufu wa Mungu ambao unaonekana dhahiri katika maisha yako. Atukuzwe Mungu!

## THE CHURCH IS CALLED “THE WAY” July 7th, 2019
![July 7th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%207.jpg)

 >***And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way… (Acts 9:1-2).***
---
***And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way… (Acts 9:1\-2\).***


From the underlined portion of the scripture above, we see that the Church was already being called “The Way” in the days of the apostles. It’s very interesting that the Church would be called “the way,” after Jesus said in John 14:6, *“…I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”*


This shows our inextricable oneness with Him. As He is, so are we in this world. We are today, the WAY to the Father, the WAY to His presence. Hallelujah! In Acts 22:4, the Apostle Paul, while narrating his persecution of the Church, said, *“I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison”* (NIV). Then again, in Acts 24:14, he said, *“However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect…”* (NIV).


They called the early Church, “The way.” The Lord, describing Himself said, *“I am the way”* (John 14:6\)! A new and living way was revealed in Jesus; and because we’re now the bearers of His message, we’ve become the way.


This is too much for the religious mind, but it’s what the Word shows. We’re the way to the Father! We’re not only to show men the presence of God but also ordained to usher them in. Blessed be God! Obadiah 1:21 says, *“And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD’S.”*


Note: it doesn’t say, “A saviour shall come up on mount Zion.” Rather, it says, “Saviours,” meaning there’d be many saviours from Zion, and we—the Church—are the saviours from Zion. We’re bearers of the divine order, carriers and dispensers of eternal verities. Praise God forevermore!

## THE ENERGY OF THE SPIRIT July 8th, 2019
![July 8th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%208.jpg)

 ---

>***Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily (Colossians 1:29\).***


In our opening verse, Paul refers to the inherent ability, the energy of the Spirit at work in him. This isn’t exclusive to Paul but to each and every one of us that has the Holy Spirit. Like Paul, be conscious of this divine energy at work in you.


It makes no difference what challenges you face in the course of your day; there’s a force—an empowerment—at work in you to blaze through the barriers. It’s the energy of the Spirit. The Apostle Paul referenced this same power in 2 Corinthians 3:5 when he said by the Spirit, *“Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.”*


We have a sufficiency; we have the ability of God’s Spirit at work in us because we have the light of God in us. The Bible says, *“…Christ in you, the hope of glory”* (Colossians 1:27\). The power of God is at work in you, coursing through your being. Become conscious of this.


The Apostle Paul was conscious of this divine energy working in him from within. The word he used in our opening verse for “working” is the Greek, “energeia” which refers to superhuman energy. Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, recognized that the “working,” the operational power of God, was in him. What a consciousness!


Have you come to the point in your life where you know and you can say confidently that there’s a superhuman power at work in you? You ought to know. You’re not labouring or striving by your physical might or human ingenuity, but by the energy of the Spirit.


This energy isn’t at work in you sparingly, but mightily, meaning that you can’t wear out! What a life you’ve got! Now you can further understand Paul’s submission by the Spirit in 2 Corinthians 4:16: *“For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.”*

My potentials are limitless, because I’m divinely endued to live the life of glory, according to God’s mighty power which works in me mightily!

## THE WAY TO THE FATHER’S PRESENCE July 9th, 2019

>***Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me (John 14:6\).***


The saddest day in human history was when Adam, having sinned against God, was driven away from the presence of God, together with his wife, Eve.


Man had been in fellowship with God, being in God’s image and likeness. The Bible says God sent an angel with a flaming sword to stay at the gate of the garden to disallow Adam from re\-entering the Garden of Eden.


Suddenly, man (Adam) discovers something: the rich fellowship that he had with God was over. That was the beginning of religion. Man began to do everything he could to get that divine presence again.


All the religions of the world today are seeking the same thing: the lost presence. Man had no way to get back into that presence, until Jesus came. He made a startling statement. He said, *“I am the WAY…no one comes to the Father, except by me!”* (John 14:6\). He’s the way to “the lost presence.”


This was what Adam needed. This was what Abraham, Moses, the Jewish Priesthood, all needed: the way to the Father’s presence! Jesus is that way! *“By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh”* (Hebrews 10:20\).


There’s no veil, no separation any more between us and the Father; He’s brought us into God’s presence, and the Bible says, *“In His presence is fullness of joy”* (Psalm 16:11\). There’s no joy like what you have in the presence of God. What a glorious life we have in Christ!


If you haven’t found your way into His presence, if you’re not yet born again, this is your moment! There’s no need to wallow in sin, defeat and ignorance any more. There’s no enmity between you and God any more. All you have to do is confess the Lordship of Jesus over your life, and your spirit will be recreated to begin an exciting life in His presence for eternity.

## BUILDING HIS TEMPLE July 10th, 2019
![July 10th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2010.jpg)

>***And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matthew 16:18\).***


In the Old Testament, there was the first tabernacle, built by Moses, and later, a second tabernacle that was built by Solomon. Then there was the third one and this time, Herod built it, and it was a magnificent temple.


Coming to the New Testament, the Lord Jesus was the first temple. He said in John 2:19, referring to Himself, *“…Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”* The second temple is you, for the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 3:16, *“Know ye not that ye are the temple of God…?”* Then, the third temple is the Church.


Just as it took Herod, a non\-Jew, and the Jews in his day, to build that third magnificent temple, it’s taking the “Jews” and “Gentiles” that have come into Christ to build this third temple—the Church. Each one of us is responsible for building this third temple, the present\-day Church.


For every new soul you lead to Christ, you’re adding another material in the building of this temple; you’re beautifying God’s house. This is what our sponsorship and distribution of Rhapsody of Realities, and all our other outreaches around the world are about! We’re building God’s temple. Hallelujah!


This is a job for every one of us; we’re co\-labourers with the Lord in building His temple: *“For we are labourers together with God…”* (1 Corinthians 3:9\). Take your service in the Gospel to a higher level. Allow no distractions whatsoever. Take your mind away from yourself. Think more about Him, and the expansion, the growth, spread and influence of His Kingdom.


He said in Matthew 6:33, *“…seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”* He already made everything you require for life and godliness available to you (2 Peter 1:3\). Therefore, focus all your energies and passion on joining Him to build His Church, touching and transforming lives around the world. Praise God!

## WE’RE FOR SIGNS AND SEASONS July 11th, 2019
![July 11th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2011.jpg)

 ---

>***And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years (Genesis 1:14\).***


How powerful the scripture above is! It’s not just dealing literally with the sun and the moon and the stars. Isaiah 8:18 further helps to explain it; it says, *“Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders.…”*


Then, in the New Testament, Hebrews 2:13\-14 refers to the prophecy of Isaiah above, stating that we’re for signs and wonders; signs and seasons. What does this mean? The words of Jesus in Luke 10:5 help make it clearer. He said, *“And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.”* This means you bring to that house a season of peace! Where there’ve been trouble, crises, and turmoil, when you show up, there’ll be calmness. Hallelujah!


The sixth verse says, *“And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it…”* (Luke 10:6\). Note: He said, *“Your peace shall rest upon them,”* because you’re a bearer of peace, the peace of Jesus Christ. He said in John 14:27, *“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you….”*


Peace is power over crises. So, everywhere you go, you calm the storm and effect changes. They may have been in distress before you came; the moment you show up, things change. There’s joy! There’s victory! There’s prosperity! Hallelujah!


That’s not all; you bring health as well; a season of health! Continuing further into verse 9 of Luke 10, Jesus said, *“And heal the sick that are therein….”* In that place where there’s been sickness and pain, you bring health! Jesus didn’t say, *“Pray for the sick therein”;* He said to heal them! He reiterated the same truth in Matthew 10:8\. He said, “*Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils….”*


You’re not ordinary. You’re a bearer and dispenser of divine verities. Have the consciousness that everywhere you go, you carry seasons of peace, seasons of love, seasons of health, hope, and gladness; seasons of blessings and miracles! Hallelujah!

## YOU NEED HIM TO FUNCTION July 12th, 2019
![July 12th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2012.jpg)

>***I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing (John 15:5\).***


It’s important to understand that nothing works without God. It doesn’t matter what your job is today, it’ll end in failure if God isn’t at work in you.


Man is a total failure without God. Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit and worked with the Holy Spirit, and He ensured we have Him living in us today.


No one can live the Christian life or do God’s work without the Holy Spirit, for it’s written, *“…Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts”* (Zechariah 4:6\). An extraordinary life, a glorious future, starts with you acknowledging the person and ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life. Jesus called Him *“The Father that dwelleth in me”* (John 14:10\).


The same Holy Spirit gave birth to us; He’s our Father—the Father that lives in us! Your consciousness of His indwelling presence will help you realize that indeed, all things are possible. Things that aren’t possible with men are possible with Him. He’ll make you an absolute success and a victor forever.


Think about the fact that not even Jesus could do without the Holy Spirit. He needed the Holy Spirit to function. All the great works He did were by the Holy Spirit. If Jesus needed the Holy Spirit, it then means you can do nothing without the Spirit. No wonder, God wants us to be filled with the Spirit always. Ephesians 5:18\-21 reveals how to get yourself constantly filled with the Spirit.


The Holy Spirit is God at work in us, building His Church through us. Recognize Him as your helper, and His ability will become your ability; His strength will become your strength. With Him, you can never fail or lose. He’s your guarantee of a life of absolute success, victory and dominion.

## KEEN TO DO GOOD July 13th, 2019
![July 13th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2013.jpg)

>***And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not (Galatians 6:9\).***


Nowadays, there’re those who have resolved not to be kind and helpful to others anymore. Why? They’ve had bad experiences, or seen other people who have been harmed or taken advantage of, in their bid to help others.


Our societies have become increasingly cruel such that many have shut their bowels of mercy and compassion. Many years ago, if you were driving and saw someone that was stranded, you were quick to help. But because of so much evil in the world today, many are more concerned about the danger of assisting strangers. This is what evil has caused.


Evil has brought hardness of heart to many. They want to help, but they don’t want to become victims at the end. But you see, you must never give up on doing good. Never be reluctant to help, for there’s power in you that far outclasses all the power of evil in the world, put together.


Greater is He that’s in you, than he that’s in the world. You’re not helpless. Think about Jesus: The servants of the High Priest came to arrest Him, and the Bible says, *“Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?* (John 18:4\). They said, *“Jesus of Nazareth,” then, He replied, “I am He”* (John 18:5\). Immediately, the power of God was released, and they all fell under the power! Why did that happen?


Just a short while before then, in Matthew 26, Jesus had been praying in the garden of Gethsemane, and the power of the Holy Ghost was surging through His being. When He said, “I am He,” the word went forth with power. He wasn’t empty. It’s the same with you. Your words are filled with power, because you carry divinity inside you.


What you need is the Spirit’s admonition in Ephesians 5:18: *“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.”* When you’re filled with the Spirit, you’d never have to bother about being victimized for doing good.


Therefore, before you hit the road or get about the day’s business, get filled with the Holy Ghost! He’ll lead and guide you through all the good things He’s put in your heart to do, and no one would be able to harm or deter you. Praise God!

## HIS LOVE—A COMPELLING FORCE July 14th, 2019
![July 14th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2014.jpg)

>***For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead (2 Corinthians 5:14\).***


Did you know that at the end of all things, the only thing that’ll stand is your love for the Lord Jesus? If you lived a whole life to be recognized by men, to be famous and have all that money could buy, but the Gospel of Jesus Christ wasn’t a compelling force in your life, you’d have lived an empty life.


The Lord Jesus said in Mark 8:36, *“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”* Then in Matthew 6:33, He said, *“But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”* What else could a Christian possibly live for, if not Christ and His Gospel? He’s all that counts. He’s the joy of heaven and earth.


As Christians, we’re not to be moved by anything else, but by Christ and His eternal Word. That means His Word doesn’t just come to you without impact; it brings a conviction to your heart and compels you to act; to do things that are pleasing to the Father. No wonder the Lord Jesus said in John 14:15, *“If ye love me, keep my commandments.”*


It matters that you’re compelled by the love of Christ to do the things that you do on earth. The Apostle Paul in our opening scripture shows us the motivational force behind his overwhelming passion for the Gospel; it was the love of Christ. He was constrained by this love to preach the Gospel, and do all that he did in furtherance of the Gospel.


Have the same consciousness. Make Jesus your focus, and be compelled by His love in all you do.

## HE DOESN’T TAKE AWAY BY DEATH July 15th, 2019
![July 15th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2015.jpg)

>***The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death (1 Corinthians 15:26\).***


In most religious circles, when funerals are being conducted, it’s common to hear the officiating minister say, “The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord.” But the Lord doesn’t “take away” by death. He’s the giver or author of life, and death isn’t from Him.


The Bible lets us know that death is an enemy, and refers to it as the last enemy that shall be destroyed. However, it’s already been defeated as the scriptures show us.


God never takes anybody away by death. The only people He took away from this world, He took them alive. Enoch, the Bible says, walked with God and suddenly, he was taken away from the earth by the Spirit of God—alive into heaven (Genesis 5:24\). Elijah was also taken away alive (read 2 Kings 2:11\).


What about Jesus? He too was taken away alive! And for those who believe in Him, they’re going to be taken away alive. Hallelujah! 1 Thessalonians 4:16\-17 says, *“For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”* This is how God “takes away”; it’s not by death. It’s called a translation.


Moreover, those whom God took away knew ahead of time. Enoch, the Bible says, before his translation, had the testimony that he pleased God. Elijah knew he was to be taken away and he discussed it with Elisha (2 Kings 2:9\-11\). The Lord Jesus was in a meeting with His disciples, after discussing with them, He levitated (Acts 1:9\). He had told them He was going to leave that way.


For the rest of us, we’ll have the same witness in our spirits that our departure is very close, so much so, we’ll be talking about it. There’ll be an urgency in the spirit and we’ll preach the Gospel with greater fervency, compelling men to believe in Jesus Christ. While we’re at it, suddenly, the trumpet will sound, and we’ll all be taken out of this world. Glory to God!

## WE MUST PREACH THE GOSPEL July 16th, 2019
![July 16th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2016.jpg)

 ---

>***Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great (Joel 3:13\).***


The wickedness and evil we see in our world are our opportunity to shine the light of the Gospel. The darker the world, the brighter our lights must shine, for we’re the light in a dark world (Philippians 2:15\).


A sinful and hurting world presents us with compelling opportunities to establish the righteousness of Christ. It’s our calling; we’ve got to do it! Bearing the light of the Gospel, we’re to turn men from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God.


Consider for a moment, the blessings of the Gospel for the poor and the despised; the afflicted and the downtrodden, and what promise it holds for them! How that a man who is as nothing, if only he’d receive Christ, would become a prince of power with God (1 Samuel 2:8\).


That’s what our God does; that’s what the Gospel does. No one’s valley is too deep; no one’s sin is too dark. He said in Isaiah 1:18, *“…though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”* Hallelujah!


 So, in looking at the world around you, have a new mindset, because Jesus came not for the righteous, but for sinners. He came to save sinners and make them sons of God. And we’re the bearers of the good news.


The world today has become so hopeless. Men have lost hope in the future; they’ve lost hope in just about everything. But there’s hope in Christ. And when we minister that hope, we’re not giving people some false hope, no; He proves His reality in the message that we preach.


We never minister alone; when we preach, the Lord confirms the Word. The Bible says, *“And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen”* (Mark 16:20\). Utilize every opportunity to preach the Gospel.

## GROW WITHOUT AGEING July 17th, 2019
![July 17th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2017.jpeg)

 ---

>***For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day (2 Corinthians 4:16\).***


Eternal life is the life with agelessness. When you received eternal life, you passed from death to life; from time into timelessness; from age into agelessness. In Christ, we grow; we don’t age.


It’s important you catch this, because the generation of the Church that catches this truth is the generation of the glory. The human body wasn’t made to grow old and die. In Bible accounts, some people lived to be over nine hundred years, some eight hundred, and others seven hundred and so on. But the number of years that man lived on earth progressively reduced because of sin, according to the scriptures.


However, the Bible says that Jesus Christ took the punishment for our sins, and died to save us. If indeed this is true; if indeed, He laid down His life for us on account of our sins, it, therefore, means that the problem of sin has been dealt with. In that case, the effect of sin should no longer continue.


As a result, man should no longer be a victim of age. His years should no longer be limited to 70, 80, or 120, because being born again, you’ve been brought into His glory and should be living a glorified life. You’re supposed to be a victor every day of your life. Nothing on earth should make you a victim; not even old age, because when you come into the zone of agelessness, you can grow without ageing.


Take Moses for example, the Bible says that at a hundred and twenty years of age, his eyes weren’t dim; his physical stature wasn’t abated: *“And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated”* (Deuteronomy 34:7\). Even though he could see that he was clearly an old man, his physical stature was strong.


He wasn’t the only one. At the age of eighty\-five, Caleb said, *“I am as strong today as I was when I was forty; therefore, give me this mountain”* (Joshua 14:7\-12\). Hallelujah!


Grow, but don’t age! Don’t be like those who are only forty\-two and they say, “You know I’m not so young anymore.” Christ makes you forever alive, strong, and effective. You have eternal life; meaning you’re in the ageless zone. Blessed be God!

## THREE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS July 18th, 2019
![July 18th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2018.jpg)

 ---

>***Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me (John 14:6\).***


People ask three important questions. Sometimes, they ask audibly or in their hearts. The first of these questions is about eternal life; we see this in Luke 18:18, where a certain ruler asked Jesus, *“…Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”* The ruler obviously knew something about eternal life; he was a Jew, and he heard Jesus preach about it and wanted to know more about it.


The second question is found in John 18:38\. Jesus, at this time, had been arrested and brought before Pilate, upon being charged with blasphemy. The Bible says, *“Pilate saith unto him, What is truth?...”* What a question! Pilate asked Jesus that question because of what Jesus said to him in the preceding verse. Let’s read: *“Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a King then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a King. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should testify to the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice”* (John 18:37\).


The third important question is found in John 14:5, and it was asked by one of His disciples, Thomas. He said, *“…Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?”* It’s like what many say today: *“There’re so many ways to God; how do we know which one is right? There’re so many churches, how can we know the true ones?”*


The Lord Jesus answered all of these three questions in John 14:6\. He said, *“…I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”* Notice the definite article, “THE”; He didn’t say, *“I’m a way, a truth, and a life.”* He used the definite article, meaning this is it! There’s no other. He took away every opportunity for options. He could have said, *“I’m one of the ways,” but He didn’t say that. He said, “I AM the way. I AM the truth. I AM the life.”* Glory to His Name forever!


If you understand this, it’ll change your whole world; your life will be completely altered. The boldness you’d exude and the results of your life will be outstanding and astounding. Hallelujah!

## THE WORD AND YOUR RESPONSE July 19th, 2019
![July 19th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2019.jpg)

>***…he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say… (Hebrews 13:5\-6\).***


It’s important we understand how to use the Word of God. The Word of God isn’t about preaching or how well you can quote it; it’s about living by it. It’s about your response to what God has said. That’s what we read in our theme scripture; it reveals an important principle: God spoke, and gave us His Word, for the purpose of our response. You ought to have a bold response to the Word always.


Now, this doesn’t mean “reciting” the same thing that God has said; and that’s where many have missed it. For example, He didn’t say, *“I will never leave you nor forsake you,”* so that you may repeat the same thing, saying, *“He will never leave me nor forsake me.”* You have to give a response. He said what He said, so that you can respond on the basis of what He has said. So, the question is, what’s your response to God?


The powerful thing about the Word of God is your response. If you don’t respond, the Word will do you no good. You have to say something that’s consistent with what God has said. For example, He has said, *“I’m with you always”;* what’s your response to that? It should be, “Yes, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want or lack anything. I prosper everywhere and in all things, because the Lord is with me; and more so, He lives in me! This is my assurance of a victorious, ever\-prosperous and glorious life. Hallelujah!”


Don’t say, “O Lord, you said you’re with me; therefore, supply my needs. You said you’re with me, why am I going through this predicament?” The one who talks that way is using the wrong codes; he’s not responding but complaining; and complainers get nothing.


Don’t complain about your situation; respond with the Word. That’s Christianity. That’s the life of faith: the response of the human spirit to God’s Word. When you hear the Word of God, give it a response. Your confession of the Word is your response to the Word, and that’s what will change your life and circumstances. Praise God forever!

## GOD IN HUMAN FLESH July 20th, 2019

>***The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God (John 10:33\).***


Many don’t understand the meaning of the expression, “Son of God.” They think it means one that’s born by God. It’s much more than that. “Son of God” means God in human flesh. Now you can better understand what it means when you read in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, about Jesus being referred to as “Son of God.”


The Jews understood it; that’s the reason on a certain occasion, they wanted to stone Him to death, and it’s one of the reasons they eventually crucified Him. They said, *“thou, being a man, makest thyself God”* (John 10:33\-36\). In Luke 22:70, they all asked Him, “…Art thou…the Son of God? He replied, *“...Ye say that I am.”*


Then, they replied, *“...What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth”* (Luke 22:71\). For that, they took Him away to crucify Him, because “Son of God” means the manifestation of God in flesh. They couldn’t take it.


When we say Jesus Christ is the Son of God, it’s a positive declaration of His Deity. We’re saying that He’s divine; He is Himself God. Now, He heads up the new creation who also are born of the Word, and in the class of God as associates of the Godkind.


The Bible says the Word (referring to Jesus) became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:14\). When He walked the earth, even though they saw Him in the body of a man, He had the life and nature of God in Him. He was hundred per cent God, and hundred per cent man—such an amazing reality!


Now, being born again, you were born after Jesus, and like Him, you have the life and nature of God in you. The Bible says as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17\). Hallelujah!

## JESUS PAID IT ALL July 21st, 2019
![July 21st, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2021.jpg)

 >***Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin… (Isaiah 53:10).***
---
***Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin… (Isaiah 53:10\).***


The Lord Jesus suffered and endured the pain and shame of the Cross, not on account of His sins or for Himself, but for us. He took our place and suffered for us.


At a stage, while on the Cross carrying the burden of our sins, He cried out in anguish, *“…Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”* (Mark 15:34\). God turned His back on Jesus because our sins were laid on Him. Habakkuk 1:13 tells us God is holy and doesn’t behold iniquity.


It was in anticipation of this that Jesus prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane: *“…saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt”* (Matthew 26:39\). The Bible specifically records that sweat came out of His body like great drops of blood.


He prayed with such anguish and agony of soul. He wasn’t willing to be cut off from His Father, because He loved His Father so much, but the Father wanted Him to be the sacrifice for the sins of the world.


 So, Jesus died on the Cross, and descended into hell; punished by God in hell on our behalf. He didn’t just go to hell, He was put to grief, and according to our theme scripture, it was God who did it; howbeit, for our sakes. And after He had taken all the punishment that was necessary, the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ was justified in the Spirit (1 Timothy 3:16\).


Today, because of His vicarious suffering and sacrifice in your behalf, sin and its consequences have no dominion over you. The Bible says through Him, we’ve been justified—declared righteous! Now, you’re free to serve the Lord and live joyfully in His presence for eternity, all because of Jesus.

## KNOWING HIS WILL July 22nd, 2019
![July 22nd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2022.jpg)

>***…that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding (Colossians 1:9\).***


If you were in a difficult situation and understood that you were right in the centre of God’s will, you’d be unperturbed, irrespective of the consequences. But those who don’t know the will of God often get ruffled by circumstances. They become worried and exasperated when they face challenges.


It’s important that you know and walk in God’s perfect will at all times. You may ask, *“Is it really possible to know the will of God?”* Absolutely! You’re His offspring. Jesus said it’s given to you to know the will of the Father—the mysteries of the Kingdom. In other words, it’s your right to know them.


Moreover, as you study the Word, the Father’s heart, His thoughts, plans and purposes are unveiled to you. His light dawns in your heart; there’s an unveiling of truth; revelation is granted you.


The Spirit of God, praying through the Apostle Paul in our opening verse, expresses this as God’s desire for His children. He doesn’t want anyone of us in doubt as to what He wants. He wants us to have full, deep, and clear knowledge of His will; not confused about anything in life.


A whole lot of people are in frustration, fear and anxiety, because they don’t know what to do; what steps to take. But it shouldn’t be so for you. The Bible says in Hosea 6:3, *“Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD….”*


Be diligent to study God’s Word, and as you do, the Holy Spirit, the unveiler of mysteries, will grant you insight into the mysteries and secrets of success. He’s the Spirit of truth, and He guides us into all truth and reveals to us things to come (John 16:13\).


Having received the Holy Spirit, you have the capacity and the power to know the full, precise, and accurate will of the Father. He also grants you the understanding of how to apply the knowledge you’ve received.


Spend more time in the Word of God. As you meditate on the Word, the Holy Spirit will bring its reality to light in your life.

## BRING GOOD THINGS TO PASS July 23rd, 2019
![July 23rd, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2023.jpg)

>***A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment (Matthew 12:35\-36\).***


In Proverbs 16:29\-30, the Bible says, *“A violent man…shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.”* Think about that! It says the evil man shuts his eyes and devises evil; moving his lips, he brings them to pass. In other words, he uses his imagination to devise wickedness, and establishes them with his mouth. It’s talking about the principle of meditation; it works both in the positive and in the negative.


God is showing us how the evil mind works, and therefore, how good works. Just as an evil man can work this principle and produce results, a good man can also put the principle to work and produce good results. That means you can use your imagination; shut your eyes and devise wonderful and glorious things.


Practise this. Your imaginative power is your creative ability. Every so often, shut your eyes, and meditate; contrive pictures of great things; possibilities from the Word of God, and begin to speak them forth. Use this principle to create a beautiful life for yourself and those around you.


It’s one of the many reasons and benefits of prayer, because when you pray, you see visions of the Spirit. When you see those visions, write them down, and bring them to pass with your faith\-filled proclamations.


We read in our opening verse that a good man, out of the abundance of his heart, brings forth good things. All the good things you desire in life are already inside you. See, and bring them forth with your words. They already exist in the realm of the spirit, but your words give them tangibility.

## VOICE FAITH NOT FEAR July 24th, 2019
![July 24th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2024.jpg)

 ---

>***Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee (Deuteronomy 31:6\).***


Many today are in precarious situations for yielding to, and voicing their fears. Consider the important lesson from Job’s experience in the Old Testament. Job was a righteous man, a faithful servant of the Lord, but through fear, he gave Satan the opportunity to wreak havoc in his life.


Satan had tried unsuccessfully to attack Job, because Job was divinely protected; there was a spiritual hedge around him (Job 1:8\-10\). However, the words of Job himself in Job 3:25 reveal how Satan was eventually able to penetrate the hedge to attack him. Job said, *“The worst of my fears has come true, what I’ve dreaded most has happened”* (MSG).


Despite God’s protection over his life, which even Satan attested to, Job voiced his fears. In the twenty\-sixth verse, he said, *“I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.”* But he was in safety until he broke the hedge. He spoke contrary to the Word of God; God could not legally protect him beyond his confessions; and that’s just like many today, who talk fear or give voice to words inspired by fear.


Never yield to fear because of an evil report. An evil report is any report that’s not consistent with the provisions of the Gospel; anything that negates your rights, privileges, ability, and heritage in Christ Jesus. For example, it doesn’t matter what the prognosis or diagnosis is concerning your health, refuse to fear. Keep declaring that you’re in health.\`


Be like Caleb and Joshua, of the twelve leaders Moses sent to spy out Canaan, who boldly voiced their faith. The Bible says the others came back with an evil report of fear concerning the giants, but Caleb and Joshua declared, *“...they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not”* (Numbers 14:9\).


That’s the voice of faith, and your faith is the victory that overcomes the world (1 John 5:4\).

## KEEP SATAN IN CHECK July 25th, 2019

>***Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you (James 4:7\).***


It isn’t for nothing that the Bible tells us in Ephesians 4:27 not to give place to Satan, our adversary. He’s extremely vicious and desperately wicked. He operates absolutely without mercy. Therefore, you must be on the offensive against him and keep him in check. Never be casual with him; cast him out, because there’s no telling how far he’d go if you let him. The Word enjoins us to *“Neither give place to the devil”* (Ephesians 4:27\).


Satan doesn’t play fair. We see his viciousness in his dealings with Job. As soon as Job broke the hedge with his negative confessions, Satan swung into action, and in one swoop, he ruined all of Job’s businesses. While Job was still bemoaning the loss of his entire wealth, the Bible says, *“…there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee”* (Job 1:18\-19\). Job lost all his children and businesses in one attack of Satan.


Job was ignorant that the devil was the one on the onslaught against him; he thought it was God, and he responded, *“Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD”* (Job 1:21\).


This is the same mistake a lot of Christians still make today; they’re being afflicted by Satan, and they think it’s the will of God; no, it’s not! God’s will is for you to live in His glory, walking in divine health, peace, abundance, and joy, and He sealed it by the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Therefore, stop the devil from messing with your health, your joy, your prosperity, your peace, etc. All you have to do is say no to him, and walk in God’s light.


The Bible says we’re not ignorant of Satan’s devices (2 Corinthians 2:11\). Whenever he shows up, give him no place. Don’t let him take anything that’s yours. The Lord Jesus said, *“…In my name shall they cast out devils…”* (Mark 16:17\). Be quick to cast him out and paralyze his activities in your life, your family, and environment.

## YOU’RE DEATH-FREE July 26th, 2019

>***For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:2\).***


From the verse above, we see that there’re two laws: the law of the Spirit of life, and the law of sin and death. The latter is the law at work in everyone that’s not born again; it promotes death and failure. Sickness and death go together, because when sickness attacks the physical body, death actually sets in and starts destroying it, no matter how slowly.


However, the law of life is more powerful than the law of death, and that’s the law at work in the new creation. That law was activated when you were born again. So, death isn’t at work in you; life is at work in you now; therefore, you’re death\-free. Blessed be God!


Look at it this way: when we say an object, maybe a wristwatch, is water\-resistant, it means it’s able to resist the penetration of water such that water couldn’t cause it any damage. If something is airtight, it means it doesn’t allow the entrance or escape of air. When you’re debt\-free, it means you’re not indebted to anyone—you owe nothing. Therefore, being now death\-free, you have no death in you.


Read our opening verse again; it’s so profound. It shows you’re free from death and the law of sin. Glory to God! Sadly, some Christians bring “death” into their lives, into their business, bodies, families etc., by reprogramming themselves through their negative confessions. But as long as you keep declaring, “In my path, there’s no death,” you’ll walk in the path of life.


Have this consciousness and function accordingly. Keep yourself in the path of life with your words. Remember, death and life are in the power of the tongue (Proverbs 18:21\).

## BOLD IN HIS PRESENCE July 27th, 2019

>***Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need (Hebrews 4:16\).***


In Luke 18:9\-14, the Lord Jesus gave a parable of the Pharisee who was obsessed by his own virtue, and “religiosity,” contrary to a tax collector who humbly asked God for mercy. The Pharisee, priding himself in his self\-righteousness, said to God, *“…I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess…”* (Luke 18:11\-13\).


However, the Publican, feeling unqualified to even stand before God, said, *“God be merciful to me a sinner.”* In the words of the Master, the Publican went away justified, while the Pharisee was condemned in his pride. But who was Jesus teaching this to? It was the Jews; He was teaching them not to trust in their self\-righteousness; He was teaching them humility in prayer.


Today, there’re Christians who, in reference to this parable, would pray with a beggarly attitude, condemning themselves before the Father. But God doesn’t want that. The Publican prayed that way because he lived under the Old Testament; Jesus hadn’t yet consummated the works of salvation. Now that He has, we’re bold and confident before our heavenly Father. His vicarious sacrifice in our behalf gave us righteousness; thus, we’re bold and unashamed before Him in love.


Therefore, don’t pray, “Please Father, I know I don’t qualify for the blessings I’m asking for, but have mercy on me, Lord.” No! He already had mercy on you and blessed you with ALL spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:3\). One of those blessings is righteousness, which gives you the ability to stand before God without guilt, fear, condemnation or inferiority. You can talk to God directly and fellowship with Him in love, because He’s your loving, gracious, heavenly Father. Hallelujah!


The Lord Jesus is our ability to stand in God’s presence without fear, for He’s our righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30\). He gave us the right to be bold in God’s presence; so, don’t pray as one who isn’t qualified to be in His presence. Be bold.


Notice our opening verse again; it says to “obtain mercy,” not “ask for mercy”; which means, grab it! Whatever you desire, His mercy already made it available; therefore, boldly reach out and take it! Glory to God!

## RELEASING THE RIGHT SOUND CODES July 28th, 2019
![July 28th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2028.jpg)

>***So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone (Ezekiel 37:7\).***


To prophesy means to speak words of divine revelation and potency; words that have and give life. Ezekiel understood that it wasn’t just about releasing words, but releasing words with the right sound code; words of the Spirit. He said, “I prophesied as I was commanded.”


As he prophesied, the Bible records that there was a noise and the bones came together, bone to his bone. That’s quite profound, for it means every bone had a code, and the moment the word was given, they knew where to fit into, without any mistake.


God designed energy to be released through words, but you must have the right words. This is why the ministry of the Spirit, fellowshipping with Him, is indispensable in our lives, because it’s the Spirit that actually knows the codes. We listen to the Holy Spirit to receive guidance from Him. He tells us exactly what to say. He could show you in pictures, but you must say it as He said to say it; otherwise, it’ll not work.


Let the Spirit guide you. When there’re crises or daunting challenges, you say, “Holy Spirit, use me to pray accurately, because I know not what to pray for as I ought.” Then start praying in tongues. Sing and worship the Lord in tongues. Do this intensely, and while at it, channel your mind to your purpose, the issue at hand.


As you continue in tongues, soon enough, the gift of prophecy will be stirred from within you to prophesy and make declarations like Ezekiel, and you’ll utter the right sound codes. This is how to effect the changes you want in your finances, job, business, family, and anything that’s of concern to you. Get the accurate sound code from the Spirit and utter it. You can change hopeless situations and effect positive changes in your life through the creative power of God’s Word in your mouth.

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, I thank you for the ability to speak words of power by the Spirit; life-altering, destiny-changing sound codes that are guaranteed to produce results. Even now, I declare that my life is for your glory; my future is that of success, progress, and prosperity in the Gospel of Jesus Christ! I dwell continually in peace, divine health, and in your grace, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## MORE THAN ENOUGH SUPPLY—EVERY DAY July 29th, 2019
![July 29th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2029.jpg)

>***Give us this day our daily bread (Matthew 6:11\).***


The verse above was part of the prayer format that Jesus gave to His disciples before the consummation of His redemptive work. The thought in that prayer does suggest that every day, in the mind of God, there’s a blessing for you; there’s more than enough supply for you every day.


God isn’t just into “provision”; He’s into supply. He’s not just providing what you need; He supplies all you require; meaning there’s a constant flow into your life. He wants you to have, not only for yourself, but enough to help others. So, for every day in God’s calendar, and in God’s plan and structure of things, there’re blessings for you; supplies set aside for you.


Psalm 68:19 says, *“Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.”* You need to be in that state of expectancy. Each one of us has a heavenly account. But you see, many of us have never drawn from our accounts, and so, there’s an accumulation of wealth in your name. You can call forth your supply even now. Hallelujah!


Jesus said, *“Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?”* (Matthew 7:9\-10\). Then He concluded, “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?” (Matthew 7:11\).


Some people have never taken possession of that which belongs to them since they became Christians. They have leftover “daily bread” that has accumulated over time, which they never possessed. All that time they were crying to God to provide money for their rent or for one thing or the other, there was supply from heaven available to them, more than the immediate need; but they didn’t know it.


It’s time you began to draw from your heavenly account. How? It’s through your faith\-filled affirmations; your confession of the Word! You declare, “I refuse to lack or be broke. There’s an allocation from heaven for me every day. I have supernatural supply and I walk in abundance.” Hallelujah!

Blessed be the Lord who daily loads me with benefits, even the God of my salvation! Today, there’s an overflow of favour and abundance for me, and I take possession. I’ll never be broke in my life, for the Lord has supplied all that I require for life and godliness according to the riches of His glory in Christ Jesus. Amen.

## BELIEVE AND EXPECT MIRACLES July 30th, 2019
![July 30th, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2030.jpg)

>***If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it (John 14:14\).***


It doesn’t make sense to believe in God and not believe in miracles. A Christian who doesn’t believe in miracles doesn’t know who God is. A miracle is the supernatural intervention of God in the natural affairs of men, an intervention that transcends human reasoning, ability, science, and logic.


Therefore, to believe in God and not expect miracles is a contradiction. So, believe and expect miracles. The Christian life is a day\-to\-day experience of, and journey in the supernatural. When you speak, your words aren’t ordinary, for they contain power, the miracle element to affect and influence your world and cause a change. In Mark 11:23, Jesus said,**"*You shall have what you say."*** In our opening verse, He said, "***If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it."***


The underlined word is the Greek, "Poieo," and it means, “make”; Jesus is saying, “I’ll make it in my Name; even if that thing doesn’t exist, I’ll make it happen.” See how He loves us! It delights the Lord to bless you and do good things for you. It’s His joy to answer your prayers and grant your heart’s desires. He said in Luke 12:32, **“Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”**


He can, and will do anything for you, because you believe. If there’s a tumour in your body, for instance, declare, “Tumour, in the Name of Jesus, you can’t stay in this body; I cut you out!” If there’s been a problem with your heart, command it to function normally, in the Name of Jesus. If it’s about your finances, command a change, and it’ll be so. Declare what you want. Voice your miracle. Create and sustain your victorious life with your faith\-filled words.

## CHILDREN OF LIGHT July 31st, 2019
![July 31st, 2019](https://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/admin-dashboard/rhapsody_images/Rhapsody%2031.jpg)

>***Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness (1 Thessalonians 5:5\).***


In the verse above, the Spirit, writing through the Apostle Paul, was addressing Christians; He’s talking to you, and He minces no words in describing you. He says you’re light! You’re born of God, of His Word, which is light, so you’re the offspring of Light. The Spirit expresses the same thought in Ephesians 5:8\. It reads, *“For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light”* (NIV). How interesting this is! It doesn’t say you were in the darkness; it says you were darkness, but now, you’re light. This means you can also declare with audacity, as Jesus did, *“As long as I’m in the world, I’m the light of the world!”*


Light illuminates. You have a calling in this life to bring illumination to your world. Philippians 2:15 says, *“That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.”* Light gives leadership and direction; it describes. You’re the one to show the world how to live, what to do, and how to be successful, irrespective of the darkness in the world.


It makes no difference the darkness and problems in the world, you’re the hope and the solution that the world needs. The problems and hardship in the world today are your opportunities to shine and manifest the glory of God. Live with this consciousness every day.

I’m a child of light, a child of the day. Therefore, I shine forth effusively, illuminating my world with glory and virtue. Through me, the unsaved hear and receive the light of the glorious Gospel and are transferred from darkness into God’s marvellous light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Praise God!
