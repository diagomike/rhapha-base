>***The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen (2 Corinthians 13:14\).***

“The communion of the Holy Ghost” in the verse above refers to the partnership, communication, or fellowship with the Holy Spirit. It involves talking with Him; yielding to His Lordship and guidance; sharing your thoughts with Him, and receiving His thoughts in your spirit and through the Word. This is what marks you out for extraordinary success in life.

Some haven’t understood the incontrovertible benefits and blessings of fellowship with the Holy Spirit. Fellowship with the Spirit should take or form the most part of your daily routine. He wants to be involved with every part of your life.

Christians who take their fellowship with the Holy Spirit seriously are often shielded and protected from chance and unfortunate occurrences. He said in Psalm 32:8, *“I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.”* Think about that! But then, in the ensuing verse 9, He gave an important admonition: *“Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle...”* (Psalm 32:9\).

Sometimes you hear, “Twenty\-five people were killed in an inferno, and a Christian sister was among them.” Or you hear, “Brother so and so was travelling to see his parents, there was an accident, and he died.” It’s not supposed to be so! There’re no accidents or mishaps to the child of God who’s in tune with the Spirit, filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.

When you’re yielded to the Spirit and the Word, the Bible says you *“…shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil”* (Proverbs 1:33\). Hallelujah! Develop an intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit. Know Him for yourself. Commune with Him constantly in prayer and through meditation on the Word. Remember He’s the Helper, Counsellor, Teacher, Advocate, Comforter, Strengthener and Standby that Jesus said the Father would send to us.

## IN CHRIST—EVERYTHING IS ALIVE November 2nd, 2021

>***For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God (Romans 8:19\).***

Everything in man’s world is in captivity (Romans 8:20\), but in God’s world, things are different. For example, Jesus took five loaves of bread and two fishes, talked to them and they multiplied, such that about five thousand men (women and the children not counted) were fed with many baskets of leftovers (Matthew 14:17–20\).

In Mark 3:1\-5, Jesus looked at the man who had a withered arm and said to him, “Hold out your hand.” When the man held it out, his hand was completely restored. He talked to lame legs and they were revived. He talked to a man who had no legs the legs grew out.

When He got to the entrance of the sepulcher where Lazarus was buried, He uttered a simple prayer of thanks to the Father, and then cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth.” Lazarus, having been dead and buried for four days, came out of the grave alive (John 11:41\-44\).

He also raised the daughter of Jairus back to life. He took the dead girl by the hand and said, “Get up!” And she came back to life (Luke 8:54\). How about the son of a widow who lived in the city of Nain? He was being borne by the undertakers to the place of internment. Seeing the widow in distress, Jesus walked over, touched the casket and said, *“Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.”* The hitherto dead young man sat up and Jesus presented him to his mother (Luke 7:11\-15\). There is a liberty in Christ, and He demonstrated that liberty of the Spirit that He brought to us. In Christ, there’s no such thing as “non\-living”; there’re no such things as waste, vanity and death.

The entire creation is groaning in pain, waiting to be liberated into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. Now that you’ve arrived on the scene, set the creation free; liberate them. Speak blessings to everything around you that’s “dead” and bring deliverance to every creature in your world. In Christ, take them out of bondage and corruption, into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.

## VICTORY IN HIS NAME November 3rd, 2021
![November 3rd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-21-day-3-victory-in-his-name.jpg)

>***…To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God (Revelation 2:7\).***

In the verse above, like several other portions of the Scriptures, we find the Lord constantly prompting us to overcome. In a reiterative pattern, He announced in Revelation 2:11, *“…He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.”* This is Jesus talking, and in Revelation 3:12, He repeated, “Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God….”

Jesus already overcame the world and when He did, we were in Him. His victory was for us. In John 16:33, He said, *“…be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”* In Him, we defeated Satan and all the demons of hell, but we’re required to maintain our victory; that’s our role. That’s the fight of faith.

The Lord knows that the adversary would try to fight us with the systems of this world. But He charged us to resist him, steadfast in the faith. This is what the fight of faith is about and He didn’t leave us without the weapon for the fight. When David confronted Goliath, he said, *“...Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts…”* (1 Samuel 17:45\). That was his weapon: The Name of the LORD of hosts! With that Name, he overcame the Philistines. Hallelujah!

That’s our weapon today. Jesus said, *“...In my name shall they cast out devils…”* (Mark 16:17\). That means, in His Name, you’ll rule over, control, and dispel demons. Then He said we should use His Name in all circumstances: *“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus…”* (Colossians 3:17\). That’s the victory!

As you go to your office, school, place of work or business today, go in the Name of Jesus. That means no matter what’s waiting for you there, you already have the victory; you’ll overpower it in the Name of Jesus! Others may be complaining about their dwindling business fortunes, but your testimony is different. Why? You’re running your businesses in the Name of Jesus.

The Bible says, *“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world…”* (1 John 5:4\). You’ve overcome the world with its hatred, death, deception, falsehood and falsities, economies and economics—in His Name. Glory to God!

## OFFERING SPIRITUAL SACRIFICES November 4th, 2021
![November 4th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-21-day-4-offering-spiritual-sacrifices.jpg)

>***By him (Christ) therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name (Hebrews 13:15\).***

The Kingdom of God to which we belong is a spiritual Kingdom. Therein, we carry out spiritual ministry and offer spiritual sacrifices. This is why it’s so important that we’re spiritually minded, because the sacrifices we offer to God must be spiritual sacrifices. God moved from the sacrifices of bulls and goats that couldn’t take away sin, to spiritual sacrifices. 

When we say “spiritual,” we’re dealing with spiritual substance, spiritual tangibility. God’s interpretation of our prayers and sacrifices, for example, is spiritual. Even the prophets could see it that way; in Hosea 14:2, the Bible says, *“Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.”*

The words we speak to God come up to Him in the quality of those calves that were sacrificed unto Him in the Old Testament. Our words in worship have the same power and effect in heaven as when they brought the sacrifice of bulls to offer to God. Our words are even more important because they go directly to God, but the bulls and calves were killed and eaten by the people.

Our prayers are spiritual sacrifices. In Psalm 141:2, David said, *“Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.”* “The fruits of our lips, giving thanks to His Name” is a spiritual sacrifice; that means you’re confessing the greatness of God; you’re confessing that He’s gracious to you, and that He’s been good to you.

When you’re worshipping the Lord in Church, or in your home, or on your knees or standing with your hands lifted, something is actually happening in heaven. But that’s not all! Hebrews 13:16, which is the very next verse to our theme verse says, *“But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.”* Showing mercy to the poor and looking for opportunities to express acts of kindness to others are sacrifices that are acceptable to God. It means that in heaven, they’re spiritual.

The importance of this is for us to be spiritually minded and understand that these things are real. Do them better, more carefully, and more truthfully.

## GIVE MORE TIME TO PRAYER November 5th, 2021

>***God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble (Psalm 46:1\).***

Esther Chapters 3 and 4 give us an amazing account of Haman, a wealthy man who was close to the reins of power; he was the king’s friend. For some reason, he hated the Jews and wanted them exterminated. He presented a proposal to the king to that effect and with the king’s express permission, he drafted and published a decree for the elimination of all Jews, both young and old.

But the Bible says, *“When Mordecai*(one of the Jews) *perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry”* (Esther 4:1\). Mordecai understood that even though the decree had been made, God could cause a change in their circumstance.

He thus galvanised the Jews, and called for prayer and fasting. The Bible says *“...there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes”* (Esther 4:3\). All they could do was call on God, and they were miraculously delivered from their enemy!

There’s a similar account in 2 Chronicles 32; the Bible tells us how the Assyrians under Sennacherib, King of Assyria, planned to destroy Judah and take over Jerusalem. The Bible says, *“And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria…”* (2 Chronicles 32:20\-21\). Hallelujah!

It makes no difference how many or how strong your adversaries are; in the place of prayer, you can cut off their influence by the power of the Holy Spirit. What you need is to give time to prayer. In the place of prayer, you obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need (Hebrews 4:16\).

You have a right to be heard when you pray; therefore, pray often. Remember, He invited us to pray; He’s more willing and passionate to answer you than you could ever imagine. The Bible says, *“For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers...”* (1 Peter 3:12\). Hallelujah! Think about that!

## HIS RESURRECTION GAVE US ETERNAL LIFE November 6th, 2021
![November 6th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-21-day-6-his-resurrection-gave-us-eternal-life.jpg)

>***For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16\).***

There’re fundamental tenets of the Faith that every Christian must live by. For example, you must believe that God raised Jesus from the dead; otherwise, you’re not a Christian. That’s because salvation was made available by the resurrection of Jesus. The death of Jesus paid for the sins of the world, but that was neither the end nor the purpose of Jesus’ death.

If you found a poor man who owed a lot of money and you paid his debt, that’ll be great, but not enough. Paying his debt made him a free man, but a “poor free man.” He’ll require something more to live on so he’d be out of poverty. In the same way, when Christ paid for the sins of the world by the shedding of His blood, we were free from the consequences of sin. Awesome! But it didn’t make us free from the nature and power of sin.

The resurrection of Jesus Christ gave us a new life and power over sin. It gave us a new life of righteousness. Hallelujah! Believing in the resurrection means you believe in His death too, because there’ll be no resurrection without the death.

The resurrection is what gave us eternal life. The Bible says in Romans 6:4, *“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”* His resurrection ushered us into the new life of righteousness and the glorious liberty of the sons of God. Hallelujah!

## A “HEART AND MOUTH” PRINCIPLE November 7th, 2021
![November 7th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-21-day-7-a-heart-and-mouth-principle.jpg)

>***For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Romans 10:10\).***

The Apostle Paul, in Romans 10:8\-10, shows us this simple, yet so powerful, principle of salvation. When you confess that Jesus is Lord of your life, believing in your heart that He died for you and God raised Him from the dead, that declaration or proclamation of your faith catapults you into the realms of salvation: *“…if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation”* (Romans 10:9\-10\).

The confession part is so important, and that’s where some have missed it. In their heart, they know Jesus is Lord, but they’ve never consciously confessed His Lordship over their lives, and without that, there’s no salvation. So, in your evangelical work, explain this important reality to those you minister to. It’s a “Heart and Mouth” principle; you can’t take one and leave the other.

The preceding verse 8 to Romans 10:9\-10 that we read earlier says, *“But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.”* If you don’t say it, salvation will never be activated, for salvation is activated by your confession; not the confession of sins, but your affirmation and declaration of the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

Why do we need to confess the Lordship of Jesus? It’s because when you proclaim His Lordship over your life, you’re instantly translated into His spiritual kingdom and given eternal life, righteousness, protection, and all of the inheritance of the sons of God in Christ. He becomes the shepherd of your life, leading and guiding you through His Word and His Holy Spirit given to all who receive Him. Amen.

## ALL WRAPPED IN THE WORD November 8th, 2021

>***I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name (Psalm 138:2\).***

In the Old Testament, God revealed Himself through various names to the children of Israel. Generation after generation, they recognized Him with those names, for they depicted or described His character. Examples of such names are Jehovah Nissi (The Lord My Banner), Jehovah Raah (The Lord My Shepherd), Jehovah Rapha (The Lord That Heals), Jehovah Sabaoth (The Lord of Hosts), etc.

However, our theme verse says He’s magnified His Word above all the revelations of His names. Meaning that whether you knew Him as El shadai or as Adonai or as Jehovah Rapha or Jehovah Jireh—whatever you knew Him to be—He’s magnified His Word above all those revelations.

Those revelations were limited; they’re all wrapped up in the Word. If you know the Word of God, you’ll go beyond the man who knows God as Elshadai or Jehovah Rapha or any of the other revelations of Him in the Old Testament. John 1:1 says, *“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the word was God.”* This is the Word that’s been magnified above all the revelations of God’s names.

You don’t need all of the Hebrew names of God now; the last of the revealed names was Jehovah Shammah—the Lord is present; and after that, He brought forth “Emmanuel”—God with us—which was Jesus in the midst of His people. But His desire was to be in us: *“To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory”* (Colossians 1:27\).

Too many have lived in religion and haven’t received reality; they don’t know how to relate with God. Christianity is a living thing; a real relationship with a living heavenly Father and His Son Jesus through the person and power of the Holy Spirit. Get to know the Word and put it to work, and your life will be an unending stream of blessings and grace.

## TICKET TO THE WHOLE WORLD November 9th, 2021

>***Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19\).***

The Lord Jesus never gave ordinary instructions; His instructions came with the power to carry them out. So, you never need to worry about whether or not you have the ability to execute His instructions. The ability comes in the instruction. Think about His disciples: they weren’t even initially allowed to go to Samaria, but then Jesus instructed them to “Go and teach all nations.” This ought to make a great impression on you.

Jesus didn’t limit His instructions to the twelve apostles; they were for us all who believe in Him. He’s commissioned us to reach the whole world. That means we’re beyond borders. The extent of our reach and the impact of our success with the Gospel are limitless. We’re to take His Word to the ends of the earth, teaching all nations the way of righteousness.

“Teaching all nations” means to make pupils and students of the nations. He’s given us the ticket to the whole world. Then He gave us the power to achieve it: *“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth”* (Acts 1:8\). The world is our parish. The whole earth is given to us to fill it with the knowledge of Christ.

We’ve been sent. We’re on a mission to save and preserve lives: *“…Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you”* (John 20:21\). What an instruction! We’ve been commissioned as Jesus was commissioned; as the Father commissioned Him. Be inspired by His instructions, and change your world.

Think about the fact that He trusts us enough to commit the nations of the world to us that we may bless them with the Gospel! Acts 3:26 says, *“Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.”* In Matthew 24:14, He said, *“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”* (Matthew 24:14\). He’s counting on us to make it happen; to tell the whole world the news of His saving power. Let’s take this seriously and win souls every day.

## OUR PRAYERS AND WORSHIP November 10th, 2021

>***And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne (Revelation 8:3\).***

When you study the Book of Revelation, one of the many beautiful things you find is the power and spiritual import of our prayers and worship. Revelation 15:8, for example, describes something remarkable as revealed to John: it says, *“And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.”*

This parallels what we read in the Old Testament when the priests entered into the temple built by Solomon. The Bible says when they began to sing and worship God with the instruments of music, the glory of God filled the house, that even the priests couldn’t stand to minister by reason of the cloud of God’s glory (2 Chronicles 5:14\).

Our prayers and worship in the earth have great impact in heaven. When we pray, when we worship, how does God see it? We’re actually offering spiritual sacrifices. The Bible says, *“And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints”* (Revelation 5:8\).

When you’re praying here in the earth, it’s not a mere religious routine; it goes to Heaven as incense. That’s what David meant when he said, *“Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice”* (Psalm 141:2\). David, being a prophet, had a revelation of the future. He saw that our prayers and sacrifices and the lifting up of our hands would replace these incense and sacrifices of the Old Testament.

Our theme verse says there’s an altar—a temple— in heaven, upon which the angel offers his incense, alongside the incense of our own prayers. How amazing that is! So, when you’re praying and worshipping the Lord, it’s important that you understand the spiritual significance of what you’re engaged in and do it with faith, hope and love. Praise God!

## WHO’S IN YOUR “HOUSE”? November 11th, 2021

>***Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? (1 Corinthians 3:16\).***

God’s will is for you to walk in divine health; He didn’t create you for sickness. He said in 3 John 1:2, *“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”* To guarantee your divine health, He sent the Holy Spirit to live in you. Romans 8:11 declares, *“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”*

This shows the result of having the Holy Spirit live in you: He’s quickened (given life to) your hitherto death\-prone or death\-doomed body. The preceding verse 10 says, *“But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness”* (Romans 8:10 ESV). The Holy Spirit in you is the life of your physical body. So, it’s about who’s living in you.

Some people are frail, weak, broken and sickly in their body because of who they’ve permitted to live in their body. Your body is your house; so, the question is, who’s in your “house”? Who have you allowed inside your body? Is it the Holy Spirit or demons? Do you realize that you’re the one to decide who indwells your body?

Paul makes a passionate appeal in Romans 12:1, saying, *“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.”* Then in 1 Corinthians 6:19\-20, he emphasizes, *“What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.”*

If for any reason you’ve had demons tormenting you and causing all manner of pain, distress, infection and illness to be manifested in your body, you can free yourself even now by using the Name of Jesus! The Bible says, *“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils…”* (Mark 16:17\). It doesn’t matter for how long those wicked spirits may have troubled you; command them to leave you. Tell them to pack their sicknesses and diseases and get out of your body.

Colossians 1:27 says, *“…Christ in you, the hope of glory.”* Thanks be unto God! Your life is for the glory of God. Now that Christ has taken up His abode in you, you have peace and honour with God. God has separated you from sickness, evil and everything of darkness. Hallelujah!

## THERE’S HOPE FOR YOU November 12th, 2021

>***But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11\).***

There’re people that science and medicine have given up to die. Medically, their chances to live are very slim because of an “incurable” sickness that has, maybe, ruined their lungs, affected their heart, kidney or other vital organs in their body. Some have been to the best medical centres, with the best therapies and medications, yet to no avail. If this is your story or that of a loved one, I want to let you know that there’s hope in Jesus Christ.

There’s a beautiful verse of scripture I’ll like you to meditate on: Romans 8:10; it says if Christ be in you, although your body may be dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness. If your physical body has already been so battered, bruised, damaged and ravaged by sickness and disease, and sin has crippled it, the Holy Spirit will revitalize and restore life to it because of the righteousness of Christ. 

It’s the righteousness of God for you to be in health. This is so powerful; think deeply on it! The Bible says, *“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him”* (2 Corinthians 5:21\). The righteousness of Christ is what makes the difference in you. As a result of Christ’s righteousness, you’re accepted in the presence of God; you’re not condemned.

Romans 5:18 says, *“Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.”* You have a right to health, because Jesus paid for it. It doesn’t matter what manner of sickness has attacked your physical body; it can be reversed in the Name of Jesus. 

Ponder again on what we read in our theme verse; that scripture is neither a promise nor something futuristic. If the Spirit of God who raised Jesus from death lives in you, He gives life to your body. Let this be your consciousness from now on.

## HE’S WITH YOU AND IN YOU ALWAYS November 13th, 2021

>***Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me (Psalm 23:4\).***

The Bible tells us of an encounter Jesus had with Jairus, the ruler of the synagogue, whose daughter died. He told Jairus, *“…Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole”* (Luke 8:50\). In another instance, He admonished His listeners as He taught them God’s Word, *“Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom”* (Luke 12:32 NKJV).

Always, He charges us not to fear, because He’s with us to help us deal victoriously with the issues of life. He said in Matthew 28:20, *“…**lo, I am with you always**, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”* Then, when He was to physically leave this world, He sent the Holy Spirit—to be in us and with us: *“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of truth…for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless…”* (John 14:16\-18\).

Take Him at His Word. The Holy Spirit came to take the place of the ascended Christ, and now, He lives in you. Be ever conscious of His presence in you; take advantage of His grace and power in your life. Since He says, “I’m with you always,” you should say, “Blessed be God! I can do all things through Christ that’s in me and with me. He’s all I need for an ever\- victorious and successful life!”

It doesn’t matter where you go in this world; the Lord is with you, morning, noon or night. This should enrich your fellowship with Him. Talk to Him with the consciousness that He’s really and truly with you. This should bring great excitement into your life because the One who really cares, the One who has all power—the great God of glory—is with you, and in you ALWAYS.

## SEE SPIRITUALLY November 14th, 2021

>***For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace (Romans 8:5\-6\).***

The Lord Jesus manifested spirituality in all things: His views, words, actions, hope, faith and love. The apostles were the same. They were spiritually minded. They looked at the world from the spiritual perspective and responded to situations and circumstances from the standpoint of the Word.

Consider how Jesus dealt with certain situations! Until He came, no one knew that an evil spirit could be responsible for the conditions in which some people found themselves; and even when they knew, no one could change that situation. But Jesus cast out evil spirits with His words*: “When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick”* (Matthew 8:16\).

Mark 9:25 says, *“When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.”* Mark 1:23\-26 says, *“And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit…And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.”* How about the demoniac at Gadara who was bound with chains and fetters? He broke the chains and inflicted wounds on his own body. Until Jesus came through that same road, he wallowed in that pitiable state. The Master commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man and he was restored (Read Mark 5:1–13\).

Jesus put a premium on words. He spoke words as *“Get up! Pick up your bed and walk!”* and someone who had been paralyzed from birth could be healed. Read the account of the man who was sick for thirty\- eight years, and lay by the Pool of Bethesda. Jesus said to him, *“…Rise, take up thy bed, and walk”* (John 5:8\). He taught that words were spirit (John 6:63\).

Jesus saw life from the realm of the spirit. As far as He was concerned, everything was controlled from the realm of the spirit. And as a child of God, that’s the realm you’re expected to see and live from. Interpret life from the spirit realm, and you’ll always win.

## WALKING IN HIS LOVE November 15th, 2021
![November 15th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-21-day-15-walking-in-his-love.jpg)

>***Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love (1 John 4:7\-8\).***

The Apostle John gives an encapsulated version of the revelation of the Pauline doctrine in 1 John 4:16: *“And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.”* So, you in Christ, and Christ in you is about His love seen in you and expressed through you!

God is love, and as His children, we’re to love as Christ loved us. The Bible says, *“THEREFORE BE imitators of God \[copy Him and follow His example], as well\-beloved children \[imitate their father]. And walk in love, \[esteeming and delighting in one another] as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, a slain offering and sacrifice to God \[for you, so that it became] a sweet fragrance”* (Ephesians 5:1\-2 AMPC).

Jesus showed us a good example by loving everyone, including His accusers and those who unjustly put Him on the Cross. We ought to emulate the Master by loving everyone unconditionally. Love makes you give of yourself to others without thinking of what you’ll get in return. It makes you think of others and accept them just as they are. They don’t have to act to deserve your love, for love is unselfish and doesn’t seek its own. It breaks the barriers of race, ethnicity and social status. It makes it possible for you to see the beauty in others and appreciate them for who they are.

The new creature in Christ is born anew after the image of God (Colossians 3:10\) and is imbued with the divine ability to express divine love. Let God’s love in you come alive; it’ll lift you to a new level of life and you’d be glad this happened. The Christian life is a life of love, freely given to us of God. Manifest that same love to others.

<details>
  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, I thank you for the revelation of your love to my spirit, and the ability to express and manifest your love to others. Love is the greatest power in the universe, and that love radiates through me today, to everyone in my world. Thank you for your glory in my life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## LIVING BY THE SPIRIT November 16th, 2021

>***How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? (Hebrews 9:14\).***

It’s impossible to live the authentic Christian life without the Holy Spirit. He’s the One to guide you, teach you the things of God, and instruct you in the way you should go. At the Rapture of the Church, the Bible says in a twinkling of an eye, the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then, we who are alive and remain shall be caught up with them—to meet the Lord in the air (1 Thessalonians 4:16\-17\).

But how is this going to happen? It’ll be by the power of the Holy Spirit! We’re in the last days, and more than ever before, God is calling men to repentance. Regardless of the destruction, hatred, killings, murders, wickedness and violence in the world today orchestrated by Satan, the will of God is revealed in 2 Peter 3:9\. It says, “*The Lord is not … willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”*

However, without the Holy Spirit, they can’t live the life that God wants them to live. Living a life that glorifies and honours God is by the power of the Holy Spirit. He alone can bring men to repentance and the acknowledging of the truth about salvation in Christ Jesus. Jesus said in John 16:8, *“And when he (the Holy Spirit) is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.”*

Living by the Spirit is the way for the child of God. The way of the Spirit is the way of success, victory and ever\-increasing glory. So, don’t ignore the Holy Spirit. Yield yourself to His influence and guidance by consciously acting on God’s Word. He’s the One with the blueprint for your success; He created you and knows everything about your life and future. He’s committed to seeing you finish your course gloriously, fulfilling the will of God with joy.

Perhaps you’re reading this and you haven’t received the Holy Spirit, you can receive Him even now; it’s very easy. You can have someone who’s full of the Spirit lay hands on you, and you’ll receive. You can also simply ask and receive Him into you by faith, trusting in God. Hallelujah!

## DON’T BOW TO HUMAN SOLUTIONS November 17th, 2021

>***So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed (Acts 19:20\).***

When it comes to your health, God’s plan is for you to use the Word to keep your body in divine health and not to bow to human solutions. His Word is medicine; the Bible says it produces health in your physical body: *“My son, attend to my words… they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh”* (Proverbs 4:20\-22\). The word “health” is the Hebrew “marpe”; it means medicine.

This means you can apply the Word as you would a prescription drug. But the difference is, God’s Word is far more effective; it never fails. Perhaps you suddenly discovered a growth in your body that seems to be getting larger and diagnosed to be malignant; don’t get into a frenzy.

First, recognize that you’re not an ordinary person; you’re born again; you have the life of God in you. Acknowledge and affirm this consciously and every so often. Then, affirm scriptures, such as Acts 19:20: *“So mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed.”* This is talking about the Word growing mightily in Ephesus and prevailing over religion, darkness and everything contrary to the Gospel, righteousness and the life of the Kingdom.

If the Word could work so mightily and prevail in a city as Ephesus, it’ll do the same in your physical body. Meditate and affirm the Word; declare that the Word of God is growing in your mind, your heart, your blood, your brain, and every fibre of your being. Talk to the growth and say, “Growth, you can’t stay in my body, because the Word of God is the life of my body; the Word of God is prevailing against you; you have no option but to dematerialize!”

This is how you use the Word against sickness and disease. You have to learn to always use the Word, because if sickness causes you to bow to human solutions, it’ll dominate you. Before long, you could be faced with something humanly incurable. All health challenges are opportunities to use the Word of God.

If a Christian doesn’t practise using the Word against headaches, migraines, colds and fevers, what would he or she do if cancer, diabetes, arthritis or some terminal diseases strike? So, use the Word. No matter how little you think the anomaly is, use the Word, and take charge of your health. Give no place to the devil (Ephesians 4:27\).

## WE ARE LIGHTS November 18th, 2021

>***Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness (1 Thessalonians 5:5\).***

In Ephesians 5:8, the Bible says, “*For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light.”* And our theme verse says, *“Ye are all the children of light….”* You’re a child of light, and if you’re a child of light, you’re light. That’s exactly what the Scripture says. Hallelujah!

The Lord Jesus, talking to the Jews, said, *“While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light...”* (John 12:36\). He told them to believe in the light, that they may be the children of light. But they didn’t. We believed, and we received eternal life and became children of light. Glory to God! 

John 8:12 says, *“Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”* This is amazing. Also, think about the words of Jesus in John 9:5; He declared, *“As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”*

What does He want your life to be like? He shows us in Matthew 5:16: *“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”* Philippians 2:15 says, *“That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.”*

We shine as lights in a dark world. We have the heart of the Father. John 3:16 says, *“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son….”* Therefore, we must love the people with the Father’s love. It’s part of shining as lights in the world.

When Jesus said to let the world “see your good works,” He was talking about works of righteousness. Put your best into preaching the Gospel, turning men from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God. That’s the true solution to all human challenges: the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes. Glory to God!

## SPIRITUAL UNDERSTANDING November 19th, 2021
![November 19th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-21-day-19-spiritual-understanding.jpg)

>***For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding (Colossians 1:9\).***

Evidently, God wants us to have spiritual understanding. Truth is reality, and it’s spiritual. All things hail from the spiritual. We must live from that perspective, and we can only do that by the insights given to us by the Holy Spirit, through the Word. Let’s examine a particular dialogue between Jesus and the Jews in John 8\. Jesus said, *“I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you”* (John 8:37\).

Now, they didn’t think their attempt to kill Him had anything to do with His Word not being in them; but Jesus knew. He pinpointed the root cause of their actions to something spiritual, because He was thinking spiritually. He said, *“I know that ye are Abraham’s seed….”* He didn’t take that away from them. But in a seemingly self\-contradictory statement, He said, *“...If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham”* (John 8:39\). He was talking spiritually.

Factually, Abraham was their father, but in action, they were children of the devil. While they were thinking factually (carnally) and arguing with Jesus, He was using the Word of God to interpret their thoughts and actions, because the Word of God is truth. He stood firmly on truth. And that’s how we must live.

In Luke 22, on the occasion of His arrest, He said, *“…this is your hour, and the power of darkness”* (Luke 22:53\). Everybody else looked at the arrest from the natural, factual point of view, but Jesus interpreted it spiritually. He said the power of darkness was behind it. 

It’s like the crises going on in the world today, which started in 2020\. Many are being deceived because they don’t know the truth. They’re not seeing from the spiritual perspective; rather, they’re following the carnal dictates of men. Through the knowledge of the Word, we can easily recognize the work of God and distinguish it from Satan’s work. Remember the words of Jesus in John 16:2: *“They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.”* He made it clear that some would think that when they kill God’s people they’re rendering Him service. They’ll have wrong interpretations and judgement, because they judge after the flesh. His Word has no place in them. We who are born of the Spirit of God must feed on the Word continually. The Holy Spirit through the Word gives us Spiritual insight and understanding in all things.

## BORN FROM ABOVE November 20th, 2021
![November 20th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-21-day-20-born-from-above.jpg)

>***And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world (John 8:23\).***

Then the Lord Jesus said to the Jews in John 8:23, “I’m from above,” He was referring to His divine origin; He’s the Lord from heaven: *“The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven”* (1 Corinthians 15:47\). The Lord Jesus made this distinction because everyone on earth received life through their earthly parents, but His life came from God—He is the Word made flesh. Every human person born into this world has the natural human life. That life, however, is corruptible life; it’s mortal.

This became man’s lot when Adam sinned against God and lost his authority to Satan in the Garden of Eden. As a result, death came into the world: *“Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned”* (Romans 5:12\).

Sin came into the world by Adam’s disobedience, and death followed. “Death” here is separation from God: a life of darkness and spiritual blindness. That’s the life of the unregenerate man, whom the Word describes as alienated from the life of God, and a stranger from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world (Ephesians 2:12\).

However, being born again, you’ve been brought into “deathlessness.” You’re not born after the image of the first man Adam, but after Christ, who is the Lord from heaven; and as He is, so are you in this world (1 John 4:17\). 1 Corinthians 15:48 explains it. It says, *“…as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.”* 

You have in you the immortal life of God. 1 Peter 1:23 declares, *“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.”* You’re the offspring of the Word, just as Jesus is the Word made flesh. Like Him, you’re from above; born from heaven, with the incorruptible and immortal life of God in you. Glory to God!

## BEYOND THE CROSS November 21st, 2021

>***Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life (Romans 6:4\).***

Being born again, you have the resurrection life; life beyond the Cross. I would to God you’d catch this. The new creation wasn’t “delivered” from the hand of the enemy, neither does he need deliverance, for he’s superior to Satan.

Deliverance was accomplished at the Cross. It was for the whole world. But there’s a resurrection life beyond the Cross. That’s the life of the new creation, and in that life, you’re not the “delivered,” neither are you the “set free” or “redeemed”; rather, you’re the recreated! The recreated man in Christ isn’t of this world; so the forces of this world have no power over him. In Christ, he has overcome the world and all its elements.

The Bible calls us *“...more than conquerors...”* (Romans 8:37\). We’re indestructible and invincible. Then, most beautifully, He calls us saints (1 Corinthians 6:2, 14:33, 2 Corinthians 1:1, Ephesians 1:1 etc.). The sinner died with Christ; the sinner was buried with Christ; but a new creature, a saint, arose with Christ. This is your new nature. The Christian is the man who believes that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead and confesses His Lordship; he identifies with the resurrected Christ. He’s a new type of man: *“...If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old things are passed away, behold, all things are become new”* (2 Corinthians 5:17\).

I’m showing you who you really are. The biggest thing to grasp about the Christian is the fact that he is absolutely a new creature. The unrecreated man, the natural human being, needed deliverance from the devil and God gave it to him. He needed remission of sin and God gave it to him. Jesus died to pay the price for his redemption.

The new creation, on the other hand, is not a product of the Cross. The Cross was enough to pay the price for redemption and salvation, but it didn’t produce a new life. If Jesus had never risen from the dead, we would still have been redeemed, but continually subject to sin. The blood He shed brought us eternal redemption and salvation. But we wouldn’t have been new creatures. The new creation is a product of the resurrection of Jesus Christ! The resurrection gave us eternal life. It gave us the righteousness of God, and made us joint\-heirs with Christ.

## A PECULIAR KINGDOM November 22nd, 2021

>***Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God (Ephesians 2:19\).***

We’re not of this world; we’re the peculiar people of a heavenly Kingdom. Though we live in the earth, our citizenship—the Kingdom to which we belong and from which we operate—is in heaven. It’s a royal and glorious Kingdom of priests. You were born into that Kingdom the day you were born again (Colossians 1:12\-13\).

It doesn’t matter that you were diagnosed with an incurable hereditary disease. It makes no difference that you were said to have a chronic heart condition. Now that you’re born again, sickness is alien to your nature; it’s an anomaly in our kingdom. Therefore, refuse to accept or accommodate it in your body.

Maybe your forbears died of a certain disease, and you’re told that’s how it’s been in your family. You now belong in a heavenly family, where Jesus is the head. You belong to a Kingdom where all things are possible and operates by the law of the Spirit of life. In this Kingdom, everyone is blessed and everything you do prospers; our joy never ends. We rejoice in adversity.

In this eternal Kingdom, we don’t allow the things which are seen to determine and control the quality of our lives. We see and live by faith. We’re confident that whatever we see that we don’t like, is subject to change: *“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal (subject to change); but the things which are not seen are eternal”*

 (2 Corinthians 4:17\-18\). This is life in our Kingdom: we’re unmovable; we’re in dominion. We can do all things through Christ who strengthens us. We’re forever victorious. Glory to God!

## YOU’RE GOD’S DREAM November 23rd, 2021

***Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures (James 1:18\)***.

The new creature is God’s dream! He is everything God ever wanted. God created the heavens, the earth and everything therein, but He couldn’t be one with any of those things. He couldn’t fellowship with any of the animals or things He created except man. His purpose for sending Jesus was to make it possible for man to be brought into oneness with God. So, you’re very special to God.

Read our theme verse again; it says you’re the first and the best of all that God created; His excellently crafted handiwork. How could anyone know this and still think failure? You couldn’t know this and live in defeat, poverty and misery; it’s not possible! You were born in the throne room and you live right in the presence of God. Everything in this world is yours. Paul understood it and declared, *“… all things are yours…the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours”* (1 Corinthians 3:21\- 22\). Hallelujah!

There’s something different about you. You’re the one who can shout, “I’ve got the whole world!” even if your account balance is seemingly in minus, because you walk in the Spirit and not in the flesh. You walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7\).

In the Old Testament, they couldn’t fulfil His dream; they were men and women of the senses. He had said to them, *“Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine”* (Exodus 19:5\). But they couldn’t obey Him.

However, in our case, He didn’t require us to first “obey” His commandments; rather, He made us new creations and called us obedient children (1 Peter 1:14\). As a result, what He promised to make them (a peculiar treasure) if they obeyed Him, we became by the New Birth.

Now that you’re born again, you’re God’s peculiar treasure. It’s what Jesus did in your behalf. The Bible says *“Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works”* (Titus 2:14\). 1 Peter 2:9 says, *“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.”* Blessed be God!

>***For…they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17\).***

Blessed be God! The life we have in Christ is one of absolute mastery and dominion over circumstances. We win only and always! It makes no difference what’s happening around you, maintain the mindset of a victor. Jesus said all things are possible to him that believes; that’s you. This is the testimony of Jesus concerning you. That simply makes you a superman in Christ!

You have what it takes to fix any problem and help others out of trouble. That’s part of the essence of being filled with the Spirit and having the Word of God in your heart and in your mouth. You become unshakeable.

God doesn’t want you to live as a victim of life or circumstances. He’s placed you in charge and in control. He wants you to use the Word of God to keep Satan in subjection. He wants you to use the Word to keep your body in health and keep yourself in prosperity. He wants you to discipline every situation with the Word of God.

God knows that as long as you’re in your physical body, you’re going to face crises in life. You’re going to contend with forces of darkness. But they’re not a factor, because He says, *“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”* (1 John 4:4\).

You were born a victor. Let that be the standpoint from which you view life. You’re more than a conqueror; you’re the blessed of God! You’ve been adequately furnished with every good and necessary thing you require for life and for godliness (2 Peter 1:3\). So, stand up tall in Christ! You can never be disadvantaged. It’s victory for you all the way—in all things and in every place: *“Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place”* (2 Corinthians 2:14\).

## A LIFE OF PRAISE November 25th, 2021

>***From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD’s name is to be praised (Psalm 113:3\).***

When you come to know who you really are in Christ, your life will be full of praise. Your times of prayer will be times of praise and excitement in the presence of God. Think for a moment: what could you possibly be in need of that the Lord hasn’t already granted you? Absolutely nothing!

The Bible says, *“For God has proved his love by giving us his greatest treasure, the gift of his Son. And since God freely offered him up as the sacrifice for us all, he certainly won’t withhold from us anything else he has to give”* (Romans 8:32 TPT). He isn’t withholding anything from you. That’s why Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:21, *“…all things are yours.”*

Then 2 Peter 1:3 says, *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness….”* Since this is true, what more, therefore, than to praise Him all your life! Even your prayer and intercession should be with a heart full of gratitude and praise because you know you’re siding with Him to cause His will to be established.

Learn to praise God. In the midst of challenges, praise Him. Be a wild praiser. Remember Paul and Silas? They were falsely accused, stripped, beaten and thrown into a maximum\-security dungeon (Acts 16:19\-24\). But the Bible tells us that at midnight, they went wild with praise: *“And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed”* (Acts 16:25\-26\). 

Even now, forget about whatever may seem to trouble you and praise God lavishly. Tell Him how great and loving He is; sing songs of praise and adoration to Him. Celebrate the Lord right there where you are, for He’s gracious and kind, righteous, holy, faithful and ever true. Let your heart be full of praise to Him, not just today, but always. Hallelujah!

## KNOWING WHO YOU REALLY ARE November 26th, 2021

>***For we are God’s \[own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, \[born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us \[taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them \[living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).***

Our opening verse is one of the many scriptures in the New Testament that describe who the Christian really is: a new creature; God’s excellent handiwork, recreated in Christ Jesus. Notice the word “recreated,” meaning he wasn’t refurbished, but born anew. When you understand this, you’ll better appreciate who you are.

What many have known about the Christian is that he’s the redeemed. They quote the Psalmist and sing, *“Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy”* (Psalm 107:2\). But the Christian is much more than someone saved or redeemed from sin, from the world, from the devil and from death.

The man that was saved or redeemed from the devil was buried in the grave with Jesus. The revelation that we are the redeemed of the Lord isn’t completely true about the personality of the Christian. Remember what the Bible says about Jesus when He was raised from the dead: we were raised together with Him (Ephesians 2:6\).

We were raised up as new creatures, new species of being. You don’t have an old life, because your human life was supplanted, replaced with the life of Christ when you were born again. You need to understand the progression of the revelation of the New Testament. The redemption was only the beginning of the process towards sonship: associates of the God\-kind.

The new creature was never in bondage. The new creature never sinned. He was born free, and born sin\- free. That’s why the Bible says, *“For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace”* (Romans 6:14\). This is why Paul said, *“...reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Lord”* (Romans 6:11\). Hallelujah!

>***Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God (Psalm 20:7\).***

Chronicles 14\-16 tells us about Asa, King of Judah, who did what was good and right in the sight of the Lord. He commanded Judah to seek the Lord and to obey the law and the commandment, and his kingdom was at peace.

Once, Zerah, the Ethiopian King, invaded Judah with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots. Asa cried out to the Lord for supernatural intervention. The Bible says, *“So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled”* (2 Chronicles 14:12\). Remarkable!

In the 36th year of his reign, another event occurred. Baasha, the King of Israel, made hostile threats against Judah. But this time, instead of seeking the Lord, King Asa sought a military alliance with Ben\- Hadad, the King of Syria. He took silver and gold from the treasuries of the temple and the royal palace and sent them as gifts to the Syrian king. The King of Israel abandoned his plans, but the Lord was displeased with King Asa.

God sent a prophet to him to remind him of how He (God) intervened when he fought against a million soldiers from Ethiopia and other lands. Instead of listening to the message from God, the king was angry with the prophet, and he began to oppress the people.

Two years later, Asa developed a severe disease in his feet for which he sought the help of physicians, not the Lord (2 Chronicles 16:12\). Can you imagine that? After thirty\-five years of a wealthy, successful and productive reign, he turned his back on God. Now, he had enough money to pay mercenaries and physicians. 

Sadly, he died of that disease two years later. The Bible specifically tells us that the reason Asa died of that disease wasn’t because the disease was deadly, but because Asa refused to seek the Lord (2 Chronicles 16:12\). That’s a major problem with some people today; they trust so much in their wealth and riches and have lost sight of who truly matters in their affairs, because they think it’s all about money.

Never let anything take your attention away from the Lord. Let the Spirit have pre\-eminence in your life. Make it a principle for yourself, and one to live by, that you’ll trust the Lord only and always.

## BE CIRCUMSPECT AND DISCERNING November 28th, 2021

>***For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace (Romans 8:6\).***

In Matthew 16:21\-23, we see an interesting scenario between Jesus and Peter. The Master had made it clear to His disciples that it was necessary for Him to go to Jerusalem, submit to an ordeal of suffering at the hands of the religious leaders, be killed, and be raised back to life on the third day.

Then the Bible says that Peter took the Lord aside to speak to Him privately and began to reprove and charge Him sharply, saying, “God forbid, Lord! This must never happen to you!” The Master then turned to Peter and said, *“…Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men”* (Matthew 16:23\).

He immediately turned Peter’s mind to the source of his information; He turned Peter’s mind to the spiritual. This says a lot about the spirituality of Jesus. He wanted Peter to know when an information is from God, or when it’s from the devil.

When information comes to you, you have to know where it’s coming from. Is it from the Kingdom of God, from the devil or from the world? Satan is the prince of this world, so information from the world is corrupted by Satan. Moreover, you’re not of this world (John 15:19\); therefore, you can’t live by the information that comes from the world.

Walk in understanding and discernment. Be spiritual. Through the ministry of the Word and the Spirit, the Lord graciously grants you the ability to discern and walk in His perfect will always. He wants you to be circumspect, cautious, prudent, vigilant and established in His Word, which is the true light that gives you direction and guidance.

If any information comes that’s not of the Lord, geared to sway you from the right path, by His Spirit, you’d hear His voice as you follow the truth of the Gospel. It’s one of the reasons the Pauline prayers for the Church are so important. In Colossians 1:9, he said, 

*“For this cause we … do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.”* Affirm this for yourself always. Every so often, declare that you’re circumspect and wise; you’re filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all wisdom and discernment. Hallelujah!

## FOCUS ON THE SPIRITUAL November 29th, 2021

>***Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth (Colossians 3:2\).***

In Luke 22, the Bible tells us how Jesus announced His impending death as He had Communion with His disciples. He used the occasion to reveal that one of them—Judas Iscariot—would betray Him. Shortly afterwards, Judas approached the priests and scribes and agreed to lead them to Jesus in exchange for money.

When they got to Jesus, He said to them, *“When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness”* (Luke 22:53\). Why did Jesus say, “…this is your hour, and the power of darkness” even though the prophetic word stated clearly that He’d be arrested? He was drawing our attention to something spiritual, which is the fact that the power of darkness was behind His arrest.

This gives us a perfect example as to being spiritually alert. How conscious are you of who’s controlling your thoughts and actions? When you make a decision, who’s responsible? Always focus on the spiritual, and not on the things you perceive with your physical senses. Be sure that your actions, thoughts and desires are always God\-inspired. Let the Holy Spirit lead and guide you in all things. Set your affections on Him. Colossians 3:2 says, *“Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.”*

Set your mind on the eternal Word of God and let the Holy Spirit be your teacher. The Bible says, *“For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace”* (Romans 8:5\-6\).

## WE’RE IN A WARFARE November 30th, 2021

>***For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does (2 Corinthians 10:3 NIV).***

Even though we live in the world, we’re engaged in a spiritual warfare. In Ephesians 6:12, the Apostle Paul tells us about the spirituality of this warfare. He says, *“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”*

Notice that the conflict is always on, and he also referenced “the evil day,” helping you understand the difference between a war and its battles. A war is the declaration of a state of hostilities. 1 Corinthians 14:8 AMPC tells us, *“And if the war bugle gives an uncertain (indistinct) call, who will prepare for battle?”*

A battle is the actual fight of a war; when the actual fight begins, that’s the “battle” of the war. Another expression for war is when you’re contending for something; it’s more passionate, and you don’t necessarily use arms. The point is that we have an adversary that we are up against—Satan.

Certain times, people get confused and say, “I thought I had conquered this thing”; the truth is you’re in a war. The devil doesn’t just go to sleep. Consider the temptation of Jesus. The Bible says, *“And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season”* (Luke 4:13\).

The devil left him until an opportune time (NIV). Satan knew he was defeated at that occasion, so he left Him for another time that he felt he’d have a chance. 1 Peter 5:8\-9 says, *“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. Whom resist stedfast in the faith….”*

It doesn’t matter that there’s an adversary who’s all out to oppose the Gospel and God’s children; he’s under our feet. Ephesians 6:10\-11 says, *“…be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”*

You have the dominion and authority over principalities, powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. Use the spiritual weapons at your disposal (Read Ephesians 6:14\-18\) to keep them at bay, to frustrate their stratagems and wiles, and foil all their evil works. Hallelujah!
