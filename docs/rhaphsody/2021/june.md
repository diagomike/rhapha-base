## PRAYER: A JOYFUL RESPONSE TO GOD’S INVITATION June 1st, 2021

>***And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us (1 John 5:14\).***

Ephesians 6:18 says, *“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.”* Notice that it says, “Praying always”; not “Praying sometimes.” It parallels what Jesus said in Luke 18:1: *“...Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.”*

If you’re a praying Christian, you’ll be an effective Christian; effective through the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus said to His disciples, *“…without me ye can do nothing”* (John 15:5\). In prayer, you maintain that connection in your communication; you remain open to His will and bring others to Him in your heart, as you pray for them.

Some think prayer is the response of the helpless or the weak to insurmountable and overwhelming challenges; no! Prayer, primarily, is fellowship with God; and even though when one is oppressed or suffers injustice, he should pray, that isn’t the reason for prayer. Prayer is the joyful response of the one who, with a heart full of faith, trusts in the living God.

Prayer is a response, more to God’s invitation to pray, than the response to a situation. He invited us to pray because He intended to answer. So, the greatest part of prayer isn’t the prayer itself; it’s the answer. We haven’t had a great prayer time if we didn’t receive answers to our prayer! Irrespective of what we have said in prayer, it’s God’s response that truly matters.

Thanks be unto God! We’re ordained to receive answers when we pray, because He said if we pray according to His will—His rule for prayer, which is praying in the Name of Jesus—He hears us. If He heard us, then He answered us. That’s the beauty of prayer: the fact that we’re guaranteed of a hearing (1 John 5:14\). You ought to rejoice each time you pray, and say like Jesus, “Father, I thank you, because you hear me always” (John 11:42\). Hallelujah!

## HAVE NO FEAR; BELIEVE GOD’S WORD June 2nd, 2021

>***And these signs shall follow them that believe…they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (Mark 16:17\-18\).***

In the past year, perhaps, more than ever in the history of this generation, we’ve seen intense distress of nations, with many living in immense fear. Even amongst Christians, we’ve seen church leaders go as far as putting up a sign to indicate they’re shutting down their churches because of fear.

But such actions are inconsistent with the ministry of Jesus Christ in whom we’ve believed. How can a Christian—who the Bible says is the salt of the earth and the light of the world, the one who’s anointed with the Holy Ghost; a God\-carrying vessel—be afraid?

Jesus highlighted the signs with which to identify those who believe in Him, part of which we read in our opening scripture. No one who truly believes in Jesus will be afraid of any sickness or infectious disease. He said in Luke 10:19, *“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”*

Your reaction to the things going on in the world today shows whether or not you truly believe in Jesus. It’s the pressures of life that reveal your convictions. If as a Christian, you’re “afraid” of sickness or disease, then in which God did you believe? Certainly not the same God that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the Prophets and the Apostles knew and talked about.

For many years, I’ve laid hands on people with some of the most contagious diseases in the world; very infectious diseases; but I could never have any fear of becoming infected, because it’s the same ministry of Jesus, by the life and power of the Holy Spirit. We have the divine life that’s “uninfectable” and impregnable to any sickness or disease. Take the Word of God seriously; study it; believe it, and live it.

## YOU’RE IN GOD’S REALM OF LIFE June 3rd, 2021
![June 3rd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-3-youre-in-gods-realm-of-life.jpg)

>***For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17\).***

1 Peter 1:23 says, *“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”* The word translated “incorruptible” is “aphthartos” (Greek), and it means not corruptible, immortal. You were born again by God’s immortal seed.

Immortality is translated from “aphtharsia” (Greek) in 2 Timothy 1:10, meaning life that can’t be damaged, dented or shortened. That’s the life you have in you now that you’re born again. When you received Christ to live in you, you were brought into life and immortality: *“…by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel”* (2 Timothy 1:10\).

Thus, you’re in God’s realm of life; you’re to reign through the Word. Every king has a realm in which he reigns; yours is the realm of life where death has no power. Blessed be God! You need to be awakened to this reality; the reality of your immortality. You’re not an ordinary person; you’re not subject to the elements and rudiments of this failing world of darkness.

You’re seated with Christ in the realm of glory, dominion, and power. You ought to affirm every day, “In my path, there’s no death; there’s no failure; everything works! There’s glory, excellence and victory only, because I dwell in the realm of life.”

Completely refuse and reject anything that isn’t consistent with the God\-life in you. Reject sickness, disease, infirmity and all works of darkness. According to the Scriptures, you’ve passed from death to life, from mortality into immortality, from age into agelessness, because in Christ, you live in God’s realm of life.

## EVER CONSCIOUS OF HIS PRESENCE June 4th, 2021
![June 4th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-4-ever-conscious-of-his-presence.jpg)

>***The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen (2 Corinthians 13:14\).***

The most important thing in your life now that you’re in Christ is your fellowship with the Holy Spirit. Until and unless this becomes a present\-hour consciousness to you, your Christianity would be a form of religion. You have to know, love and relate with the Holy Spirit as not only a real person, but also as the very essence of Christ and Christianity. He’s the One who raised up Jesus from the dead; and without the resurrection, there would have been no salvation. Everything you’d ever want, admire and love in Jesus is in the Holy Spirit.

The Lord Jesus is now in heaven; the Holy Spirit is here with us, and the beautiful thing about it is that we have Him (the Holy Spirit) in us and with us anywhere and everywhere. The disciples couldn’t take Jesus home with them; they were with Him in their waking hours, in their work hours, but when He went to heaven, they had to welcome the Holy Spirit.

The Holy Spirit came to take the place of the ascended Christ. He lives in you today. So, be ever conscious of His presence in you; take advantage of His grace and power in your life. With Him, you can do anything; life becomes a glide and smooth sail in glory. Hallelujah!

The apostles in the early Church understood and took great advantage of the Holy Spirit’s presence in their lives. After they received the Holy Spirit, their lives and ministry changed; they ministered and did all things by the power of the Holy Spirit. No wonder they had such extraordinary results and made such a marvelous impact with the Gospel.

I know I’m a victor forever, and will always excel, producing fruits and blessings of righteousness, because of the grace and ministry of the Holy Spirit in my life. Amen.

## CHILDREN OF THE WORD June 5th, 2021
![June 5th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-5-children-of-the-spoken-word.jpg)

>***Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant… (Acts 3:25\).***

I’ve often said that as Christians, we’re not in covenant with God; we’re the results or children of the covenant. There’s a huge difference between being in covenant, and being the result of the covenant. 

Think about it this way: when a man and woman get married, they come into a covenant; when they have children, their children are the result or fruit of that covenant. You can’t say the children are in covenant with their parents; only the parents have a covenant with each other. You have to understand this; otherwise, you’ll never really enjoy the blessings and glory of Christianity.

So, in our theme verse, Peter, preaching to the Jews, spoke spiritually. He didn’t mean they were the children of the Prophets in the sense that they were born by the wives of the Prophets; no. When he called them the children of the Prophets and of the covenant, he meant children of the promise, or the spoken Word. And that’s exactly who we are.

The Apostle Paul, in his epistle to the Galatians, writes: *“For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise”* (Galatians 3:27\-29\).

We’re as much Abraham’s seed as the Jews that Paul addressed in his epistle. The new creation is the actual spiritual seed of Abraham. We’re heirs of the promise. Romans 8:17 says, *“…if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint\-heirs with Christ….”* That’s who you are; that’s your identity! Glory to God!

I’m the seed of Abraham, the result of the spoken Word; I walk in my inheritance in Christ, being an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ. I live in victory and dominion today and always, making progress from glory to glory, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## DIVINE ACQUITTAL June 6th, 2021
![June 6th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-6-divine-acquittal.jpg)

 ---

>***Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 5:1\).***

The Bible says Jesus wasn’t only delivered to death on account of your sins, He was also raised back to life for your justification (Romans 4:25\). What does it mean to be justified? The word translated “justified” means to be acquitted and declared righteous; it is to be declared “not guilty”; free of guilt. Therefore, in the mind of justice, there’re no charges against you! The mystery of divine acquittal beats human imagination. How can a man be acquitted in an onward and permanent way? How is that possible?

In natural justice, you’re only acquitted today from charges of past offenses; you can’t be acquitted from charges of future offenses. But it’s not so with God. Your divine acquittal covers past, present and future offenses. There’s a badge on you everywhere you go that says “Acquitted!”

Read the theme verse again. It says, *“Therefore being justified by faith…”* (Romans 5:1\). What is faith? The Bible says, *“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen”* (Hebrews 11:1\). You don’t apply faith for what’s behind you, or what you already have with you. Therefore, “being justified by faith” means, from this moment, you’ve entered into the future with divine acquittal. It’s the result of what Jesus did. Now you can further appreciate when He said in Colossians 1:21\-22: *“And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled…to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.”*

You’re holy, unblameable and unreproveable in His sight. This is the way God sees you. Why would anyone want to live in sin when they understand this truth? You’re too holy, too righteous, too clean, and too pure: this is what God has given you as a gift! He declared Himself to be righteous in granting you divine acquittal for believing in Jesus: *“To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus”* (Romans 3:26\).



---  
<details>
  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, what a blessing it is to know that I’ve been divinely acquitted of all charges. I walk in the light of my justification, and reign over sin, Satan and circumstances. My life is an expression of your righteousness. I’m victorious all the way, serving you joyously without fear or condemnation, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## STRIVING IN PRAYER June 7th, 2021
![June 7th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-7-striving-in-prayer.jpg)

 ---

>***Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers… (Colossians 4:12\).***

The phrase translated “laboring fervently” in the scripture above is “agonizomai” (Greek), and it doesn’t translate into mere labouring; it means to strive. In fact, the first synonym is “to fight”; it also means to struggle or contend with an adversary. The same word is what we have in 1 Timothy 6:12 which says, *“Fight the good fight….”*

Now, Paul, by the Spirit, tells the Christians in the church in Colossae that Epaphras was always “fighting” for them in prayers. He was contending with satanic forces in their behalf. That’s part of what you do in interceding for others. 2 Corinthians 4:3\-4 says, *“But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”* Here, we see why we must strive in prayer for the souls of men.

Perhaps you have family members and loved ones, friends, colleagues and neighbours you’ve been witnessing to and they’ve refused to heed the call of salvation; God’s Word shows what the real problem is: Satan—the “god of this world”—has blinded their minds! For such people, you must contend for their souls in prayer; you “agonize” in intercession for them. You declare, “In the Name of the Lord Jesus, you evil spirit of darkness that has blinded their minds, I break your influence over them!”

But you see, you don’t stop there; you continue in intercession; it’s called prevailing in prayer. You travail in prayer over their minds, that their hearts be opened to the Lord, and be guided to the Word of God, in the Name of Jesus. You pray that the light of the glorious Gospel shines in their hearts, and they embrace the grace of God for their salvation; the presence of God mantles their hearts and God’s Word prevails in their lives. Hallelujah!

Pray like this for your friends or family members who aren’t yet born again, and you’ll be amazed at the result. Praise God!

## AS WHITE AS SNOW June 8th, 2021
![June 8th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-8-as-white-as-snow.jpg)

>***Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool (Isaiah 1:18\).***

The Lord Jesus was divine and without sin; yet, He became the sin\-sacrifice, offered up for the sin of the world. He took our place of sin on the Cross, so that we might take His place of righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21\).

As a result of what Jesus did, we’re declared holy and without blame before the Father. We can boldly stand in the presence of God without guilt, inferiority or condemnation. The truth is that God holds nothing against you. To Him, you’re as perfect as Jesus is, because your righteousness is the righteousness of Jesus Christ.

Picture it this way: An amazing prince beckons on you to attend his banquet. Whereas you’re wearing rags—dirty and smelly and wouldn’t want to come close to him or his guests because of your filthy looks—with a warm smile, he signals that you come in and flings open the banquet door.

Noticing your reluctance, he entreats further that you come in so he could introduce you to the others in the hall. But with a look of dejection, you refuse the invitation. Finally, the prince says, “I know how you feel; I’ll not make you ashamed. Can you trust me?” Then, you trust his word, and go in. However, you still can’t imagine yourself mingling with such clean and flawless people.

Knowing your thoughts, the prince says, “Now that you’ve believed, look at yourself again!” Then you did and suddenly, you were as regal and immaculate as the prince and everyone else in the room. This is akin to your righteousness in Christ Jesus. The Bible says, *“Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ”* (Romans 5:1\). Glory to God!

No wonder He says in 1 Corinthians 6:11 that you’re washed, sanctified, and justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Now He’s made you His partner in bringing others into this amazing life of righteousness, to experience the same peace and glory you have in Him. Hallelujah! Don’t keep it to yourself.

## CIVIL AUTHORITIES ARE FOR GOOD WORKS June 9th, 2021
![June 9th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-9-civil-authorities-are-for-good-works.jpg)

 ---

>***For civil authorities are not a terror to \[people of] good conduct, but to \[those of] bad behavior. Would you have no dread of him who is in authority? Then do what is right and you will receive his approval and commendation (Romans 13:3 AMPC).***

God’s Word teaches that we obey civil authorities because they’re established by God (Romans 13:2\). So, whether it’s the king, the prime minister, the president, the governor or mayor, etc., we’re to obey them, but only in the context of God’s Word.

1 Peter 2:13\-15 says, *“Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.”* Peter, by the Spirit, shows us that these ordinances were set up for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.

However, we’re in a world where some government leaders do the exact opposite of what the Word says. That’s why it can become a problem if you leave the definition of “right” or “wrong” to the government. The Word of God is what determines right and wrong. In Romans 13:1\-4, the Spirit of God, through the Apostle Paul, admonishes everyone to obey state authorities, because no authority exists without God’s permission.

But He didn’t stop there; He went further to spell the responsibilities of the state: *“For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil”* (Romans 13:3\-4\).

You may then ask, “Doesn’t it follow that whatever a leader does, therefore, is from God?” Absolutely not! You have to apply the right contextual understanding; otherwise, where would you place the likes of Stalin, Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler? Their actions were ungodly. So we understand that not all leaders please the Lord.

Civil authorities are to promote a righteous cause; they’re for good works not evil. Proverbs 29:2 \& 4 (AMPC) says, *“When the \[uncompromisingly] righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked man rules, the people groan and sigh…The king by justice establishes the land, but he who exacts gifts and tribute overthrows it.”*

## HIS TRUE DELIGHT June 10th, 2021

>***Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men (Proverbs 8:30\-31\).***

Jesus said, *“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you”* (John 14:16\-17\). These words corroborate the Spirit’s true desire as revealed in Proverbs 8:31 RSV: *“…delighting in the sons of men.”*

The desire of the Spirit of God, who is the conveyor of the blessings of God and of all that’s been given to us in Christ Jesus is to dwell in you and have fellowship with you. His desire wasn’t to live in heaven without us, but to be with us, and in us.

This explains one major reason we got filled with the Holy Spirit. He came to live in us because He loves us and desires deep fellowship with us. That’s why Jesus encouraged us about fellowship with the Holy Spirit. It also brings to mind Paul’s beautiful prayer for the Christians in Corinth: *“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen”* (2 Corinthians 13:14\).

At the end of all things, His ultimate desire will be made manifest, because Revelation 21:3 says, *“And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God.”* Blessed be God.

Think about the fact that this awesome infinite personality of the Godhead—the Holy Spirit—lives in you in His fullness, making you the headquarters of His operations in the earth. You’re His moving house, bearing His grace, glory and righteousness. This has always been His desire. Hallelujah!

If you’d learn to fellowship with the Holy Spirit, He’ll transform your life. He’ll cause the glory of Christ to be seen and expressed through you in ways you never thought possible.

## THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN June 11th, 2021
![June 11th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-11-the-kingdom-of-heaven.jpg)

>***And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand (Matthew 3:2\).***

Matthew, in the verse above, used the term, “the kingdom of heaven” as he talked about the message that John the Baptist came preaching. But when you read Mark’s account, he (Mark) used the term, “the kingdom of God”: *“And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel”* (Mark 1:15\).

Whenever the writers of the Synoptic gospels— Matthew, Mark and Luke report the same event, with some disparity, Matthew’s account is likely to be the most verbatim in quoting Jesus, because among the three writers, he was the only one of the twelve apostles, hearing directly from Jesus. A good example is when He used the expression “kingdom of heaven” and when He used “kingdom of God.”

You might ask, “Is there a difference between the two?” Though synonymously used, both expressions are clearly different. The Kingdom of Heaven is that part of the Kingdom of God established in the earth, and headed by Jesus. In fact, the Greek rendering is “Kingdom of the heavens,” which means a kingdom from heaven.

“Kingdom of God” refers to the rulership of God, the dominion of God, the realm of God. The Kingdom of God is universal; it goes beyond mere territories. It goes as far as to your heart—which is why the Kingdom of God can be established in your heart. Jesus said the kingdom of God is within you (Luke 17:21\).

Jesus came to establish the Kingdom of Heaven in the earth, to project the Kingdom of God, as the ambassador of the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of Heaven is the Embassy of the Kingdom of God. So, Jesus sets up His headquarters in the earth and His job is to bring people into God’s Kingdom.

In essence, the Kingdom of Heaven is about the work of Jesus Christ in the earth; it’s the extension of the Kingdom of God in the earth, headed by Jesus Christ. The Kingdom of Heaven is here now, of which we’re a part. Hallelujah!

## DON’T LIVE IN NAME ONLY June 12th, 2021

>***And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead (Revelation 3:1\).***

Jesus said concerning the church in Sardis, *“… thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.”* The church lived in name only, but was dead. It’s like living in history. The death mentioned here isn’t total death. It’s a state where, even though there’re still works and activities, there’s so much apathy and “spiritlessness.”

Being alive in name only isn’t a good thing. Some nations and churches are like that. They have a name of a living church, or are recognised in the comity of nations, but they’re dead. This can also happen to an individual, because churches and nations are made up of individuals.

A worship leader, for instance, could sing and people would think he’s alive, but he knows that he struggles to pray, doesn’t fast, and no longer reads the Bible. God wants everyone in this position to repent. The Master’s instruction to such folks is to be watchful and strengthen the things that are ready to die. That’s quite interesting.

For that worship leader, it may be the singing that’s ready to die and he or she doesn’t know it. So, fan the embers of your desire for the Lord and the things of the Spirit. Be aglow and afire for Him always. Pray often. Win souls. Study and meditate on the Word. Be watchful and strengthen these things. Be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord in truth.

## PRAY FOR ALL MEN June 13th, 2021
![June 13th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-13-pray-for-all-men.jpg)

>***And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel (1 Chronicles 21:1\).***

The Bible shows how evil spirits influence men to do wrong. One of such instances is what we read about David in our theme verse. Imagine David, a righteous king, was moved by Satan to number Israel against God’s will. As a result, God took actions against Israel.

There’s another incident recorded for us in the gospels. When Jesus made it clear to His disciples that it was necessary for Him to die on account of our sins and be raised back to life for our justification, Peter took Him aside and began to “rebuke” Him, saying, “God forbid, Lord! This must never happen to you; you’re not going to die” (Matthew 16:22\).

Jesus, right away, identified that it was Satan speaking through Peter, and the Bible says *“...he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men”* (Matthew 16:23\). So, even good men can be moved by Satan to do or say the wrong things. That’s why God wants us to know the truth; know His Word. When you know the truth, you can walk in the light of it. You’ll know how to pray, and how to put a stop to Satan’s works and influences around you.

Learn to pray for all nations of men, leaders and those in authority as admonished in 1 Timothy 2:1\-2\. Boldly declare by the Spirit that the will, plans and purposes of God be established in and around you, in the hearts of leaders in your community, city, town, nation and in the organisation where you work. Pray that they refuse to yield to negative influences that could stir them to wickedness; rather, they rule with justice and equity, righteousness and truth. Amen.

## “PRAYING IN PRAYER” June 14th, 2021
![June 14th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-14-praying-in-prayer.jpg)

>***Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months (James 5:17\).***

The Greek connotation of the words “prayed earnestly” is an interesting emphasis; it actually says that Elijah “Prayed in prayer”; like when Jesus said to His disciples in Luke 22:15, *“...With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.”*

How do you “desire” something with desire? Or “pray” in prayer? It’s a way of strengthening the communication. Thus, by including the word “earnest,” he helps us understand the strength of what he wanted to communicate. It means “heartfelt, continued prayer,” like the Amplified Classic version puts it: *“…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available \[dynamic in its working]”* (James 5:16\).

1 Kings 17 gives us the details of what transpired during the course of prayer: *“And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word”* (1 Kings 17:1\).

Elijah didn’t just say, “There’ll be no rain according to my word,” just because he felt like it; no! The 18th chapter lets us know Elijah did what he did at the word of the Lord. When it was time for the drought to end, he “prayed in prayer” again, or like the King James puts it, he “prayed earnestly”; it was heartfelt and continued until he had the desired results (study 1 Kings 17\-18\).

The same way Elijah was effective in prayer, you also can trust in the same living God and “pray” in prayer when you desire a change. Elijah prayed and something remarkable happened to a whole nation. We can effect changes in our nation, state, city or institution. The earnest, heartfelt, continued prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available, dynamic in its working. Pray this way. Pray with deep desire, with intense passion, and there’ll be a change. Hallelujah!

## FOLLOW PROPHETIC INSTRUCTIONS June 15th, 2021
![June 15th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-15-follow-prophetic-instructions.jpg)

>***Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life (Proverbs 4:13\).***

In 2 Kings 13, we find a very interesting story concerning the Prophet Elisha and Joash, King of Israel. Joash was having trouble with the Syrians and wanted victory over them. So, he came to the man of God, Elisha. Part of their ensuing dialogue was Elisha instructing Joash to take some arrows and smite them upon the ground.

The Bible says Joash did it three times and stopped (2 Kings 13:18\). Elisha, the man of God was furious (the Bible says wroth) with King Joash (2 Kings 13:19\) because he stopped. He should have kept on shooting the arrows until the Prophet told him to stop. Shooting the arrows only three times meant he was only going to defeat Syria three times; whereas, God’s plan was something far better. Joash didn’t know that it mattered how many times he shot the arrows. The prophet didn’t ask him to stop, but he stopped by himself.

Here’s what I want to get across to you: Sometimes, many ignore very important things without knowing it, such as paying attention to prophetic instructions, which is part of God’s guidance for His children. A prophetic instruction is an instruction of the Spirit that’s given to you by the Spirit; it’s directed to you, for you. It could come to you directly by the Spirit of God from within you or through someone whom He’s given some leadership influence over your life.

For example, the Lord may be asking you to fast for a certain period of time, but you don’t think it’s important; so, you either didn’t fast at all or you didn’t meet the duration, and then something unpleasant happens. You may not realize that it’s connected to the instruction that you didn’t follow. Such things matter; so, don’t take them lightly. It could be some spiritual instruction from your Pastor, to you or to the congregation of which you’re a member. These are all important.

When God gives you a prophetic instruction or guidance, it’s in your interest to follow through. Your entire destiny or the next level of your success, promotion and greatness may depend on it.

## REIGNING THROUGH CHRIST June 16th, 2021

>***For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17\).***

We have received abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness. Now we reign in and by Christ Jesus. We reign through Christ over the world and its systems, circumstances, and over Satan and his demonic community.

The Bible says whatever you do, in word or deed, do all in the Name of Jesus (Colossians 3:17\). His Name is the greatest and highest name in heaven, in earth, and in hell! The Name of Jesus commands the greatest respect. He told us we could cast out devils in His Name. Make sure you’re doing it. Hallelujah!

I recall something that happened when I was a student many years ago. There was a certain university that was troubled by cultists. I mobilized a few friends of mine and we went to the place where the foundation stone of the school was laid.

When we arrived there, we placed our hands on the stone and declared, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, you demons of darkness that have been controlling this school, controlling the students, responsible for cultism here, we break your authority and influence; be gone in the Name of Jesus!”

Guess what? On that same campus, we set up the fellowship that would become the largest fellowship on that campus, till this day. Of course, we don’t have to go to any foundation stone; from wherever you are, you can issue commands to demons anywhere, in the Name of Jesus, and dislodge them.

Christianity is living in the Name of Jesus. The Bible says, *“… be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might”* (Ephesians 6:10\); that means take advantage of His ability; take advantage of His might, of His power, standing in His Name and functioning under His auspices. You can’t have that Name and be helpless; never! Use it today and always, and live victoriously evermore. Glory to God!

## A BALANCED LIFE June 17th, 2021
![June 17th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/june-day-17-a-balanced-life.jpg)

>***That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God (Colossians 1:10\).***

The Holy Spirit inspired the Apostle Paul to pray the prayer above for the Church, letting us understand God’s will for our lives. He prayed that you’d walk in the way of true righteousness, pleasing God in all that you do, fruitful and productive, as you mature in the rich experience of knowing Him in His fullness. Hallelujah!

God wants your life to be fruitful in every good work. With this fruitfulness, He wants you increasing in your “epignosis” (full, exact and experiential knowledge) of Him. What a balanced life! For some people, when they become very productive with their work, business or career, they don’t have time for God anymore. They hardly even study the Bible or participate in church meetings and activities. The more they make progress in their job, the less time they devote to spiritual things; something is wrong.

The life of the Christian is one of ever\-increasing glory; all\-round success. That is, you’re making good progress in your work, your family is doing fine, your children are growing up strong in faith and in righteousness, and at the same time, you’re increasing in the knowledge of God.

Oh, how important the knowledge of God is! The Bible says, *“Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord”* (2 Peter 1:2\). Do you want more grace in your life, and peace multiplied unto you? Go for the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ!

God doesn’t want you deficient in any area of your life. In the 11th verse of Colossians 1, Paul continued in his prayer declaring that you be strengthened with all might, according to God’s glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness. You can be very fruitful, productive, and strong. God wants your life to be balanced; and you can actualize His desire in your life by walking in the knowledge of His Word.

## A KNOWLEDGE OF RELATIONSHIP June 18th, 2021

>***Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him (Ephesians 1:16\-17\).***

Just because you’ve been a Christian for a long time doesn’t necessarily mean you’d be effective for God, and in the things of God. It takes more than singing nicely, praising God joyfully, and even preaching, to be effective for Christ and for the Kingdom; you have to know Him in a very personal way.

That’s the reason for Paul’s prayer for the baby church in Ephesus, as read in our opening verse. Paul heard about their love for God; they were excited about the things of God. But he knew they lacked something and prayed that the Lord would grant it to them: *“...the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him….”*

There’s a certain type of knowledge, a certain type of revelation of God that you ought to have; it’s called “Epignosis” (Greek); knowledge that relates with the known; a knowledge of relationship. This knowledge is different from theology, or mere science.

You can appropriate that prayer of the Spirit through Paul for yourself; put your name there and say, “I have the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the accurate knowledge of God.” You’ll experience the unveiling! It’s the work of the Spirit of God.

Without this kind of knowledge, you’ll be a religious Christian, doing things religiously, without having a real relationship with God. When you have that relationship, you no longer see Him as the God of David or the God of Elijah; He becomes your God; He’s personal to you. That’s when you really appreciate and celebrate your union and oneness with Him.

## ESTABLISH HIS WILL FOR YOUR WORLD June 19th, 2021

>***Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh… (Jeremiah 17:7\-8\).***

In Hebrews 11:3, the Bible says, *“Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God….”* The word “framed” is “katartizo” (Greek), and it means to repair or adjust, to complete thoroughly, to restore, prepare, mend or to make perfect. With faith, you can frame the course of your life in line with God’s perfect will.

There’re things happening in your world today— circumstances and situations—that aren’t consistent with the will of God. They try to mess up your world; don’t let that happen; frame your world.

Your responsibility is to establish the will of the Father in the earth. His will won’t be fulfilled without His hand, and you’re His hand to establish His perfect will. It’s your life, your ministry, and calling to establish the will of the Father as far as it concerns you in your world. Otherwise, it’ll not happen.

Don’t fold your hands and watch the devil wreak havoc in your life, family, city or country, or in the lives of your loved ones. Let the Word of God in your heart come out from your mouth. With the Word on your lips, you truncate and decimate the efforts of the adversary!

In Joel 2:28, when God said, *“...I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy...,”* He was letting you know with what to control the “aions,” the circumstances of your life; it’s by your words of prophecy! You can live in an oasis of peace in a troubled world.

The whole world can be chaotic, rocking around you, whereas you’re in absolute peace. That’s the message in our theme verse: you’ll not know when heat comes. They may be depressed, and you’re in absolute prosperity. How? Through your faith\-filled words. Don’t keep the Word only in your heart; speak it forth and frame your world! Frame how you want things to be with you and for you.

## TRUST AND BOAST IN HIS NAME June 20th, 2021

>***And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him (Colossians 3:17\).***

In 1 John 5:13, John writes, *“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; **that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.**”* Notice the underlined construction; it simply means to put the Name of Jesus to work! His Name is your access to every city and every nation. It’s your guarantee of consistent victory and unending blessings.

The Name of Jesus is bigger than the whole world. Philippians 2:10 says, *“…at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.”* That Name is named upon you. This is the reason you can be unruffled and at peace in any city, region or nation, irrespective of the adversaries or adversities that you might face. His Name is your security.

Solomon had an idea about this and said in Proverbs 18:10, “The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.” That was in the Old Testament; today we don’t “run” into the Name of The Lord; we were born in Him, and have inherited His Name. We live in and by His Name. Hallelujah!

This was what Peter and John knew and acted out when they healed the lame man at the gate of the temple called Beautiful; they put the Name of Jesus to work (Read Acts 3:1\-10\). The man was crippled from birth, but Peter fastened his eyes on him and said, *“…In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk”* (Acts 3:6\).

The Bible says Peter grabbed him by the arm, yanked him up, and instantly, his ankle bones received strength. Maybe today, your finances, job, or business is in a “crippled” state; use the Name of Jesus! Are there doors that seem to have been shut against you? Put that Name to work.

Unlike your own name, or any other name, the Name of Jesus can be trusted. The Psalmist said in Psalm 20:7 AMPC, *“Some trust in and boast of chariots and some of horses, but we will trust in and boast of the name of the Lord our God.”* It doesn’t matter the challenges you might be facing in your finances or in your health; put the Name of Jesus to work. If it’s a pain or a growth in your body, command it to dematerialize in the Name of Jesus, and it shall be so. His Name is the Name you can trust.

## UNBELIEF AND OBEDIENCE June 21st, 2021

>***Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience (Ephesians 2:2\).***

The word “disobedience” in the scripture above is translated from the Greek word “apeitheia” and it means disbelief (obstinate and rebellious); it’s characteristically unbelief. So, it’s referring to the children of unbelief. It describes something that’s very much like the spirit of the antichrist.

2 Thessalonians 2:7 AMPC says, *“For the mystery of lawlessness (that hidden principle of rebellion against constituted authority) is already at work in the world, \[but it is] restrained only until he who restrains is taken out of the way.”* “Mystery of lawlessness” refers to rebellion; a defiant opposition to God; to be highly opposed to God’s will; to God’s Word.

There’re people who, without even knowing why, find themselves doing the things they do, in defiance to God. That’s how come you find people who say, “I just don’t like Christians.” If you were to ask them the reason for such hatred, they’ll say, “Nothing; I just don’t like them.” The Bible shows us what spirit is working in such people.

1 Corinthians 2:12 talks about the spirit of the world; and it’s the same spirit we read about in our opening scripture: *“...the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience”* (Ephesians 2:2\). But thank God the Bible says that’s not what we received. We received the Spirit of God and He teaches us and nurtures us in the will of the Father: *“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God”* (1 Corinthians 2:12\). Hallelujah!

## USE THE WORD TO MAKE YOUR LIFE GLORIOUS June 22nd, 2021

>***Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all (Galatians 4:1\).***

“God is going to see me through; He’ll make a way for me, where there’s no way….” These are some of the unscriptural statements you hear from some Christians from time to time, and they wonder why their situations remain unchanged. You need to understand who you really are as a Christian; you’re one with God! As He is, so are you (1 John 4:17\); and who is He? He is the WAY!

If He’s the way, which other way do you want Him to make? Understand this: nothing that you face is set to your disadvantage. You can walk through any barrier, or adverse circumstance in victory and great glory. That’s your heritage as a child of God.

Quit thinking, talking and living as though you’re in the Old Testament. You don’t need a “breakthrough” from anything; you already “broke through” with Jesus when He rose triumphantly from the grave two thousand years ago. You were delivered (past tense) from the domain of darkness, and translated into the Kingdom of God’s Love\-son. You’re in the place of dominion, power and glory.

2 Peter 1:3 says, *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”* It’s about your knowledge of Him. What becomes of your life is now entirely up to you.

If you’re waiting on God to do anything about your life, or give you anything, you may wait in vain. He already did and gave you all that you require for an excellent, glorious and triumphant life. The works were finished from the foundation of the world (Hebrews 4:3 NKJV).

In Joshua 1:8, God didn’t say, “I’m going to make your way prosperous”; rather, He said, “YOU will make your own way prosperous.” God’s responsibility is to give you the recipe for prosperity, success and the good life, and He already did that through His Word. Now, you’re to use the Word to make your life glorious. Use the Word to subdue circumstances and prevail against adversities. Praise God!

## BE FERVENT IN SOUL-WINNING AND INTERCESSION June 23rd, 2021

>***Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience (Ephesians 2:2\).***

One of the most pitiful things to read about is the actual state of those who don’t know Jesus Christ. The scripture above is telling us about such people; those who aren’t Christians. It says they walk *“according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.”*

It helps you understand why they think the way they do; they’re controlled by some other force. It says the prince of the power of the air is at work in them—the children of disobedience—those who have rejected the truth. This is where we come in; we must break the power of Satan over such folks and take the light of God’s Word to them.

The Bible says you must bind the strongman to plunder his house (Matthew 12:29\). For us to record a massive harvest of souls in the nations of the world in these last days, we must break the power and influence of Satan and demons over the minds and lives of those who haven’t yet known the Lord, so the light of God’s glorious Gospel can shine in their hearts.

Anyone who’s not born again, whether it’s your father, mother, uncle, auntie, brother, sister, cousin, nephew, niece, in\-law, friend, colleague, neighbour, etc.; they’re all under the control and dominion of these wicked rulers of darkness, until they receive the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

2 Corinthians 4:3 says, *“But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.”* Ephesians 4:18 says they have their understanding darkened. That’s why you must do something about it; they’re your responsibility. Be more fervent in soul winning and intercession; the harvest is ripe. Right from the day of Pentecost, the Bible tells us the Holy Spirit was poured out upon all men, in accordance with the prophecy in Joel 2:28\.

This means men now have the potential ability of recognizing and receiving the truth. As you pray, declare that the power and influence of Satan and his demons over the people are broken in the Name of Jesus, and men and women hear the Gospel, perceive, understand and receive it for their salvation in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah! We must do this with all earnestness.

## AVAIL YOURSELF OF HIS POWER IN YOU June 24th, 2021

>***And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us\-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power (Ephesians 1:19\).***

In the scripture above, the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, prayed for the Christians at Ephesus that they’d know the exceeding greatness of God’s power at work in them. Of course, everybody knows God is powerful; if there’s a God in heaven, He must be powerful. But is that power directed towards you? Is that power available for your use?

That’s what Paul was talking about. He wants you to come to the point where you know that the power of God is available for your use, for your application in the “now” of your life. He wants you to have the knowledge and be conscious that it’s the power of God that’s working in our behalf. That’s the power He demonstrated when He raised Jesus from the dead.

The second part of the opening scripture talks about the authority that we have in Him. Verses 22 and 23 says, *“And hath put all things under his (Jesus’) feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all”* (Ephesians 1:22\-23\). That’s us! He’s letting you know the power of your authority in Christ Jesus.

When you come to understand that you have His dominion, His all\-encompassing and unlimited authority, you’ll never be afraid of Satan, man, or anything. You’d think and talk like David who said, *“Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil…”* (Psalm 23:4\). *“The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?...Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear…”* (Psalm 27:1, 3\). Hallelujah!

## BE IN THE CENTRE OF GOD’S WILL June 25th, 2021

>***For we are God’s \[own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, \[born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us \[taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them \[living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).***

Something I always wanted with God was to be in the centre of His will for my life. I didn’t want anything to push me out of it. I knew that being in the centre of His will is the perfect place of safety; nowhere else would satisfy. When I found out that He already had my life all planned out, I chose to run with that plan and no longer have to make my own plan.

We aren’t some form of afterthought in God’s plan; no, our lives were carefully orchestrated. The works God commanded us to do were planned beforehand. The question isn’t whether the plan has been made; the question is whether you’ll agree in your life to live according to His plan. Our theme verse says we’re to take *“…paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them \[living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].”*

Your path of life was prepared ahead of time. He planned for you, not just to live, but to live the good life! If you aren’t living a good life, it means you aren’t on the path that God prearranged for you; and I’m using the Word of God to correct you, even now.

In 2 Timothy 1:9, the Bible says God *“...hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began.”* Purpose and grace were given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. The plan was already there, and now, it’s made manifest (2 Timothy 1:10\). Would you embrace it?

This is your time for a realignment. He wants you to have a full, deep and clear knowledge of His will, His purpose for your life, and fulfil it. Nothing could be more important.

## WE ARE OF THE TRUTH June 26th, 2021

>***Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth (John 17:17\).***

As God’s children, we’re born of His truth; thus, we’re children of truth. We live in and by truth. We’re located by truth, and receive truth. But the children of the world feed on lies, and therefore live a lie.

It brings to mind the words of Jesus to the Jews who wouldn’t hear and receive His Word. He said, *“Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not”* (John 8:43\-45\).

They couldn’t hear and receive His truth because they didn’t belong to Him; they weren’t children of truth. Anyone who is of the truth will hear His voice. How can someone be of the truth? It’s by believing the truth; by receiving truth.

How can you know truth? Truth distinguishes itself. The Bible says, *“But wisdom is justified of all her children”* (Luke 7:35\). You’ll know truth when it comes to your spirit. God’s truth produces faith in you; it produces the love of God in your heart. His truth fills you with hope and brings liberty to your spirit. It’ll also give you direction, because the Word of God is light. Psalm 119:105 tells us, *“Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”* Hallelujah!

## REASSIGN THE EARTH’S DESOLATE HERITAGES June 27th, 2021

>***…and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages (Isaiah 49:8\).***

The KJV construction of the verse above, especially the latter part, is somewhat complex; but the NIV simplifies it. It says, *“…to restore the land and to **reassign its desolate inheritances**.”* Notice the underlined expression; it’s so powerful. It means that as God’s people, we’re designated to reassign the earth’s desolate heritages.

In other words, in places where Satan has wreaked havoc, we can overturn his activities, his manipulations and manoeuvres, and establish the will of God. The Bible talks about the dark places of the earth that are filled with the habitations of cruelty (Psalm 74:20\); but it’s not enough to cast the devils out of such regions and places; we must reassign such places to angels and insist that only the righteousness of God prevails therein.

Therefore, if you have noticed satanic activities in your city, town, village, county, region or country, do what Jesus said to do in Mark 16:17: Cast the devils out, as you pray fervently in the Spirit and charge them to return no more. Then reassign these regions, formerly destitute of the Spirit of God, to angels.

Why is this important? It’s because of what Jesus said; He said the devil that you cast out goes to the dry places seeking rest, looking for where to go. If he doesn’t find any, he comes back to the same place from where he was cast out, and if he finds it empty, swept and garnished, he’ll bring in seven other spirits more wicked than himself (Read Matthew 12:43\-45\).

So, you’ve got to learn to reassign desolate heritages. You have the authority and there’re angels at your service. And so, when you dispossess evil spirits from a family, city or a nation, you say, “In the Name of Jesus, I reassign this family, city or nation to angels of God!” The Holy Ghost knows exactly which of the angels should take over that place to ensure things are run by the principles of the Kingdom of God, ensuring only the Word of God dominates and prevails. Praise God!

## IT’S IN YOUR MOUTH June 28th, 2021

>***Giving thanks unto the Father…Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12\-13\).***

In Exodus 17, the Bible shows us that the Amalekites became one of Israel’s enemies in the early periods of their history. So, Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men, and go and fight with Amalek; but I’ll go up to the mountain of God with the rod of God in my hand” (Exodus 17:9\). Exodus 17:10 says, *“So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.”*

While the battle was raging, Aaron and Hur noticed that whenever Moses held up his hands, Israel prevailed, and when he lowered his hands, the Amalekites prevailed. The Bible says they *“…took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun”* (Exodus 17:12\).

As a result, Joshua, leading the army of Israel, discomfited Amalek: *“And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword”* (Exodus 17:13\). But the war was won from the mountain, through the lifting up of Moses’ hands; they controlled things in the earth, from the spiritual realm.

On a previous occasion, God had said to Moses, when the Israelites, being chased by the Egyptians, came before the red sea, “Stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it” (Exodus 14:16\). But in Joshua’s day, the revelation progressed; it was about where the soles of their feet shall tread upon: *“Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses”* (Joshua 1:3\).

No wonder when it was time for them to cross the Jordan, Joshua didn’t have to stretch his hands over Jordan. The Bible says soon as *“…the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,) That the waters… failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho”* (Joshua 3:15\-16\). Blessed be God! In our day, it’s even better! We only need to speak from wherever we are, and the power of God will be activated for supernatural results anywhere in the world. The power is in your mouth! The Word is in your mouth. The authority is in your mouth, by the blessed Name of the Lord Jesus Christ! We don’t need to climb up the mountain like Moses; we’re already on the mountain of God! We were born there, for the Bible says we’ve arrived on Mount Zion (Hebrews 12:22\). Praise God forever!

## HIS INVIGORATING POWER IN YOU June 29th, 2021

>***That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man (Ephesians 3:16\).***

When the Holy Spirit came to live in the quarters of your heart, you ceased to be an ordinary being. Many have received the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues, but they haven’t understood this truth; they haven’t been taught what the Holy Spirit has the power and ability to do inside them.

The Holy Spirit living inside you makes you a superman! That’s what the Apostle Paul was referring to in our theme verse. He prayed that God’s people be “strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man.” The word “strengthened” is to be invigorated with might.

The Bible tells us that when the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt and headed for the Promised Land, *“...there was not one feeble person among their tribes”* (Psalm 105:37\). None of them had to be carried because he or she was too weak. They were divinely invigorated. It’s the same with you today, and even better.

Now that you’ve received the Holy Spirit, your hitherto mortal body has been quickened—made alive. You can live without any form of weakness in your body. Romans 8:10 tells us that since Christ now lives in you, even if your body had been ravaged by sickness and disease, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness. That’s divine vitalization.

Christ in you—the Holy Ghost in you— is your assurance of healing, divine health and a glorious life in Christ Jesus. But if you’re not taught this, it’ll not be real in your life. That’s why you find many Christians who believe it’s okay to be sick; no! Christians aren’t supposed to be sick; not when you have the Holy Spirit.

The Bible says your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19\). The Holy Spirit perambulates your body (2 Corinthians 6:16\). How can sickness thrive in your body, where the Holy Spirit perambulates? What you need is to be more conscious of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, of His power and glory in you. Hallelujah!

I’m constantly invigorated by the Holy Spirit who dwells in me. He gives me supernatural power, the miracle-working ability to perform. There’s no weakness in me, because the Holy Spirit, the very embodiment of all glory, dominion and strength, lives in me in His fullness; and He keeps my spirit, soul and body invigorated and ever alive. Glory to God!

## TRUST AND LIVE IN THE WORD June 30th, 2021

>**But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves…But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed (James 1:22\-25\).**

The Word of God is immutable and infallible; its integrity is unquestionable. The Word is able to produce in and for you the message that it bears. God’s Word is everything. Any change or miracle you desire in life is possible through the Word. God’s Word is His material for your blessing, which is why you must get the Word into your spirit; trust and live in the Word. 

God’s response to you, His solution to every problem, is His Word. To those who were afflicted and in distress, Psalm 107:20 says, *“He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.”* When He wanted to launch Abraham to a new level in his life, He gave him the Word. He said to him, *“Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee”* (Genesis 17:5\). Though Abraham had no physical descendants at the time, in the mind of God, he was the father of many nations. That was God’s destiny for him, a destiny created through God’s Word.

Don’t assume that as long as God has given a word concerning you, it’ll come to pass; you have a role to play. You must connect to and align yourself with His message to you to experience the blessings thereof.

God’s Word is full of power, and that power is real and available to us. However, the way to make contact with that power and use it to your benefit is walking in the Word, being a doer of the Word. It’s the doers—not the hearers of the Word—that are blessed. Read our theme scripture again.
