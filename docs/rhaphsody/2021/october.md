## LIFE WORKS IN YOU October 1st, 2021

>***Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned (Romans 5:12\).***

Through Adam’s transgression, death passed upon all men. What is death? Many think that death is just the cessation of life, but it’s much more than that. Firstly, death is the expulsion or removal of God’s presence, Spirit and influence from any creature.

Life comes from God; therefore, anything that hasn’t been imparted by the presence of God or His Spirit can’t have life. Science, with all its discoveries, can’t create or give life; they’ve got to get the life from something else that God already made. Anything can be fabricated, but it’ll not have life except there’s contact or influence with what already has life.

Secondly, death is the corruption of a creation and resultant dissolution into its original components. Anything that has life has been influenced by God; it has God’s presence and has been touched of the Spirit. But Satan, who had the power of death, is against that. He works towards the expulsion or removal of that presence. Death begins with the corruption of the creation.

If you have pure water in a vessel, and then drop some little impurity in it, it’s corrupted; it’s now less than a hundred per cent pure. Death begins with corruption of a creation; a change into something that makes it less glorious than it ought to be. Satan aims for the corruption and eventual dissolution of that creation into its original constituents. For example, when a human body dies, the spirit departs, and the body eventually decomposes into water and dirt.

Satan hates God’s creation and seeks to destroy it. That’s why when sickness attacks the body, it’s a corruption of the person’s health. But thanks be unto God! Jesus put an end to death! The Bible says, *“…Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel”* (2 Timothy 1:10\). Hallelujah! Death has been abolished.

In Christ, you’ve been brought into “deathlessness!” Whereas everything in the natural world degenerates, life works in you and in everything that’s connected to you, because you’re in the realm of life. You’ve passed from death to life (John 5:24\). Romans 5:17 says, *“…they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”*

## HE QUALIFIED US FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS October 2nd, 2021
![October 2nd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-2-he-qualified-us-for-righteousness.jpg)

>***For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17\).***

When you confessed the Lordship of Jesus over your life, instantly, His righteousness was imparted to your spirit; His righteousness became your righteousness. You’re now living in the righteousness of Jesus Christ.

Jesus was righteous before God; He was the only one born sinless and lived without sin. Thus, He qualified to be man’s substitute. He fulfilled all the righteous demands of justice in our behalf. He became sin on the Cross, for our sakes, so we could be made righteous. He qualified us to be righteous. Hallelujah!

The Bible says Adam’s transgression made all men sinners; likewise, the obedience of Christ has made all men righteous. This is legal before God. Anyone who acknowledges the obedience and sacrifice of Christ, and confesses His Lordship is immediately catapulted into the vital experience of salvation and the life of righteousness.

Romans 5:1 says, *“Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” To be “justified”* means you’re acquitted by your faith in Christ Jesus; you’re declared righteous as though you never sinned, because of what Jesus did. Now you’re in oneness with God, in fellowship with Him by Jesus Christ. This is so huge; but sadly, many haven’t grasped it yet; as a result, they’re still struggling to be righteous. There’s nothing that you do today, or could ever do, that’ll make you righteous before God; that’s why He gave you His own righteousness. How He loves us so much!

Being born again, you’re as righteous as Jesus is righteous. He substituted His righteousness for your sin\-nature; think about that! Now you can fellowship with God unashamed, with boldness, confidence and joy, knowing that He loves you unconditionally. Hallelujah!

## THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PRIESTS October 3rd, 2021
![October 3rd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-3-the-responsibilities-of-priests.jpg)

 ---

>***Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way (1 Samuel 12:23\).***

The Bible says in Revelation 1:6 that the Lord Jesus has *“…made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.”* So, in Christ, you’re a priest before God. Each one of us is occupying that office today, and there’re responsibilities attached to that office.

The first responsibility of priests is ministering to the Lord. When Aaron was going to be made a priest, God said to Moses, *“…take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office…”* (Exodus 28:1\). But how do we minister to God as priests?

1 Peter 2:5 says, *“Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.”* We don’t offer bulls and goats as they did in the Old Testament but spiritual sacrifices: the calves of our lips (Hosea 14:2\). Hallelujah!

Secondly, priests make the Word of God known. When Jesus gave the great commission in Matthew 28:19\-20, it was to us—the priests of God. He said*, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”* 

You’re to make pupils of those in your world; teach them about God and the Kingdom\-life; let them in on the fundamentals of the glorious Kingdom we’ve been brought into. The Bible says, *“It’s the job of priests to teach the truth. People are supposed to look to them for guidance…”* (Malachi 2:7 MSG). This is your ministry as a priest; it’s your calling, and responsibility, to make His Word known to the world; people should seek, inquire for and require knowledge from you about the life of righteousness.

The third responsibility of priests is intercession. We’re like Jesus our High Priest, about whom the Bible says, *“Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them”* (Hebrews 7:25\). Our theme verse shows us Samuel as a teaching priest who wouldn’t cease to pray for the people. Be like\-minded. Pray often for all men and for your country.

God has given us the dominion and the authority to alter the course of events in the earth, using the Name of Jesus. Therefore, in prayer, let’s bring His will to pass in the earth, in the lives of those around us, in our cities, and nations. Take your place of priesthood in ministering to the Lord, teaching and intercession. Hallelujah!

## BUILT TO OVERCOME October 4th, 2021
![October 4th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-4-built-to-overcome.jpg)

 ---

>***For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you. We continually ask God to fill you with the knowledge of his will…being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience (Colossians 1:9\-11 NIV).***

God’s people are soldiers; we’re built to withstand and prevail against the pressures and adversities of life. There’re no sissies in God’s army. Don’t faint in the day of adversity. The TLB version of the Bible says in Proverbs 24:10: *“You are a poor specimen if you can’t stand the pressure of adversity.”*

Be strong and tough for Christ! It makes no difference how fiercely you’re persecuted for the Gospel; count it all joy! 2 Corinthians 4:17 says, *“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.”*

2 Timothy 2:3 says, *“Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.”* Some people endure with tears, but our theme scripture says to do so with joyfulness. Always remember, the contrary winds make your roots go deeper. The quality of your personality has to be tested. The bigger the trouble, the greater your victories. Without pressures, your greatness may never manifest.

Therefore, in the face of opposition, declare, “Greater is He that’s in me, than he that’s in the world!” James 1:2 says, *“My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.”* Why would God admonish you to rejoice in adversity? It’s because victory is in your spirit.

Paul said, “We glory in tribulation, for tribulation produces patience” (Romans 5:3\). Always remember that greater is He that’s in you, than all the troubles you could ever face. With the Word in you, you’ll stand any test! You’ll always win. Praise God!

## POWERED BY THE HOLY GHOST October 5th, 2021
![October 5th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-5-powered-by-the-holy-ghost.jpg)

>***Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts (Zechariah 4:6\).***

You have what it takes to win, irrespective of the adversities you may face in life. If you’ve found yourself in a precarious situation, be comforted; there’s someone living inside you, who is greater and stronger than Satan, the world, and all the troubles, elements and circumstances of this world—the Holy Spirit. You’re powered by the Holy Spirit.

No wonder John said*, “Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”* (1 John 4:4\). Become ever more conscious of the Spirit—His power, glory and ministry in your life.

Even in prayer, you must rely on Him to pray effectively. Some people pray, but nothing happens, because they speak words that aren’t powered, communicated or inspired by the Holy Spirit. The power of the Holy Spirit is the missing element in many people’s lives; it explains why they live as victims whereas God has made them victors.

In Ephesians 5:18\-19, the Apostle Paul tells us, *“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.”* Being filled with the Spirit is the answer. When you’re filled with the Spirit, you’ll bring the supernatural power of God to bear on your words and all you do.

The Holy Spirit makes the difference; He’s the power of God and He lives in you in His fullness; in His entire glory and might. How then could your life be ordinary? In the book of Acts, the apostles understood this and ministered always in and by the power of the Spirit. Oftentimes, they were described as men full of the Holy Ghost; for example, Stephen (Acts 6:5\). Then it says in verse 8, *“And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.”*

The same can, and should be said of you; you’re full of the Holy Ghost and power because Acts 1:8 says, *“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you….”* You can have extraordinary results in your life and ministry because you’re powered by the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah!

## DELIVERING “LAWFUL CAPTIVES” October 6th, 2021
![October 6th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-6-delivering-lawful-captives.jpg)

>***Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children (Isaiah 49:24\-25\).***

Sometimes, there’re things that happen to certain individuals, families, cities, communities or even nations because of sin—evil and wickedness that thrive in their midst; and such people become lawful captives. But because of the mercy of God, we’re able to deliver them through prayer. That’s part of what we read in our opening scripture. How do you do this?

The first part is when you issue your word of faith in the Name of Jesus Christ, and the second part is when you engage in heartfelt, continued intercession. Since they became legal captives by reason of their actions, you can’t just free them by issuing words of faith. You have to intercede in prayer. You may even have to get other like\-minded Christians to join you to intercede for that family, city, or nation.

One of the rules in intercession is that you must be persistent, and continue in prayer for as long as it takes for you to see the desired result. You can put Satan’s dominion in your family, community, city and country to an end and liberate men and women from his clutch\-hold, in the Name of Jesus, in heartfelt, continued intercession. Hallelujah!

## PRACTISE ETERNAL LIFE October 7th, 2021
![October 7th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-7-practise-eternal-life.jpg)

 ---

>***And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son (1 John 5:11\).***

Oh, how the Church needs to teach and preach eternal life! Most have never understood it, because they’ve never been taught. In 1 John 5:13 NIV, John said, *“I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.”* He wanted them to know they had eternal life, because just like today, many don’t know. So, you find a lot of Christians living as victims, buffeted by the vagaries and elements of this world.

It’s the reason for the colds, headaches, fevers and all the sicknesses and diseases many suffer from. Sadly, some even think it’s okay to be sick. No; not for the Christian! The life we have is divine. If an injury happens in your body, remind yourself that you’ve got divine life in you; it works in you—in every fibre of your being. Then, heal the wound! Command it to close up and be normal. You’ve got to practise this.

1 Timothy 4:15 says, *“Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them….”* The expression “Meditate upon” is “Meletao” (Greek), and it also means to practise. Many years ago, as I started learning this, I had a cut on my hand and it was bleeding profusely. But I wasn’t agitated. I had the consciousness of eternal life. So, I placed my finger over the cut and said, “stanch and be healed, in Jesus’ Name!”

Guess what? Not only did the bleeding cease, there was no trace of a wound whatsoever. Hallelujah! It’s important you learn to live the life that God has given you; practise it. Remember, when you were a child, you had to be taught how to talk and walk like humans, and you didn’t perfect it overnight but grew through practice into perfection.

Likewise, now that you’re born again, practise living the divine life. Superimpose the power of that life over your physical body by meditation, prayer (especially praying in the spirit), and by constant affirmation of the Word of God.

## HIS SPIRITUAL TEMPLE October 8th, 2021
![October 8th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-8-his-spiritual-temple.jpg)

 ---

>***When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory (Psalm 102:16\).***

Zion in the scripture above doesn’t refer to Israel at the Millennium but to the Church of Jesus Christ. When you read about the millennial reign from the beginning to the end, whatever the Bible says will happen at the Millennium must first happen with the Church; the reflection is in the Church. So, before building the temple in Jerusalem, which is going to be at the Millennium, He’s going to build His temple, which is the Church.

In Zechariah 6:12, the Bible says, *“And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD.”* Jesus is the One referred to as “The BRANCH,” and He’s going to build the temple of the Lord, and it started from the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles. Ephesians 2:22 shows the veracity of the ongoing building; it says, *“In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.”*

Jesus is already building His spiritual temple of the Church, and He says we’re members of that very building. Hallelujah! Hebrews 12:22\-23 says, *“But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect.”* The Church is Zion in this context, spelt “Sion.”

In building His Church, He gave some to be apostles, and some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip His people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up (Ephesians 4:11\-12\). When He’s done building His Church, He’ll appear in glory! Until then, the Church will reign in His Name, over the powers of darkness and the elements of this world, for He said

*, “...I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it”* (Matthew 16:18\). *“...Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven”* (Matthew 18:18\).

## DECLARE WHAT YOU WANT IN HIS NAME October 9th, 2021

>***Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son (John 14:12\-13\).***

When Jesus said, “And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do,” He wasn’t talking about prayer. The word “ask” is the Greek “aiteo” and it’s a substitute for the word “require.” It’s different from what we have in John 16:23 where Jesus said, *“And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.”*

In the case of the latter, the word “ask” is “erotao” (Greek), which is prayer. Here, Jesus was showing us how to pray to the Father in His Name. But the “ask” in our theme verse is talking about you making a demand in the Name of Jesus.

In Acts 3:1\-6, the Bible shows us how Peter and John put this to work. They encountered a man crippled from birth who daily begged for alms at the temple gate. Peter said to him, *“...Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk”* (Acts 3:6\). This isn’t prayer; Peter made a demand in the Name of Jesus.

Many of the evil things happening in our world today are caused by demons. But with the Name of Jesus, we prevail; we have the victory. Every time you face distressing situations, declare what you want in the Name of Jesus, and there’ll be a change. It’s about His authority. Use the Name of Jesus to keep your body in health, calm the storms around you, and effect changes in your home, family, community, town, city, and in your country.

Being born again, though your body is the temple of God, you’re its caretaker or custodian. It’s your responsibility to manage your body and keep it in health, in its utmost shape for God to use. Satan will try to do anything to ravage your body; he’ll run rampage in your body if you let him; but you must say, “No!”

Recall what we read in our theme verse; it says, *“… present your bodies a living sacrifice….”* God doesn’t do the “presenting” for you; rather, He tells you to present your body to Him. He gave you the authority to manage your body. This is why some Christians, even though they’ve received the Holy Spirit, can still be sick in their bodies. The reason is they’re the ones in charge of their bodies. God has a right to rule your body, but He appointed you to rule it for Him.

Imagine the Mayor of a city; he has the authority to run the city, but he doesn’t run the individual homes in the city. He leaves the running of your home to you. It’s the same with your body; you have to stop the devil from manipulating any part of your body. Use the authority that’s been granted you in Christ; use the Name of Jesus.

Furthermore, the Bible says you were bought with a price; therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s (1 Corinthians 6:20\). You’re a spirit; you have a soul and live in a body. Your soul is the seat of your mind, your emotions and your will. God doesn’t control your will, your emotions, and your mind; He tells you to do that.

The Bible says in Romans 12:2, *“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind….”* Just as it’s your job to manage your mind, it’s your responsibility as well to manage your body. Renewing or managing your mind is done through the Word—meditating on the Word! That’s also how to manage your body and keep it in divine health. The Bible says the Word of God is medicine—health to your physical body (Proverbs 4:22\).

## PRAYING WITHOUT CEASING October 11th, 2021
![October 11th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-11-praying-without-ceasing.jpg)

>***Pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17\).***

When the Bible says, *“Pray without ceasing,”* what does it mean? Moreover, how is that even possible? God never tells us to do something we couldn’t do. First, understand that in the verse above, the Apostle Paul wasn’t addressing an individual, but the church in Thessalonica. How could they have prayed without ceasing as a church? It’s simple; it’s by scheduling.

That’s what we’ve done since 2020 with the Pastor Chris Live “Pray\-A\-Thon.” We worked out a schedule so we could pray without ceasing, round the clock, every day, all year\-round in a non\-stop prayer\-chain. Through our heartfelt, continued prayers, we’re causing changes and enforcing the will of the Father here on earth.

Never take this spiritual admonition as an exaggeration; take the Word of God seriously. When you re\-interpret such clear instructions of the Spirit, you weaken the meaning and then lose the power of it. If as a family, or a group, you plan to pray for a specific number of hours, commit to it. Form a prayer chain; schedule those who would pray at different times during the day.

Let’s say, Susan, for example, takes a certain number of minutes; then Dave follows, and Casey takes the next slot, and Ben takes another and so on, such that no one breaks the chain. If you’d do this diligently, you’d be amazed at the giant leaps and strides you’d experience in the spirit. He didn’t ask us to pray without ceasing for nothing. The joy of it all is the answers we receive. Hallelujah!

Remember, the Church is the only restraining force against the evil manipulations and dictates of Satan. Through our prayers, we contend for the souls of men, and cancel the wicked plans of the devil, and establish the will of God in the earth. Always take advantage of the privilege, opportunity and blessings of prayer. When it’s time to pray, avoid all forms of distractions. If you’re going to walk in God’s unusual blessings continually, then you must pray without ceasing.

## HEALING IN HIS WINGS October 12th, 2021
![October 12th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-12-healing-in-his-wingss.jpg)

>***But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall (Malachi 4:2\).***

In the Scriptures, there’re several instances where people touched the hem of Jesus’ garment and received instant healing. For example, Luke 8 talks about the woman with the issue of blood, who suffered for twelve long years, spending all her earnings on physicians to no avail. But the Bible says she *“… touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched”* (Luke 8:44\).

The word, “border” in this verse is “Kraspedon” (Greek), and it means fringes or tassels. Also, in Matthew 14, when Jesus came to the land of Gennesaret, the people of that region rushed to Him for healing, and the Bible says they *“...besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole”* (Matthew 14:36\).

They brought so many sick people to Jesus, and He didn’t have to do anything; all they needed was to touch the fringes of His garment. Remarkable! Mark 6:56 says, *“And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.”*

What was special about the border of Jesus’ garment? Every Jew had the same fringes in their garments as Jesus (Read Numbers 15:37\-38\). So, it wasn’t about the fashion or style of His garment but the one wearing it. Those that touched Him to be healed believed He was the Messiah; therefore, everything about Him, including the fringes of His garment, would produce healing.

That’s what we read in our theme verse. It says: *“…the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings….”* The word, “wings” is “kanaph” in Hebrew, and it refers to the border or the fringes. Jesus had healing in His fringes, and they knew it! Glory to God! That power is still available today in His Name. So, if you’re sick in your body today, or you know someone who is, use the Name of Jesus against that sickness, disease or infirmity; healing is guaranteed. Hallelujah!

## WE HAVE SOMETHING THEY CAN’T WITHSTAND October 13th, 2021

>***For through THE VOICE OF THE LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod (Isaiah 30:31\).***

In the Old Testament, God prophetically described the spirit of the antichrist in several ways for us, and He helped us understand what that spirit would do in different phases, until he’s fully manifested in a man. But as long as we’re still in the earth, before the Rapture of the Church, Satan and his cohorts of darkness don’t stand a chance in establishing their evil order. We have something that they can’t withstand: the Name of Jesus and the Word of God spoken in the power of the Holy Spirit.

Observe something in our theme verse: the phrase, “the voice of the LORD”; it refers to the Word of God spoken by the power of the Holy Spirit. That means the “rhema” of God, which is the sword of the Spirit; it discomfits Satan and the princes of darkness. 

Satan puts people in bondage and makes tyrants and despots out of leaders. Think about a man who was very humane when he was elected a government official but suddenly becomes a tyrant afterwards. Why? Satan took over his mind. This is what happened in some countries. Suddenly, some leaders metamorphosed into cruel dictators and the people lost their civil liberties.

But the Bible says, *“And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones. For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod”* (Isaiah 30:30\-31\).

“The Assyrian” is one of the prophetic names of the Antichrist. Thus, by the Word of God on our lips we cut off and beat down this evil prince of darkness and thwart his plans. As long as we, the Church of Jesus Christ, are in the earth, only the will and purpose of God will be established. Glory to God!

## LIVE IN HEALTH October 14th, 2021

>***What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? (1 Corinthians 6:19\).***

Christ in you is your assurance of divine health. No Christian ought to be sick, because the Lord Jesus consummated the plan of divine health. The Bible says He brought life and immortality to light (2 Timothy 1:10\); that means only life works in you; the law of the Spirit of life is at work in you.

Take charge of your health and rule over your body with the Word of God. If you notice any problem in any part of your body, declare, “In the Name of Jesus, I cut off this anomaly from my body.” Maybe it’s migraine headaches, and it has affected your academics or your job; put your hands on your head and say, “Head, in the Name of Jesus, I command you to be healed!” Don’t excuse sickness; don’t let it hinder you from making an impact in your world with the Gospel!

You don’t need that heart trouble you’ve been suffering with; it’s time to wake up to who you are! Place your hand on your chest and say, “Heart, become normal, in the Name of Jesus!” And it’ll be so. Refuse to yield your body to sickness. Divine health is your right in Christ; it’s God’s will for you. He said in 3 John 1:2, *“...I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”*

The Word of God is medicine to your body (Proverbs 4:22\). Choose to be healthy and strong. Live by God’s Word, and refuse to observe lying vanities. Praise God!

## HE DIED FOR THE UNGODLY October 15th, 2021

>***And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled (Colossians 1:21\).***

The scripture above describes the ungodly as alienated from God, and enemies in their minds by wicked works. In other words, they were enemies of God in their minds because of their wicked works. Evidently, it wasn’t God who declared them enemies; rather, He’s the One reconciling them. The Bible says, *“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them…”* (2 Corinthians 5:19\).

This is similar to what transpired between God and Adam in the Garden. Adam sinned against God and ran into hiding (Genesis 3:8\). But God came looking for him; He said, “Adam, where are you?” How gracious He is! While we were sinners, in God’s mind, we weren’t enemies; He was working out how to bring us to Himself; He was working on a plan.

Colossians 1:22 tells us that the purpose and summation of Christ’s redemptive work was *“…to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.”* He knew what He was going to do before He did it. Romans 5:6 says, “*For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.”* This is so touching.

He didn’t wait for us to become godly before He died for us. He initiated the reconciliation: *“For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life”* (Romans 5:10\). Hallelujah! Let this love be expressed through you to the ungodly in reaching out to them with the Gospel. Let them know God isn’t mad at them; they can come to Him just as they are and be accepted.

He said in Isaiah 1:18, *“…though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”* He’s the One that washes, sanctifies and justifies the ungodly in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Hallelujah!

## DON’T BE CARELESS WITH WORDS October 16th, 2021

>***And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground (1 Samuel 3:19\).***

Our theme verse shows us something very significant about God; He places premium on words. Jesus emphasized the importance of words several times in His teachings. In Matthew 12:36, He said, *“…every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”* That’s a serious warning.

Notice He didn’t say men shall give account for some idle words that they speak, but for every idle word. Idle words are empty, ineffectual words; careless jesting and ramblings; coarse language. In Ephesians 4:29, He said, *“Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.”*

Not only must your words be gracious and edifying always, they must also be faith words. Words are things; they have substance; they create or destroy*. “Death and life are in the power of the tongue...”* (Proverbs 18:21\). Don’t be careless with words. Your words represent you; they’re your life.

Mark 11:23 says, *“For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea…he shall have whatsoever he saith.”* You’re what you say. Jesus said in Matthew 12:37, *“For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”* 

Even salvation is activated by words. Romans 10:9\-10 tells us, *“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”* Take words seriously.

## BE BOLD ABOUT HIM October 17th, 2021

>***It’s news I’m most proud to proclaim, this extraordinary Message of God’s powerful plan to rescue everyone who trusts him, starting with Jews and then right on to everyone else! (Romans 1:16 MSG).***

The Apostle Paul was passionate about the Gospel and proclaimed it with all passion, boldness, audacity, faith, and conviction. In Romans 1:16\-17, he said, *“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.”*

If you love Jesus, you’ll be passionate about His message and about serving Him. If you truly believe that the message of the Gospel has changed your life, you’ll be bold to speak about it openly; you’ll be bold to reach out to others with the Gospel you’ve received.

Never be shamefaced about Christ, the message of the Gospel or your identity with Him. At every opportunity, preach the Gospel. You might say, “I don’t know what to say”; begin with your testimony of Christ—how He changed your life. Talk about our inextricable oneness with Him, His liquid and unconditional love for all, His grace, mercy and kindness.

Be impenitent about your love for Jesus. Don’t be ashamed of who you are in Him, and don’t let others make you ashamed of what you believe. Jesus said, *“For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father’s, and of the holy angels”* (Luke 9:26\). If you think Jesus changed your life, you have to be bold to talk about it; be bold to express it; be bold to tell others what Jesus Christ means to you and what He’s done in your life. You’re a witness of who He is.

## THE RIGHT FOUNDATION October 18th, 2021
![October 18th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-18-the-right-foundation.jpg)

>***As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby (1 Peter 2:2\)***

Everything that would stand and endure needs a good, rock\-solid foundation. Therefore, every Christian must have the right foundation of the Word of God and doctrine of Christ. It begins with a ravenous appetite for the pure, unadulterated Word of God. Nothing but God’s Word guarantees your spiritual growth.

The Scriptures emphasize growing unto perfection, starting with ensuring you understand the fundamentals. Luke reports how the Apostle Paul used The School of Tyrannus to debate and teach, presenting the Word of God on a daily basis to the new Christians for a space of two years (Acts 19:1\-10\).

Paul had different categories of people who were at different stages of learning, but he ensured they all had the right spiritual foundation. After the foundations, however, it’s important to move to the higher class, the more advanced teachings: *“Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. And this will we do, if God permit”* (Hebrews 6:1\-3\).

All of these help to lay a good and solid foundation upon which a successful and fulfilling Christian life and ministry can be built.

The words of Jesus about having a solid foundation for your life is an important food for thought; meditate on it always. He said, 

*“…everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash”*

 (Matthew 7:24\-27 NIV).

## CONTINUE IN PRAYER October 19th, 2021
![October 19th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-19-continue-in-prayer.jpg)

>***Pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17\).***

There’re certain situations you may face and all you have to do is pray once, and that’s it. But there’re other situations that call for persistence in prayer. The Word of God teaches us about different kinds of prayers and what rules apply to them.

For example, when dealing with things about other people, especially when it has to do with their wrong choices and beliefs, you don’t just pray once and go away. You continue in prayer, interceding for them, rebuking the adversary that’s deceiving them. You have to repeatedly mount pressure against the adversary until he lets go and there’s a change.

There’s so much evil going on in the world today and the plan of the enemy is to set up the world of the antichrist before the time. But we have to prevent that. The Bible says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available. We will keep pressing in the spirit, overturning the decrees and activities of darkness.

God has never thought, and doesn’t think, Satan is a problem, because He gave us authority over demons and the powers of darkness. The problem, for the most part, has been that some of God’s children focused more on personal gains instead of the faith to save men. Our world would surely be a better place if we would focus more on the souls of men in fervent prayers, intercessions, supplications, giving of thanks and preaching the Word.

That’s what He charged us to do, and He told us the outcome and why we should do it: *“I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth”* (1 Timothy 2:1\-4\). Follow the Word and pray like this.

Jesus said, *“…men ought always to pray, and not to faint”* (Luke 18:1\). If we’d follow the order and pray as the Spirit indicates, we’d take this whole world for Jesus Christ. Glory to God!

## BE YIELDED TO HIM October 20th, 2021

>***While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them… (Matthew 17:5\).***

In a certain day, Jesus took with Him Peter, James and John to a high mountain and was transfigured before them. While there, Elijah and Moses appeared and spoke with Jesus. A cloud of glory overshadowed them. The glory was so much and so transcendent that Peter said to Jesus, *“...Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias”* (Matthew 17:4\).

There’re such times when the Spirit of God overwhelms us and we become so conscious of His divine presence that we don’t want to be anywhere else. Many aren’t conscious of His divine presence in, and with them; they’ve thus reduced Christianity to mere religion. They don’t know what it is to carry the presence of the Holy Spirit. And without the Spirit, there’s no Christianity. He is EVERYTHING! If you’d trust Him, He’d walk you on the path of life and glory.

Many don’t know Him and therefore haven’t given Him full control of their lives. Put Him in charge of your life. Come under His sway. Talk to Him more than you talk to anyone else. Talk to Him about everything and anything. You’d be amazed how excellently He’ll guide and lead you. His joy is to see you fulfil God’s destiny for your life.

There’re too many Christians who talk about the Holy Spirit but are not submitted to Him. Every Christian must learn to be fully yielded to the Holy Spirit. You may be a gifted preacher, singer, sportsman, a writer or a politician, but if you’re not yielded to the Spirit, there’ll be no glory in your life. He’s the glory of God. The more yielded you are to Him, the more His glory increases in, and effuses through you.

## CHRIST IN YOU IS THE ANSWER October 21st, 2021

>***And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness (Romans 8:10\).***

It doesn’t matter what your life was like before you gave your heart to Christ; the old, weak, sickly, poor and struggling “you” died with Christ on the Cross. A new you came alive when He resurrected. So, don’t look at the physical anymore; see through the Spirit. Now that you’re in Christ, and Christ is in you, glory, wholeness, perfection, success and prosperity are guaranteed in your life.

The Bible says, *“...Christ in you, the hope of glory”* (Colossians 1:27\). The assurance that there’s nothing missing or broken in your life is Christ in you. Someone may say, “But I’ve given my life to Christ; Christ is in me now, but I’m still blind” or “I’m still crippled.” I have news for you!

In Acts 9, Peter the Apostle went visiting the churches and came to a place called Lydda. There, he met a man named Aeneas who had been paralyzed for eight years. Even though Aeneas had become a Christian, he was still paralyzed. But guess what? All Peter said to him was, *“...Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed…”* (Acts 9:34\). The Bible says he jumped right out of bed, completely made whole.

If you have Christ inside you, that’s the end of paralysis! That’s the end of blindness, deafness, any kind of sickness or disease, failure and death! Hallelujah! Christ in you is the answer. Our theme verse says if Christ be in you, though your body be dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness. Why would you accommodate asthma if Christ is in you? You ought to boldly declare, “I refuse to be sick, diseased or afflicted.”

There’re not enough epidemics in the world that can withstand the life of Christ in you. You’re shielded in Him. No wonder He said, *“…nothing shall by any means hurt you”* (Luke 10:19\). Your life is divine. Make up your mind you’re going to live the life that Christ has given you, and you’ll be everything He’s called you to be. Hallelujah!

## GIVING THANKS October 22nd, 2021
![October 22nd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-22-giving-thanks.jpg)

>***In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you (1 Thessalonians 5:18\).***

The will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you is that you give thanks in everything. What does it mean to give thanks? To give thanks is to speak blessings. When you study the Gospel, there’re several instances that show us how the Lord Jesus gave thanks by speaking blessings. In Matthew 26:26, just before His betrayal, the Bible says, *“…as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.”*

On another occasion, before He fed a multitude with five loaves of bread and two pieces of fish, *“… he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them all”* (Mark 6:41\). Notice what He did in both instances with the bread and the fish: He “blessed them.”

Mark, in His writing, gave further insight to what Jesus did: He “gave thanks”: *“And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it”* (Mark 14:23\). Mark 8:6 says: *“And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people.”*

So, when the Bible says that Jesus took bread and blessed it, what He actually did was to give thanks; the words that He spoke were words of thanks. Learn to bless. Remember, God speaks through you; He uses your mouth to “bless”, to change circumstances, to bring deliverance and salvation to others. He uses your mouth to bring correction to issues, such that no matter what’s going on in your life, or around you, He can mend it.

Hebrews 11:3 says, *“Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God….”* In other words, through the “rhema” of God, God would bring a blessing where a curse had been intended; He’ll bring about prosperity, success, peace and victory where poverty, failure, defeat or destruction had been intended. Hallelujah!

Every so often, declare, “Father, I thank you in the Name of Jesus; I offer thanks for, and in this situation, because it is corrected; it is working out for my good, and your perfect will is established.” Hallelujah! Even in “blessing” the Lord, it’s the same thing; you bless Him by giving thanks. Without the “thanks” in it, it would be empty.

## THE FRUIT OF OUR LIPS ARE WORDS October 23rd, 2021
![October 23rd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-23-the-fruit-of-our-lips-are-words.jpg)

>***Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips (Hosea 14:2\).***

Peter 2:5 tells us that we’re living stones, built up as a spiritual house—a holy priesthood—to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. These sacrifices are no longer those of bulls and calves offered over the brazen altar; they’re the fruits of our lips. Hebrews 13:15 says, *“By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.”*

The fruit of our lips are “words,” as shown in our opening verse. The Greek construction of “giving thanks” is “homologeo” and it means to make confessions; so, we’re to make confessions; that is, speak words that give thanks to His Name. For example, you say, “Father, you’re greater than all; you’re the sovereign God; gracious and kind; forever loving, ever faithful and true; absolutely good! The King of kings and the Lord of lords; I thank you for your love, your greatness, and your kindness.”

That’s offering the fruit of your lips; that’s making confessions of His greatness, power, love, kindness, goodness, and of His work and ministry in your life. These “fruit of our lips” which are words that we offer must be done continually, just like the priests of the Old Testament did.

The Bible tells us what the priests were to do: *“… stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even; And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD”* (1 Chronicles 23:30\-31\).

In the New Testament, with our words, we’re required to offer spiritual sacrifices continually. You can practise this even now! With a heart full of thanksgiving and praise, make confessions of how great He is, and how matchless His Name is. Render sacrifices of praise to His majesty! Extol His greatness and worship His holy Name. Remember, there’s none like Him, for His kingdom and reign is everlasting!

## PRAYING FOR THE SICK October 24th, 2021
![October 24th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-day-24-praying-for-the-sick.jpg)

>***And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, WHOM SATAN HATH BOUND, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? (Luke 13:16\).***

In praying for the sick to get well, there’re certain truths to be mindful of; otherwise, you may pray from sunup to sundown with little or no impact. First, recognize that God wants them well; He isn’t the one responsible for the sickness. Some believe God uses sickness to carry out His plan or to correct His children; that’s a lie from the pit of hell. No sickness or disease is from God.

Secondly, does that sick person want to be well? This would be an important question to answer. Jesus asked certain folks in the Bible who apparently were in distressing health situation the simple question, “What do you want?” So, it’s important the person is willing and ready to get well and that there’s mutual faith.

Thirdly, be in tune with the Spirit. The Holy Spirit can guide you to know whether or not a demon is responsible for that sickness or disease. That way, you’re able to deal with the situation. For example, the woman that was bowed\-over in Luke 13, Jesus showed us Satan was responsible for her infirmity. The moment Jesus cast the devil out, the woman was healed.

Never be afraid of demons or evil spirits. The Name of Jesus is greater than all. We cast out evil spirits with words, as Jesus did. In Matthew 10:8, Luke 9:2, Luke 10:9, Jesus charged the disciples to heal the sick, and He didn’t ask them to pray to Him or to the Father to heal the sick. Evidently, we have authority from Jesus to heal the sick and bring health and joy to a dying world. Be bold about it. Glory to God!

## THE MAN AND HIS NAME October 25th, 2021

>***Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth (Philippians 2:9\-10\).***

In the 3rd chapter of the book of Acts, we read that Peter healed a certain man who was crippled from birth. The man, obviously filled with joy, threw his arms around Peter and John, ecstatic with praise to God. All the people who recognized him ran up to where they were at Solomon’s Porch to see for themselves. When Peter saw that he had a congregation, he took the opportunity and preached Christ to them.

In the 4th chapter, Peter made a statement, the profundity of which is of staggering proportions. He said, *“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved”* (Acts 4:12\). Here, Peter was referring to the Name, Jesus! Some have asked, “What’s so special about the Name, Jesus? There are people who have it as their first or last name today.” 

It’s not how a name is spelt or pronounced that matters. There may be a thousand and one other people bearing the same name as the president of your country, but only one of them has the power and the authority over your country at the moment. In some parts of the world, as in South America, there’re some people called “Jesus.” So, the point isn’t how it is spelt or the sound of the name; it’s about the authority of the one bearing the name.

You can’t separate a man from his name. The name identifies the man, and whatever authority that’s given to the man is vested in the name. In the case of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, all authority in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth is given unto Him. So, when you say, “I come in the Name of Jesus” or affirm anything in His Name, you’re invoking His authority.

That’s the only Name in whom all of God’s power is vested. That Name has power and it’ll unlock every door, destroy every sickness, and cause you to walk in unending glory and victories. The one who’s crippled may not be able to walk in his own name, or in the name of the president of his country, but in the Name of Jesus, even maimed limbs are restored. Even now, receive strength into you in the Name of Jesus. If you’ve been sick or afflicted, be made whole; be healed in Jesus’ Name. Right away, rejoice and thank Him for healing you and act accordingly.

The Bible says, *“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him”* (Colossians 3:17\). Learn to live in, and use His Name. That Name ends failure, poverty, sickness, lack and darkness once and for all. Hallelujah!

## TRAVAILING IN PRAYER October 26th, 2021

>***My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you (Galatians 4:19\).***

In the 3rd chapter of Paul’s epistle to the Galatian Christians, he calls out their outright repudiation of the message of faith. They had left the simple message of grace in Christ to keeping the Law of Moses in order to be justified. Having learnt that they had accepted the teachings of false teachers, Paul chided them, *“O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth…”* (Galatians 3:1\). 

There’re some like that in the church today; they started well but went on listening to wrong doctrines and were misled. They became argumentative, confrontational, disorderly, rude and unruly in the house of God, and some even stopped fellowship with the church altogether.

When you have a brother or sister in the Lord or a whole family disobeying the truth of God’s Word, obstinate, and walking contrary to the instructions of the Spirit, it’s because the spirit of foolishness has taken over their minds; thus, it’s time to travail in birth again until Christ is formed in them, as Paul the Apostle did. 

Why did Paul have to travail in birth again for the Galatians? He travailed in birth previously, by which they came to Christ. He determined to do so again now that they were falling away from the truth. This travail in birth is intercessory prayers that leads to salvation and deliverance of one who’s lost or fallen out of the way. 

That’s what you do for such people; you pray again and again, in intercession and fasting—that the Christ\-life gains the ascendancy in them, and they be fully yielded to, and established in God’s truth and righteousness.

The words *“…travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you”* show that the life of Christ wasn’t being manifested in them; they had become worldly, living on the wrong information that was destroying their faith. So, learn to pray fervently in the spirit for new converts and new members in the churches of Christ around the world. Pray that they’ll increase in the knowledge and revelation of Christ, and be established in the faith through the ministry of the Word and the Holy Spirit, fulfilling their purpose and leading others to Christ.

Also, pray for those who may be facing difficult times and persecutions, or wavering in their faith, that they be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man, rooted and grounded in love, pleasing Him in all things, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## THE SECRET PLACE OF THE MOST HIGH October 27th, 2021

>***Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations (Psalm 90:1\).***

In this day and age, when there’s so much trouble and crises, with a seemingly overwhelming spread of evil around the world, many are thinking, “Is there hope?” But when you study the Scriptures, you’ll understand God’s divine plan for His children in a tempestuous world. For example, Psalm 91; the first verse is as inspiring as it is comforting. It says, *“He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.”*

Your location in the Spirit is the “secret place of the most high”; that was the best way the psalmist could put it. The second verse (Psalm 91:2\) sheds more light on it; it says, *“I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.”* That means the Lord Himself is that secret place, because He is your refuge and your fortress. Therefore, that you dwell in the secret place of the most high means you dwell in Him. In the New Testament, that place is called Christ: *“…if any man be **in Christ…”*** (2 Corinthians 5:17\).

Notice the underlined expression, “in Christ,” showing that Christ is a place in God. How could anyone be disadvantaged in Christ? It’s impossible! In Christ is glory only—always and forever! In Christ is life forevermore; you’re shielded from harm, evil and destruction. No wonder it says in Psalm 91:7 NIV *“A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.”*

>***Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength (Nehemiah 8:10\).***

Our God is so gracious and kind; think about what we just read! The children of Israel were in sadness, weeping because they hadn’t quite obeyed God. But while they were weeping and repenting, the Lord said to them, “Go and celebrate, for this day which you’ve assembled to hear my Word is holy; don’t be sorry, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.” Hallelujah!

The eleventh and twelfth verses say, *“So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved. And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions….”* Now, it’s not about the eating and the drinking, for the Bible says, *“…the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost”* (Romans 14:17\). It’s about the joy you have in Him through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we’ve now received the atonement (Romans 5:11\).

In Nehemiah 12:43, when they had built the walls of Jerusalem and it was time for them to celebrate, the Bible says, *“Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.”* Wow! 1 Peter 1:8 calls our joy “indescribable and full of glory.” Their joy was heard afar off! They were exuberant with joy and rejoicing.

In spite of the terrible things happening in the world today, you can be full of joy every day and express it lavishly. Celebrate the Lord—His greatness, goodness, love, grace and mercies—every day, like you’ve never done before. Give no place to gloom in your life. Joy is a fruit of your recreated human spirit; so, always release it from within you. Jesus said*, “These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full”* (John 15:11\). Glory to God!

## TRUST AND ACT ON HIS WORD October 29th, 2021

>***According as his divine power HATH GIVEN UNTO US ALL THINGS that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (2 Peter 1:3\).***

In 1 Corinthians 3:21, the Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, corroborates our underlined portion of the verse above; it says, *“…all things are yours.”* That’s because all things are in Christ, and Christ is in you. Therefore, things present and things to come are all yours! His divine power—not your own ability or human wisdom—has given unto you ALL things that pertain to life and godliness. This means you’re not supposed to ever be in lack or want.

Read our theme verse again: *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness….”* When God says He’s done something, you believe and act accordingly. For instance, you probably have some money in the bank; when you made the deposit, they probably sent you a confirmatory message that XYZ amount of money had been credited to your account, and you believed it. When you needed to spend it, you didn’t “try” to claim it; you just knew the money was yours and accessible to you.

Did you know that God’s Word to you is the confirmatory message that you have what He says you have, and are who He says you are, and can do what He says you can do? Trust and act on His Word; you’d be amazed at the quality of life you’d live. His Word is absolutely dependable! Let your confidence in life—your guarantee that you’ll forever be a victor and a success—be on the basis of your faith in the Word.

If, today, you seem to be struggling through life, living as a victim, it’s most likely because you haven’t believed the Word enough. Rather than blame circumstances, the government or other people for your situation, consciously and consistently walk in the light of God’s Word. There’s nothing you could ever need or desire for a godly life that’s not already yours in Christ. The question is, do you know this? If you do, then you have before you a life of endless possibilities: nothing shall be impossible unto you (Mark 9:23\). Put the Word to work in your life, and you’ll always be victorious.

## THE CHRIST-LIFE IN YOU October 30th, 2021

>***When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory (Colossians 3:4\).***

In John 5:26, Jesus said, *“For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.”* This means that Jesus had the same life as God when He walked the earth. He had to, because He is Himself God. He said in John 10:38, “I want you to know and believe that the Father is in me and I in Him.”

What we just read is simply extraordinary; it’s the very thing that God wanted with man, for which He created man: to be in us, and us in Him, so we would be one with Him—super beings of His reflection— associates of the God\-kind, and His icons in the earth. Hallelujah! This happened when you were born again. The Bible says, *“But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit”* (1 Corinthians 6:17\).

Even though you were born of a human being, this oneness with Christ makes you supernatural, because the life in you is the life and nature of God; now, Christ is your life. That’s what we read in our theme verse. 1 John 5:11\-12 NKJV says, *“And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.”* Blessed be God!

If you have Jesus Christ, you have divine life in you now. Romans 6:23 says the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ. But that’s a fundamental truth of the Gospel. As you get higher in the understanding of the Gospel, you’d discover that Jesus really doesn’t stand away and give you eternal life; He’s Himself eternal life! In giving you eternal life, He actually gave you Himself. What could be more glorious!

My life is hid with Christ in God; Christ is my life! The life of sin, failure, defeat and shame was nailed to the Cross, and I arose triumphantly with Christ to a life of righteousness, honour, peace and glory. My humanity has been supplanted by His divinity. Blessed be His Name forever!

## DOMINION OVER DARKNESS October 31st, 2021

>***Giving thanks unto the Father…Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12\-13\).***

Being born again, you’re superior to Satan; you defeated Satan in and with Jesus—in Satan’s own domain—hell! Colossians 2:15 (NIV) says, *“And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.”* When Jesus did this, you were in Him. Hallelujah!

Therefore, you’re not under the authority, dominion, jurisdiction, or powers of darkness; they can’t affect your life anymore. Where you are is a realm they can’t attain to or approach; it’s the Kingdom of God’s dear Son. You’re not supposed to be at the mercy of demons. But the problem is that many in the Church haven’t exercised their authority and dominion over Satan and the powers of darkness.

In dealing with Satan, there’s no need for argument or pointless tussle. Jesus didn’t say, “You shall “push” away or tussle with devils in my Name”; He said, *“... cast out devils...”* (Mark 16:17\); that is, kick out, throw out, fling off with force. You give them commands. Hallelujah! You’ve got to put the Word of God to work. If, for example, the devil is causing you Essential Tremor—causing your hands, head, trunk, voice or legs to shake rhythmically—you say, “Hold on, devil! I belong in the Kingdom of Christ, not in the domain of darkness. Therefore, in the Name of Jesus, body, I command this anomaly to stop!” That’ll be the end of that trouble. When you insist, your body will comply, because God’s Word is law! Nothing can resist the power in the Name of Jesus.

The Lord has given you power (authority) to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the ability of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. Satan has no right to run things in your life or in your home or in the lives of your loved ones, because you’re one with Christ, vested with all power and authority in heaven and in the earth to subdue Satan, dominate circumstances, and take charge of your world. Glory to God!
