## HIS WORD TO YOU IS WHAT YOU NEED February 1st, 2021

>***Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it (Psalm 119:140\).***

God’s Word is God’s creative material. Its power is unlimited. The Word created all things, and is effective today as ever. His Word to you at any time in your life, regarding any situation, is all you need.

Think about what He did with King Solomon; how did God make him the wisest man that ever lived, until Jesus? It was with words! He appeared to Solomon in a dream by night and asked him, “What do you want?” 

Solomon asked for wisdom and understanding (1 Kings 3:8\-9\).  God didn’t “open” Solomon’s brain to deposit wisdom inside; all He said was, “Solomon, you have it!” He said to him, *“Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee”* (1 Kings 3:12\). Blessed be God!

The moment Solomon received those words, they became to him and in him what God said. Wisdom and an understanding heart were imparted to the man. He did the same with Abraham; He said, *“…thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee”* (Genesis 17:5\).

Abraham had no children, because his wife was barren, but God said “Your name is now Abraham, because I have made you a father of many.” From then on, it didn’t make any difference what the physical circumstances were; he refused to consider his aged body or Sarah’s dead womb and began to confess what God had said about him. His Word to you is all that matters; that’s your victory.

Read Romans 4:19\-20; it says, *“And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.”* That’s how it works: when God says it, and you respond by affirming the same thing, His Word to you becomes; it prevails in your life and circumstances. Hallelujah!

## ALL HIS BLESSINGS ARE ALREADY FULFILLED February 2nd, 2021
![February 2nd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-2-all-his-blessings-are-already-fulfilled.jpg)

>***For all of God’s promises have been fulfilled in Christ with a resounding “yes!” And through Christ, our “Amen” (Which means “Yes”) ascends to God for his glory (2 Corinthians 1:20 NLT).***

God’s Word to you aren’t mere promises; they’re statements of fact. There’re no more promises to be fulfilled for the new creation in Christ. What’s a promise? It’s a declaration that one will do a specified thing. That declaration gives the person to whom it is made a right to expect or to claim the performance or forbearance of that specified act. 

There’s no place in the New Testament that tells you God is going to heal you and that you should pray that He might heal you. He did it already in Christ! Christ Jesus is the fulfilment of all of God’s promises.

We’re not expecting the fulfilment of any promise. We have, and live in, the truth of His Word NOW. There’s no need to say, “O, Lord, you promised to heal me,” or “Lord, you promised to deliver me.” To say so is to be oblivious or completely ignorant of what Christ really came to do. He came as the fulfilment of all of God’s promises; He’s the blessing of God to you. 

For the Christian, good health isn’t a promise; prosperity isn’t a promise; remission of your sins isn’t a promise; justification isn’t a promise; sanctification isn’t a promise, and righteousness isn’t a promise. All these are blessings God has freely given to you in Christ.

The Bible says, *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue”* (2 Peter 1:3\). Quit the struggle. Enjoy your life in Christ.

## REIGNING THROUGH JESUS CHRIST February 3rd, 2021
![February 3rd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-3-reigning-through-jesus-christ.jpg)

>***For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17\).***

The underlined preposition “by” is the Greek “dia,” which means “through”; we’re to reign in life through Jesus Christ. In the millennium, we’re not going to reign through Him, but WITH Him. We’ll also reign with Him in the New Heaven and the New Earth. The Bible says we *“…shall reign with him a thousand years”* (Revelation 20:6\). 2 Timothy 2:12 says, *“If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us.”* But that’s all in the future. But NOW, we reign through Him, in this life. Hallelujah!

Walk in that consciousness. Remember what the Word says in Romans 6:4: *“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”* This new life is the life of kings. Revelation 5:10 says He’s made us kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

You’re a new person with kingly values and mentality. Look at the world differently, from the perspective of victory and reigning. The Amplified Classic version of our theme verse says we shall reign as kings in the realm of life. You’re a king; reign as one!

Rule with words; that’s what kings do. The Bible says, *“Where the word of a king is, there is power…”* (Ecclesiastes 8:4\). Exercise dominion through words. Issue commands to Satan, and the elements of this world, and they’ll hear and obey you, because you function in, and with the dominion of Christ.

You can alter the course of events and change circumstances from the privacy of your room. That’s why you should never be moved by anything. It doesn’t matter what the situation is, you can cause them to align with the will of God through your faith\-filled words. Glory to God!

## THE HOLY SPIRIT—THE FATHER’S BLESSING February 4th, 2021
![February 4th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-4-the-holy-spiritthe-fathers-blessing.jpg)

>***And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him (Acts 5:32\).***

Luke 11:13 is one of the scriptures many misapply and misunderstand about receiving the Holy Spirit. There, Jesus said, *“If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?”* But then, He wasn’t talking to Christians, but to those under the Old Covenant.

Anyone could have received the Holy Spirit by asking; but sadly, most never did because they didn’t ask. Jesus said ask and it shall be given unto you (Luke 11:9\). But after the New Testament was effected, from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Word never told anyone to ask for the Holy Spirit. What we’re told is how the apostles ministered the Holy Spirit to people; they *“...prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost”* (Acts 8:15\); and some received without prayer (Acts 10:44\-46\).

It’s actually pointless to ask God for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is one of the cardinal gifts of God—to all men. By simply obeying His call to believe the Gospel, anyone can receive Him. He said in Acts 2:17, *“And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh….”* See also, Acts 5:32, Hebrews 5:9, Romans 2:8\.

Notice He didn’t say, “I will pour out of my Spirit upon **all Christians**, but upon all flesh.” This is the Father’s blessing. It has come now. Without the Holy Spirit, you can’t live the Christian life. God desires that you walk in the fullness of the Spirit and live righteously and victoriously in this present world.

If you haven’t received the Holy Spirit since you’ve been born again, Galatians 3:14 says, *“…that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.”* Simply say, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, I open my heart now, and I receive the Holy Spirit.” Then by faith, receive as simply as you received Christ. While thanking Him, you may even now be filled with the Spirit, speaking with tongues or prophesying. Glory to God!

## BUILD YOUR LIFE ON TRUTH February 5th, 2021

>***Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path (Psalm 119:105\).***

Many have founded their lives on the misinformation, assumptions and theories of men, rather than on the Word of God. Unlike this world and everything in it, you can rely on the Word; it’s infallible, and immutable; the Word is eternal, and must be the source of the information you live by.

The internet where many consult for information has been corrupted and invaded with disinformation to rob you of your faith in the Bible and Jesus Christ. They write things against the Bible, against the things that Jesus said, against the things the prophets said. They claim to find contradictions in the Bible and that it needs to be reviewed. These are misguided minds and deceivers who are void of the Holy Spirit!

The Bible is the only reliable material on the face of the earth. When you stand before the Lord, He’s not going to ask you what your history teacher or professor taught you. He’s going to ask you about His Word, because the information therein was God\-inspired.

Our opening verse describes the ministry of the Word in giving you direction in life. No matter what you hear or read, follow only the guidance and direction of the Word. Build your life on God’s truth.

## YOUR HANDS ARE BLESSED February 6th, 2021
![February 6th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-6-your-hands-are-blessed.jpg)

>***Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid (1 Corinthians 6:15\).***

Jesus said, “You shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover” (Mark 16:18\), because your hands aren’t ordinary; they’re the hands of Jesus. That’s what we read in our theme verse: “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?” Your feet are the feet of Christ. Your eyes are the eyes of Christ. He walks, talks, sees and blesses through you. Hallelujah! 

I’ve often wondered when Christians sing, “My hands are blessed…” if they understand the implication of their words and the power of the truth professed. The reason your hands are blessed is that they’re the hands of Jesus, and He’s made you a blessing. So, your hands are the extension of you (the blessing), because you’re the extension of Christ. Hallelujah!

Therefore, learn to use your hands. There’s victory\-power through your hands. There’s a profuse effusion of divine power when you stretch or lift your hands in prayer and worship. The same thing happens when you stretch it in the direction of a situation you want changed or something or someone you want blessed. 

For example, if there’s something that’s been damaged in your home, or there’s a situation in your life that you want changed, with your mouth and your hands, you can change anything! The Bible tells us that by the stretching forth of the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were wrought amongst the people (Acts 5:12\).

As you stretch forth your hands, hopes will be restored; burdens will be lifted; sicknesses and diseases will be healed; destinies will be changed, by the power of the Holy Spirit. Use your hands today in faith, and watch miracles happen.

## YOU CARRY THE GLORY IN YOU February 7th, 2021
![February 7th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-7-you-carry-the-glory-in-you.jpg)

 ---

>***When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory. This shall be written for the generation to come… (Psalm 102:16, 18\).***

The only thing the Christian is yet to receive that should happen in the earth is the redemption— the transformation or glorification of his physical body. Meaning that we’re going to put on a new body, but that body is going to come from heaven and the Bible tells us exactly when that’s going to happen. It says, *“In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye…we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption...”* (1 Corinthians 15:52\-53\).

However, currently, we carry in our earthly vessels, the glory of Christ. Paul calls it a treasure; he says, *“...We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us”* (2 Corinthians 4:7\). The light of God is in you, in your spirit. You bear the perfections of Christ. Hallelujah!

The Bible says, *“For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ”* (2 Corinthians 4:6\). You’re truly the living tabernacle of God! Christ is alive in you. Why is this so important?

It’s because the Church has transcended the babyhood stage; we’ve come of age! We read in our theme verse that when the Lord shall build up Zion, He shall appear in His glory; and this shall be written for the last generation. We are the last generation; the generation called to manifest His glory in the earth. This is what the earth has been waiting for. Romans 8:19 says, *“For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.”* We’re in office; we’ve taken our place of dominion, impacting our world with the glory of God.

## YOU HAVE A PERMANENT MERCY SEAT February 8th, 2021
![February 8th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-8-you-have-a-permanent-mercy-seat.jpg)

>***Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God (Romans 3:25\).***

There’re those who try out all sorts of rituals to receive remission of sins. Some even inflict harsh wounds on themselves, trying to pay for their sins by their own blood or their own suffering. But all that is futile. If this has been your journey or experience, stop in your tracks! Stop the struggle! Jesus has paid for you.

The Bible says He was set forth to be the appeasement for your sins. The Greek word translated “propitiation” in our theme verse is “hilasterion,” and it means the place of mercy, or “Mercy Seat.” In the Old Testament, the Mercy Seat was the covering of the ark of God. God met there with the High Priest, and His presence was on the Mercy Seat.

But today, Jesus Christ is God’s place of mercy for us; He’s the Mercy Seat, the medium of expiation. Jesus was set forth for that purpose, so that God would declare His own righteousness for letting sinners go free. You have a permanent mercy seat—Christ Jesus! This is different from the one that the High Priests went into every year in the Old Testament.

In the Old Testament, the High Priests offered the sacrificial lamb, and confessed the sins of the people over the scapegoat. But the following year, there was a remembrance of their sins again. The sins that were past couldn’t be remitted. The Bible says, *“But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year. For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins”* (Hebrews 10:3\-4\).

But the Apostle Paul declared, *“Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man (Jesus) is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses”* (Acts 13:38\-39\). He offered to God a perfect sacrifice for all\-time and eternity, such that there’ll be no more remembrance of sins. This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Receive it for yourself, and preach it to those in your world. Praise God!

I’ve been justified, declared righteous freely, by the grace of Jesus Christ, through the redemption that’s in His blood! He’s my Mercy Seat!

## THE HOLY SPIRIT: THE GLORY OF CHRISTIANITY February 9th, 2021

>***But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his (Romans 8:9\).***

It’s impossible to live the authentic Christian life without the Holy Spirit; as a matter of fact, what you’d have wouldn’t qualify to be called the Christian life. The Holy Spirit is the glory of Christianity. You couldn’t know God or love Jesus without the Holy Spirit. Christians who don’t have the Holy Spirit are vulnerable to Satan, to his attacks, manoeuvres and manipulations.

In Matthew 12:43\-44, Jesus tells us something instructive, which in a sense, describes the condition of the one who doesn’t have the Holy Spirit. He said, *“When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.”*

The one who’s born again but hasn’t received the Holy Spirit has his “spirit” swept and garnished, but empty! Consequently, he easily falls into temptations and sin. He’d be unable to control his fleshly appetites or restrain himself from evil. It’s only through the Holy Spirit that you mortify the deeds of the body and carnal desires: *“For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live”* (Romans 8:13\).

Without the Holy Spirit, you can’t have the character of Christ. Jesus had to have the Holy Spirit. The apostles had to have the Holy Spirit. Life without the Holy Spirit is empty. If you haven’t received the Holy Spirit, do so right away. Simply say, “Blessed Holy Spirit, I receive you into my heart now in the Name of Jesus Christ”; and be filled with the Spirit of God. Amen.

## IMPREGNABLE TO SICKNESS February 10th, 2021

>***But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11\).***

When we say we’re Christians, we’re not just saying we worship God by Jesus Christ. In John 15:5, Jesus said, “I’m the vine, you’re the branches. I’m in you, and you’re in me.” That’s mutual inhabitation! This is real to God, and it needs to be real to you. You’re not an ordinary person. The life you received in Christ can’t be destroyed by sickness, disease and infirmity.

Years ago, I shared on a very important subject, “The impact of the Holy Spirit on the human body.” The human body is impacted by the presence of the Holy Ghost. When you have the Holy Spirit inside you, your body is literally affected. Colossians 1:27 says, *“…Christ in you, the hope of glory.”* Then Romans 8:10 shows us the implication of Christ being in you; it says, “And if Christ be in you, though your body be dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.”

He wants you to understand that Christ in you isn’t a religious statement; it’s not a meaningless statement. Now that Christ is in you, your body is vitalized by the Spirit! You’re impregnable to sickness, disease, and infirmity. Oftentimes, a lot of the infections people suffer affect the blood; it’s due to the blood life of the human body. But being born again, your body is no longer dependent on blood for its life. Your body lives by the Spirit. Read our opening verse again and discover who you are and what you have in Christ!

Now that you’re born again and have received the Holy Spirit, you should never be sick again in your life! Refuse to yield your body to sickness. Take charge and rule over your body with the Word of God.

## THE MYSTERY OF LIGHTS February 11th, 2021

>***And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not (John 1:5\).***

The Apostle John gave us the revelation of the incarnate Word. He describes how He (the Word) was in the world, but the world knew Him not. He unequivocally declares that God’s Word is life; that life being the light of men!

In the fifth verse, he continues, *“And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”* The word translated “comprehend” is the Greek, “katalambano”; it means to seize, to attain, and also, to overcome. Thus, the light shines in darkness and the darkness couldn’t attain to its power; it couldn’t overcome, nor seize it.

The darkness couldn’t take a hold of, or comprehend the mystery of lights. The darkness couldn’t overpower or overcome light, and still hasn’t! Have you ever turned on the light in a room and the darkness was so thick that it caused the light to recede? That can never happen! Even if the light is small or a mere flicker, the darkness has to pull apart.

This should help you understand who you are when Jesus said, *“Ye are the light of the world…”* (Matthew 5:14\). He was talking about your calling as a Christian, and you must become conscious of this truth. You’re called to light up the darkness in your world, in your sphere of influence; you’re that light that darkness can’t comprehend.

Perhaps you’re a student, a security guard, a lawyer, a banker, doctor or scientist; you’re the light in your community of practice. If there’s so much darkness surrounding a subject, you’re the one to proffer answers. You’re the light in that field, imbued with supernatural ideas and genius for the solutions needed.

Light up your world today: *“Let your light so shine before men that they may see your moral excellence and your praiseworthy, noble, and good deeds and recognize and honor and praise and glorify your Father Who is in heaven”* (Matthew 5:16 AMPC).

## PERSISTING IN PRAYER February 12th, 2021
![February 12th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-12-persisting-in-prayer.jpg)

>***…The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much (James 5:16\).***

The Amplified Classic version of our theme verse places the premium on persistent prayer: *“…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available \[dynamic in its working].”* The word “continued” is a clear indication that there must be some persistence. You don’t just mutter a few words and say the issue is “done and dusted”; you keep pushing, until you have the note of victory in your spirit.

Let’s take a cue from the Master. On a certain occasion, He took His three closest disciples—Peter, James and John with Him to a place called Gethsemane, to pray. Matthew 26:39 tells us, *“And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”*

Luke, by the Spirit, reveals, *“And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground”* (Luke 22:44\). Jesus was distraught, and He prayed with much intensity. This was no casual two\-minute prayer! Recall that He chastised the disciples for their weakness and inability to keep watch (pray) with Him for an hour (Matthew 26:40\).

The Lord persisted because He understood what was at stake. What He was praying about was beyond Himself; He was about to endure a separation from His Father. It was about the salvation of generations: past, present and future. He was looking at eternity, for all those who had gone by, and those who were living at the time, and those who would ever come. So, He prayed and persisted in prayer.

This is what is required of us today; the stakes are much higher than ever. There’s a fight for the souls of men and we must agonize in prayer for their salvation. We must keep praying and interceding until the last soul that must be won is reached and brought into the Kingdom before the Rapture of the Church.

## MAKE POWER AVAILABLE FIRST February 13th, 2021

>***…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available \[dynamic in its working] (James 5:16 AMPC).***

Many don’t understand the importance of heartfelt, continued prayers. They speak forth words ever before spending quality time in prayer and they wonder why their declarations aren’t effective. You have to learn how to make power available, first!

When you’ve made power available, then make proclamations of faith, the change you desire would be established. Read the story of Elijah in 1 Kings 17\-18\. He had prayed drought into existence—and it didn’t rain—not a drop for three and a half years. When it was time for the drought to end, Elijah petitioned the Lord for rain. It wasn’t just some short, casual cobbling of words in prayer; no! It was earnest, heartfelt, continued and fervent.

He sent out his servant six times to see if there was a sign as he continued in prayer, expecting an answer. The servant came back the seventh time and said, “I see a small cloud, very small, like the size of a man’s hand, rising out of the sea.” That was all Elijah needed; he knew he had prevailed!

He told his servant, “*...Quickly then, on your way. Tell Ahab, ‘Saddle up and get down from the mountain before the rain stops you’”* (1 Kings 18:44 MSG). Observe the sequence. Elijah made tremendous power available through heartfelt prayers, and then gave the word.

Same way, after you’ve stirred up a Holy Ghost storm in your closet, that’s when you speak forth “rhema.” That’s one sure way you can effectively alter the course of events to align with God’s divine plan, purpose and will in your life, family, city, nation and around the world.

The Church prevails and dominates by the power of the Spirit. Amen.

## DO IT FOR HIS GLORY February 14th, 2021
![February 14th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-14-do-it-for-his-glory.jpg)

>***Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves (Philippians 2:3\).***

The Amplified Classic translation puts our theme verse in a clearer perspective. It says, *“Do nothing from factional motives \[through contentiousness, strife, selfishness, or for unworthy ends] or prompted by conceit and empty arrogance….”* It brings to mind the confrontation between the Prophet Elijah and the false prophets of Baal in 1 Kings 18\.

Some have studied that portion and ran off with the idea that what Elijah did was to project himself for others to applaud, but that’s not true. The prophet challenged King Ahab to gather the Israelites and the prophets of the false gods—four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and four hundred prophets of Asherah—at Mount Carmel. They were to prepare a sacrifice, and call down fire from heaven to consume the sacrifice. The one who succeeded would be revealed as the true prophet.

Each group prepared a bull on an altar and called on their god to send fire from heaven. The prophets of Baal called on their god and cried and cut themselves, but there was no response from their god. When it was Elijah’s turn, he drenched the sacrifice with water; then he called to God and God sent fire from heaven. The fire completely engulfed the sacrifice.

Read Elijah’s words in 1 Kings 18:36: *“…LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, **let it be known this day that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these things at thy word.**”* He was following the guidance of God’s Spirit. That confrontation wasn’t a show of his sense of self, or self\-importance; it was solely based on the Lord’s guidance.

Observe the result: the Israelites lost faith in Ahab and followed Elijah’s guidance in trusting and recognizing God’s sovereignty. What Elijah did glorified the Lord God of Israel before the people. Whatever you do for the Lord shouldn’t be out of selfish ambition or conceit. It should be for His glory. You must learn to follow the Spirit in the Word, by the Word, and through the Word just like Elijah did. And your works, and your ways, will glorify the Lord.

## GIVE MORE ATTENTION TO PRAYER February 15th, 2021

>***…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available \[dynamic in its working] (James 5:16 AMPC).***

Matthew 17 recounts the story of an epileptic boy whom Jesus’ disciples couldn’t heal. He was eventually brought by his father to Jesus, and the Bible says, *“…Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour”* (Matthew 17:18\).

The disciples, bemused, went privately to Jesus and inquired why they couldn’t cast the devil out. Jesus replied, *“…Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting”* (Matthew 17:20\-21\).

Jesus’ response gives us an idea as to a certain kind of preparation that’s necessary for certain things. So, the kind of impact you want to make in the spirit will be determined by the seriousness that you put in prayer. If you’re going to birth something, for example, that of course, would require some more time of intense fellowship in prayer.

It’s part of the reason we emphasize personal times of prayer, where you shut everything and everyone else out to spend time with the Lord. Have a planned and robust prayer routine; schedule quality times devoid of distractions, for personal fellowship with the Lord. Give more attention to this, especially in these last days.

## ADD MORE KNOWLEDGE February 16th, 2021

>***Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analyzing and accurately dividing \[rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth (2 Timothy 2:15 AMPC).***

God said, *“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children”* (Hosea 4:6\). The knowledge of God’s Word for each one of us is very important. You must therefore seek to have, by all means, an accurate knowledge of the Word; there’s no alternative to it.

The will, nature, and purpose of God are revealed in His Word. To neglect the Word is to be in the dark about the will of the Father and how He wants you to live. We’ve produced several materials to help you in your personal study. For example, Rhapsody of Realities devotional is a life guide designed to enhance your spiritual growth and development by bringing you a fresh perspective from God’s Word every day. 

Features like the day’s topic, theme scripture, the day’s message, the daily confession and the Bible reading plan segment are all aspects designed by the Spirit to bring the richness of God’s Word to you on a daily basis. Take advantage of them.

You can also take advantage of the previous editions; the words are just as fresh; read through and study them. Remember, the Word of God is undated. It’s good for today.

There’re also myriads of other materials, in both audio and video formats, available on the Pastor Chris Digital Library (PCDL), spanning various life issues. Avail yourself of these materials, and you’ll be amazed at how fast, and stalwart your faith will grow. So, make your personal study of the Word an integral part of your daily routine.

## EXAMINE WHAT YOU HEAR February 17th, 2021
![February 17th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-17-examine-what-you-hear.jpg)

>***My dear friends, don’t believe everything you hear. Carefully weigh and examine what people tell you. Not everyone who talks about God comes from God. There are a lot of lying preachers loose in the world (1 John 4:1 MSG).***

There’re those who quote Romans 13:1 and assume they should do whatever they’re told to do, as long as the one giving such instructions is a person of authority. They’d say, “He’s a renowned leader; therefore, he must be speaking the truth”; but that’s not how it works.

First, let’s review that scripture properly; it says, *“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God”* (Romans 13:1\). Our opening verse tells us to test the spirits. That’s why you don’t just run with, or do whatever you’re told by just anybody; examine where that authority is coming from. It could be from Satan. So, you have to be careful.

God can choose a leader, and the leader can go rogue against God. The Scripture is replete with examples of those that went against God, even though they were chosen of God. Let’s take the story of King Saul as a case study. In 1 Samuel 15, Samuel the prophet gave very definite instructions to King Saul. He was to go to war against Amalek and destroy everything connected to them, with no exceptions!

Saul went out as instructed, and had the victory. He utterly destroyed all that was despised and worthless, but spared what he deemed choice and valuable. Not only did he spare Agag, the king, he also spared the best of the sheep and oxen, and all that was good. What was God’s response?

He said to Samuel the prophet, *“I regret making Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not performed My commands…”* (1 Samuel 15:11 AMPC). This shows that not every leader listens to God or wants to do what’s right.

Therefore subject all things to the light of God’s Word. 1 Thessalonians 5:21 says, *“Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.”* Just because you felt good about what someone of authority told you doesn’t mean it was from God. Always remember that God’s Word is the supreme authority by which we judge all things.

Also, to the leaders, it’s important you listen to God. Find out what He wants, and do His will. Refuse to compromise. Examine your policies to be sure they’re good for God and for people.

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, I consciously weigh every instruction against the truth of the Word, irrespective of who gives it. I refuse to go contrary to your Word, which gives life, light, direction and purpose to me. My steps are ordered by you, through the Word and your Spirit, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

>***Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us (Ephesians 3:20\).***

Some people blame God for every unfortunate event in their lives and in the world, and that’s as a result of their ignorance. God is all\-powerful; yet, His power to produce the miracle you desire or require is inside you; you only need to put it to work.

Read our theme verse again carefully; it says, *“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.”* Whatever God will do in your life is to the extent of the operation of His power in you. Therefore, you really can’t, and shouldn’t hold Him accountable for all the happenings in your life.

He’s also not the one “delaying” the fulfilment of His Word in your life; you’re the one to activate the power in you. It makes no difference what you need; be it healing, increased finances, a new job, a child, growth and expansion in ministry, business or in your career, success in your academics, etc. the power to make it happen is inside you. The Lord Jesus said in Acts 1:8, *“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you….”* That power is the dynamic ability to effect changes, and the quickest way to activate it is speaking in other tongues.

1 Corinthians 14:4 says, *“He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself….”* That means the one who speaks in other tongues energises or activates himself in the supernatural; he stirs up divine power from within. That power of God is also activated when you affirm His Word with boldness.

God and His Word are one. When you declare the Word concerning any situation, you’re invoking His power to bring about a change in that situation. Maintain the habit of meditating on the Word; contemplating and speaking it forth, and you’ll experience the release of the power of God in your life.

## A GIFT TO THE WORLD February 19th, 2021

>***In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour (Titus 1:2\-3\).***

How beautiful this is; eternal life was a promise before the world began, which has now been fulfilled. God’s plan was to make it available to men through the preaching of the Gospel. It was a gift to the whole world. You might say, “O, I thought eternal life was a gift to Christians?” No; John 3:16 says, *“For God so loved **the world**, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”*

When a sinner believes in Jesus, and confesses his Lordship, he or she receives eternal life, and becomes a Christian. Receiving that life brings you into oneness and sonship with God. Jesus said in John 5:26, *“For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.”* John tells us in his epistle, *“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life”* (1 John 5:11\-12\). Eternal life is the present\-hour possession of the one who has Jesus: “…this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life.”

For many, eternal life means the life that goes on and on forever; but that’s only a part of it. Eternal life is the superior life and nature of God; the God\-life. It’s the essence of divinity. This life in you makes you superior to Satan; and it supplanted your human life when you were born again. Glory to God!

## YOUR FAITH WILL BE TESTED February 20th, 2021
![February 20th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-20-your-faith-will-be-tested.jpg)

>***Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth (Revelation 3:10\).***

In 2 Thessalonians 2:3, Paul the Apostle said, *“Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.”* It says many will defect from the Faith. Why would this happen? In Judges 7, when God wanted Gideon to go fight the Midianites, God assured him through the angel that he (Gideon) would defeat his enemies.

Gideon thought he’d need an army; so, he gathered his soldiers. But God said to him, “If you go with so many soldiers, you might think that you won the battle by yourselves. Tell everyone who’s afraid to go home”; and the Bible says twenty\-two thousand of them went home (Judges 7:3\). Then God said, “I want to test the remaining ten thousand soldiers. Bring them to the stream and tell them to drink water. You’ll retain only those who watch out for the enemy while they drink.”

And the Bible says only three hundred of them passed that test (Read Judges 7:4\-6\). They didn’t even know they were being tested. Also, in Jeremiah 9, the Bible says the people accustomed their tongues to lies. They were so false that even a brother couldn’t be trusted. Because of this deceit and hypocrisy, and lying, God said, *“...Behold, I will melt them, and **try them**…”* (Jeremiah 9:7\). This is going to be happening in these last days. A great test is coming, and it has already begun, because God must separate those that are real from those that aren’t real; those who were never true with God.

If this weren’t serious, Jesus wouldn’t require to intervene on behalf of the church in Philadelphia, as read in our theme verse. If your faith in Christ is genuine, it’s going to be tested: *“That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ”* (1 Peter 1:7\). Let Jesus Christ and His Kingdom be all that matters to you in this life.

## “ONE BREAD AND ONE BODY” February 21st, 2021

>***Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat (John 6:31\).***

What we read in our theme verse was the Lord Jesus addressing the Jews. In verses 32\-33, He continued, *“…Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.”*

Then in the forty\-ninth verse, He further emphasised His point: *“Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die”* (John 6:49\-50\). Jesus is the Living Bread; the bread which came down from heaven.

He explained this to His disciples in John 6:51, saying, *“I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”* Then the Apostle Paul, in 1 Corinthians 10:17, explains how this connects to us. He said, *“For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.”* If we’re one bread with Him, it therefore means we have the same life, because we’re born of the Word (1 Peter 1:23\), just as He is the Word made flesh (John 1:14\).

Colossians 1:18 says, *“And he*(Christ) *is the head of the body, the church….”* The head and the body share the same life. If we share His life, then we also share His health, prosperity, strength and glory. No wonder He calls us, “Partakers of the divine nature”; associates of the God\-kind. 1 John 4:17 says, *“…as he is, so are we in this world.”* You’re of the same stock with Christ. Therefore, walk as He walked—in glory, righteousness, strength and dominion. Hallelujah!

## YOU’RE WHAT YOU SAY February 22nd, 2021
![February 22nd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-22-youre-what-you-say.jpg)

>***For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith (Mark 11:23\).***

Your life is the summation of the words that come out of you. Our opening verse emphasizes the importance of framing your life with your words. That’s the most beautiful natural gift from God to man; the gift of words; the ability to speak and make words.

Life produces for you a harvest of what you say, and here, there’s no middle ground. As a Christian, you must keep talking; if you want to live in health, talk health. If you want to walk in righteousness and always produce works of righteousness, then talk righteousness; every so often, consciously declare, “I’m the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. I produce works and fruits of righteousness.”

You have to say it, to live it. You might say, “What if I haven’t been saying anything? What will my life be like?” You’ll still have a harvest; unfortunately, it’ll be the wrong one. It’s like leaving a garden unattended; weeds will definitely grow of their own accord. Keep yourself in victory, dominion and prosperity with your words.

God already did all that’s necessary for you to have and enjoy life in Christ to the full, through the power of the Holy Spirit. It’s your responsibility now to keep things that way and it’s mainly by your confession. Always affirm that you have a great life. Declare that you’ve been called to glory and virtue; a life of power, and moral excellence. Make these declarations every day.

There isn’t anything you don’t have (1 Corinthians 3:21; 2 Peter 1:3\), and there isn’t anything you can’t do (Philippians 4:13\). Therefore, always declare abundance, supernatural provisions, strength, possibilities and victories, and your life will go in that direction only.

## LIVING FOR HIS GLORY February 23rd, 2021
![February 23rd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-23-living-for-his-glory.jpg)

>***And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again (2 Corinthians 5:15\).***

In these last days, there’s only one thing that matters: living for the Lord; living for His glory; living a life of purpose. Jesus showed us the example to follow in this regard. In John 17:4, He said, *“I have glorified thee on the earth: **I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do**.”*

That ought to be your thinking as well; glorifying the Father should be your passion and purpose for living. How do you glorify the Father? It’s by doing His will; doing that which He commits to you and finishing the work. Have you discovered His purpose for your life? Are you about His work?

The purpose of the Father is the salvation of the whole world. That’s the reason He sent Jesus. And your purpose in life is connected to this. No matter what you do in life, if you’re not reaching the lost and winning souls, you’re living an empty life. The Bible says God is unwilling that any should perish but that all men should come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9\). You bring Him glory in making this happen.

He seeks to beautify the lives of those around you, and lead them into righteousnes through you; that’s living a purposeful life. It doesn’t matter how fruitful or effective you might have been in other areas, you must seek to excel in soul winning, in taking the Gospel to the lost, hopeless, hurting and downtrodden, not just in your world, but also in the regions beyond.

A life well lived, a successful life that pleases God, is one that achieves those things God destined you to do. Therefore, bring Him glory by being effectual in leading men to righteousness.

## SEE THE WORD IN PICTURES February 24th, 2021
![February 24th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-24-see-the-word-in-pictures.jpg)

>***While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal (2 Corinthians 4:18\).***

When you study the Scriptures, learn to do so with pictures; see with the eyes of your spirit; believe and act accordingly. It’s the blessings that your spirit takes a hold of that’ll manifest in your life. Therefore, as you listen to, or study the Word, visualize your victory, prosperity, health, peace, progress and success from within, and affirm accordingly.

Before the physical manifestation of the glory and victories that you desire in life, you must see them first within you. Once you can see it from within, then it’s yours. You can never have it on the outside if you didn’t first have it within. That’s where some have missed it. They want to see first with their physical eyes before calling it real; that’s not faith. Faith is calling real that which the physical senses can’t perceive.

For example, God said to Abraham, *“Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee…”* (Genesis 17:5\-6\). Abraham first had to visualise himself as the father of many nations. At the time God spoke to him, he was ninety\-nine years old, and Sarah his wife, was equally old and barren. Nevertheless, the Bible says, *“He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God”* (Romans 4:20\). In Genesis 15:5, the Lord had said to him, *“…Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and … So shall thy seed be.”* Abraham believed. He saw the picture of his uncountable descendants—numerous as the stars—from within.

What is it that you desire in your life today? Is it a child? See it inside first. Is it the growth and expansion of your church, a new job or business? Create the picture and take possession in the spirit, and with your spirit, first, because it’s already real in the spirit\-realm. Hallelujah!

The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places, and indeed, I have a goodly heritage. Hallelujah!

## THE SPIRIT HAS BEEN POURED OUT February 25th, 2021

>***And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions (Joel 2:28\).***

The Bible says *“...no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost”* (1 Corinthians 12:3\). No one can confess the Lordship of Jesus or decide to serve God, except drawn by the Holy Spirit. When the Bible says the word of salvation is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart (Romans 10:8\), it’s the Holy Spirit that puts that word in your heart. Right from when someone professes the Lordship of Jesus for salvation, it’s the Holy Spirit already working in his or her life. 

God, knowing that everyone needs the Holy Spirit to believe the Gospel, said in our theme verse, *“…I will pour out my spirit upon **all flesh**; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy….”* Note the underlined phrase, “all flesh.” In fact, the Complete Jewish Bible clarifies it. It says, *“After this, I will pour out my Spirit on all humanity. Your sons and daughters will prophesy…”* (Joel 3:1 CJB). So, the “all flesh” in the KJV actually means “all humanity.”

The Spirit has been poured out on ALL HUMANITY; this is the reason anyone today can hear and receive the Gospel. In Acts 2, the Bible says a large crowd of Jews came from different nations of the world to celebrate Pentecost (Read Acts 2:9\-12\). As Peter ministered the Gospel to them, three thousand of them gave their hearts to Christ.

The next time Peter ministered, it was five thousand souls that got converted (Acts 4:4\). Before long, there was a multitude of believers in Jerusalem! Why? The Holy Ghost had been poured out on all men, as promised in Joel 2:28\. Glory to God!

This is why we preach the Gospel, because we know everyone has the capacity to accept the Word of God. The Holy Spirit is all over the world, working, convicting the world of sin and drawing men to righteousness. Praise God!

##  BLESSED AND HIGHLY FAVOURED February 26th, 2021
![February 26th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-26-blessed-and-highly-favoured.jpg)

 ---

>***To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved (Ephesians 1:6\).***

The word “accepted” in the scripture above is “charitoo” (Greek), and it means to grace; that is, to be imbued with special honour; make accepted or be highly favoured. So, the scripture should actually read, “…He has made us highly favoured in the beloved.” Hallelujah!

Someone in Scripture who got such a description was Mary. Luke 1:28 says, *“And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured….”* And that’s exactly what God is telling you; you’re blessed and highly favoured.

Mary was blessed and highly favoured because she was to carry Jesus in her womb through the Word. Today, you’re carrying Jesus in your spirit through the Word. Glory to God! His Word isn’t just in you, His Word is your life, for you’re born of the Word. What a life He’s given us!

What does it mean to be favoured? It means that you’re blessed beyond measure; you’re blessed of God even when you don’t seem to deserve it. In essence, look beyond your ability; look beyond whether or not you qualify; God Himself is your ability and your sufficiency. That’s what it says in 2 Corinthians 3:5, “Our sufficiency is of Him.”

Being highly favoured means everything you do prospers. Even when others fail or make losses, you excel, because you’re sponsored by the Spirit; he orders your steps. Even if you were surrounded by critics and detractors, it’ll make no difference because you’re God’s man or woman, piloted by grace.

As God’s favour is manifested in your behalf, doors and opportunities which can’t be humanly explained are open to you. The Bible says,  *“And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance…”* (2 Corinthians 9:8 AMPC). This is God’s desire for you. Psalm 5:12 says,  *“For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.”* Everywhere and every time, throughout this year, be conscious that you’re blessed and highly favoured.

## THE HONOUR OF PREACHING THE GOSPEL February 27th, 2021
![February 27th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-27-the-honour-of-preaching-the-gospel.jpg)

 ---

>***This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare (1 Timothy 1:18\).***

God has never used the angels to minister or preach the Gospel for the salvation of men. Even if He gets the attention of a sinner through an angel, He’ll get a Christian who has received that salvation to preach the Gospel to that sinner, because He gave the Church the honour of preaching the Gospel (Acts 10:1\-6\).

He also gave us, His saints, the honour of executing judgment in this earth over the forces of darkness (Psalm 149:5\-9\). This is so that we’ll have no excuse in preaching the Gospel and covering the earth with His righteousness. He gave us the power to use His Name against satanic forces. He said, *“...Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature…And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils…”* (Mark 16:15\-17\).

Be excited about preaching the Gospel and let nothing hinder you from it. Irrespective of the threats, persecutions or challenges that you might face, preach the Gospel unafraid. Remember, you’re a soldier in God’s army. Soldiers are undaunted about their cause. True soldiers don’t retreat, and they don’t surrender. They fight to the finish. So, be strong and tough in accomplishing the task of soul winning in these last days.

Pray. You represent the Heavenly Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and there’s a battle for the souls of men. Before you go out on evangelism, spend time in intercession. Prevail in prayer for the souls of men and prophesy their salvation. Prophesy to your city, your nation, and the nations of the world, that they all belong to Jesus Christ and souls are won en\-mass into the Kingdom.

Take your role as a praying priest, and minister of reconciliation. Remember, this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.

## CHRIST IN YOU February 28th, 2021

>***But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, To reveal his Son in me… (Galatians 1:15\-16\).***

The Apostle Paul, in our opening text, testified that God was pleased to reveal His Son, Jesus Christ in him. This isn’t just for the Apostle Paul; it’s the calling of every Christian. Christ revealed or expressed in your daily walk is the essence of Christianity. The Bible says, *“To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory”* (Colossians 1:27\).

Can you see Christ in you? Can you see His life manifested in and through you? If Christ is revealed in you, there’ll be no place for defeat or weakness. There’ll be no room for sickness in your body. The hope that you’ll forever be victorious, is Christ in you. You may have been diagnosed with a terminal disease; if you can contemplate Christ in you, that’ll be the end of that infirmity. The Bible says, *“But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness”* (Romans 8:10 NIV).

It doesn’t matter how large the tumour is, Christ in you will cause it to dematerialize. Peter was going through the quarters, visiting the brethren. Then he met Aeneas, who had been paralysed, bedridden for eight long years. In that condition, he received the Gospel. All that Peter said to him was, “Aeneas, Christ makes you well!” (Acts 9:34\).

If you’ve been experiencing symptoms of disease or infirmity in your body, Christ makes you well. Become conscious of the indwelling Christ; He’s your strength; therefore, if you couldn’t walk, rise up and walk. In Him, and through Him, you can do all things! You’re victorious forever. He’s your riddance, your wisdom, and your righteousness. Blessed be God!
