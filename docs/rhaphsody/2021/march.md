## SPEAK WORDS FROM THE FATHER March 1st, 2021

>***For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak (John 12:49\).***

Have you ever wondered why some of the words you speak produce the wrong results? Perhaps you’re not speaking words from the Father. Jesus spoke the Father’s words. He knew exactly the right words to say in every situation, to everyone, and concerning everything. The secret is what He told us in our theme verse.

Imagine what transpired in Luke 7:11\-17\. He was on a journey to the city of Nain, and as He arrived at the gate of the city, He saw a funeral procession of a young man who was the only son of a widow. Moved with compassion, He touched the casket and said, *“…Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother”* (Luke 7:14\-15\). He raised the lifeless body of that young man back to life with words!

Over a raging tempest, the Bible says, *“…he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm”* (Mark 4:39\). It made no difference how turbulent the weather was, Jesus hushed them with words. The words He spoke came from the Father. He said in John 12:50, *“…whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.”*

We’re to have His kind of results, because the Father has given us words to speak. Don’t speak words that you learnt from the world; speak the Word of God. Get your language from the Word of God. That’s why you have to keep studying the Scriptures (2 Timothy 2:15\). Think and talk like Jesus, and you’ll have His extraordinary results.

## BE VIGILANT IN THE SPIRIT March 2nd, 2021

>***They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon (Nehemiah 4:17\).***

Nehemiah was faced with an intense opposition when he decided to build the wall of Jerusalem. The Jews’ enemies were determined to stop the building by slaying the builders. But Nehemiah wasn’t ignorant of their evil plans and intentions.

As he led God’s people to build the wall, they prepared to ward off any form of attack. Each one held a weapon with the other hand, taking every necessary precaution against any onslaught from the enemy. This was written for our learning.

We’re partners and co\-labourers with the Lord in building His Church—His body—winning souls and carrying out the work of the ministry. While at it, we must be ready to fight against the decrees of darkness to force us to live in a world, an atmosphere or governmental system that’s hostile to the Gospel.

Satan, knowing that his time is short, is trying to move ahead to create the environment of the anti\-Christ before his time. So, we must be on the alert and on the offensive. 1 Peter 5:8 says, “*Be sober, be vigilant….”* Be vigilant in the spirit, listening in, and with, your spirit as you speak in tongues and meditate on the Scriptures. The Lord will give you strategies and guidance on how to effectively dismantle the structures of the adversary.

Refuse to be moved by some of the happenings in the world today—the confusion, fear and deception. By the power of God’s Spirit, we (the Church) are exercising our authority in Christ, bringing in the new order of things. Get vitally involved in this. Pray like you’ve never done! When we call for days of global prayer and fasting, be a part of it. We’re setting in place a new world order in the Spirit, where the Gospel has free course, and in preparation for our soon coming Lord. Amen.

## HAVE NO FEAR OF MAN March 3rd, 2021

>***…Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses (Nehemiah 4:14\).***

Many years ago, while I was in the university, the government of the day, a military government, banned all religious activities on campus. Some of the members of our fellowship came to convince me to comply, but I had heard from God; He told me to remain on campus.

Some of them weren’t ready to stand with me, perhaps, because they were afraid. But if God had told me to continue, why should I stop because of what someone said? Always, God’s Word or counsel to you is what counts. He made the Vice\-Chancellor, Governor, President, Prime Minister, etc.

The Bible says the powers that be are ordained of Him; He put them in office. If they go rogue against Him by coming up with laws and policies that don’t favour His righteous cause, you’re not obliged to comply. No authority supersedes God’s authority. So, I went ahead with the programme I had scheduled on campus, because I’d rather obey God; and it was a remarkable success.

Subsequently, we were never stopped from holding services on campus till I graduated. Was I defying the government? No! I was only obeying the orders of a higher government. It was the same with the apostles. Peter and the other apostles confronted the authorities in their day. Once, they said, *“...You yourselves judge which is right in God’s sight\-\-\-to obey you or to obey God”* (Acts 4:19 GNB). As a man or woman of God, as a Christian, as one who walks with God, have no fear of men! Have no fear of their laws or decrees; have no fear of anything. The Bible says there’s no wisdom against the Lord (Proverbs 21:30\).

Human beings can never come together and come up with enough wisdom or strategy against God. It’s impossible. When you’re walking in sync with His plan and purpose for your life, it makes no difference what anyone thinks or does; it doesn’t matter the threats; you’ll win. The opposition may come from your family, your city, country, or government; have no fear, *“...because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”* (1 John 4:4\).

## KEEP “PUSHING” IN PRAYER March 4th, 2021

>***Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much (James 5:16\).***

When the Bible says there was no rain in the land of Israel according to the word of Elijah, it wasn’t that Elijah suddenly woke up and said, “There’ll be no rain in Israel for the next three and half years.” No, the Bible says he prayed earnestly. 1 Kings 18:42 shows how he prayed; it says Elijah *“bowed deeply in prayer, his face between his knees”* (MSG).

The Amplified Classic version of our theme verse aptly describes this kind of prayer*: “...The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available \[dynamic in its working].”* It says the prayer is earnest, and there’s a persistence about it. In other words, it’s a sustained kind of prayer that’s marked by a deep feeling of conviction.

This isn’t the kind of prayer you pray at the dining table or when you’re hurrying off to work. There’re certain times and situations where you don’t just speak the word and go away; you persist in prayer. You keep pushing. You may be saying the same thing, but you’re pushing.

Jesus did that too in the Garden of Gethsemane. He said the same things in prayer, and He prayed that way for an hour. It wasn’t a two\-minute prayer. He persisted, because he understood the stakes of the moment. We’re in a similar moment today. The stakes are high. You’ve got to take your personal prayer life more seriously.

Always stir yourself and respond to the call and urgency of prayer from your spirit, declaring the Word and crushing the forces of darkness, in the spirit. It may look like nothing is changing, but you keep pushing. You might ask, “But when do I stop?” You stop when you “know that you know” in your spirit that it’s done! Glory to God! You’ll surely get the note of victory.

## STAND OUT AND BE COURAGEOUS March 5th, 2021

>***There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee (Joshua 1:5\).***

I often recall how, many years ago, cult activities in tertiary institutions were on the rise. Some Christian groups were threatened and intimidated from time to time by these nocturnal groups. But as I studied my Bible and read about the exploits of people like David, Moses, Jephthah, etc., I couldn’t understand why any Christian would be intimidated by cultists. So, I prayed, “Lord, give me just one chance; I’ll force those cult members out!”

Finally, I got into the university, and then came my first experience in my first year! One night, the cult members came dancing into the campus in their full regalia, and there was complete pandemonium. But while many scampered in different directions, looking for where to hide, I got on my knees, spoke in tongues, and I said, “Lord Jesus, by your grace, I‘ll deal with this; they’ll never have such effrontery on this campus again.”

Then on another occasion, a year later, they sent out a message that they were “sailing” that night. And I said, “Sailing where? Never!” When it was night, I gathered some of the brethren, and said, “We’re sailing tonight!” As they (the cultists) were making noise and rabble\-rousing, we were out on the other side, dancing and singing, “The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but they are mighty through the Holy Ghost!” 

We were singing with the consciousness that in the spirit, we’re declaring them arrested. Guess what? The next day, the Police came looking for them, and they were arrested! Praise God! The months following, several of the cult leaders and members received salvation and joined us.

As Christians, we should never be intimidated by anything or anyone. It’s something the Lord said to me years ago; He said, “As I was with Moses, so I’ll be with you. I’ll not fail you nor forsake you”; and He’s saying the same to you, even now. Be strong, and very courageous. God’s Word is dependable. That’s what I’m telling you today. You can stake your life on it. When others are terrorized and full of fear concerning any situation, stand out, and be full of courage.

## THINK BEYOND YOURSELF March 6th, 2021

>***Don’t push your way to the front; don’t sweet\-talk your way to the top. Put yourself aside, and help others get ahead. Don’t be obsessed with getting your own advantage. Forget yourselves long enough to lend a helping hand (Philippians 2:3\-4 MSG).***

1 Timothy 2:1\-4 says*, “I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.”* It’s our responsibility to change the world through prayer, ministry and protagonism. That’s what you have to do. Otherwise, you haven’t lived.

In Nehemiah 4:14, as the children of Israel began to build the wall of Jerusalem and prepared to defend it, Nehemiah said to the people, *“…fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”* He didn’t say, “Fight for yourselves.” And the word “houses” there doesn’t mean buildings; he was referring to clans, whole families, like you’d say, “The house of Joseph.” He was calling out the champion spirit in them.

Champions don’t fight for themselves; they fight for others. That’s what we read in our theme verse; it says, *“Put yourself aside, and help others get ahead. Don’t be obsessed with getting your own advantage.”* When you pray, it shouldn’t always be about your business, your family or things related to you; it should be for a greater cause. Think beyond yourself.

There’re many who are going through a lot of hurt for whom we must pray. The Bible says of the Lord Jesus that He’s touched with the feeling of our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15\). Be moved by the conditions of the sinners and others who are suffering around you. Let the plight of the poor, the sick, and the downtrodden stir compassion in you to intercede for them and cause a change in their lives today. We’re to continue in intercession for the nations, leaders, and peoples of the world, especially in these last days.

## DIRECT THEIR COURSE THROUGH PRAYER March 7th, 2021

>***I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty (1 Timothy 2:1\-2\).***

Our theme scripture is the Spirit’s admonition through Paul to the Church on the importance of earnest intercession for all men, our countries of domicile, and the leaders therein. The result of such is an overwhelming experience of God’s blessings of peace and prosperity. This is part of what you do in obedience—praying, contending for the hearts of men in your country, and around the world—that God’s righteousness be established, and all forms of evil, turmoil, wickedness and terror, be thwarted.

Today, the happenings in our world are a great source of concern. But the Church holds the solution. The Church is the only restraining power against evil in the earth today (2 Thessalonians 2:7\). So, you must pray and not complain. If you don’t pray for your country, the leaders and people, where would peace come from?

Read our theme verse again; God’s directive on how we must pray in order to experience peace in our nations is clear; it’s not by bearing arms or becoming riotous.

Rise to the challenge and take up the responsibility of prayer. Pray earnestly and fervidly in the Spirit for the nations and leaders of the countries where you live or work, and the rest of the world. Declare that God’s righteousness prevails, and His glory rests on, and influences men’s hearts as God’s people boldly proclaim the Gospel.

Pray also for ministers, that they’d be granted more grace to preach the Gospel with boldness and power, that many more souls would be added to the Church all around the world. Until the rapture takes place, we hold the true reins of power in the nations, and have the authority to direct their course through prayer.

## CONSCIOUSLY PRACTISE THE WORD March 8th, 2021

>***But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed (James 1:25\).***

Consciously practising the Word is how you can enjoy its full blessings in your life, because the power of God is in His Word. For example, the Word says*, “...Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you”* (Matthew 5:44\). Consciously practise this; let it be your daily walk.

When you start out practising something, you may miss it, but don’t give up and say, “Well, I tried.” Keep at it until you gain mastery. Again, the Word says, *“...take no thought for your life...”* (Luke 12:22\); in other words, have no cares. Practise it. Don’t find yourself worrying over the mundane things of life, with fear of lack; rather, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.

Psalm 1:3 reveals something phenomenal about the extraordinary life of blessings you have in Christ. It says you’re like a tree planted by the rivers of water—ever luscious and green—fruitful and eternally productive. Affirm this every day about yourself. Irrespective, and independent of the happenings in the world, be unmoved, because you know you’re empowered to prosper. For you, it’s blessings only. Hallelujah!

We’re Word\-practitioners; Jesus Christ is the Living Word, and we’re born after Him. Paul said, “Ye are the Epistles of Christ” (2 Corinthians 3:3\). That means we’re the expression of the Word. The Apostle Peter referenced a similar thought in 1 Peter 1:23, saying, *“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.”*

Being born of the Word means you must live in, by and through the Word; you must live it out in your daily walk.

## STAND IN HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS March 9th, 2021

>***To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus (Romans 3:26\).***

Jesus Christ has become your righteousness. That’s why in Christianity, we don’t walk in our righteousness; rather, we stand in His righteousness. We declare and boldly affirm that Christ is our righteousness and walk in the light of His righteousness. It’s like being covered in His glory; you’re not seen. It’s His light that’s seen; it’s His glory that’s seen.

It’s His power that’s made manifest as you walk in His righteousness. That’s our blessing as new creatures in Christ Jesus. Don’t be “performance\-conscious” before God. Don’t allow sin and the guilt of your mistakes dissipate your zeal for God and faith in Him. 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, *“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”*

You’ve become the effulgence of His righteousness, because He manifests His righteousness through you. He took your place of sin, and gave you His righteousness. Now, He manifests His righteousness through you. This is an amazing reality! Your new life started with the resurrection of Jesus Christ: *“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life”* (Romans 6:4\).

2 Corinthians 5:17 says, *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature…”*; a new species or kind of man, born in righteousness. This is the reason you can practise righteousness and produce fruits and works of righteousness, because that’s your nature in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!

## BE PREPARED AHEAD OF THE EVIL DAY March 10th, 2021

>***Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might… For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand (Ephesians 6:10\-13\).***

The first part of our opening scripture admonishes that you be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. The Lord never tells us to do something we couldn’t do. If He says, *“Be strong in the Lord,”* it means that’s what you need to do. He gives further instructions in the eleventh verse: *“Put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”*

This is telling you to prepare, and stay prepared ahead of the evil day. He tells you what to do against the devil. If you put on the whole armour of God as He has said, you’ll be able to stand against all the stratagems, schemes, maneuvers, and manipulations of the devil.

The reason many falter when they face challenges is that they don’t act on the Word. In the verses we read in our theme scripture, God instructed us clearly on what to do. What He said in verse thirteen is the reason for verses 10\-12\. There’s a day of trouble (the evil day); it’s to be anticipated. There’s an enemy out there seeking whom to devour, and when he has the opportunity, he’ll strike. But we’re not ignorant of His devices.

Satan isn’t a factor. As long as you’re strong in the Lord—keeping His Word in your heart and in your mouth—you’ll discomfit the enemy whenever he shows up. As long as the Word of God is your arsenal, you’ll always win. The Word of God is the sword of the Spirit with which you cut the devil down. Hallelujah!

## A SOLID FOUNDATION WITH THE WORD March 11th, 2021

>***But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word (Acts 6:4\).***

A solid foundation of the Word of God is what will determine your reaction and disposition to life and circumstances around you. Think about the happenings in the world in the past months; the reaction and actions of some Christians is proof they never had the right foundation. Some were completely disillusioned and ran into hiding—to “isolate” themselves—while looking to government leaders for help and guidance. They were terrified by the same things that frightened the world; that shouldn’t be.

The Church isn’t a group of sissies; we’re soldiers. We’re tough for Christ. How could a Christian be afraid of a virus, after Jesus said in Luke 10:19, *“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”* This is a sovereign declaration; it’s unequivocal. You’re superior to anything that hurts or binds; you’re “uninfectable.”

But you see, if you don’t know this truth, you’d be terrified. This is why we bring you the Word of God every day, to build you up in Christ, to impart knowledge to you. Acts 20:32 says, *“And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up….”* If you’re brought up on the foundation of the Word of God, nothing will move you.

Recall the words of Jesus in Luke 6:47\-49 as He distinguished between the one whose life is founded on the Word of God, and the one whose life isn’t. He said, *“Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.”* Build a solid foundation for your life with the Word of God.

## THE STAKES ARE HIGH March 12th, 2021

>***Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord (Romans 12:11\).***

Clearly, we see from the Scriptures that we’re in the final days before the rapture of the Church. This isn’t the time to loaf around; there’s a lot the Lord wants to do through you with the short time left. Our theme verse says*, “Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.”* You’ve got to work with the mentality that His appearing could be any minute, and become very passionate in your spirit for the Gospel—ensuring its spread and impact around the world.

As the Scriptures tell us, the Antichrist is only going to be given three and a half years for the Great Tribulation. It’s going to be a period of intense trouble, worse than the world has ever experienced and will ever experience (Matthew 24:21\); and it’ll be world\-wide in scope. Jesus said, *“And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved…”* (Matthew 24:22\).

Imagine the kind of evil and destruction that’ll be perpetrated by the Antichrist for only three and a half years that warrants a divine shortening. That also tells us something: We can do a lot of good within a short time; we can shake up this world. It begins with you giving more attention to prayer, especially praying for the impact of the Gospel around the world in these last days.

This is very important; the stakes are very high. It’s not just about you; it’s about the future of our world. Before the Rapture, we’ve got to dominate this world like never before! Jesus isn’t planning to “snatch” us out of this world as though we’ve been victims. Remember that He overcame the world. He’s coming for a victorious Church; a triumphant Church. Glory to God!

## WE’VE BEEN ENTHRONED March 13th, 2021
![March 13th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-13-weve-been-enthroned.jpg)

 ---

>***But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us…And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 2:4\-6\).***

The phrase “sit together” in the scripture above is “sugkathizo” (Greek), and it means to give (or take) a seat in company with; a joint\-sitting. Think about that! What could be greater than having a joint\-sitting with Christ! Weymouth New Testament version renders it so beautifully; it says God *“raised us with Him from the dead, and enthroned us with Him in the heavenly realms as being in Christ Jesus.”* We’ve been enthroned! Blessed be God!

Now that we’ve been enthroned, what are we supposed to do? Romans 5:17 tells us: *“For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”* The word “reign” is “basileuo” (Greek) which means “to king.” And Revelation 5:10 perfectly corroborates this truth; it says, *“And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.”*

Yes, at the millennial period, we’re going to be reigning with Christ, according to the Bible. But today in the earth, we’re reigning through Him or by Him, because we’re using His Name; operating in His stead. We’re called to exercise dominion and to live as masters and victors in life through Jesus Christ. We reign over Satan, darkness, the world and all creation.

The Bible says, *“The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it”* (John 1:5 ESV). Hallelujah! This is why the Bible says, *“For the mystery of lawlessness (that hidden principle of rebellion against constituted authority) is already at work in the world, \[but it is] restrained only until he who restrains is taken out of the way”* (2 Thessalonians 2:7 AMPC). We—the Church—are the ones restraining evil in the world. Jesus said, *“As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world”* (John 9:5\). In the same way, until we’re taken out of here by the Rapture, darkness can’t prevail, because we have a joint\-sitting with Christ in the place of power and dominion. And we exercise that power and dominion now!

## OUR WEAPONS OF WORDS March 14th, 2021

>***Giving thanks unto the Father…Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12\-13\).***

From the scripture above, we see that there’re only two groups of people: those under the power of darkness and those in the Kingdom of God’s dear Son. Until you’re born again and transferred into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son, you remain under the power of darkness, and Satan becomes the god of all that concerns you.

Remember, Jesus said to the Jews who came to arrest Him, *“Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do...”* (John 8:44\). This is why we oftentimes find leaders and rulers of nations that are influenced and controlled by the principalities of darkness. When such leaders make wicked decisions and enforce repressive policies, it’s because they’re being influenced by evil forces. That’s why we pray for leaders, so that instead of being influenced by the forces of darkness, they’d be influenced by the Spirit of God.

The Bible says, *“I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority…”* (1 Timothy 2:1\-2\). Then, 2 Corinthians 10:4 says, *“For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds.”*

The word “warfare” is “strateia” (Greek) and it’s telling us that we’re in the strategizing office, leading a military expedition in the Spirit. When we speak words in prayer, angels of God and the Spirit of God take those words and weaponize them. That’s what makes them mighty to the pulling down of fortresses.

So, as a Christian, recognize the enormity of the responsibility on you, to intercede for leaders of nations. Every so often, pray fervently in the spirit for the leaders in your country. With authoritative words, rebuke the forces of darkness to desist from influencing them, and affirm that their hearts are turned to the Lord to do His will. This is what we must do for leaders of nations to be influenced by God’s wisdom and righteousness; we must pray for them in line with God’s Word.

## VICTORY UNTO VICTORY March 15th, 2021

>***But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him (2 Corinthians 2:14 NIV).***

You can win every day, and achieve extraordinary success. The Amplified Classic version of the scripture above says, *“But thanks be to God, Who in Christ always leads us in triumph \[as trophies of Christ’s victory] and through us spreads and makes evident the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere.”* As we get ourselves prepared in these days before the Rapture, you’re not only going to be triumphant in your city but everywhere you go.

1 John 5:4 says, *“For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world; and this is the victory that conquers the world, even our faith”* (AMPC). The question is, What’s your mentality? How do you see yourself? When we say Christ has given your life a meaning, that’s what we’re talking about, because you’ve come to a place where you realize life isn’t for defeat; your journey is victory unto victory. That’s our heritage in Christ.

It makes no difference that the world is in crises; there should never be fear in you. Jesus said, *“…be of good cheer; I have overcome the world”* (John 16:33\). He overcame the world for you. To be born again is to be born of God, and it says whatever is born of God is victorious over Satan, the world and its failing system. Hallelujah!

Get excited when you face troubles or crises, because you’re certain it’ll all turn out for your good. This is because, in our kingdom, we win only, and make progress from glory to glory. We dominate this physical world with the principles of our heavenly Kingdom. Hallelujah!

## GLORY THROUGH THE CHURCH March 16th, 2021

>***Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen (Ephesians 3:20\-21\).***

In the first chapter of the book of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, began to explain who Christ is, with respect to God, and who the Church is. He also went on to explain why the Church isn’t a conglomeration of religious groups; rather, it’s the Body of Christ, full of glory.

In Ephesians 3:6 NKJV, he explained *“that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, of the same body, and partakers of His promise in Christ through the gospel.”* 1 Corinthians 12:27 tells us that we’re the Body of Christ and members in particular. How did we become members of the Body of Christ? It was by being baptized into Christ at the New Birth. Our theme verse says, *“Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.”*

The Greek word translated “ages” is “genea”; it means a generation. That means from generation to generation, the Father is glorified in the Church, by Jesus Christ. The desire and ministry of Jesus is to glorify the Father always, and this He does through the Church.

Even in the face of diverse persecution and belligerent oppositions, we remain bold and courageous for and with the Gospel, because His glory is in, and upon us. With that glory, we triumph over sickness, diseases, poverty, and reign victoriously in the realms of life. The Church of Jesus Christ is glorious, triumphant, flourishing, and full of dominion, wisdom and power. Hallelujah!

## WORSHIP WITH KNOWLEDGE March 17th, 2021

>***But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth: for the father seeketh such to worship him (John 4:23\).***

When you really know Jesus, your worship or praise to Him becomes meaningful. It wouldn’t just be because the song is melodious; rather, it’ll effuse profusely from the deep recesses of your heart, in true fellowship and knowledge of His greatness and loving kindness. There may not be any instrumental music or melody while you’re worshipping, but your heart will be so enraptured and entwined with Him, with outbursts of spirit songs in spiritual melody.

Remember, people praise, worship and pray in all religions. The question is, who is the object of their worship? Who are they praying to? What are they saying to Him? And what might be His response, if any? Your worship or praise has to come from a place of knowledge of the Word. The Word says, *“Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands be as the evening sacrifice”* (Psalm 141:2\). Also, in 1 Timothy 2:8, the Bible tells us, *“I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.”*

As you lift your hands in worship or prayer, you’re offering to Him a sacrifice of sweet\-smelling savour. Go ahead and practise this now. Worship the Father from your spirit and according to His Word, with your hands lifted up.

## PERSECUTED FOR HIS SAKE March 18th, 2021

>***Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you (1 Peter 4:4\).***

In 1 Peter 4, the Apostle Peter emphasizes that living in accordance to God’s Word comes with a price of being ridiculed. Many will be surprised when you don’t join them in the same wild and reckless living; and so they’ll insult, vilify and speak evil of you.

The Amplified Classic translation of the opening text tells us, *“They are astonished and think it very queer that you do not now run hand in hand with them in the same excesses of dissipation, and they abuse \[you].”* Irrespective of the evil or abuses they haul at you because you ‘follow’ Jesus, never be ashamed. Your association with Christ is the greatest honour ever.

The Bible says, “For it is better to suffer for doing good, if this should be God’s will, than for doing evil” (1 Peter 3:17\). So, distinguish yourself for the Lord. Arm yourself with the same mind—the mind of Christ. Don’t be ashamed to stand up for the Lord no matter the persecutions. He stood up for you, and saved you; so, you must stand up for Him. Don’t be concerned that you may be isolated or ostracized.

Jesus loves you even if all others forsake you, and according to the Word, He won’t forsake you. He’s in you and always with you: *“...lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen”* (Matthew 28:20\). Read His words in Luke 21:33\-36: *“Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away. And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth....”*

We’re in the end times, and the current happenings around the world are a fulfilment of these prophecies, right before our eyes. But here’s a question you must answer in Hebrews 2:3: *“How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?....”* Live according to God’s Word and let nothing cause you to ignore or neglect your salvation. Jesus said in Matthew 5:11\-12, *“Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.”*

## HOLY, FAULTLESS AND GUILTLESS March 19th, 2021

>***That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish (Ephesians 5:26\-27\).***

The Lord Jesus is coming for a glorious Church, one without blemish, a faultless Church. You say, “is that possible?” Absolutely! That’s what His redemptive work was all about. Colossians 1:21\-22 (CEV) says, *“You used to be far from God. Your thoughts made you his enemies, and you did evil things. But his Son became a human and died. So God made peace with you, and now he lets you stand in his presence as people who are holy and faultless and innocent.”*

Through the sacrifice of His own body as the sin\-payment on your behalf, you now dwell in His presence. There’s no enmity between you and the Father (Read Ephesians 2:13\-16\). How comforting it is to know the true nature and character of our heavenly Father! He brought us to Himself. James 1:5 says, He *“…upbraideth not…,”* which means He doesn’t reproach or criticize you. He doesn’t blame you for anything. He doesn’t count your sins against you (2 Corinthians 5:19\).

You’re free from accusation; you’ve been justified. No wonder Paul got poetical in Romans 8:33\-34 saying, *“Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again….”* Then in verses 38 and 39, he climaxed, *“For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”*

Christ Jesus already died for you; He was condemned in your place. Thus, no one should condemn you anymore (Romans 8:1\). Christ is your righteousness (1 Corinthians 1:30\). It doesn’t matter who accuses you; you’re holy, faultless and guiltless before God, because Jesus took responsibility for all your sins. He’s the reason God doesn’t charge you with wrong. Hallelujah!

## PRAY FOR WORLD LEADERS March 20th, 2021
![March 20th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-20-pray-for-world-leaders.jpg)

>***I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty (1 Timothy 2:1\-2\).***

It was all over the news some time ago how a man strangled his four\-year\-old child to death in a bathtub. After killing him, he screamed with tears, “I don’t know why I did it!” Of course, he went to prison for it. In his words, he said, “I felt a power beyond myself and I strangled my own son.”

Also reported, was a sixteen\-year\-old boy who walked into his home, killed his mother and father with gunshots. Just standing there, bemused, he said he didn’t know why he did it. You’re talking about sons and daughters, men and women, husbands and wives, dads and moms from hell! Why are they from hell? It’s because they’re possessed of demons; evil spirits have entered into them to carry out such despicable acts.

That’s why God tells us to pray for leaders because they aren’t left out of such demonic influence. You’ve got to pray for them because an evil spirit can enter into them. The Bible tells us in Luke 22:3 that an evil spirit entered into Judas Iscariot. When that happened, he walked out of where Jesus and the disciples were, went to the chief priests to finalise arrangements to betray Jesus, the Son of God.

When Judas saw Jesus hanging on the Cross, he thought Jesus would miraculously come off the Cross, but He didn’t. Matthew 27:3\-5 tells us, *“When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders…So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.”* What does that tell you? Satan caused him to do it.

That’s what’s happening to some leaders today; they’re taking steps that are detrimental, damaging and harmful to their nations, people, businesses and the systems. You might say, “I trust my leaders”; but they can be influenced and overpowered by these demonic forces to sign policies or do despicable things they never planned to do. Therefore, you must pray for them.

Pray that they’ll have the will, desire, and boldness to do what’s right in spite of pressures, and refuse to yield to corrupting and negative influences. It’s not out of place to also pray for the removal of those who push their selfish or satanic agendas at the detriment of their people. Most importantly, pray for the salvation of men and leaders alike.

## CHRIST OUR LIGHT March 21st, 2021

>***In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not (John 1:4\-5\).***

In John 8:12, Jesus said, *“…I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”* Again, in John 9:5, He said, “As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.” For anyone to live without Christ, therefore, is to live in gross darkness, utter hopelessness, confusion, and be void of beauty. Light defines; gives direction, beauty, and illumines.

You can’t even know yourself outside Christ; only under His light is your true identity and personality revealed. The Bible says with Him is the fountain of life: in His light shall we see light (Psalm 36:9\). Hallelujah!

If you use all the lights in the world to define your life, you’re sunk, because you’re sure to see the wrong things. But in Him, in His light, you see the glory of God. You see that you’re excellent and full of glory. His light shows who you are, what you have, and your abilities in Christ. It shows you have the greater One living in you.

No wonder the Psamist said in Psalm 119:105, *“Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”* Christ and His Word are one. Apart from showing you your endowments and blessings in Christ, the Word guides you in God’s perfect will for your life, imparting to you the wisdom to fulfil it.

Through His Word, you receive guidance as to specific details about your life, your ministry, career, etc., and definite steps to take in actualizing your set goals. The Bible says Christ has been made unto us wisdom from God. Become more conscious of this, and you’ll function with greater insight and knowledge, walking in success, health, prosperity, peace, and strength always!

## MARKED FOR VICTORY AND SUCCESS March 22nd, 2021

>***And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper (Psalm 1:3\).***

As a child of God, you’re called to live each day of your life in glory, in victory over every situation. You’re marked for success. The triumphant life is your birth\-right, because God has raised you up, and made you to sit together with Christ in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6\).

You’re seated far above the devil and the cohorts of darkness, and the negative influences of this world. Have the mentality that you can’t be defeated or disadvantaged. Nothing in this world can successfully stand against you, for *“…greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”* (1 John 4:4\). You’ve been translated into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son, who leads you in the triumphal excursions of life.

What a life He’s given us! Imagine what He tells us in our opening verse; the same truth is expressed in John 15:16 where He says, *“Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.”* Jesus brought us into a life of power, fruitfulness and productivity. You’ve been chosen to bring forth lasting results.

This means He has made you efficient and effective; it’s one of the beautiful results of having the Holy Spirit in your life. Acts 1:8 AMPC says, *“But you shall receive power (ability, efficiency, and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you....”* This is the mind\-set with which you must approach the things you do. There’s increased grace for you.

The Lord is at work in you, both to will and to do of His good pleasure (Philippians 2:13\). He’s your sufficiency (2 Corinthians 3:5\); your “able\-to\-do\-it\-ness.” Every so often, declare that you’re marked for success and victory; you produce excellent results. This is the life God has given you; it’s a life of dominion, where you triumph gloriously, and honour Him with your works and fruits of righteousness.

## PERFECT COMPLETION March 23rd, 2021
![March 23rd, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-23-perfect-completion.jpg)

 ---

>***For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power (Colossians 2:9\-10\).***

The totality of divinity resides in Jesus Christ. When you see Jesus, you’re looking at the fullness of the God\-head; He’s the house of God in totality. Whether or not you agree with this doesn’t make any difference. You may think of Him and say He’s just a man, but He is Himself God!

“Fullness” in our theme scripture means “a completeness,” where nothing that’s necessary is out; where there’s no shortage; a perfect completion. And something most amazing about this is what we read in the latter part: “You’re complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power.”

When God looks at you, He sees everything you require for life and godliness in you. 2 Peter 1:3 says, *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”* This is the reality. Refuse to live with a lack mentality, as though there’re certain things you don’t have. Take off the limits.

Refuse to think that your completeness is in the government, your place of work or any human structure, organization or association. Your completeness is in Christ. You’re sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency. Become totally inundated with this consciousness.

Your confession, every so often, should be, “Father, I thank you, because I have all things! I’m complete in Christ; there’s no shortage in my life, but completeness.” Do this consciously and continually, and see your life blossom in righteousness, glory, wisdom and dominion of Christ, beyond your imagination. Hallelujah!

## RECEIVING FORGIVENESS IS AN ACT OF FAITH March 24th, 2021
![March 24th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-24-receiving-forgiveness-is-an-act-of-faith.jpg)

>***But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin (1 John 1:7\).***

Did you know that in the New Testament, God didn’t tell us to ask Him for forgiveness? Asking Him for forgiveness is like asking Him to save you. Think about it: If you do ask Him for forgiveness, when will you know He has answered?

Likewise, if you’re asking Him to save your soul, how will you know He has saved you? You’ll never know, because there’s nothing for Him to do about saving you that He hasn’t already done. It’s the same thing with forgiveness; you receive forgiveness; you don’t ask for it, because the blood of Jesus Christ was shed for the remission of your sins.

Some Christians are always asking God for forgiveness, and because they’re asking for something that’s been provided for, they don’t apply faith. You’re to receive forgiveness as an act of your faith. Afterwards, live above that situation through the power of the Holy Spirit and the Word.

You’ve already been washed and purged of your sins. Colossians 1:21\-22 says, *“And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight.”* This happened before you ever did anything right or wrong. Therefore, refuse to be sin\-conscious. You’re the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus; think and live righteousness.

Our opening text says if we walk in the light (the Word) as He is in the light, the blood of Jesus automatically cleanses us from all sin. Since this is true, you don’t have to be confessing your sins all the time. If you do something wrong, simply say, “Lord, I’m sorry for what I did; I receive forgiveness in Jesus’ Name”; and that’s it. You might ask, “Is it that simple?” Yes, it is. In Christ, we have automatic cleansing from sin; it’s part of the redemptive work of His blood in our behalf.

## DOMINATE YOUR WORLD March 25th, 2021
![March 25th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-25-dominate-your-world.jpg)

>***Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances (Colossians 2:20\).***

Our opening verse lets us know that we’re not subject to the principles of this world. Jesus dominated this world; He lived above the decadence of the world, the corruption and failure of His society. He lived far above, and beyond the government and systems of the day when He walked the earth. That’s the life He’s given us: one that’s not subject to, but lords over, the rudiments of this world.

He’s made us self\-sufficient, to function above and beyond the systems of this world. He said you’re in the world, but not of the world. That means you’re to dominate the systems and corrupting influences in today’s world. Many around you may be influenced, and provoked to compromise as a result of the deceit, corruption and wickedness in today’s world, but not you. You hail from God’s Kingdom, and your life is built on, and regulated by, His truth only.

Keep learning God’s Word. It’ll make you think and talk like Jesus. In John 16:33, He said, *“These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”* Have the same consciousness, because He overcame the world for you. Although He lived in a world plagued by gross darkness, deceit, economic hardships, sickness, oppression, deaths, disasters, etc., He had a victor’s mindset; the kind He expects you to function with.

When you face challenges, persecutions, distressing situations, turbulent times, trials, and temptations, be unruffled; because in Christ, you have overcome the world (1 John 4:4\). Let this consciousness reflect even in your prayer\-language. It makes no difference the challenges you face; when you pray, declare that in the Name of Jesus, you’ve overcome the world and its systems; its hatred, deceit, poverty, corruption, depression, falsehood and antichrist spirit. Hallelujah!

## CLOTHED IN GLORY March 26th, 2021

>***Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified (Romans 8:30\).***

How beautiful this is! We’ve been called, justified and glorified. Your life is full of glory. That’s the reason you can manifest the glory of God; it’s what He called you to do: *“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, \[God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light”* (1 Peter 2:9 AMPC).

Jesus said in John 17:22, *“And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.”* It’s important that you see yourself in this light. See yourself in, and as, the glory of God. When Adam and Eve disobeyed God in the Garden, their fall made them “see” that they were naked, and they became ashamed and afraid (Genesis 3:7\). When God called out to Adam in the Garden, he replied, *“…I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself”* (Genesis 3:10\).

The Lord’s response to him was, *“… Who told thee that thou wast naked...?”* (Genesis 3:11\). Adam saw his guilt and his shame, but that’s not what God wants you to see. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says*, “…if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”* The word “behold” is the Greek, “idou,” which is akin to the Hebrew word, “chazah.” It means to become spiritually aware, to see, and come alive to what you see. God wants you to see that you’re clothed with glory.

You were born to reign and manifest the glory of the Kingdom of God in the earth. Romans 8:19 says, *“For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.”* What a life! The same way Jesus came to the earth to express God and manifest His glory, you’ve been chosen of God to show forth His glory. You’ve been called to display God.

Read Colossians 1:27: *“To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”* This means glory has been realized. Therefore, SEE that you’ve been glorified. There’s no reason to be afraid or run from God. He’s taken away all guilt, reproach and shame from your life. He’s justified you. Now, He wants you to live as His glorified one—in His righteousness—as a champion. Hallelujah!

## MORE THAN LETTERS March 27th, 2021
![March 27th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/rhapsody-pastor-chris-day-27-more-than-letters.jpg)

 >***Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life (2 Corinthians 3:5-6).***

***Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God; Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life*** ***(2 Corinthians 3:5\-6\).***

The Word of God is more than letters; it’s spirit and life. The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Jesus said, *“It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life”* (John 6:63\). The Word builds, lifts, and transforms us from glory to glory. It’s the reason we emphasize meditating on the Word of God.

Meditation gets the Word into your spirit to become personal to you. As you study or listen to God’s Word, every time there’s a stirring in your spirit to speak forth words on the basis of what you’re studying or being taught, don’t suppress it. Speak forth. Each time you hear the Word, it’s God talking to you, but He always wants you to respond; that’s where the glory is!

Until you respond to God’s Word, it won’t produce any results. The Word will be mere letters to you. But the Word in your mouth is God talking; it’s the sword of the Spirit with which you cut the devil down and prevail over the adversities of life.

That transformation you desire in your finances, health and family is dependent on you, your response to the Word. Psalm 119:89 says, *“For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.”* His Word is settled in heaven, but you must settle it in your life through your affirmations of the Word. Hallelujah!

## SERVE THE LORD HEARTILY March 28th, 2021

>***And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines (1 Samuel 7:3\).***

We’re in the final moments of the last days, and it’s important that you’re focused on the Lord, serving Him heartily. The Bible says, *“You may as well know this too…that in the last days it is going to be very difficult to be a Christian”* (2 Timothy 3:1 TLB). Notice it doesn’t say, “It shall be impossible to be a Christian,” but “difficult.” So, it’s telling you to serve the Lord, regardless and independent of circumstances or persecution.

This isn’t the time to hide your Christian identity. Nothing whatsoever should be viable enough to take your attention away from the Lord and His Kingdom. Some are only fervent in serving the Lord when everything seems rosy, when their business is thriving and their finances are booming. But the true test comes when trouble strikes, and they get discouraged, and suddenly lose their fervour.

Some others only serve the Lord during times of challenges. But as soon as they have a miracle and are out of the dilemma, their commitment to the Lord immediately wanes. Something is wrong. Don’t let that happen to you. Be on fire for the Lord all the time. Be instant in season, and out of season.

Let nothing compete with, or inhibit your love for and commitment to Christ. The Bible says, *“Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord…”* (1 Corinthians 15:58\). When everything is going smoothly, be steadfast. And when it’s a period of adversity, serve the Lord heartily still. The Bible says, *“If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small”* (Proverbs 24:10\). Colossians 3:23 tells us, *“And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord….”* Praise God!

## IT’S SOONER THAN YOU THINK March 29th, 2021

>***Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book (Revelation 22:7\).***

Some have wondered why we preach the Gospel the way we do, all around the world, with so much urgency, fervency and passion. It’s because the Master gave us a mandate to evangelize the world before He comes back, leading men and women into righteousness.

In Mathew 28:19, He said, “*Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”* He gave us a message for the whole world about what He came to do in the earth, so that when He comes back, many will be prepared for Him, and go with Him. Hallelujah!

This is our inspiration and the urgency of the moment. We’re not just trying to get people excited about Christianity; it’s about Jesus Christ and His living message: He came to die for the whole world, and God raised Him from the dead. He ascended into heaven, and He’s alive today, and will come back any time from now.

How ready are you for His return? If you’re still wondering when, and how soon He is coming back, I can tell you this: it’s a lot sooner than many realize, judging from the timelines revealed to us in Scriptures.

All the things He told us will happen before He comes are happening exactly the way He said they would. There aren’t too many signs or events left to be fulfilled before the Master’s return. This is why we must keep preaching the Gospel, preparing men and women all over the world for the Rapture. He was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin, unto salvation (Hebrews 9:28\). Therefore, be prepared and ready for Him.

## THE SANCTIFIER IN YOU March 30th, 2021

>***But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption (1 Corinthians 1:30\).***

Besides being your wisdom, righteousness, and redemption (riddance), Christ is also your sanctification. The word sanctification used in our opening verse refers to the act or process of making holy or setting apart unto God for His eternal purpose. It’s translated from the Greek word “hagiasmos” which means, “a purifier.” So, the sanctifier has come to live in you.

Christ isn’t in you, trying to sanctify you; He has sanctified you, and continues to sanctify everything you do. He’s your separator; He has separated you from the rest of the world, from sin and evil, unto the glorious liberty of the sons of God. Hallelujah! Just as you’re required to activate wisdom by speaking wisdom, you’re also required to speak sanctification—words that cleanse and purify.

Recall what Paul said in 1 Timothy 4:4\-5: *“For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: **For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer**.”* You can purify or sanctify anything that belongs to you with the Word of God and prayer.

The Lord Jesus said in John 15:3, *“Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.”* Jesus has gone to heaven, but He lives in, and through you today. You’re the one bearing those wonderful sanctifying words today. Keep speaking words of blessings, to cleanse and sanctify your environment. As you speak, people are purified; they’re transformed from glory to another.

Hebrews 2:11 says, *“For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren.”* Christ the sanctifier is in you; He’s one with your spirit now (1 Corinthians 6:17\). And through you, He’s carrying out His ministry of sanctifying all things to Himself.

## THE NEW AND LIVING WAY March 31st, 2021

>***Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh (Hebrews 10:19\-20\).***

How awesome this is! Jesus opened for us a new and living way to the Father; He took off the veil to the Father’s presence and ushered us in. Blessed be God! Remember His words in John 14:6: *“…I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”*

Recall that in Genesis, Adam had sinned against God and was driven away from the presence of God, together with his wife, Eve. They’d been in fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden, but the Bible says God sent an angel with a flaming sword to stay at the gate of the Garden to disallow them from re\-entering the garden.

Suddenly, the rich fellowship man once had with God was over. That was the beginning of religion. Man began to do everything he could to get that divine presence again. All the religions of the world today are seeking the same thing: the divine presence. Man had no way to get back into that presence, until Jesus came. He made a startling statement which we read earlier. He said, *“...I am the WAY…no one comes to the Father, but by me!”* (John 14:6\).

This was what Adam needed. This was what the Patriarchs of the Old Testament all needed—the way to the Father’s presence. Jesus is that way. When He died on the Cross, the Bible says the thick veil that separated the temple from the Most Holy Place was torn in two, from top to bottom (Matthew 27:51\), making the presence of God accessible.

Today, there’s no veil, no separation anymore between you and the Father. You live in His presence, and the Bible says, “In His presence is fullness of joy and pleasures evermore” (Psalm 16:11\). If you haven’t found your way into His presence, if you’re not yet born again, there’s no need to wallow in sin, defeat and ignorance anymore. There’s no need searching for the way; Jesus is the Way. All you have to do is confess His lordship over your life, and your spirit will be recreated to begin an exciting life in God’s presence for eternity. Hallelujah!
