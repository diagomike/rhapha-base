>***Christ rules there above all heavenly rulers, authorities, powers, and lords; he has a title superior to all titles of authority in this world and in the next (Ephesians 1:21 GNB).***

Did you know that in the Millennium, they’d have to use the Name of Jesus? That’s the same Name we’ve already been given and have lived in, lived by, used and enjoyed for almost 2000 years. Glory to God! Sadly, many today still don’t understand the authority that’s vested in the Name of Jesus and the power of attorney given to us to use it. That’s why they’ve never fully enjoyed the benefits of it.

Jesus has a Name that’s superior to all titles of authority in this world and in the next. So, learn to use His Name. The Weymouth New Testament describes the transcendent greatness of His power, the infinitude of His might, and the supremacy and dominion of His Name, reign and glory both in this age and in the age to come: *“…that you may know…the transcendent greatness of His power…as seen in the working of His infinite might when He displayed it in Christ by raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His own right hand in the heavenly realms, high above all other government and authority and power and dominion, and every title of sovereignty used either in this Age or in the Age to come”* (Ephesians 1:18\-21 WNT).

The most beautiful part is that His authority, His rulership, reign and dominion is for the benefit of the Church. He is all that He is—His Name wields all the power that it wields—for our benefit. Ephesians 1:22 NLT says, *“...God has put all things under the authority of Christ, and he gave him this authority for the benefit of the church.”*

Never live as a victim. Don’t live an ordinary life. Use the Name of Jesus. He said, *“All authority is given unto me in heaven and in earth.”* Then on the basis of that authority, He said, *“Go ye therefore…”* (Matthew 28:19\). Devils, angels, life, death, hell, the world, circumstances, living and non\-living things hear and respond to you in His Name. Therefore, be conscious of the transcendent greatness of His Name; live and do all things in His Name.

## AN ENDLESS ERA OF GLORY September 2nd, 2021

>***Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen (Ephesians 3:20\-21\).***

The Greek word translated “ages” in the verse above is “genea” and it means generations; “all ages” here refers to all the generations of the Church. Then it goes further to say, “world without end,” meaning “an endless era.” When Christ rose from the dead and sent the Holy Spirit to begin the Church, we began an endless era; the era of the Church that’ll never end!

Satan only takes over this world after we’ve been raptured. We’ll be with the Lord for seven years (timeline on earth), and then come back with Him to this earth to reign and rule with Him. The power and glory of God that we see in Christ today isn’t about to come to an end. We’re into something that knows no end; the glory only goes on. The Bible says, *“But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day”* (Proverbs 4:18\). This is what the world doesn’t understand. No one can ever bring down the Church of Jesus Christ.

When Satan tries to incite his demons against the Church or against the work of God, all that’s necessary is for any child of God who’s full of faith and the Holy Ghost to rise up and exercise dominion. Glory to God! There’s *“a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory”* waiting for us (2 Corinthians 4:17\). This is why you can be full of joy every day, because your life can only be ever more glorious. Hallelujah!

## AN OUTWARD SHOW OF AN INNER TRUTH September 3rd, 2021

>***Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD (Psalm 134:2\).***

Have you ever wondered why oftentimes, people look towards the sky when we say, “Let us pray?” It’s actually an outward show of an inner truth, of something spiritual, because the Father isn’t in the sky but inside us; He lives in you. So, don’t get confused by the motions and outward expressions and gesticulations.

Psalm 141:2 says, *“Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.”* When David, a prophet of God, wrote this, he was well acquainted with the priesthood ministry of the Old Testament in the old tabernacle. He spoke prophetically and likened the evening sacrifice in the Old Testament to the lifting of our hands in worship today.

Also, the Bible says, *“Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD”* (Psalm 134:2\). The Apostle Paul reiterated the same thing; he understood the importance of lifting our hands in worship when he said by the Spirit, *“I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting”*(1 Timothy 2:8\).

When your hands are lifted up in worship, you’re affirming that the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made you free from death and the law of sin; you’re affirming your liberty, joy, access into God’s presence and your oneness with Him. You’re not trying to “reach out” to God as though He were far away; He’s in you, you’re in Him; and you know it. Blessed be God!

## ALWAYS IN CHARGE September 4th, 2021
![September 4th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/sept-day-4-always-in-charge-b.jpg)

>***In your patience possess ye your souls (Luke 21:19\).***

The words above are the words of Jesus, and He’s telling you to always be in control while you wait; it’s an attitude of victory. When you’re confident in the Lord, in His ability and power at work in and through you, nothing shakes you.

Perhaps you suddenly received news that your spouse, child or a loved one has been rushed to the theatre for an emergency procedure. Instead of being rattled, be in charge and in control. Don’t start pacing the floor, edgy about the situation: relax. Take charge!

Never panic or be overwhelmed with fear when you face dire circumstances or opposition; maintain your composure and use your authority in Christ. Pray in rest, for He’s brought us into His rest. Take a hold of God’s Word, knowing who you are and your authority in Christ, and then issue commands. Tame the situation.

The challenges you face are “bread” for you; they’re the springboard to your next and higher level of glory. That’s why the Bible says, “Count it all joy when you go through diverse tests” (James 1:2\). 2 Corinthians 4:17\-18 calls the adversities you face “light afflictions,” transient and short\-lived troubles—they produce for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.

There’s nothing in this world that should get you ruffled or agitated. Meditate on these words of Jesus in John 16:33 AMPC: *“I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have \[perfect] peace and confidence. In the world you have tribulation and trials and distress and frustration; but be of good cheer \[take courage; be confident, certain, undaunted]! For I have overcome the world. \[I have deprived it of power to harm you and have conquered it for you].”*

## IT’S ABOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE September 5th, 2021
![September 5th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/sept-day-5-its-about-your-knowledge-b-new.jpg)

>***They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea. (Isaiah 11:9 NIV).***

In Acts 27\-28, Luke reports an inspiring incident with Paul while on a journey to Rome. The ship ferrying them and some two hundred and seventy\-four others was caught in a violent storm. Thankfully, all aboard swam safely to shore on the island of Malta. The people who lived there showed them great kindness, and made a fire, and called them all to warm themselves. As Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out of the heat and fastened itself to his hand.

When the natives saw the creature hanging from Paul’s hand, they said to one another, “No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live” (Acts 28:4 NKJV). While the onlookers expected Paul to swell and suddenly drop dead as a result of the venom, he simply shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. They concluded that he was a god.

What made Paul so different? He was eternal life\-conscious. He knew that the one who has the Son of God has eternal life: *“…the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord”* (Romans 6:23\). The one who has eternal life can’t be poisoned. Jesus said so in Mark 16:18: *“…if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them....”*

This is the life that He’s given us, but many don’t know it. The Bible says through knowledge shall the just be delivered into their inheritance. So, you see, it works by knowledge! It’s about your knowledge of the immortal and incorruptible life of Christ that’s at work in you. No wonder John said, *“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life…”* (1 John 5:13\).

## THE AUTHORITY OF HIS NAME September 6th, 2021
![September 6th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/september-day-6-the-authority-of-his-name.jpg)

>***Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth (Philippians 2:9\-10\).***

The scripture above is definitive about the authority of Jesus. This is different from the character or identity of His Name. For example, Jesus passed by many sick people who didn’t take advantage of His identity to receive healing when He walked the earth. In fact, the Bible says He came to a place where there were many impotent folks, He healed one person and went away from there (Read John 5:1\-15\). Yet He had His identity, had His character. So, in using His Name, it’s about His authority.

You’re not even required to squeeze up faith to use His Name. His Name is an instrument and a gift given to you to use. And the authority of His Name is over things, beings, and anything that can be identified. Anyone of us can use that Name and the power in it. John 14:12\-14 says, *“Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.”*

He gave us the power of attorney—the legal right to act in His stead—to use His Name. So, don’t cheat yourself; use His Name. Use it against Satan, the forces of darkness and circumstances, and they’ll respond to you as they would to Jesus.

## YOU’RE THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE September 7th, 2021

>***The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise (Proverbs 11:30\).***

What God cares about the most in the earth is the souls of men. The Bible says in John 3:16, *“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”* He loved the world of humans, not things; we’re the object of His love. Each one of us is more important to Him than the planets and galaxies.

He’s got angels that supervise the galaxies, and angels appointed over other matters. But the angels with the most honourable job are the ones appointed over people, over the souls for whom Jesus died. When you understand this as a Christian, especially as one who heads a cell or care\-group or fellowship in the local church, your premium will be on people.

You might say, “I only have three people in my fellowship!” But as small as that number might seem, you’re more important to God than the one who’s put in charge of the environment and all the infrastructure in any particular planet or continent. A cell leader in the house of God has more value in God’s book of honours than one who’s not born again but might be politically in charge of a whole nation.

Read the words of Jesus in Mark 8:36\-37: *“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?”* This means the whole world—all of the cosmos—doesn’t compare to the value of one soul. The value of a soul is the blood of Jesus.

If you were the only person on the face of the earth, Jesus would have still come to die for you. He didn’t come because we were many; He came because we were valuable to God. That’s why God isn’t willing that anyone should perish.

If anyone goes to hell, it isn’t because God wanted him or her to go to hell; He’s done everything to stop men from going to hell, and He’ll do everything to stop them. The only thing is, He can’t decide for you, because He gave you a very important gift: the ability to make decisions; the right to choose. And in His love, He went ahead to tell you what to choose: life in Christ (1 John 5:11\).

## YOUR LIFE IS SHAPED BY YOUR THOUGHTS September 8th, 2021

>***Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life (Proverbs 4:23\).***

It’s not every thought that comes to you that is from God. The only way you know the source of your thoughts is through the light of God’s Word, and the ministry of the Holy Spirit. It’s very important what you think about, and how you think, because your life is shaped by your thoughts. Our theme verse in the Good News translations says, *“Be careful how you think; your life is shaped by your thoughts.”*

Screen and filter your thoughts; mount garrison over your heart, because out of your heart are the issues of life! You have to be the policeman of your heart; take charge of your heart. Don’t allow every thought. Allow only God’s thoughts, righteous thoughts and thoughts of love in Christ Jesus.

The Bible specifically lets us know the kind of thoughts to allow: *“Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things”* (Philippians 4:8\). You’re the character of your thoughts. What you think about, you become. The Lord Jesus actually related this in His teachings in a most enlightening way. He said, *“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart”* (Matthew 5:27\-28\).

Your thoughts can deliver to you a glorious life or keep you on the sidewalk of life. If you’d let the Word dominate your thinking, it’ll create the right thoughts in you and give you the right mindset. You’d think victory, success, dominion and possibilities only.

Romans 12:2 says, *“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind….”* When your thoughts are consistent with the Word, your life will be a reflection of His glory, for the glory is in the Word. So, discipline your mind to accept only the right thoughts.

Dear Father, I consciously think the right thoughts and meditate only on things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of a good report, virtuous and praiseworthy.

## WE BELIEVE AND SPEAK September 9th, 2021
![September 9th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/sept-day-9-we-believe-and-speak.jpg)

>***We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak (2 Corinthians 4:13\).***

Many read our opening verse as though we speak so that we will believe, but it’s not so. The confessions of the Word that we make aren’t so that we can finally believe what we’re saying. Read what it says: *“We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.”* That’s the principle of the spirit of faith: Faith works from inside out, not the other way round.

We speak because we have believed. In fact, the opening verse actually reads, “We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, **I have faith**, therefore have I spoken; **we also have faith**, and therefore speak.” We speak according to our faith. When I speak, it’s my faith talking.

It brings to mind the story in Matthew 9 of the two blind men that Jesus healed. They cried out, “Thou Son of David, have mercy on us.” Jesus asked them, “Do you really believe I can do this?” They said, “Yes, Master!” Then He touched their eyes and said, *“… According to your faith be it unto you”* (Matthew 9:29\). The Bible says, “And their eyes were opened…” (Matthew 9:30\). Why? It’s because they had faith and they vocalized it.

Faith is expressed primarily through words, and the Bible lets us know that we all have faith. If we didn’t have faith, it would have been a problem, but we have it; He gave it to us as Paul said in Romans 12:3, *“For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you…according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.”* That’s the faith with which you believed in Jesus Christ, and that faith speaks.

Tame and rule the world; reign over circumstances through your faith proclamations. Don’t cry because of any problem; don’t gripe over anything; speak words of faith. Perhaps you’ve been experiencing challenges in your job or business; speak and effect a change! Jesus said you shall have what you say (Mark 11:23\). Your blessing is in your mouth. Declare victory only and always, and that’ll be your experience.

>***Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend (Proverbs 27:17\)***

The Message translation of the theme verse says, *“You use steel to sharpen steel, and one friend sharpens another”* (Proverbs 27:17\). Perhaps you’re concerned that your close friends, or others in your church, fellowship, cell or care\-group aren’t as passionate about spiritual growth and God’s Word as they should be. You could even be the leader of such a group. The first place to begin is to check yourself, because hunger begets hunger. As the leader of the group, how rapacious is your appetite for the Word? How passionate are you about spiritual things?

Passion is palpable and infectious. What you’re hungry or passionate about, soon enough, will rub off on those around you. Haven’t you noticed that oftentimes, when people yawn, those around them may start yawning as well? Or once someone says, “I’m hungry”; others who are present and may also not have eaten, immediately become conscious of hunger. 

If you have a ravenous appetite for God’s Word, those around you would cultivate the same hunger soon enough. Therefore, be the first to be on fire. Be the example of what you want to see in those you lead. Lead by example. For example, don’t just encourage them to pray; be a praying person yourself.

But if a pastor isn’t prayerful, and he’s calling for prayer meetings, he may be wasting his time, because those gatherings would be void of the Spirit. Copy Jesus, His devotion to the Scriptures, and to prayer. At a tender age, the Bible says He was in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening, and asking them questions. Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and His answers (Luke 2:41\-47\). 

The Bible also tells us, *“And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed”* (Mark 1:35\). In another instance,  *“…he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God”* (Luke 6:12\). So, it’s got to begin with you. Spiritual or numerical growth isn’t a mystery, a miracle or an accident. It’s the application of revealed principles and means.

## MAKING A LASTING IMPACT September 11th, 2021

>***How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (Acts 10:38\).***

It’s not how long you live; it’s the impact you make that matters, and Jesus was a typical example of that. He didn’t have a long life on earth, but He impacted the world tremendously. Luke 3:23 NLT says, *“Jesus was about thirty years old when he began his public ministry....”* At thirty\-three, He was crucified. He ministered for just three years and changed the whole world.

Throughout history, no single individual has made or could ever make the kind of impact on the whole world as Jesus. Even the world’s dating system—back and forth—is referenced to Him. The period of His birth is used as the dividing point of world history: B.C (Before Christ) and A.D (anno Domini). Amazing!

He lived and manifested the glory of God in His days on earth. He walked on water, talked to the wind and the waves, unstopped deaf ears, opened blind eyes, healed lame legs, restored maimed limbs, and raised the dead. He died and resurrected and made salvation possible for humanity.

The beautiful thing is that He did all that He did through the power of the Holy Spirit. In John 14:10, He said, *“…the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works”*; that’s the Holy Spirit. In John 8:38, He said, *“I speak that which I have seen with my Father….”* Jesus walked in union with the Father in an extraordinary way. He did nothing without the power of the Holy Spirit.

We have the same ability within us to function likewise, because the same Holy Spirit that was the power and essence of Jesus lives in us today. He said in John 20:21, *“…as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.”* This means you have His authority; therefore, let those words propel you to make a lasting impact in your world. You can do what He did and be impactful through the power of the Holy Spirit.

>***Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations (Jeremiah 1:5\).***

There’re those who are hesitant to let God have His way in their lives. They think He’ll change their “lofty” dreams and ambitions. They’ve painted the picture of what they want in life and the direction they want to go, and they think if they let God have His way, He may change their destiny and lead them to become something they don’t want to be. That’s a terrible mistake.

The Lord knows better and loves you more than you love yourself. Therefore, trust Him with your life. He’s more ambitious for your success than you could ever be. All He’s ever wanted is the best for you. What joy thrilled my soul when I discovered that the Lord was more ambitious for my success than I could ever be, and that He loved and cared for me more than I could ever imagine! He created the whole world and He knows everything about me and about my future. Therefore, it was easy to trust Him and follow the path that He’s prepared for me.

Every so often, I’d say, “Lord, you know exactly what to do with someone like me. You’re experienced in dealing with all kinds of people, so you know exactly what to do with my life.” When you’re conscious of this, you’d become bold, sharp, focused and unafraid; you’d know that your future is secure in Him.

Nothing could be more fulfilling and gratifying than knowing and following God’s plan for your life. Stop holding on to some dream, idea or aspirations that aren’t in line with God’s purpose for your life. He’s got you covered; so, let Him guide you.

## WORD-BASED SONGS September 13th, 2021
![September 13th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/sept-day-13-word-based-songs.jpg)

>***Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? (1 Corinthians 3:16\).***

Have you ever heard some Christians sing, “Holy Spirit, come down; rain down on us.” Such a song is inconsistent with truth, because the Holy Spirit already came on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1\-3\) and lives in you today. It’s also no use singing, “Come live in me Holy Spirit.” It’s clear from our opening scripture that He dwells in you: *“Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?”* (1 Corinthians 3:16\).

Some even get emotional and cry, singing, “Fill me, O Lord!” But the Word never said God is going to fill you. Paul, by the Spirit, said in Ephesians 5:18, *“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.”* It’s your responsibility to be filled with the Spirit. He told you to do it. Therefore, no matter how much you sing and cry to the Lord to fill you, you’ll never be filled, because the Word already shows how to get yourself filled with the Spirit.

Singing the wrong songs creates unbelief and deepens ignorance. Therefore, when you sing, listen to the words; sing songs that are founded on the truth of God’s Word in the Gospel of Christ. Our worship, praise and thanksgiving or even songs of edification must be correctly delivered in words consistent with the New Testament of Christ. It’s not about singing your favourite song or the one that gives you goose bumps; it’s about singing scriptural songs of the present truth.

## CUSTODIANS OF ETERNAL BLESSINGS September 14th, 2021

>***…I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing (Genesis 12:2\).***

The Christian is blessed in all things. He’s blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. In Genesis 12:2, God didn’t say to Abraham, “I will bless you and make you ‘lucky’”; rather, He said, *“…I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.”* This is what you need: the consciousness that you’re blessed and are a blessing! 

You’re empowered to be successful; the ability to prosper in all things has been invoked in your life; it’s inherent in you and works all the time. Everywhere you go, there’s favour. Your steps are always ordered of the Lord; you don’t go anywhere by chance, and you don’t go anywhere alone, for He’s in you and with you always. This is the heritage of the seed of Abraham. It worked for the physical descendants of Abraham— Isaac and Jacob; they were blessed in all things and bequeathed the same blessings to their generations.

It’s even better with us today; the Bible says, *“And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise”* (Galatians 3:29\). Ours is a better covenant, established upon better promises (Hebrews 8:6\); promises that have all been fulfilled in Christ. You ought to know like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that you’re blessed, and the custodian of blessings. Make this your consciousness and confession.

## TAKE CARE OF OTHERS September 15th, 2021

>***Therefore encourage (admonish, exhort) one another and edify (strengthen and build up) one another, just as you are doing (1 Thessalonians 5:11 AMPC).***

There’re Christians who got offended and almost gave up the faith because someone in their local church mistreated or disappointed them. That’s wrong. God didn’t tell us everyone in the church will like us, treat us well and always be helpful to us. But He told you to like others, treat them well, and always be willing to help. So, it begins with YOU!

Don’t let the reason you’re the member of any particular church or group in church be that you’re looking for someone to help you; rather, develop a desire to render service, to help others. Acts 20:35 tells us that it’s more blessed to give than to receive. 

If you felt ignored, rejected and uncared for, that should let you know what some others might be feeling too. So, take up the responsibility and look out for those in a similar situation and encourage and strengthen them. That’s Christian ministry; it’s one of the beautiful blessings and privileges you get from being a member of a local church. The church—the local church—has a ministry, and God wants you to be a vital member.

There’s no one on earth who has no family; everyone belongs in a family. If you find that you’re the only one you know in your entire family, reach out and help someone else who’s lonely, and make them part of your family. You should never be alone. Don’t live for yourself only. Be responsible for others, just as there’re leaders over you who are responsible for you.

## THE WORD ON YOUR LIPS September 16th, 2021

>***Through faith we understand that the WORLDS were FRAMED by the WORD of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear (Hebrews 11:3\).***

There’re three important words to note in our theme verse; they are framed, words, and world. The word “framed” is translated from the Greek “katartizo”, and it means to restore or mend. “Worlds” is translated from the Greek “aion” which means “course of life”; the structure and administration or seasons and times of one’s life on earth.

“Word,” on the other hand, is translated from the Greek word “rhema,” and it means the spoken and active word to a specific person, for a specific purpose, at a specific time. From the foregoing, we observe that the “aions” were framed, mended, restored by the Word (rhema) of God.

The expression “rhema of God” as you find in the New Testament is never applied to God talking by Himself, but to God putting His Word in man’s heart for man to speak. So, our theme verse doesn’t mean that God was “framing the aions”; it means that men framed their worlds—courses of life— by using the Word of God; they uttered “rhema.”

 With “rhema” you give shape, structure and beauty to your world, to your life; you construct the conditions—what your world and life should be like— with the Word on your lips. What’s your life like today? Do you want a life of ever\-increasing grace, glory and dominion? The key is your mouth!

It makes no difference what obtains presently in your “aion”; you can mend what needs mending; you can restore what needs restoration; you can fix anything that’s been ruined. You can quell terror and put a halt to the malicious destructions and havoc the devil seeks to wreak in your world, life, family, city or country, or in the lives of your loved ones, by uttering the Word of God that your spirit has taken a hold of. 

Use the Word. Put it on your lips and use it to keep the adversary in his place. Use it to frame the course of your life to be consistent with God’s plan and purpose for your life. Hallelujah!

## FAITH TALKS September 17th, 2021
![September 17th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/sept-day-17-faith-talks.jpg)

 ---

>***We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak (2 Corinthians 4:13\).***

What a beautiful and inspiring description we have in Hebrews 11 of those in faith’s hall of fame. The Bible says these men and women tamed and framed their worlds, their eras, by faith. Abel’s offering to God, for example, was an act of faith: *“By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh”* (Hebrews 11:4\).

Abel wasn’t just carrying out some ceremony with his mouth shut, no! He said some things, such that even in death, his blood still speaks. What exactly was his confession? It most certainly would have been in sync with what the other patriarchs confessed. The Bible says they confessed that they were strangers in the world: *“These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth”* (Hebrews 11:13\).

The key thing is that they spoke faith words. That helps us learn how they created and constructed their times. They talked their future; they said what was going to happen, and did all that they did, by faith. It’s the same spirit of faith at work in us today. We believe, and therefore speak.

Faith is the noun of believing; believing is a verb. Your faith is demonstrated in words that propel you to action. You can’t believe and be quiet. Even in the negative realm—the satanic realm—they use the same principle because it’s a spiritual principle. If they don’t say it, they know it’ll not happen.

Isn’t that what Jesus said in Mark 11:23? He said you shall have what you say: *“For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.”* Declare faith\-filled words and rule your world.

## INHABITANTS OF THE HEAVENLY JERUSALEM September 18th, 2021

>***Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined (Psalm 50:2\).***

Paul, in his letter to the Galatian Christians, referenced the allegory of Sarah and Hagar (Galatians 4\). Through the two women, Abraham had two sons: Ishmael and Isaac. Sarah and Hagar represented two covenants. Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, and is a figure of the present city of Jerusalem in the middle East, which the Bible says is in slavery with all its people (Galatians 4:25\).

Then, there’s the Jerusalem that is above: *“But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all”* (Galatians 4:26\). How beautiful! Read the 30th to 31st verses: *“Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.”*

The Jerusalem that is above is the mother of us all; that’s the one to which we belong; we’re there now! Hebrews 12:22 tells us, *“But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem....”* In Isaiah 60:14 (MSG), Zion refers figuratively to Israel as the people of God: *“The descendants of your oppressor will come bowing and scraping to you. All who looked down at you in contempt will lick your boots. They’ll confer a title on you: City of GOD, Zion of The Holy of Israel.”*

But today, in the New Testament, Zion refers to God’s spiritual Kingdom, which we’re a part of. Hebrews 12:18,22\-23 (MSG) says, *“Unlike your ancestors, you didn’t come to Mount Sinai\-\-all that volcanic blaze and earthshaking rumble—…No, that’s not your experience at all. You’ve come to Mount Zion the city where the living God resides. The invisible Jerusalem is populated by throngs of festive angels and Christian citizens. It is the city where God is Judge, with judgments that make us just.”* So, in the mind of God, we live in Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, NOW, in the same way that the natural born Jews live in Jerusalem that’s in the Middle East. Hallelujah!

## BORN OF THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT September 19th, 2021

>***And just as we have borne the image \[of the man] of dust, so shall we and so let us also bear the image \[of the Man] of heaven (1 Corinthians 15:49 AMPC).***

Every human person born into this world comes with the natural human life. That life, however, is corruptible; it’s mortal, subject to sickness, disease and death. This was the life and nature of the first Adam and all those born after him—unregenerate men.

1 Corinthians 15:47–48 says, *“The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.”* Notice the tenses; it says “… as is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy,” and that’s absolutely right. That’s why Jesus, in His communication with Nicodemus, said to him, “You must be born again” (John 3:7\).

When you’re born again, you’re born after the Lord from heaven. So, as Christians, we have the divine life, we have the God\-nature NOW. The one who’s yet to receive this God\-life is “earthy” and susceptible to the depravities and negativities of this world. He or she is subject to the elements and systems of this world and snowed\-under by their corrupting influences.

But thanks be unto God! Your ties with the first Adam have been severed completely and forever. Christ is your root and heritage; you hail from God: *“Ye are of God little children…”* (1 John 4:4\). Whereas death works in the unregenerate man, you’re of the life\-giving Spirit: *“And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit”* (1 Corinthians 15:45\). Life works in you. Glory to God!

>***Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God... (1 John 3:1\).***

Some people ask, “Do we really have the same quality of life as our heavenly Father right now in the earth or is it something that’ll happen when we get to heaven?” Some get confused by their misunderstanding of what the Apostle Paul said in 1 Corinthians 15:52: *“…and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”*

First, it’s important to understand that your real life—your spirit—came from the Word. So, beyond the physical frame, you have in you the life and nature of God, the life of the Word. God’s Word is seed (Luke 8:11\), and the seed is the life\-carrying faculty of a living thing. The life of God is transferred or transmuted through His Word, which is His seed.

For example, when He said to the Virgin Mary, “You shall conceive and give birth to a son,” the Word He spoke became Jesus. Through the agency of that same Word, He gave birth to us as new creatures: *“Being born again, not of corruptible **seed**, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”* (1 Peter 1:23\).

The underlined word “seed,” is translated from the Greek word “sperma” from where the English word “sperm” is derived. The Bible says, “Of His own will begat He us by the Word (seed) of truth that we should be the first and the best of His creatures” (James 1:18\). This is how we became sons and daughters of God, with the same quality of life as our heavenly Father.

Our opening verse says, *“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God….”* Right now, we’re the vital sons of God in truth, because we’re actually born of Him. In the next verse, John emphasizes it: *“Beloved, now are we the sons of God…”* (1 John 3:2\). On the outside we may not look so great, but in our spirits we’re absolutely like Him, being born of Him. He brought us into His realm, His class of being. No wonder 1 John 4:17 says, *“…as he is, so are we in this world.”*

## A SPECIAL ATMOSPHERE September 21st, 2021

>***And the Lord will create over the whole site, over every dwelling place of Mount Zion and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy (a defense of divine love and protection) (Isaiah 4:5 AMPC).***

Glory to God! The theme verse today foretells of a phenomenon previously experienced by Israel, a reference to the pillar of a cloud and of fire which attended them in their exodus from Egypt. They were under God’s divine protection, provision, love and care. Exodus 13:21\-22 says, *“And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire….”*

Even though they were in the desert, in that terrible arid land, they weren’t scorched by the sun. Then at night, they were kept warm by a pillar of fire. Thus, day or night—they were under a special atmosphere. That’s amazing! This didn’t happen for one day, three days, a few months or a year; it was for forty long years. God protected them!

Read the psalmist’s account of this in Psalm 105:37 (AMPC): *“He brought \[Israel] forth also with silver and gold, and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.”* Deuteronomy 29:5 (NKJV) says, *“And I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet....”* This is extraordinary; they were in God’s presence and He fed and nurtured them.

Nehemiah 9:20\-21 (GNB) says, *“In your goodness you told them what they should do; you fed them manna and gave them water to drink. Through forty years in the desert you provided all that they needed; their clothing never wore out, and their feet were not swollen with pain.”* He hasn’t changed. The same God takes care of you and nurtures you today. His presence in, with, and about you today makes you an oasis of love and grace in a troubled world.

You live in His presence, in a divine atmosphere of joy, bliss and glory, where you’re absolutely independent of circumstances. Be mindful of this always. There could be chaos or anarchy everywhere, but in Him you’re at peace and in safety. Hallelujah!

## LIVE IN AND FROM CHRIST September 22nd, 2021

>***For in Him we live and move and have our being; as even some of your \[own] poets have said, For we are also His offspring (Acts 17:28 AMPC).***

Ephesians 2:4\-6 says, *“But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.”* When Jesus was raised from the dead, we were raised together with Him and made to sit together with Him in heavenly places.

Therefore, we’re seated with Christ right now, at home in Him and with Him. No wonder we’re told, *“…whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him”* (Colossians 3:17\). Then Colossians 2:6 says, *“As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him.”*

Now that we’re in Him, seated together with Him, we must live by and through Him. We must live and walk in the Name of Jesus. How do you live and walk in His Name? It evidently conveys to you that His Name is a place, an environment. When you were born again, you were born into Christ; you were immersed, baptized into Christ; therefore, you’re in Christ.

Understand the difference between “you in Christ” and “Christ in you.” “Christ in you” is about your life, your glory. “You in Christ” is about your environment, where you live. So now that you’re in this environment, live therein. Transact your affairs in, and from, Christ twenty\-four hours a day! Hallelujah!

## THE BLESSING OF THE NEW TESTAMENT September 23rd, 2021

>***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27\).***

If you’ve ever been to Israel and the Old City of Jerusalem, you’d have heard of or visited the Western Wall, or Wailing Wall. It’s one of the most significant historic sites for the Jewish people. While thousands of people from different nationalities throng the Wailing Wall every year to relish this archeological masterpiece, others religiously journey there to say or recite prayers, hoping their prayers will be answered faster at this site.

No doubt, the Wailing Wall is an iconic religious site, but God isn’t more there than He is in you. Some are carried away by the idea that if they pray at, let’s say a “prayer mountain,” a forest, or the Wailing Wall, God will hear them more. If that were true, Jesus would have taught about it; He’d have instructed us to pray at the Wailing Wall, but He didn’t.

The Apostles would have said so too, but they didn’t. In fact, Jesus said, *“…believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father…But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him”* (John 4:21\-23\). The inspiration and blessing of the New Testament is in your heart; it’s with you everywhere.

The Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, reveals the truth about Christianity—the mystery that was hidden from ages and from generations. That mystery is “Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:26\-27\). This is God’s vision; that’s the reason for the New Testament. Everything you’d ever need in life is in Christ, and Christ is in you; to have Christ is to have everything.

Henceforth, look into your heart, for that’s where all the answer is. Christ resides in your heart. You’ve already been blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ (Ephesians 1:3\). The totality of the character and nature of the man Jesus, all that He represents—His life, power, wisdom, majesty, glory and grace—are all tabernacled in you. This is the blessing of the New Testament. Praise God!

## WORSHIP HIM ANYWHERE…ANYTIME September 24th, 2021

>***And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it (Revelation 21:22\).***

In the Old Testament, the Israelites worshiped God in a temple, but in the beautiful revelation of the New Jerusalem, the Apostle John gushes in admiration about how the city of God could exist without a temple. One would have expected to see a temple, just as it was in Old Testament days. But this New Jerusalem, however, doesn’t need a temple because the entire city is the dwelling place of Almighty God and the Lamb. That’s remarkable!

In other words, His presence is everywhere in that city; the whole thing has become His temple. That brings to mind what Jesus said as He engaged a woman in Sychar, a Samaritan village. The woman had said, *“Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship”* (John 4:20 NKJV). But then, Jesus replied, *“…the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him”* (John 4:23\). Why? It’s because in the spirit, they’d experience the presence of God anywhere, and everywhere.

Today, everywhere you go, you carry His presence in you, and with you. Now you can better understand the words of the Apostle Paul in Acts 17:28: *“For in him we live, and move, and have our being….”* We’re not apart or separate from Him. We don’t seek or look for Him; we’re in Him and with Him, and He’s in us, with us and about us! Wherever you are, wherever you go, you live and move in Him.

This same Apostle said in Romans 1:9, *“For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers.”* Can you see how Paul did it? He served God with his “spirit” in the Gospel of His Son. The word “serve” actually refers to “worship.” That’s why we can worship Him anywhere, and at any time. 

This is different from the Old Testament where they had to go to the right place to offer the right sacrifice; if they didn’t go to the right place, it was not accepted. In fact, when they set up a new temple in Samaria, God was angry, because according to His instruction, the temple was only to be in Jerusalem. But in Christ Jesus, we worship God with our spirits. Hallelujah!

Even now, lift your hands in worship to the Lord and offer Him a sacrifice of sweet\-smelling savour. From where you are, worship the Father from your spirit and according to His Word.

## WHEN GOD SPEAKS IN PROPHECY… September 25th, 2021
![September 25th, 2021](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/sept-day-25-when-god-speaks-in-prophecy-b.jpg)

>***If what the prophet spoke in GOD’s name doesn’t happen, then obviously GOD wasn’t behind it; the prophet made it up. Forget about him (Deuteronomy 18:22 MSG).***

When God gives a prophetic word, it’ll come to pass whether or not you believe it. Think about this: Jesus said to Simon Peter, *“...Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice”* (Matthew 26:34\). Did Peter believe? No! In fact, he insisted, *“Even if I must die with You, I will not deny or disown You...”* (Matthew 26:35 AMPC).

But did the words of Jesus come to pass? Yes! Peter denied Jesus and disowned Him. In fact, on a certain occasion, Peter cursed and swore that he didn’t know Jesus. How about the story of Judas? When Jesus told His disciples one of them would betray Him, Judas Iscariot didn’t accept what Jesus said about him neither was he happy about it.

Then the Bible tells us in Luke 22:3 that an evil spirit entered into Judas Iscariot. When that happened, he walked out of where Jesus and the disciples were, went to the Chief Priests to conclude arrangements to betray Jesus. Look through the Scriptures, you’ll find several prophetic words to kings, and prophecies to nations; they didn’t have to believe those prophetic words, but the words came to pass nonetheless.

However, when you believe the prophetic word, you’ll be blessed; more so, when the word of prophecy concerns you for your benefit. For example, when Mary received the prophetic words about the birth of Jesus, she said, *“...Be it unto me, according to thy Word...”* (Luke 1:38\).

Mary believed and gave birth to the Lord Jesus Christ (Luke 2:6\-7\) according to prophecy. The Bible says, *“And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord”* (Luke 1:45\). When you believe, those words of blessings come to pass in your life. The difference, however, is that when God speaks prophetically about your nation, about your time, your course of life, whether or not you believe it, it’s going to happen anyway. So, what you do is to learn the Word; understand the Word; find and take your place in that prophetic word, and you’ll be victorious always.

## MAKE THINGS RIGHT WITH THE PROPHETIC WORD September 26th, 2021

***You have heard \[these things foretold], now you see this fulfillment. And will you not bear witness to it? I show you specified new things from this time forth, even hidden things \[kept in reserve] which you have not known (Isaiah 48:6 AMPC).***

When you read our opening scripture further into the 7th verse, you’d observe that the “specified new things” Isaiah spoke of were created by the prophetic word: *“They are created now \[called into being by the prophetic word]…”* (Isaiah 48:7 AMPC).

The prophetic word is the “rhema” of God that’s put in your mouth, words that you speak for God. These are utterances the Lord gives you by His Spirit; they come from the inner recesses of your spirit. Remember, your spirit was created by the Word of God, and the Word lives in you (1 Peter 1:23\).

Also, the Word, the “logos” of God that dwells inside you sees, understands and knows all things: *“For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do”* (Hebrews 4:12\-13\). How then do you bring these things that the Word sees, understands and knows, to pass? It’s by the prophetic words you utter by the Holy Spirit that’s in you.

The Bible says, *“And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy…”* (Acts 2:17\). This doesn’t only apply to your personal life; you can direct the very course of this world by the prophetic word. For example, when the governments of nations, leaders of industries, and others gang up against the Church, take up words from the Spirit and utter them in faith. We’re not hamstrung; we know what to do to alter events and cause things to align with God’s perfect will! He sent us as His witnesses and as His ministers.

God has put His Word in our hearts and in our mouths and sent us as saviours to our world, just like Obadiah, the prophet, said, *“And saviours shall come up on mount Zion…”* (Obadiah 1:21\). Through your words—the prophetic word—make things right in your life, in your home, in your ministry, job, business, city, and nation. Hallelujah!

## HE MADE US HEALERS September 27th, 2021

>***And these signs shall follow them that believe… They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (Mark 16:17\-18\).***

Acts 28 shows us one of Paul’s experiences on the Island of Malta where he and a company of others stayed as a result of a shipwreck. During their stay, the Bible says Paul healed the father of Publius. Publius was the headman in that part of the island: *“And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him”* (Acts 28:8\).

Notice the spirit’s language; it says Paul prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him. Some people tell us, “We must be very humble and never say we healed anybody; only God heals.” But Jesus told us to heal the sick. He was very emphatic; He said, *“Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give”* (Matthew 10:8\).

In Luke 9:1\-2, the Bible says, *“…he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.”* He made us healers. Hallelujah! Read Acts 14; the Bible says Paul was preaching in a city called Lystra and noticed a certain man who was crippled from his mother’s womb, and healed him (Acts 14:8\-10\).

The eleventh verse says, *“**And when the people saw what Paul had done,** they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.”* Notice the underlined portion: the people saw what Paul had done. Understand that this is the Spirit’s account, His narration of what transpired. The Spirit says Paul did it. 

You’re not an ordinary person; you’re a divine package of power to bless and heal your world. As you preach the Gospel, do what Jesus said to do: heal the sick, raise the dead, and cleanse the lepers. Your hands are healing hands; they transmit the power of God. Through you, His divine presence is made manifest to those in your world.

## SACRIFICES OF PRAISE  September 28th, 2021

>***By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name (Hebrews 13:15\).***

In 2 Chronicles 5, the Bible shows us an extraordinary moment at the dedication of Solomon’s Temple. The singers were with clashing cymbals and strings, giving thanks and offering praises to the Lord. The Bible says all the priests came together, *“Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets)”* (2 Chronicles 5:12\). They were all rejoicing before the Lord.

The 13th verse says they *“…lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever….”* These are spiritual sacrifices! They did exactly what God wanted. The killing of the animals during the ceremony didn’t bring the glory. But as they offered spiritual sacrifices to God, the Bible says, *“…then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD”* (2 Chronicles 5:13\).

In 2 Chronicles 20, the Bible tells us how Judah had been surrounded by enemies. Then Jehoshaphat did something. The Bible says, *“…when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever”* (2 Chronicles 20:21\). The battle was led by singers. And what happened to their enemies?

The Bible says *“…they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped”* (2 Chronicles 20:24\). Hallelujah! When you face difficulties and adversities, praise the Lord in the beauty of holiness; bless His Name and affirm that His mercy endures forever. In the midst of that seeming hardship, declare that His faithfulness is unto all generations. This is your office as a priest unto Christ; you’re to offer sacrifices of worship and praise to God always: *“By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name”* (Hebrews 13:15\).

>***As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him (Colossians 2:6\).***

The New International Version of the verse above says, *“So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him.”* A valid question to ask would be, “If this refers to Christ as a man, how can you walk or live in a man?” But evidently, Christ isn’t only the man Jesus or the head of the Church and His body; Christ is also a place!

When Jesus said in John 14:2, *“...I go to prepare a place for you,”* that place is called “Christ”; that’s your new home and environment. That’s the reason it says in the ensuing verse 7 of Colossians 2, *“Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving”* (Colossians 2:7\). The place is called “there” in this context. It says, “abounding therein”; that means overflowing with thanksgiving and joy in that place called Christ. Hallelujah!

He tells us in Hebrews 12:22: *“But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels.”* All the saints in glory are there.

God’s plan is that He’ll gather all things in Christ. The Bible says, *“That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him”* (Ephesians 1:10\). Christ is eternity! Now that you’re in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17\), you live in eternity. You have eternal life. You’ve passed from time into timelessness. Glory to God!

## YOUR FRUITS MUST REMAIN September 30th, 2021

>***Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward (2 John 1:8\).***

In John 20:21, Jesus said, *“…as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.”* He sent us with the fullness of the Spirit (John 3:34\); and so, we must produce lasting results in bearing fruits of righteousness. In John 15:16, He said, *“Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain….”*

In these last days, we’re reaching a lot of people with the Word of the Gospel; we’re bearing fruits. But these fruits must remain. We don’t just walk away after we’ve reached them for Christ; we must follow them up. The Bible says, *“And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do”* (Acts 15:36\).

When people give their hearts to the Lord, they’re like new born babies. That’s why the Bible says as new born babes they should desire the sincere milk of the Word that they may grow thereby (1 Peter 2:2\). They need to grow and be established in Christ. So, you must continue to teach them the Word, encourage them and travail in prayer until Christ is formed in them as Paul said in Galatians 4:19\.

In 2 Corinthians 11:3\-4, the Apostle Paul shows us that Satan could take advantage of those who aren’t yet firmly rooted in the Word and deceive them as he did Eve. They could be tempted by others who are preaching a different message or being led by some other spirits. Therefore, in your evangelical efforts, persist until you see that those you’ve ministered to are established in Christ, firmly rooted and grounded in Him, and they in turn are winning others.

Dear Father, thank you for the mighty harvest of souls recorded around the world in these last days through the evangelical efforts of your children everywhere. I pray for the new converts, that Christ may dwell in their hearts by faith; and that they, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend the depth and magnitude of your love, being filled with all the fullness of God, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.
