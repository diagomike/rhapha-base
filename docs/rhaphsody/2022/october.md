## HIS GRACE AT WORK IN YOU October 1st, 2022

>***And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work (2 Corinthians 9:8\).***

The Bible says, *“And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance…”* (2 Corinthians 9:8 AMPC). That means the Lord directs grace towards you. Grace brings acceptability, honour and dignity; it attracts the right people, circumstances and resources to you, in line with God’s purpose for your life.

Every so often, declare, “I walk and function in grace; grace sets me apart for glory and excellence. I’m a child of grace.” The Bible says to take advantage of the grace that’s in Christ Jesus. With this grace, you can be successful in any and every endeavour.

Become conscious of what we read in our theme verse; it says God is able to make ALL grace to abound towards you; and He did in Christ Jesus. The Bible says of His fullness have we all received grace heaped upon grace (John 1:16\). Then Paul tells us the result of having received this overflow and superfluity of grace: *“…much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ”* (Romans 5:17\).

Grace causes us to reign (to “king”) in life. That means you’re in dominion; you’re ruling over demons, sickness and disease, poverty, failure and death through Christ Jesus. Because His grace is at work in you, what others struggle for will always come to you naturally, by free course. Hallelujah!

## MANIFEST HIS GLORY IN SOUL WINNING October 2nd, 2022

>***And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18\).***

Each one of us is called to manifest the glory of God in soul winning. With boldness, we’re to take the message of the Gospel to those in our world and the regions beyond. It brings to mind the testimony of a dear pastor who was sent to take the Gospel to an apex ruler in some Muslim region. The first time he went, he was turned down. But his senior Pastor who gave him the instruction told him to go again.

He went the second time, undaunted, knowing that it could cost him his life; again, they turned him down. The senior Pastor, convinced he had heard from the Lord, said to him the third time, “Go again.” And he went; this time, no man forbidding him. Hallelujah! He delivered the message as he was sent, at the peril of his life. This is divine boldness to an instruction from heaven.

There’s an unusual grace from God at work in the lives of His children and in the Church today: all roads open, and all barriers crumble because of the power of the Gospel and the Name of Jesus that we proclaim. That’s what’s happening everywhere we go with Rhapsody of Realities. Hallelujah!

More than ever before, boldly proclaim the Gospel. Remember where we’re from: the lineage of the patriarchs and the apostles. Think about what they were like in their day, and what they did with the message (study the entire Hebrews 11\). The Bible says of the apostles, *“…they spake the word of God with boldness”* (Acts 4:31\). They preached everywhere until they filled the whole of Jerusalem with their doctrine (Acts 5:28\).

The same is happening in our day: billions of people from around the world are inspired and transformed by the message of the Gospel, because we’re of the same stock as the apostles and prophets of old. We’re manifesting the glory of God in soul winning because we function in the same grace and power of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah!

## PRAYING FOR ALL MEN IS SACROSANCT October 3rd, 2022

>***I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men (1 Timothy 2:1\).***

A few years ago, while talking to the Lord, I had some questions on my mind. Why did it seem like the world was going in a wrong direction in spite of much preaching by ministries and churches? Why was there so much trouble in the world and very little peace?

The Lord soon began to show me some things. He directed me to 1 Timothy 2:1 \-2, which says, *“I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.”* Here, He shows us what to prioritize as we pray.

We all want to lead quiet and peaceable lives; we want honesty in our societies. But for all that to happen, the Scripture tells us what we must do: pray for all men; for kings, and for all who are in authority. God wants us to pray like this “first of all”; in other words, as a priority. It’s a divine instruction.

As the Church of Jesus Christ, we can’t ignore this instruction and expect to have peace or honest men and women to lead our societies. The Lord’s instruction is clear; we must deliberately gather to pray for all men and all the different categories of leaders in our societies: presidents, governors, mayors, heads of schools, heads of major influential institutions and more.

If we pray more this way, God’s righteousness will be established in our nations, cities and communities; and all forms of evil, turmoil, wickedness and terror will be thwarted. If you haven’t learnt to pray this way, begin today.

Perhaps you lead a cell group, an outreach fellowship, or you pastor a church, teach and lead your members to pray this way. Intercede in prayer and give thanks, first of all, for all men; for kings, and for all that are in authority, before you pray for or about other matters.

Dear heavenly Father, thank you for your Spirit that guides me to pray aright and pray effectively. Even now, I pray for all men; for kings, and those in authority in the nations of the world; thanking you, that your righteousness prevails in their hearts. All over the world, the lives of men are being transformed by the power and influence of the Gospel, resulting in the glorious salvation of many, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## WISDOM THROUGH WORDS October 4th, 2022
![October 4th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-4-wisdom-through-words.jpg)

>***But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption (1 Corinthians 1:30\).***

In 1 Kings 3, the Bible tells us of a remarkable encounter Solomon had with the Lord. Solomon had offered more than a thousand burnt offerings to God in Gibeon. The same night, the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Solomon, ask for anything you want.”

In response, Solomon answered, *“Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people…”* (1 Kings 3:9\). How it pleased the Lord that Solomon asked for this. But here’s what I want you to notice: After the encounter, Solomon was said to be the wisest man on the face of the earth. The Bible says, *“And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. For he was wiser than all men…”* (1 Kings 4:29\-31\). How did Solomon get the wisdom?

God only appeared to him in a dream; there was no physical contact. But God spoke words, and wisdom was imparted to Solomon. In 1 Kings 3:12 ESV, the Lord said to Solomon, *“...I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.”* Solomon believed, and immediately, he began to manifest wisdom.

God gave Solomon wisdom through words; He said it, and that was it! Did you know that He did the same for us? Only that in our case, He gave us something greater than what Solomon had. Our theme verse says Christ Jesus has been made unto us wisdom. And Jesus said of Himself, *“...a greater than Solomon is here”* (Luke 11:31\).

Jesus Christ (a greater than Solomon) is your wisdom— “Sophia” (Greek). “Sophia” is theoretical wisdom and insight into reality; it’s the collective understanding of things. Christ is your excellent wisdom. The wisdom (“Phronesis” in Greek) of the righteous is given you in Christ Jesus. It’s practical wisdom. Thus, in Christ, He has granted you the ability to understand concepts and see relationships between them. He makes you do and say the right things before you think. How amazing this is!

Now, think about the amazing things Solomon did because of the wisdom of God at work in him. You can do much more today because you’re greater than Solomon. You have the wisdom of Christ. Blessed be God!

## JESUS IS THE LIFE October 5th, 2022
![October 5th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-5-jesus-is-the-life.jpg)

>***Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life… (John 14:6\).***

Knowing the origin of life is one of science’s most perplexing mysteries. No one has ever created life. The very source or substance of life hasn’t been known to man. But 1 John 1:2 tells us something so profound; it says, *“…life was manifested, and we have seen it….”*

This means life came out of obscurity and was shown to us. How? Who or what did John and the people of his day see that they called life? It was Jesus! He is life personified. Hallelujah! Imagine that you saw someone or something that says to you, “I’m life; I’m responsible for your existence.” What would you think?

Well, it happened. That’s what we read in our theme verse. Jesus said, “...I am the way, the truth, and the life….” That’s an amazing declaration! Who could ever dare say such a thing? Jesus proved His claim: A man named Lazarus was dead and buried for four days, and they sent for Jesus. When Jesus got there, He said to Martha, Lazarus’ sister, *“...I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live”* (John 11:25\).

Moments later, Jesus stood by the grave of Lazarus and *“...cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth”* (John 11:43\). To the utter bewilderment of the people gathered, Lazarus came back to life! Hallelujah! That wasn’t the first person He would raise from the dead. He had raised the widow’s son at Nain (Luke 7:11\-17\), and Jairus’ daughter (Luke 8:41\-56\).

Jesus is the resurrection and the life. God gave Him power over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as God has given Him (John 17:2\). This covers everything that He came to do; it’s the biggest of them all: He came to give us life. You received that life and became a partaker of the divine nature when you were born again. 1 John 5:11\-12 says, *“… this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.”* Glory to God!

## EXALT WISDOM October 6th, 2022
![October 6th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-6-exalt-wisdom.jpg)

>***Doth not wisdom cry? And understanding put forth her voice? (Proverbs 8:1\).***

The Word of God is the wisdom of God. In Proverbs 8, we read of the appeal of Wisdom. In the eighteenth verse, for example, Wisdom says, *“Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.”* How come, in spite of this, there’re more poor people in the world? It’s because many ignore Wisdom.

Again, Wisdom says, *“I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures”* (Proverbs 8:20\-21\). This is enough for you to bury yourself in the study and meditation of the Word daily. When you give the Word attention, you’re giving attention to Wisdom.

Sadly, many haven’t cultured themselves to exalt Wisdom, to embrace and celebrate Wisdom. How do you exalt or honour Wisdom? It’s by honouring the Word, giving the Word first place in your life, making the Word your only arbiter.

Proverbs 4:7\-8 says, *“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom…Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.”* The wisdom of God—the Word of God—will bring you to a place of honour. That means if you’ll not exalt the Word of God in your life and in the lives of others, you’ll not come to a place of honour.

Also, it says Wisdom will promote you; meaning that if you exalt the Word of God, you’ll have life’s promotions. You may be promoted at work, or in school, but being promoted in life comes from exalting and giving the Word first place in your life. Make up your mind that you’ll always honour the Lord by honouring and exalting His Word.

## SINGING ACCORDING TO OUR DISPENSATION October 7th, 2022
![October 7th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-7-singing-according-to-our-dispensation.jpg)

>***Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God (Colossians 1:25\)***

As I studied the Bible, I realized that God never left us in the dark about anything. For example, the songs we sing are supposed to be according to dispensations but many don’t realize it. Our praise of God has to be according to our dispensation—where we live in God’s calendar—His prophetic timing, and where we are with God.

When you don’t understand this, you may think that every song is okay, but that’s not true. The Apostle John, while exiled on the island of Patmos, expounded on three different groups by the revelation of the Spirit. The first group is found in Revelation 5:8\-9\. These are four living creatures and the twenty\-four elders. The apostles are part of the 24 elders, and they represent the Church. Read the lyrics of their song in Revelation 5:9\.

Then, we have the second group in Revelation 14:1\-3\. These are the 144,000 (about 12 thousand from each of the 12 tribes of Israel). The Bible says, *“And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth”* (Revelation 14:3\).

They sang the song, but nobody could capture or understand what they were singing. Why? It’s because the song didn’t belong to the dispensation of the four “beasts” and twenty\-four elders.

Lastly, the third group—the tribulation saints—who got the victory over the beast. This is found in Revelation 15\. But these tribulation saints who’re divided into two groups (the Jews, and those who became Christians after the Rapture) sang two songs. They sang the song of Moses, and they sang the song of the Lamb (read Revelation 15:3\-4\).

This immediately awakens an understanding in the Church of Jesus Christ that our singing has to be according to revelation and our dispensation. We have to sing songs that truly praise and worship God; songs that are consistent with who we are in Christ, our dominion and heritage in Him (Revelation 1:6; 5:10\). Hallelujah!

## SIGNALS FROM DIVINE HEADQUARTERS October 8th, 2022

>***Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober (1 Thessalonians 5:6\).***

God is always in communication with us, but not many are attentive enough to pick His signals. There’s a communication system between us and our heavenly “headquarters.” The Holy Spirit operates the divine headquarters of our kingdom and has the capacity to communicate with every single one of us anywhere, at the same time, and at any time. A true soldier or minister of the Gospel must be listening all the time to likely signals and instructions from our divine headquarters.

People carry their phones, not necessarily for anything else, but because they want to talk. But I carry mine, primarily because of my writings. Before the advent of these sophisticated gadgets, I always had my writing materials with me. I had to, because I discovered by practice and experience that the Lord will suddenly say something important to me. So I’m always alert. My spiritual connection never breaks.

Unlike the cellular networks that fluctuate, the network to and from our divine headquarters never breaks; but it’s about how alert you are to receive. It’s on, even while you’re asleep. There have been times I woke up suddenly because the Spirit of God said something to me and I woke up with it, and I was wise to pen down what He said.

Train yourself to always listen to the Spirit. Always be expectant that He’ll speak to you. When it’s time to pray, keep your writing materials close by. And as you pray, listen for His voice in your spirit and take action immediately on the things He tells you to do. Stay connected through the Holy Spirit. Remain prayerful and give attention to the study of the Scriptures. Hallelujah!

## ROLL THEM OVER TO JESUS October 9th, 2022

>***Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you (1 Peter 5:7\).***

Our opening verse in The Passion Translation says, “*Pour out all your worries and stress upon him and leave them there, for he always tenderly cares for you.”* He’s telling you to roll your cares and concerns over to Jesus. How encouraging that is. It’s a simple invitation to a life of unending peace and joy. Hallelujah!

The Amplified Classic version renders it thus: *“Casting the whole of your care \[all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately \{and\} cares about you watchfully.”* This means leave none out. There’re people who care so much and are troubled about many things. It seems they must worry to be “happy”; what a terrible way to live.

God loves you. He cares for you affectionately and protectively watches over you. This is what He says of Himself with respect to you. He doesn’t want you flustered or worried about anything. Worrying will steal your joy and reduce your effectiveness.

You may say, “The things I worry about are things of the Kingdom; I have a target to win many souls, so it gets me worried.” No. He told us to win souls; but He didn’t tell us to worry about winning them. So, refuse to worry! Every so often, say, “I refuse to be anxious over anything; but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, I make my request known unto God. Therefore, His peace that surpasses all understanding garrisons my heart and mind in Christ Jesus.”

The things He asked us to do are never burdensome. He said in Matthew 11:28\-30, *“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me…and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”* That’s it! He’s taken the stress out of life. Yours is to act on His Word. Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God, and His peace that surpasses all understanding shall garrison your heart and mind in Christ Jesus. Amen.

## GIVE ATTENTION TO THE ONE THING NEEDFUL October 10th, 2022

>***But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her (Luke 10:42\).***

There’re those who get so carried away with their work and other activities that they lose focus of what truly matters—the Word! They get so preoccupied in the many activities that they don’t have time to fellowship, study and meditate on the Word. That’s wrong!

The Word of God is your food for life. 1 Peter 1:23 says, *“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.”* You were born of the Word and can only be sustained by the Word. 1 Peter 2:2 says, *“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.”*

True and lasting success comes from conscious meditation on the Word of God: *“This Book of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe and do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall deal wisely and have good success”* (Joshua 1:8 AMPC).

When the Lord Jesus counselled Martha in Luke 10, He was unequivocal in letting her know what to prioritize: the Word! He said, “…Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her” (Luke 10:41\-42\).

No wonder the Spirit says to us in Colossians 3:16 AMPC, *“Let the word \[spoken by] Christ (the Messiah) have its home \[in your hearts and minds] and dwell in you in \[all its] richness, as you teach and admonish and train one another in all insight and intelligence and wisdom \[in spiritual things, and as you sing] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, making melody to God with \[His] grace in your hearts.”*

Give attention to the Word and fellowship with the Holy Spirit! Spend quality time in prayer every day; you’ll experience such peace and prosperity—such blessings and glory in your life that you never thought possible. Hallelujah!

## PRAISE MUST HAVE MEANING October 11th, 2022
![October 11th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-11-praise-must-have-meaning.jpg)

>***God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth (John 4:24\).***

Some people say they’re praising God and all they say is, “Lord, I praise you”; but the truth is that they haven’t praised Him. To give someone a gift, for example, you don’t just say, “I give you a gift” and do nothing; you deliver the actual gift to the person. You don’t give the gift with your mouth; you act it.

It’s the same with praising, thanking and worshipping the Lord. You do it with content. When you say, “I bless you, Lord,” then go ahead and bless Him. How do you bless Him? It’s by giving Him thanks: you thank Him for who He is, what He’s done, and for His glory in your life.

There has to be a meaning when you thank Him; what’s the thanks connected to? So, you say, “I thank you Lord for X, Y, Z.” It must be connected to something; otherwise, you only muttered words. If I came to you and said, “Thank you,” you’d want to know what I’m thanking you for.

Even when He tells us to have a heart that’s full of thanksgiving, it still has a purpose; there’s something in your heart that you’re thanking Him for. I may pray in my privacy and say, “Father, thank you”; that’s because in my heart, I have so many things I’m grateful to Him for that I’m not voicing, because God sees the heart. In my heart are these beautiful thoughts of what He’s done for me or said to me for which I’m expressing thanks.

So, always, when you praise Him, it’s got to have meaning; it’s got to have content. The content is the fruit of your lips, giving thanks to His Name: *“By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name”* (Hebrews 13:15\).

## YOUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE HOUSE OF GOD October 12th, 2022
![October 12th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-12-your-behaviour-in-the-house-of-god.jpg)

>***But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth (1 Timothy 3:15\).***

The Church of Jesus Christ is the ground and pillar of truth; it’s not an organization or association of believers. The Church is the house of God, and the Bible is clear as to how we’re to comport ourselves in the house of God; there’s a behaviour that’s expected.

When we say the Church is the house of God, it also means, firstly, that as an individual, your body is God’s house. Secondly, the members of a particular local assembly—the local church—is God’s house. Thirdly, the place or building where we carry out our worship activities is also called the house of God.

Now, in all three references, the house of God demands and deserves reverence. The Lord is holy. The Lord is pure. The Lord is righteous. Therefore, our manner of life, our comportment in His “house”—in serving and worshipping Him—must depict His nature. It must be according to the Word and by the power of the Holy Spirit.

As you study the Scriptures, you discover the things He says we should do and not do. These aren’t commandments but pictures of who we are and how we should live. For example, for your physical body, He says, “Present it as an instrument of righteousness” (Romans 6:13\). Then in Romans 12:1, He says, *“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.”*

Also, Romans 16:17 says, *“Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.”* In the house of God, in the church, you don’t cause divisions and offences amongst God’s people. You don’t walk in rebellion or disobedience, but in faith, hope, love and humility. Hallelujah!

## JESUS IS LORD AND KING October 13th, 2022
![October 13th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-13-jesus-is-lord-and-king.jpg)

>***…Until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ: Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords (1 Timothy 6:14\-15\).***

The Lord Jesus is the King of kings and Lord of lords. When He was born, the Bible says, *“…there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him”* (Matthew 2:1\-2\). He didn’t become a king; He was born a king.

In John 18, we find His own testimony when Pilate asked Him, “Art thou a king then?” Jesus responded, *“... Thou sayest that I am a king...”* (John 18:37\). His response meant, “You’re right.” He spoke in the affirmative. In fact, in the 39th verse, speaking to the Jews, Pilate confirmed Jesus’ affirmation when he said, *“…will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?”*

Had Jesus denied being a King, Pilate wouldn’t call Him the King of the Jews. In Acts 2:30, speaking to an audience, Peter said, *“Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him (David), that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne.”*

In John 12:13, upon His triumphal entry into Jerusalem, the crowds extravagantly honoured Him and praised God for sending this King into Jerusalem. They cried out, *“... Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.”*

Of course, the elders of the Jews were offended and told Him to silence those who praised Him and received Him as King (Luke 19:39\). But Jesus responded, *“...If they kept quiet, the stones along the road would burst into cheers”* (Luke 19:40 NLT). In other words, even the stones will affirm the same. Hallelujah!

The Lord Jesus is the exalted God, the immortal God, living in unapproachable light of divine glory. There’s none like Him. We’re not serving a mere religious leader, but one who is King and Monarch of the universe. He has all authority in heaven, in earth, and under the earth. Be unapologetic in your identity with Him, and speak boldly of Him. Glory to His Name forever!

## RIGHTEOUSNESS—A GIFT FOR ALL MEN October 14th, 2022
![October 14th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-14-righteousnessa-gift-for-all-men.jpg)

>***Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17\).***

Righteousness is one of the three cardinal gifts of God, and it was offered to the whole world. The gift of righteousness is for all men. You might argue, “Why then does the Bible say, ‘*As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one?’”* (Romans 3:10\). That’s the reason Jesus came, suffered, and died for all men.

He came into this world to make a righteous creation out of the unrighteous man. He died once so that every man who hitherto was unrighteous could believe in Him and become righteous. Romans 10:10 says, *“For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”*

Legally speaking, every sinner in the world, including the atheist, has already been made righteous. However, because they haven’t activated the life of righteousness by being born again, they can’t experience the vital realities of the life of righteousness. They can’t produce the fruits and works of righteousness.

It’s the reason we preach the Gospel; the world needs to know that the death and resurrection of Jesus has freed all men from the bondage of sin. Now, righteousness is available in Christ Jesus. 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, *“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”*

Now that you’re born again, you’ve been brought into a new life of righteousness: *“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life”* (Romans 6:4\). Righteousness is the nature of God that gives you right standing with God and the nature to do right. This is your new nature in Christ; an intimate relationship with God is now possible. Hallelujah!

Righteous Father, I thank you for giving me your righteousness and granting me the ability to boldly stand before you without guilt, condemnation, inferiority or blame. I’m righteousness-conscious.

## JESUS IS LORD AND CHRIST October 15th, 2022

>***Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36\).***

When we say Jesus is Lord, it means Master, one who’s over others. He’s Lord and Christ! He can also be called Lord Christ or Christ the Lord. This is important because of the meaning of the word “Christ.” 

Christ is from the Greek word “Christos” and it’s the equivalent of the word “Messiah” in Hebrew. But Messiah means “anointed one” who becomes the Saviour. So, Jesus is God’s anointed One, sent for the salvation of the world. When He was born, the angels brought the tidings of it to the shepherds and said, *“For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord”* (Luke 2:11\).

Also, Peter boldly declared this incredible truth to the Jews in Jerusalem, as read in our theme verse; he said, *“…God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.”* Hallelujah! In John 4, based on the testimony of the Samaritan woman, many of the Samaritans of the city came to hear Jesus for a first\-hand confirmation, and they said to the woman, *“...Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world”* (John 4:42\). Hallelujah!

Believing that Jesus is Christ is very important, because without that, there’s no salvation. Jesus isn’t one of the “Christs”; there’s no such thing as “other Christs”; Jesus is THE CHRIST! And the Bible says, *“Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God…”* (1 John 5:1\). Your salvation is hinged on this. Jesus is both Lord and Christ; proclaim it everywhere. Praise God forever!

## MANIFESTING HIS GLORY IN OUR DAY October 16th, 2022

>***Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report (Hebrews 11:1\-2\).***

One day, while I was still very young, the Lord said to me, “I’m with you. I will not fail you or forsake you.” This was life\-transforming for me. With this information, I was certain of one thing: God is dependable. I got up from where I was sitting that day, a changed person forever.

I was ecstatic because the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; the God of the prophets and the apostles; the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ was with me. He’s real in me and to me. He isn’t only the God of the Bible, but my God as well. Hallelujah!

Think about it: In the days of the prophets and the apostles, the Bible says they obtained a good report by their life and actions of faith. The apostles were inspired when they read of the elders like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, Jephthah, Moses, Elijah, and more. We also read of the elders, but we are further inspired by the likes of Peter, James, John, Paul, and the others.

It however shouldn’t stop there. What will your days be like? What’s your story going to be? How will it be written? Just as the elders obtained a good report, we also have to obtain good reports in our day. We shouldn’t have the young generation ask us: “Where’s the God of Elijah or the God of Paul?” He’s our God as well.

We have to bring the God of Elijah to our day through our actions of faith. We have to take Christ beyond the written pages and manifest His glory to our generation, for He is the same yesterday, today and forever.

## WISDOM AND INSTRUCTION October 17th, 2022

>***Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured (Proverbs 13:18\).***

The Book of Proverbs is an important Book of the Bible. It’s a Book of wisdom which every smart Christian should study meticulously. It shows us the importance of God’s instructions and their applications to our lives. Not everybody knows wisdom and instruction. But Proverbs 1:2 tells us to *“...know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding.”* This is referring to the Word of God.

The Word of God is wisdom and instruction, and there’s a cost for not attending to instructions. Proverbs 4:13 refers to God’s instructions as life. Our theme verse says poverty and shame shall be to him that refuses instruction.

The person doesn’t need to have been poor; no matter how rich he may be at the moment, if he wouldn’t heed instruction— God’s Word—the Bible says poverty shall be his lot. The fifteenth chapter further buttresses this clear warning; it says, *“He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding”* (Proverbs 15:32\).

The Word of God is God’s instruction manual for an extraordinary life of glory, dominion and victory. Therefore, consciously practice fellowship with the Holy Spirit and the Word. That’s where you receive His instructions and guidance that put you over circumstances and the adversities of life.

Live out the Word every day. That’s exactly what James tells us when he says, *“But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves”* (James 1:22\). This is what we do in the New Testament: we’re the Word in manifestation. Through us, the Word of God is lived beyond the written pages.

We’re the Word of God in action today. So, in your personal life, study the Word; “eat” and digest the Word. As you do, following His instructions becomes your way of life, and His instructions make great. Hallelujah!

## ENFORCE THE VICTORY OF CHRIST October 18th, 2022

>***The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly (John 10:10\).***

In 1 John 3:8, the Bible gives us a clear message on the purpose of Jesus’ coming. It says, *“He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. **For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil**.”* What are the works of the devil?

In the first part, it reveals the works of the devil to be sin; doing things that are inconsistent with the will and plan of God. It includes wickedness, evil, destruction, sickness, pain, affliction, and even death, for the Bible says death is the result of sin (Romans 6:23\).

But thanks be unto God! “Jesus came and abolished death and brought life and immortality to light” (2 Timothy 1:10\). In Acts 10:38, the Bible says, *“How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”* The sicknesses, diseases, pain, misery, and suffering in the world are all works of the devil. But Jesus brought healing and health; He brought light, joy and peace. He destroyed ALL the works of the devil. Hallelujah!

Therefore, if ever the works of the devil try to manifest in your body, in your home, or in any area of your life, just remember that Jesus already got rid of them. All you have to do is maintain your faith on what He’s already done. Refuse to accommodate anything of Satan and of darkness in your life and in your sphere of influence.

Hebrews 2:14\-15 says, *“Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.”* This scripture has already been consummated. Therefore, enforce the victory Jesus Christ wrought in your behalf and enjoy your glorious life in Him. Hallelujah!

## YOU MEAN MORE TO HIM October 19th, 2022

>***I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me (John 17:23\).***

One day, a minister of the Gospel came to me and said he was considering quitting the ministry because life had been difficult for him. I asked him why he went into the ministry in the first place. He said he loved God and wanted to tell everybody about Jesus.

Then I said, “It’s wonderful that you love God more than He loves you.” He thought about it and said, “No, that’s not what I said.” Then I said, “But that’s what you mean.” Of course, when I was done sharing with him from the Scriptures, things became clearer for him, and today, he’s a fabulous minister, doing amazing things for the Lord. But he almost gave up.

There’re many in similar situations today. Some are even angry with God because they think in spite of their prayers, God has refused to “do something” about their situation. But it’s not so; they’re not walking in His Word. Perhaps they need more knowledge, new knowledge that’ll create new opportunities. Perhaps, also, they’re not putting their faith to work.

But here’s what’s absolutely certain: God loves you more than you love yourself. He’s more passionate about your success in life and ministry than you could ever be. He loves you infinitely and unconditionally, but you have to live in and by His Word. When you understand His Word and His love for you, it’ll change your life and give you an extraordinary mentality.

In the Father’s eyes, you’re as precious as Jesus is. He thought you were valuable enough to send Jesus to die in your place. Imagine you bought a phone for $2,000; that immediately shows the value of the phone to you. In the same way, if Jesus Christ was given for you, it means you’re worth Jesus Christ.

I’ve often said that even if you were the only person on earth, Jesus would still have come to die for you. He didn’t come because we were many. Therefore, appreciate your value. You mean more to Him than you could ever imagine. Think, talk, walk, and live as someone special, for indeed you are. Hallelujah!

## WRITE DOWN WHAT HE TELLS YOU October 20th, 2022

>***And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint (Luke 18:1\).***

It’s very rare for me to pray without the Spirit ministering something to me. Many years ago, I learnt something I’ll never forget. While praying, I got into a spiritual vision and saw the Lord standing before me, and He began to tell me certain important things. But then I realized I didn’t have my writing materials close by.

I argued within myself whether or not to go get the writing materials, but I wasn’t sure the vision would continue if I left the place. I summoned courage and said, “Lord, can I quickly get my writing materials?” And He permitted me. I got off my knees, went to get my writing materials and got right back to the same spot that I was. And the moment my knees hit the floor, there the Lord was again.

What touched me the most in that experience was the love of the Master. He waited for me. To think that He waited for me. Hallelujah! But the point is that I made a habit of keeping writing materials close by, each time I pray, because I know the Lord may say something to me and I don’t want to miss it.

The Lord knows how important the things He tells us are, and we have to learn to write them down. If the prophets and the apostles weren’t faithful to write down the things that God told them, we wouldn’t have had the Scriptures. As you pray, surely, God will talk to you. He’ll give you guidance and instructions. He may even give you prophetic instructions about your life and future; write them down so you don’t forget.

## THE CALL TO FELLOWSHIP October 21st, 2022
![October 21st, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-21-the-call-to-fellowship.jpg)

>***That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3\).***

Without fellowship, nothing you do on earth is esteemed in Heaven. That’s why the highest and most important purpose of Christ in the plan of salvation is the call to fellowship, bringing us into fellowship with God. It’s not enough that you’re born again; what God really wants is fellowship with you. That’s the purpose of the New Birth.

You can love your two\-year old child very much, but you can’t have real fellowship with him or her. Real fellowship entails communication—sharing, talking at higher levels where you understand each other and exchange thoughts. This is the kind of fellowship God has called us into.

When John said, *“…that ye also may have fellowship with us...,”* he wasn’t talking about conversion from a certain religion to Christianity; it’s a declaration of truth. We’ve been called into partnership and togetherness with Deity. It’s the fellowship of the God\-kind, a oneness of spirit. Hallelujah!

The Bible says, *“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord”* (1 Corinthians 1:9\). We’re in union with Jesus Christ. Romans 8:16\-17 explains it further. It says, *“The Spirit Himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and **joint\-heirs with Christ**….”*

The underlined portion shows the kind of union we have with Him: He brought us to the same level with Himself. This is mind\-blowing. But you see, you can’t function at that high level of oneness and fellowship except through the Holy Spirit. Your desire should be to fellowship more with the Holy Spirit every day.

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, thank you for the privilege of being in fellowship, in oneness of spirit with you. As a result of this relationship, every limit and barrier is taken off my way; I experience nothing but progress in my life. Your glory and wisdom function in me and through me in an overflowing measure; and I experience unprecedented manifestations of your power through fellowship of the Spirit, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## GROWING BY THE WORD October 22nd, 2022
![October 22nd, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-22-growing-by-the-word.jpg)

>***As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby (1 Peter 2:2\).***

Growth isn’t a miracle and shouldn’t take a miracle; it’s the result of the right application of revealed principles and means. Growth is intrinsic to life; it’s a natural course of life. Everything that has life grows; it’s one of the characteristics that differentiate living things from non\-living things.

As a Christian, your spiritual growth is very important, and you can only grow by the Word. God’s Word is food for the human spirit. 1 Peter 2:2 says, *“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.”* The Word of God builds you and transforms your life from glory to glory.

James 1:21 says, *“…receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.”* It’s like natural seeds that can only grow properly when planted in the right environment. If you want to grow spiritually, you must expose your spirit to the Word; you must feed on the Word.

It’s one of the reasons you must be an active member of a local church, where you learn the Word of God that imparts faith and builds your spirit strong. Do your personal study of the Word; this is so important. 2 Timothy 2:15 says, *“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”*

Then, in 2 Timothy 3:16\-17, it says, *“All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: **That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works**.”* Notice the underlined portion.

How exciting it is to watch yourself grow up to spiritual maturity! You notice your choices and values change. Your passion and affection are set only on the things of the Spirit. This isn’t something anyone can do for you; it’s your responsibility. God already fulfilled His role by making His Word available to you. He said in Colossians 3:16, *“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom….”*

With the Word in you, you’re able to tame the crises of life. You’re able to take charge of your health. You know how to keep Satan and his cohorts in check. You enforce the will and dominion of Christ in your city, nation, and in the nations of the world. That’s part of Christian growth. Hallelujah!

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, I thank you for your Word and its power in my life; I’m growing unto maturity, in grace and in the knowledge of my Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. My spirit is built up strong, and educated as I study and meditate on God’s Word, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## PUT YOUR GIFTS TO WORK October 23rd, 2022

>***And that special gift of ministry you were given when the leaders of the church laid hands on you and prayed\-\-keep that dusted off and in use (1 Timothy 4:14 MSG).***

If you aren’t careful to watch whatever God gives you, you could lose it. And part of watching it is that you’re using it. For example, if you were given the gift of prophecy and you aren’t using it, after a while, it’ll become more difficult for you to manifest that gift or edify the church with it.

It brings to mind the question a dear lady once asked me. She said, “Pastor Chris, when I got born again, I was blessed with the gift of prophecy, but I don’t know where the gift has gone; what can I do?” First, Romans 11:29 says, *“For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.”* That means He doesn’t take them away.

For that dear lady, the gift was always in her; it didn’t go anywhere. She was the one that might have strayed from it or made it dormant by not using it. If you’re in a similar situation today, it’s simple what you should do: Get back in the flow of the Spirit, and stay in it. First, make sure your commitment to God is very clear in your spirit. Be totally committed to serving the Lord.

Secondly, get back to praying. Prophecy is bringing forth the Word of God that’s given to your spirit. But you don’t get that Word when you’re not in fellowship with Him. Get yourself back to fellowshipping with the Lord, and your spirit will be stirred.

Thirdly, pray in tongues more often; this will energize, strengthen and inspire your spirit. It’ll make your spirit become more sensitive. Then, study the Word and meditate on it. Remember, it’s the Holy Spirit who inspires prophecy in your spirit, and He’s the author of the Scriptures (2 Timothy 3:16\). He’ll make His Word and message more palatable to your spirit. And because your spirit has become more sensitive, you’d be able to pick His Word, His message, and make it available to yourself and to God’s people in prophecy. Hallelujah!

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, I thank you for the gift of prophecy. I’m inspired and aided by the prophetic intimations I receive by the Spirit even now.

## USE THE GIFT OF PROPHECY CORRECTLY October 24th, 2022

>***But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort (1 Corinthians 14:3\).***

In 1 Peter 4:10, the Bible shows that each one of us has been blessed with one spiritual gift or the other to use in the service of others. He also counsels us not to abuse or misuse these gifts.

For example, the gift of prophecy, just like any other gift of the Spirit, has to be used correctly to edify the Church. It’s unwise to interrupt others just because you have a word of prophecy. The Bible says *“Let all things be done decently and in order”* (1 Corinthians 14:40\). Wait for the appropriate time and opportunity.

Don’t disrupt the worship because you want to “prophesy.” 1 Corinthians 14:30\-31 says, *“If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.”* How instructive!

Every one of us could have the gift of prophecy, and if we had enough time during a church service, the whole congregation could prophesy one by one. This is specific about the gift of prophecy. Then, He tells us what this gift of prophecy is used for: edification, exhortation and comfort. It’s never used for condemnation.

When spiritual gifts are used correctly, God is glorified and the Church grows. Apply the gift of prophecy correctly and you’ll see quantum leaps and unending growth in your life, ministry and church. Hallelujah!

## DON’T CONSULT MEDIUMS October 25th, 2022
![October 25th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-25-dont-consult-mediums.jpg)

>***And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? (Isaiah 8:19\).***

Someone once asked if it’s okay for Christians to consult mediums and psychics. That’s absurd! You have the Holy Spirit; therefore, you don’t need any of that. Moreover, psychics, soothsayers, diviners or astrologers can’t tell you the truth about the future, or your future, because they don’t know it. Only the Holy Spirit knows the future and the truth about you and your future.

Romans 8:14 says, *“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”* The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth, sent by God to guide you into ALL truth and show you the future—things to come: *“Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come”* (John 16:13\).

Therefore, depend on the Holy Spirit for answers. Trust Him for the guidance and direction you need. Consult with Him about anything and everything for which you require accurate guidance. A total lack of understanding of our opening verse is the reason some are still confused about whether or not it’s okay to seek mediums. It’s not okay.

When you look at all that God said about wizards, He often talked about their idea of trying to look into the spirit world and use mediums that are totally against the Word and the leading of the Holy Spirit. So, be wise; never pay attention to such predictions. Consult with, and receive guidance from the Holy Spirit only, and always.

## BE EFFECTUAL IN SOUL WINNING October 26th, 2022

>***And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18\).***

Not every Christian is participating actively in the ministry of reconciliation. It’s not meant to be so. We’re all expected to be active and very effectual in soul winning. The day would come when we all stand before the Master and every one of us would receive praise of Him (1 Corinthians 4:5\). The Lord is going to reward us according to our works: *“For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works”* (Matthew 16:27\).

As we know, our works aren’t the same; our commitment is at different levels. But today, I want you to make an honest assessment of your participation in the Gospel: if you were to stand before God right now, what would He say about your works in the propagation of the Gospel in these end times?

God’s number one passion is soul winning; therefore, put everything into it. Be active, very active, in the ministry of reconciliation. 2 Peter 3:9 says, “*The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us\-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”*

The Lord’s overwhelming passion to reconcile men to Himself is emphasized in the assignment He gave to Jesus, buttressed by these words of the Master Himself: *“...I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly”* (John 10:10\). Take this seriously. Every day, talk to others about Jesus. Do it in your neighbourhood, in your estate, and then go beyond.

There’re places you might not be able to get to physically; you can reach them through partnership and sponsorship of the Gospel materials distribution, such as Rhapsody of Realities. We have the structure and platforms for such. Contact your local church office or visit www.reachoutworld.org for more information.

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, I thank you for the opportunity to actively win souls today.

Satan’s bondage and deception are destroyed, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## DESIRE TO PROPHESY October 27th, 2022
![October 27th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/oct-22-day-27-desire-to-prophesyy.jpg)

>***For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted (1 Corinthians 14:31\).***

To prophesy means to speak words of divine revelation and potency, words that have and give life. And through the gift of prophecy, the Body of Christ—the Church—is edified, strengthened and comforted.

You might be in your closet or in a meeting, and words in Psalm 23 well up from within you, and then you go, “Psalm 23 verse 1 says, The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want’; therefore, we’re nourished, sustained, energized, strengthened and prepared for His soon return through the ministry of the Word! We’re invigorated and vitalized through and through because He nourishes us.” With such words, the church is edified. Hallelujah!

That’s why the Bible says, *“Pursue love, and desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy”* (1 Corinthians 14:1 NKJV). Through the gift of prophecy, we can admonish one another and strengthen one another. 1 Corinthians 14:31 says, *“For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.”* This isn’t the same thing as everyone being a prophet. He didn’t say we may all desire to be prophets. Rather, it says that every one of us can, and should, desire to prophesy.

If the gift of prophecy will bless and edify the church, it’ll bless and edify you. You can use the gift of prophecy to take charge of your life and control things in your “aion.” Acts 2:17 says, *“And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy….”*

Chart your course in perpetual victory and triumph through the gift of prophecy. Prophesy about the peace and prosperity of your nation and the nations of the world. Prophesy about your health, success, prosperity and victory. Prophesy about your life and about your future. Prophesy to your bones, to your body, to your skin, to your blood, to your finances, job, business, academics, etc.

## HIS NAME HAS POWER IN ALL THREE WORLDS October 28th, 2022

>***Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth (Philippians 2:9\-10\).***

If Jesus truly gave us the legal right, that is, the power of attorney to use His Name, what results should we expect when we use His Name? What’s so important about the Name of Jesus? What does His Name represent and why should we have so much confidence in the Name of Jesus?

We have the answer in our opening scripture. Notice the construction; it’s absolute. It says, “At the name of Jesus every knee should bow”; that’s a sovereign decree, a law in the realm of the spirit. Hallelujah! This sovereign decree is in force in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth (in hell). His Name has power in all three worlds; that power applies to the “things,” that is, whatever exists in all three worlds; whether they be thrones, governments, galaxies, principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world or in high places; they’re all subject to His Name. 

This is remarkable! It explains why you should never be flustered by anything in life. It makes no difference what Satan and his cohorts of hell are concocting; you can neutralize their efforts and overturn their works in the Name of Jesus. Recall part of what we read in Philippians 2:9\-10: “of things under the earth”; it means beings, things, or anything that exists in hell.

No wonder Jesus told us to: *“Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils...”* (Matthew 10:8\). Even if a man went to hell, you could call him back, because the Name of Jesus Christ has power in heaven, on earth, and in hell. Hallelujah!

>***Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular (1 Corinthians 12:27\).***

The Church is the Body of Christ, and Jesus is the head of the Body. Jesus and the Church both make up one body, which is called Christ; we’re members of the Body of Christ. The Living Bible translation of our opening verse helps us understand it a little more. It says, *“Now, here is what I am trying to say: all of you together are the one body of Christ, and each one of you is a separate and necessary part of it.”*

That means you’re needed in the Body of Christ; you’re a necessary contributor to the proper growth and edification of the Church. The Bible says, *“… the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love”* (Ephesians 4:16\).

The Body of Christ advances and makes progress according to the individual contributions of every Christian. This is so important. It’s like the physical parts of the human body and their respective functions. Your liver, legs, kidneys, lungs, heart, thumb, etc., all have their distinct functions. They all work together to ensure that your body functions well. Each part is vital for the overall wellbeing of the body.

If anything goes wrong in any part of your body, it impacts the whole body. This is also true for the spiritual Body of Christ. See yourself as a vital member of the Body of Christ, and make your impact felt. Pray as the Bible says. Win souls. Walk in humility, faith, hope and love. Produce fruits and works of righteousness.

Don’t cause the Body to regress through such things as bitterness, pride, envy and inactivity. Be fervent in Spirit—serving the Lord. Walk in righteousness and in the fullness of the Spirit every day. Praise God!

## THE AUTHORITY AND DOMINION OF HIS NAME October 30th, 2022

>***And what is the exceeding greatness of his power…Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come (Ephesians 1:19\-21\).***

In Ephesians 1:17\-18, the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, prayed a beautiful prayer for God’s people. As He progressed in the prayer, He showed us something about who Jesus really is, and expounds on the authority, power and dominion vested in His Name. Notice that God raised Jesus from the dead and set Him at His own right hand. “Right hand” isn’t a description of directional or geographical location; it implies the seat of power.

When you refer to someone as your right\-hand man, what you mean is that he represents you; he has your authority to act in your stead. Jesus is in God’s seat. Where exactly is that? It says, *“…in the heavenly places, Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come”* (Ephesians 1:20\-21\). That’s where Jesus is—His position of authority.

Thus, the Name of Jesus Christ is above every power, every rulership, every government, and every authority. The Wuest translation gives us a more excellent rendering of Ephesians 1:21\. It tells us that Jesus is *“over and above every government and authority and power and lordship and every name that is constantly being named, not only in this age, but also in the one about to come.”*

No wonder the apostles used the Name of Jesus and ruled the world of their time. This is what Christians around the world must rediscover today: the power of the Name of Jesus. Learn to use that Name in all circumstances.

The Name of Jesus is the Name above all names, and I use that Name as an instrument today. His Name is greater than cancer; it replaces maimed limbs, it opens blind eyes, unstops deaf ears, and raises the dead. In the Name of Jesus, I declare that I’m more than a conqueror, a champion forever; eternally fruitful and productive. Blessed be God!

## STUDY TO SHOW YOURSELF APPROVED October 31st, 2022

>***Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth (2 Timothy 2:15\).***

Daniel made outstanding impacts in his day. The Scripture shows us he was studious. In Daniel 9:2, he said, *“In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.”*

Daniel was so studious he gave special attention to Jeremiah’s prophecy of the seventy years of the captivity. In Daniel 1:4 (NLT), the Bible shows us the king needed people who were to pilot the affairs of his kingdom, and Daniel was found to be eminently qualified.

Daniel was highly esteemed of the Lord. In the New Testament, Jesus also quoted him (Daniel) and corroborated his prophecy when He said, “*When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet…”* (Matthew 24:15\).

We find the same quality with Paul the Apostle. Paul was studious. In 2 Timothy 4:13, we see his attachment to his study materials when he said to Timothy, “*The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.”* He specially requested for his study materials to be sent to him, because he was a diligent student.

If Daniel and Paul were studious, why won’t you? You must study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, but rightly dividing the word of truth. In Hosea 4:6, God said, *“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge….”* He was referring to the knowledge of the Word. Until and unless you know the Word for yourself, you’re going to be a victim in life. That’s why God wants you to study. Give yourself to the Word and your success, progress and prosperity will be inevitable.
