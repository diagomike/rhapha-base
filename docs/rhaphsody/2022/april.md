## THE EXERCISE OF OUR AUTHORITY April 1st, 2022
![April 1st, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-1-the-exercise-of-our-authority.jpg)

>***And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death (Revelation 12:10\-11\).***

How wonderful this is! These verses aren’t talking about us the Church but about the Tribulation saints. This is going to happen during the Great Tribulation period. We would have gone to heaven at this time. While these saints will have their role in this spiritual conflict as stated, the actual fight would be done by angels, led by Michael the Archangel.

Michael the Archangel doesn’t fight for the Church. The Bible shows us he fights for Israel. Daniel 12:1 says, *“And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people….”* If you read it all the way to the 7th verse, it becomes even more lucid that it’s dealing with Israel. But in our dispensation, the angels only fight in our behalf in things we don’t know about and things we don’t do anything about; otherwise, they generally minister in our behalf (Hebrews 1:14\).

Angels don’t need to fight in our behalf when we exercise our authority in Christ. Why? The demons bow in response to our authority, because we’re using the Name of Jesus. His Name is greater than every principality and power and every name that’s named, both in this world and in that which is to come!

In Christianity, we’re not called to fight with devils; we cast them out: *“And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons…”* (Mark 16:17 NKJV). He gave us complete authority over Satan and all evil spirits. Praise God!

I’m seated together with Christ in the heavenly realms, far above principalities, powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world. My authority is that of the blessed Lord Jesus Christ—the only true God! Now therefore, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, I affirm I have power over Satan, evil spirits and their works. I break their influence over leaders of governments and their agencies, that the Name of the Lord may be glorified. Amen.

## YOU WERE BORN A VICTOR April 2nd, 2022
![April 2nd, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-2-you-were-born-a-victor.jpg)

>***Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4\).***

We read Revelation 12:10\-11 in our previous study and noted that it referred to the Tribulation saints during the Great Tribulation period. It’s been written concerning them that they overcame through the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. The word translated “testimony” is “marturia” (Greek) and it means report, testimony, record, witness.

In our dispensation, we’re not trying or hoping to overcome Satan, demons and the antichrist spirits. No! It’s recorded concerning us that we’ve overcome them simply because of who we are, where we are, and the One who lives within us! We’re of God; that means we’re born of Him; we hail from Him and therefore one with Him.

Secondly, we’re in Christ, seated with Him in the realm of great glory, dominion and authority. Christ— the greater One—lives in us. The Bible says Christ in you the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27\). No wonder Jesus said, “Cheer up; I’ve overcome the world” (John 16:33\). The One who already overcame them is inside you and you’re one with Him. As He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17\). Hallelujah!

The events in the world today indicate that these are trying times. Many are disturbed, distraught and perplexed about their health, finances, jobs and businesses. But you’ve been called to live above and dominate this world. Let that be your constant contemplation and confession.

Every so often, you say, “I’m born of God; I’ve overcome the world because greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world!” Refuse to allow circumstances get you to think otherwise. You’re a victor in Christ Jesus. You were born that way. You’ve overcome the world and its systems, its failures, falsehoods, deceptions, corruption and corrupting influences. Glory to God!

I live victoriously and triumphantly above sickness, disease, inflation and terror as I walk in God’s Word. Hallelujah!

## REJOICE AND BE GRATEFUL April 3rd, 2022
![April 3rd, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-3-rejoice-and-be-grateful.jpg)

>***LET US BE GLAD AND REJOICE, AND GIVE HONOUR TO HIM: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready (Revelation 19:7\).***

True Christianity is living by faith in God’s Word, where you’re forever grateful and giving glory to God for His life in you. Your ability to express gratitude is key to your greatness. David was never ashamed or afraid to express his gratitude to the Lord openly. Many times, he expressed his gratitude in songs and in psalms. No wonder he lived such a great life.

On a certain occasion, while I was meditating on the awesomeness of the Lord and thanking Him for all He’s done, I was drawn to one of the psalms of David, which is recorded in 1 Chronicles 16\. It says, *“Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people”* (1 Chronicles 16:7\-8\). This is so beautiful.

When we realize all that the Lord has done for us in a world that’s gone so cruel and dark, and how He glorified Jesus in our lives in an extraordinary way, we can only be full of gratitude to Him. Don’t live like those who are blind to all the good things happening in and around them for which they ought to be grateful.

The New International Version of our underlined portion of the opening verse says, *“Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory....”* Always, we should praise the Lord, declaring that He’s the One who has given us victory over the world and its systems. He’s exalted the Name of Jesus in our lives, and through us, He spreads salvation to the world. Trust Him with your life and be full of gratitude to Him every day.

## THE CLOUD OF GLORY April 4th, 2022
![April 4th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-4-the-cloud-of-glory-res.jpg)

 ---

>***For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys (Exodus 40:38\).***

Matthew 17 tells us that Peter, James and John were with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration. While they were there, Moses and Elijah appeared, and suddenly, the cloud of God covered them (Matthew 17:5\). This same cloud was referenced in Exodus 13:21 and Exodus 16:10 (study both references).

We find a remarkable scenario in our theme verse: for forty years, the children of Israel saw the cloud of God’s glory upon the tabernacle by day and as a pillar of fire by night. This is really significant because Isaiah 63:9 says, *“In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.”*

The next verse tells us that the Angel of His presence is the Holy Spirit: *“But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them”* (Isaiah 63:10\). He was the One that was with them in that cloud of glory. Then the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 10:1\-2: *“Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.”* Remarkable!

Now, 2 Chronicles 5:1\-14 gives us an interesting account: Solomon had built the temple of God and the priests were to take the Ark of God from the old tabernacle and bring it into the new temple built by Solomon. When the Ark was brought in, this same cloud of glory filled the temple so much so that the priests couldn’t stand to minister in the Holy Place. Hallelujah!

That glory is in you and overshadows you today, because you’re the bearer of the Ark. The Ark of God is in your heart today because His Word is written in your heart (Jeremiah 31:33, Hebrews 8:10\). The Word is where the glory is. As long as you give the Word of God its place in your life, you’ll always be covered in that cloud of glory, where you’re shielded from evil and all the depravities in the world. Praise God!

## ONLY IMAGINE POSITIVE OUTCOMES April 5th, 2022
![April 5th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-5-only-imagine-positive-outcomes-res.jpg)

>***Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us (Ephesians 3:20\).***

The human spirit is very powerful, with tremendous creative and imaginative ability. Remember, man was created in the image of God; he looks like God and functions like God. That’s why we say, “Your imaginative power is your creative ability.”

Knowing this, therefore, you should only imagine positive outcomes. Refuse to worry about anything. Worry helps you imagine the worst\-case scenario. Worry helps you imagine negative possibilities, and your imagination of those negative possibilities crystalizes them. Worry helps make your fears possible.

It’s the reason God tells us not to worry or be anxious about anything (Philippians 4:6\). You may say, “What if something has gone wrong, shouldn’t I be worried?” No! Simply refuse to worry! It makes no difference what happens with the economy, health care or health “scare.” When you worry, you set up a magnetic force that attracts to you everything that’s consistent with what you’re worried about.

Never imagine that you may be sent out of the house because you’re behind in your rent. Don’t imagine yourself losing your job. Don’t worry or panic that money isn’t going to be available to you for the things you need to accomplish. Don’t worry that the pain you’re feeling may be more complicated than you realize or could result in an incurable disease. Never have, or form, such negative imaginations. What you imagine is what becomes. Stay your mind on the Word and let it control your expectations.

## SERVING GOD RIGHTLY April 6th, 2022
![April 6th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-6-serving-god-rightlyy.jpg)

>***And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams (1 Samuel 15:22\).***

The Lord Jesus, in John 4:23, outlines true worship as that which is done in spirit and in truth. There’s no other way. Serving the Lord has to be from your spirit and according to His Word. His Word provides the guidance, the prescribed order of service and worship in the Kingdom.

You don’t give God what you choose or just what you like; you give Him what He has asked for in the way that He asked for it. You serve Him according to His demands, not according to your feelings or emotions. There’re people who say, “Everyone can serve God in His own way!” That’s not true. When you study the Bible, you’d find that those who tried to serve God in their own way got killed or rebuked by God.

Genesis 4 tells us the story of Cain and Abel: two brothers who brought their offerings to the Lord. Cain brought an offering of his choice, while Abel brought what God asked to be offered. Abel’s offering was accepted, but Cain’s sacrifice was rejected. In Genesis 4:7, seeing that Cain was angry, the Lord rebuked him saying, ***“If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted....”***

How about Moses, who, instead of talking to the rock, struck the rock? Water came out, and the people drank to their fill, but God was displeased and rebuked Moses (Numbers 20:1\-12, Deuteronomy 4:21\-22\). Uzzah was killed when he tried to render service to God by stabilizing the stumbling Ark of God at Nachon’s threshing floor (2 Samuel 6:6\-7\).

If you want to serve God right, give more attention to studying the Scriptures. He’ll grant you the wisdom and insight of the Spirit on how to serve Him truly, with a pure heart and a willing mind.

## SPEAK “THE WORD” April 7th, 2022

>***But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her (Luke 10:42\).***

The Word of God is everything. Jesus reiterated this in our opening verse when He chastised Martha for being encumbered and troubled by many things. He said one thing is needful, which is the Word of God, and her sister, Mary, gave attention to it. 

When the world was a chaotic mass, empty and in darkness, what did God do? He didn’t call the angels for a construction exercise; He didn’t fix it by trying to do anything with His hands. He only said, “Let there be light,” and there was light (Genesis 1:3\).

Words are powerful, but the Word of God is all powerful. Always remember that. When you were born again, you were born of the Word: *“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”* (1 Peter 1:23\). You’re an offspring of the Word, called to live by the Word, built and being built by the Word. You dwell in the Word, and the Word dwells in you. Now, God says, “Let the same Word that brought you into being flow out of your mouth.”

When we say, “Speak words,” it’s not just any words you’re to speak; it’s “the Word.” In the realm of the spirit, the Word is all that’s necessary. So, have the Word in your spirit; let it dwell in you richly (Colossians 3:16\) and come out of your mouth. The Word of God in your mouth is God talking.

As you grow in the Word, all that comes into your thinking, your imaginations, are all in sync with the Word. And then you find that, like Jesus, your life is the manifestation and revelation of the Word. Hallelujah!

## SINGING NEW SONGS IN WORSHIP April 8th, 2022
![April 8th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-8-singing-new-songs-in-worship-res.jpg)

>***Sing to GOD a brand\-new song, sing his praises all over the world! Let the sea and its fish give a round of applause, with all the far\-flung islands joining in (Isaiah 42:10 MSG).***

If we praise and worship the Lord accurately, by that I mean according to the Scriptures, we’ll experience and bask in His glory as He has determined for our lives. Jesus said, *“But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth: for the father seeketh such to worship him”* (John 4:23\). Philippians 3:3 says we’re the true circumcision who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.

True worship of God is that which is done according to His Word. For example, the Word tells us to sing a “New Song” to the Lord! Yet, many haven’t thought this is important. The psalmist said, *“O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth. Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day”* (Psalm 96:1–2\).

Psalm 98:1 also says, *“O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.”* Then, in Psalm 149:1, we’re encouraged to *“…Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.”* Read what David, the prophet of God said in Psalm 144:9: *“I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.”* 

Why does the Spirit admonish us to sing a new song to the Lord? It’s because the revelation of God’s Word given to His people increases. The Word doesn’t change, but the more you open your heart to the leading and tutelage of the Holy Spirit, the more you would know and see; the more knowledge will be granted you.

As the revelation and understanding of the Word increases, new songs are birthed through the Spirit. The wrong songs in worship have robbed the Church of her effectiveness for so long, and God wants a change. As we act on the Word, singing new songs in worship and praise to the Lord, with the right revelation of truth, His glory will fill the whole earth. We recently unveiled over 200 new songs that you can sing and translate in every language. Also join us during the **Global Praise Services** transmitted live on LoveWorld networks.

## REPEL WORRY April 9th, 2022
![April 9th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-9-repel-worry.jpg)

 >***Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? (Matthew 6:25).***
---
God doesn’t want you worried over anything. When worry attacks your mind, don’t think it’s going to go away on its own; no. Worry is spiritual; that’s why you have to repel it with your shield of faith: *“Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked”* (Ephesians 6:16\).

You need to protect and defend yourself against worry and then go on the offensive with the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God in your mouth, concerning your situation. That’s what you use to repel worry: the “Rhema” of God in your mouth.

What does God’s Word say? It says, *“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus”* (Philippians 4:6\-7 NIV). Don’t sit there worrying and whining; declare what you want and give thanks to God because it’s done. Hallelujah!

Having done that, it says, “The peace of God that surpasses understanding, will garrison your heart and mind in Christ Jesus.” So, here you are, circumstances don’t look right, everything looks like there’s trouble; yet, you’re at peace! Others can’t understand how you can be absolutely unflustered in the midst of so much trouble. The reason is simple: you’re acting on the Word! You’ve cast all your cares upon Him (1 Peter 5:7\). That’s how to live a worry\-free life.

## CLOUD OF WITNESSES April 10th, 2022
![April 10th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-10-cloud-of-witnesses.jpg)

>***Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us (Hebrews 12:1\).***

It’s important to know and understand the symbolic significance of “clouds” as revealed in Scripture. Human beings are referred to as clouds in the same way that they’re referred to as trees. For example, Isaiah 61:3 helps us to see the parallel between humans and trees. We’re referred to as the trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord that He might be glorified.

In another instance, the Bible says, *“And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water…”* (Psalm 1:3\). Think about that. In the same way, we’re also referred to as a “cloud.” When Jesus died on the Cross and descended into hell, he brought the Old Testament saints who were waiting for Him in the heavenlies out of hades. They came out of their graves after His resurrection and some of them actually appeared to many in the holy city. Acts 1:9 says, *“And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.”*

Observe that Luke, by the inspiration of the Spirit, tells us, *“…a cloud received him out of their sight.”* Here, Luke wasn’t talking about that visible mass of condensed water vapour floating in the atmosphere. He was referring to what we read in our opening verse: *“Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us”* (Hebrews 12:1\).

This huge cloud (crowd) of witnesses to the life of faith are those that the Bible talked about in Hebrews 11\. These are men and women who through their faith performed great feats for the Kingdom of God (Hebrews 11:32\-33\). These witnesses of faith subdued kingdoms and did supernatural things in their time; they ruled their world. They wrought righteousness; meaning when others conformed to error, they stood their grounds for the truth and prevailed. We sometimes refer to these as those in the “Faith Hall of Fame.” Indeed, they’re a cloud of witnesses, of people, and everyone with his own glory. Hallelujah!

## WATER-CARRYING CLOUD April 11th, 2022

>***Drip down, heavens, from above, And let the clouds pour down righteousness; Let the earth open up and salvation bear fruit, And righteousness sprout with it. I, the Lord, have created it (Isaiah 45:8 NASB).***

Jude, in his epistle, appealed to God’s people to earnestly contend for the faith against the attack of false teachers. In the 4th verse of his inspiring epistle, he explained why we should aggressively defend the truth because some godless people had crept in stealthily. These are people who distorted the message about the grace of God in order to excuse their immoral ways, and those who disowned and denied Jesus Christ as the supreme authority and Lord. 

Now, notice what he says about these same people in verses 11\-12*: “Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core. These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots”* (Jude 1:11\-12\). He calls them “clouds without water, carried about by the winds; trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots!”

But what does the Lord call us? First, look at Isaiah 61:3; it says*, “To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.”* We’re trees of righteousness, producing fruits of righteousness.

Also, each one of us, according to the Bible, is a cloud; we’re clouds of glory and clouds with water. That’s very significant because John 7:38 says, *“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.”* We’re fountains of living water. From your cloud, righteousness and salvation rain upon the earth. As a water\-carrying cloud, you pour forth righteousness and salvation in the earth, just as our theme verse says.

## THE “FOUNTAIN” IN YOU April 12th, 2022

>***He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (John 7:38\).***

This is so remarkable! Jesus said out of your innermost being flow gushers of living water. This living water comes out in words inspired by the Holy Spirit that lives within you.

Jeremiah 2:13 talks about broken cisterns which can’t hold water; that’s not you! The Holy Spirit in you is a fountain of living water, pouring forth from within you in words of life. Two things characterize the words we speak: righteousness and salvation. Thus, we speak words of righteousness and words of salvation.

Our words lead men into righteousness and salvation. So, we’re those who turn many to righteousness and bring them into salvation. Hallelujah. Your words aren’t ordinary. Through your words, righteousness is unveiled and many are convicted in their hearts for salvation. The Bible says*, “Drip down, heavens, from above, And let the clouds pour down righteousness; Let the earth open up and salvation bear fruit, And righteousness sprout with it. I, the Lord, have created it”* (Isaiah 45:8 NASB).

## EVERYONE IS IMPORTANT April 13th, 2022

>***For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! (1 Corinthians 9:16\).***

The Gospel is for everybody. When it comes to our kingdom and our kingdom work, every individual is important to God. He’s not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9\).

The Gospel of Jesus Christ is potent; His grace, love and mercy have been poured out on all men for their salvation. The Bible says the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation for all men— regardless of their status, background or ethnicity.

God has purposed to save and use anybody—any one of us—for His glory. None of us is too small or too lowly. For example, in 2 Kings 5, we read about Naaman, a commander of the Army of the King of Syria, a great man held in the highest esteem, a mighty man of valour, but he was a leper. On a certain day, while the Syrian troops raided Israel, they captured a girl, and she became a servant to Naaman’s wife.

Sometime later, this little Israelite maid witnessed to Naaman (2 Kings 5:3\), and not only did Naaman get healed of his leprosy through the Prophet Elisha, this army general got converted and became a worshipper of the Lord, God of Israel. I’ve heard similar testimonies of how army generals were led to Christ, maybe by their drivers or some domestic staff. There’s no one too great to be led into salvation.

Perhaps you’re a hairdresser or a makeup artist, and those who request your services are celebrities, the wealthy and influential of the society; go ahead and lead them to Christ. You must realize that your earthly job, business, education or profession is your opportunity and vehicle for transporting the Gospel. If you get on transit, be it in a bus, a train or on the plane, witness to your co\-passengers; tell them about Jesus.

Never let an opportunity pass by that you’ve not utilized for the Gospel. This is what the Lord has set us on course for; so, be bold and fearless. Preach the Gospel to anybody and everybody.

## IT’S A REAL KINGDOM April 14th, 2022

>***Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God (Mark 1:14\).***

Jesus began His ministry talking and preaching about the Kingdom of God. Mark 1:14\-15 says, *“Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.”*

Observe the term Jesus used as He preached: “the kingdom of God is at hand.” “Is at hand” is one of two expressions: on the one hand, it means “It’s near”; on the other hand, it means “It’s here.” In John 3:3\-5, Jesus made it so plain; He said, *“…Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God…Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.”*

Notice the expressions “he cannot see” and “he cannot enter.” This shows that the Kingdom of God is real. You don’t see it with your optical eyes, but you see it in your spirit. We “entered” and became a part of the Kingdom when we were born again; that’s how the Kingdom became real to us and in us.

Jesus also used the expression “The Kingdom of Heaven.” Though many use both expressions interchangeably, they’re clearly different. The Kingdom of Heaven is more perfectly expressive of that part of the Kingdom of God established by Jesus in the earth. The Kingdom of God includes all of that which is under God in the earth and in Heaven. But the Kingdom of Heaven is that part of the Kingdom of God that’s functional in the earth, set up by the Lord Jesus Christ.

So, when Jesus came and said, “The Kingdom of God is at hand,” He was actually talking about the Kingdom of Heaven that He had come to set up, because the Kingdom of God was already there before Jesus came. Our Heavenly Father is the head of the Kingdom of God. 1 Corinthians 15:24 shows us that at the end of all things, the Kingdom of Heaven that’s been set up in the earth will be delivered to the Father because it belonged to Him all along. Hallelujah!

## PREPARING THE NATIONS FOR HIS RETURN April 15th, 2022

>***Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book (Revelation 22:7\).***

In Matthew 28:19\-20, the Master instructed, *“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations… Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”* The Lord Jesus gave us a message. It’s the message of salvation for the whole world, which He accomplished in His death and resurrection.

We’re to preach this message until He returns as He promised. Because the time for His return is nearer than ever, we must preach the Gospel now with greater fervency and urgency than ever before. This isn’t religion; it’s about Jesus Christ and His living message: that He came to die for all men, and that God raised Him from the dead that we may have eternal life and come into fellowship with God; and that He’s coming back for all who believe in Him.

He gave us the signs that’ll herald His coming, and we’re seeing many of those things happening in our world today. There isn’t that much time left. That’s why we’re preaching and calling every man to repentance: *“Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus”* (Colossians 1:28\).

The Bible gives us an interesting description of His coming. 1 Thessalonians 4:16\-17 says, *“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”* Can you see why you should be prepared by living for Him, every day?

Knowing that the coming of the Lord is closer than ever, take the admonition in Jude 1:4 to heart, living circumspectly, purposefully, worthily and accurately, not as the unwise and witless but as wise: “For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.”

Blessed be God for His unfathomable grace, wisdom and mercy, lavished upon His Church to effectively proclaim the Gospel and establish His righteousness in all the earth in these last days! This Easter, preach the Gospel like never before. Turn many from darkness and damnation into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. Hallelujah!

## WORKERS TOGETHER WITH HIM April 16th, 2022

>***I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in me — and I in him— bears much fruit, because APART FROM ME YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH NOTHING (John 15:5 NET).***

We’re workers together with the Lord (2 Corinthians 6:1\). In essence, without Him, you can do nothing, and without you, He can’t reach the world because you’re His vessel, His mouthpiece, the one He’s trusted to take His message of salvation to the ends of the earth.

Notice that I didn’t say, “Without you, God will not do anything”; I said, “He cannot.” It’s that strong. When He said, “Without me ye can do nothing,” He meant, cut off from vital union with Him, “apart” or “severed” from Him, you can’t do anything. The other side is just as true. Without you, He can’t do anything that concerns you; He can’t do anything in your life or in your world, because that’ll violate His Word, will and purpose.

In Mark 16:15, Jesus said, *“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”* You’re to go out with all boldness, faith, courage and conviction, knowing that the Lord already did His part. Remember, Jesus gave His life to save the whole world. John 15:13 says, *“Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.”*

Your purpose in the earth is to fulfil His dream. It’s to live for Him. Be compelled by the love of the One who gave His life so that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16\). Put your faith, your energies and whole life into preaching the Gospel. Nothing should be as important to you as your love for Jesus Christ, which you demonstrate in leading others to salvation.

## AN EXTRAORDINARY EVENT April 17th, 2022

>***And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight (Acts 1:9\).***

Jesus was crucified and buried. On the third day, God raised Him from the dead, showed Him alive openly. But something remarkable about Jesus after that resurrection from death, which was a mind\-blowing experience for all those who witnessed it, was His ascension to heaven.

While He was talking to His disciples on that occasion, suddenly, He levitated and ascended into the clouds before their eyes and went right into heaven. This was extraordinary.

Enoch was taken alive by God (Genesis 5:24\), and Elijah was taken alive with the chariot of fire by God (2 Kings 2:11\). Jesus ascended! This was how He left this world. No one ever disputed it, because there were too many witnesses.

While the disciples were standing there, looking into heaven at this wonder, two angels came to them and said*, “…Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven”* (Acts 1:11\). He is coming again. Blessed be God!

## HE PREORDAINED YOUR PATHS April 18th, 2022

>***For we are God’s \[own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, \[born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us \[TAKING PATHS WHICH HE PREPARED AHEAD OF TIME], THAT WE SHOULD WALK IN THEM \[living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).***

As a Christian, God prepared your path, the path in life that you should follow. Predestination is at work in you. Take a moment to think about what we read in our opening verse; it’s so sublime: we were recreated in Christ Jesus for good works which God planned beforehand for us, taking paths which He prearranged.

This simply means that your life is set on a course. You’re not an accident. There’re those who are on a path that’s different from the path that God prearranged for them. They live in the wrong house, in the wrong city, they went to the wrong school, they have the wrong friends. Some are in the wrong job or business; they have the wrong associates and are in the wrong associations in life. They’re not aware that God has a special path prepared for them; so, they’re toiling and struggling through life.

Everyone has a definite path that he’s supposed to follow, and if you don’t know, you’d think life is just according to impulses. For example, perhaps after your graduation from the university, you opted to do a second degree; the question is, why?

Maybe it’s because your parents said so; maybe you just liked the idea of acquiring a second degree, or maybe you saw your friends going for it and you decided to get on the bandwagon. But did you ever ask God whether or not that was consistent with His plan and purpose for your life?

Most people never bother to find out God’s plan for their lives let alone see to it that they fulfil it. But that’s the greatest thing in your life—discovering God’s purpose and fulfilling it. Be wise and know that you need to talk to God about what you should do, the direction you should go, because everything God wants you to achieve in life has been pre\-ordained.

If you want the best from God, if you want to live in His perfect will, you’ve got to walk in the path He prearranged for you, and it’s a path of righteousness, great glory, greatness and unending victories. Glory to God!

## A REPLACEMENT OF THE OLD WITH THE NEW April 19th, 2022
![April 19th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-19-a-replacement-of-the-old-with-the-new-res.jpg)

>***For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; THAT WE SHOULD SERVE IN NEWNESS OF SPIRIT, and not in the oldness of the letter (Romans 7:5\-6\).***

Our opening scripture is part of Apostle Paul’s letter to the Church in Rome, where he admonished them to serve God in newness of spirit and not according to the old ways of the flesh. Why is this important? It’s because the Christian is essentially a new creation, a brand new man, born with the life and nature of God. Therefore, to serve God in newness of spirit means to serve Him in your present state as one who’s been recreated in righteousness and true holiness, and not according to the Law or the senses. 

This brings us to an understanding of what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:17 that if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature; old things—the old life of the flesh and everything associated with it—are passed away, and all things have become new. Being born again, you’ve put on the “new man” who, according to Colossians 3:10, is renewed in knowledge in the image of God that created him. Think about that! No wonder the Bible says as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17\).

Romans 6:6 says, *“Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.”* The old life was supplanted with the life of Christ. It wasn’t just a mere change that took place in you when you were born again; it was a translation, a replacement of the old with the new. It’s a brand new life. This new life transcends this world. It can’t be tainted by the corrupting influences of the earthly realm.

Romans 6:4 says, *“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”* The expression “newness of life” means that the old life has been completely replaced by a new one that never existed before. This new life has its origin in God. Glory to His Name forever!

## QUANTUM LEAP IN GRACE April 20th, 2022
![April 20th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-20-quantum-leap-in-grace.jpg)

>***Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord (2 Peter 1:1\-2\).***

Blessed be God! The Bible says God gives more grace. Don’t be satisfied to be at the same level of grace for too long; press for more. Always desire new levels of His glory and grace in your life. 

In our theme verse, the Apostle Peter was addressing Christians who already received the grace of God and he said, “Grace and peace be MULTIPLIED unto you.” You can have grace multiplied, not just added. That means grace, many times more! How does this happen? It’s *“...through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.”*

The Greek word for knowledge is “epignosis” and it means exact or precise knowledge; full knowledge with intimacy to the object of this knowledge. Meaning that the more you get to know God through the Word, the more you experience quantum leaps in grace— exponential grace.

Without “epignosis,” your grace will be stagnant. Don’t let that happen to you; go for more of God’s Word. Meditate on the Scriptures and the grace of God will be multiplied in your life. Also, walk in humility and love. The Bible says God resists the proud, but gives more grace to the humble (James 4:6\).

With multiplied grace, you can accomplish more for the Lord! His beauty, glory and goodness are released in and through you in a way that impacts everything and everyone around you. Glory to God!

Through conscious and intimate fellowship with the Word and the Holy Spirit, I’m brought into an esoteric knowledge of God and of the Lord Jesus. Therefore, His grace is multiplied in my life, every day. That grace attracts the right people, circumstances and resources in line with God’s purpose into my life. I experience quantum leaps in grace, basking in higher levels of God’s glory, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

>***The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple (Psalm 19:7\).***

Your personal growth as a Christian is non\-negotiable. And you can only grow and become more effective in the things of God by consciously making up your mind to study, meditate and live by God’s Word. The Word of God builds you; it empowers, inspires, uplifts, motivates and gives you clarity of purpose.

With that clarity of purpose, you’re definite and focused on the steps you’re to take in fulfilling your God\-given destiny. God already planned the course and direction of your life; everything is programmed inside you. He did the programming through His Word. That’s why the Word is so important in our lives.

2 Timothy 3:16\-17 AMPC says, *“Every Scripture is God\-breathed (given by His inspiration) and profitable… So that the man of God may be complete and proficient, well fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work.”* It’s impossible for anyone whose life is regulated and propelled by the Word to fail or be disadvantaged. Living by the Word makes you an absolute success: *“This Book of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe and do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall deal wisely and have good success”* (Joshua 1:8 AMPC).

Study and know the Scriptures for yourself. 2 Timothy 2:15 says, *“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”* When you study the Word meditatively, the Holy Spirit illuminates your spirit with amazing truths that’ll culture your mind in the direction of consistent growth, progress and prosperity.

The Word of God is where the glory is. That glory constantly increases in your life as you meditate on the Word. This is the reason some Christians have more glory than others; it’s about yielding to and living the Word.

## INCREASING YOUR FAITH April 22nd, 2022
![April 22nd, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/april-22-day-22-increasing-your-faith.jpg)

>***For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith (Romans 12:3\).***

The first step to increasing your faith is knowing how faith comes: Faith comes by hearing: *“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”* (Romans 10:17\). Therefore, if you’re going to have more faith, you have to hear more of God’s Word. You can’t be listening to negative things that produce fear and expect your faith to increase; that’ll only build more fear in you.

Inundate your spirit with the Word. Some people face certain challenges and are overwhelmed because they’re operating at a level of faith that’s too low to deal with the situation. Yet, it’s possible to have a lot of faith that’s weak. Weak faith is the result of the lack of exercise of faith.

So, hearing God’s Word is one thing, but until you act on the Word you’ve received, your faith will be weak and you’ll stagger when you face adversities. So, grow your faith strong through the exercise of your faith. Strong faith is prevailing faith; it doesn’t stagger: *“Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God”* (Romans 4:18\-20\).

A rapacious appetite for the Word of God will of necessity bolster faith in you to tame circumstances, keep Satan where he belongs, and cause you to live triumphantly every day. But you must keep exercising your faith to keep it strong.

## OUTFLOW OF WORDS April 23rd, 2022

>***In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (John 7:37\-38\).***

Let’s review what we just read: Jesus said if you believe in me as the Scripture has said, out of your belly—your innermost being—shall flow rivers of living water. When He says rivers of living water, what does that mean? What are these living waters? They’re words, rivers of living words.

Many had thought the rivers of living water refer to the outflow of the Spirit from us; no, they’re actually words of life. The Spirit is transmitted in words, because words are spirit. Jesus said in John 6:63, *“...the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.”*

We pour out spirit when we pour out words. When you take the Word of God from within your spirit and speak it forth, when you prophesy, you’re pouring out rivers of living water. This is what the Bible says, and if we follow the Word, we’ll always have the right results.

 Study the New Testament; you’d find that whenever the apostles were filled with the Spirit, it resulted in outflow of words: they spoke the Word of God with boldness (Acts 4:31\); the Word of the Lord grew and multiplied (Acts 6:7, Acts 12:24\).

Being filled with the Spirit always resulted in an outflow of words. That’s why you must put a premium on words. Every so often, get yourself filled with the Spirit according to Ephesians 5:18\-20 and pour out words—gushers of living water! Those words will tame the world, change circumstances and give life to everything in and around you.

## EVER-EXPANDING MINISTRY April 24th, 2022

>***For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you. But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you... (Romans 15:22\-24\).***

I’m so inspired by Paul and his visionary posture towards the ministry of the Gospel. Think about what we just read in our theme verse: He was explaining to the church in Rome the reason he hadn’t come to see them. He said, “I’ve been busy evangelizing other areas, but now I’m through; I don’t have any more places remaining where I haven’t preached Christ. So, now I can come to you on my way to Spain.”

When you study the life of Paul and the other apostles of the Lord in the Book of Acts, you find an ever\-expanding ministry. In Acts chapter 2, the previously frightened disciples suddenly became bold after they received the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost. Peter preached his first message and three thousand souls were saved: *“Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls”* (Acts 2:41\).

In the 3rd chapter, into the beginning of the 4th chapter, we read how Peter healed a paralyzed man who begged for alms at the gate of the temple called Beautiful. As a result, the people ran together and crowded around them. There, Peter used the opportunity to preach, and this time, five thousand souls were saved: *“Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand”* (Acts 4:4\).

In Acts 4:31, we read that after the apostles had prayed and were all filled with the Holy Ghost, *“... they spake the word of God with boldness.”* Again, the result was that a multitude of people believed (Acts 4:32\). The apostles were preaching the Gospel and working miracles. Acts 5:12 tells us, *“And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.”* Then it says in the 14th verse, *“And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women).”* 

Observe the progression. The first time, three thousand souls believed at once. The next time, the number of those who believed was about five thousand (women and the children not counted). Then, a multitude! It didn’t end there; in Acts 5:14, Luke calls those who had believed “multitudes!” That’s ever\-expanding ministry.

## SPEAK WISDOM ALWAYS April 25th, 2022

>***Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit, which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual (1 Corinthians 2:12\-13\).***

Notice that our theme scripture says, “Which things also we speak”; then reading further, it clarifies what those things are—wisdom! We speak wisdom. 1 Corinthians 2:6\-8 makes it even clearer; it says, *“Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.”*

Speaking wisdom is speaking the Word. It discomfits the adversary; they can’t get in on it! For example, the Word says you’re a partaker of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4\); that’s the wisdom of God. Therefore, when you, on the basis of that scripture, declare, “I’m an associate of the God\-kind, a partaker of His grace, glory and expression of His righteousness,” you’re speaking wisdom.

When you declare, “All things are mine,” you’re speaking wisdom. When you say, “I have the life of God in me; I live in agelessness, ‘wantlessness,’ deathlessness and fearlessness,” you’re speaking wisdom.

Declare what the Word says concerning you, irrespective of the situation. Affirm your righteousness, health, dominion and oneness with the Lord with boldness. Speak wisdom always and your life will glorify God.

## EVERYONE IS FIT FOR THE MASTER’S USE April 26th, 2022

>***For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth… (Romans 1:16\).***

When you study the Scriptures, you’d find that some soul\-winning strategies we’ve often promoted may only be effective theoretically and not practically. For example, we may say bankers should reach the world of bankers with the Gospel, or judges should witness to other judges, etc. While that’s a nice strategy, we should always bear in mind that everyone is fit for the Master’s use; meaning, anybody can reach anybody with the Gospel.

You don’t have to be an engineer to lead engineers to Christ. That’s not how the Word of God spreads. We must all have the mentality that we’re missionaries—God’s agents of salvation everywhere we are—and therefore witness to everyone we meet. Consider the salvation of Naaman, a respected army general who had leprosy. Different people played vital roles in his testimony, especially a young Israelite maid.

The maid started with the general’s wife; she preached to her saying, *“…I wish my master would go to see the prophet in Samaria. He would heal him of his leprosy”* (2 Kings 5:3 NLT). The woman believed, and that’s how the matter got to the King of Syria and the result was Naaman’s miraculous healing and conversion.

Take advantage of your position, wherever God has placed you, and boldly preach the Gospel. There’re people God has divinely ordained that you’ll be the one to reach them, and He’s positioned you accordingly. They may be politicians, entrepreneurs, lecturers, health workers, etc.; yet, God has connected with them in a way that only you can talk to them about Jesus.

Wealthy people have places they eat, order groceries and other supplies. If you happen to run such places or are the delivery person, use the opportunity to tell them about Jesus. If you were the waiter or a butler in a fancy restaurant for only rich people, after attending to them, especially if they leave you a tip, tell them, “Sir, (or Ma’am) I have something for you too”; and then give them a copy of Rhapsody of Realities. That restaurant may be the only place and opportunity such people may have to receive the Gospel.

Let’s take advantage of our opportunities and take the Gospel to everybody. Our message in Christ is true and is no respecter of persons.

## EVER-INCREASING FAITH April 27th, 2022

>***Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our area of activity among you will greatly expand (2 Corinthians 10:15 NIV).***

The life we have in Christ is from faith to faith— ever\-increasing faith! Talking about the Gospel, the Bible says, *“For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith…”* (Romans 1:17 NKJV). The more you receive God’s Word, the greater your faith, because *“…faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”* (Romans 10:17\).

Open yourself to ever\-increasing faith; don’t stop where you’ve been; take off the lid. In some of Paul’s writings, we read of his emphasis on ever\-increasing faith. In 2 Thessalonians 1:3 for example, he compliments them on their increasing faith: *“…your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth.”*

If you have ever\-increasing faith, it’ll result in an ever\-expanding ministry. The same theme Scripture in the Amplified Classic says, *“We do not boast therefore, beyond our proper limit, over other men’s labors, but we have the hope and confident expectation that as your faith continues to grow, our field among you may be greatly enlarged, still within the limits of our commission.”* In other words, with ever\-increasing faith, you stay focused in your vision, while you’re expanding.

If you’re a leader in any capacity in the church, build your faith and the faith of your members. When your faith and their faith increases, the work will also greatly expand and increase. In a church or group where the faith of the people is low, the work of God will be low.

This helps you understand why the teaching of faith, the work of faith, and the life of faith are very essential. To learn more on Faith and how it works, order the book “How To Make Your Faith Work” from the Rhapsody of Realities App store. Hallelujah!

## THE CHURCH’S DOMINION IS FOREVER April 28th, 2022

>***And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matthew 16:18\).***

Some today are stupefied that the Church of Jesus Christ is still waxing strong, greater and more effective than ever. I wonder what they thought! They had postulated and were so sure that the Church of Jesus Christ would be consumed by their nefarious plans, but they were wrong.

Since the inception of the Church on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2, it has outlived its detractors, its persecutors, its haters, its adversaries and all its enemies. It’s impossible to destroy the Church. It’ll never happen. Those who boast against the Church, apparently, have forgotten their history!

When the Church was still young, in the Book of Acts, there were those who tried everything they could to stifle the Church, but still, the Church outlived them. It’s therefore a vain imagination for anyone or group to consider that the Church will either go extinct or somehow fizzle out and become history. The dominion and dominance of the Church is an endless one.

It reminds of the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s puzzling dream that no one could explain until God gave the interpretation to Daniel (Daniel 2\). In Daniel’s interpretation, all human structures, beginning with the king as the head of gold and all the silver, bronze, iron, and all the iron mixed with clay, would be destroyed by a “stone cut without hands.”

Then Daniel 2:44 says, *“And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.”* The stone that was cut out without hand was from God, and that stone destroyed the whole human structure and set up a kingdom, which the Bible says shall not be left to other people.

The Church will never fall to the dominion or domination of another; at the end, it’ll be standing strong, because the Church is forever. The Bible says about Jesus, the head of the Church, *“And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest, Who is made…after the power of an endless life”* (Hebrews 7:15\-16\). Hallelujah!

>***For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich (2 Corinthians 8:9\).***

The Bible says, *“The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it”* (Proverbs 10:22\). Poverty isn’t a blessing. That’s the reason Jesus delivered us from it. The Bible says He was rich, yet for our sakes, He became poor so that through His poverty, we might be made rich. He gave us prosperity in place of poverty, in the same way that He gave us His righteousness in place of sin.

When we say poverty isn’t a blessing, that’s not to say that when someone is poor, something is wrong with him or her; no! Anyone can make a choice. It’s like what the Bible says about many who suffered, not accepting deliverance, that they may obtain a better resurrection (Hebrews 11:35\).

There may be people who have chosen to live in poverty. If that’s your choice, it’s okay, because it’s the choice you’ve made. It’s a sacrifice, and you shouldn’t feel ashamed for making that choice. But if you became poor circumstantially or as a result of being oppressed by others or for some other reasons outside of your personal choice, then that’s not okay. You have a right to change things.

However, when you choose to be poor, don’t try to make anybody else poor, except they also seek from you the principles of poverty, that they also might become poor. But there’re some of us who are called to do certain things in the world for which reason we can’t and must not be poor. This isn’t because we love to be “rich” but because of responsibility, because of what we have to do. God is counting on us to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth. He said in Matthew 24:14, *“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”* The Gospel is free but it’s not cheap to publish.

The Lord said through the Prophet in Zechariah 1:17, *“…My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad….”* Refuse to be poor. Make up your mind that you’ll be as prosperous as God has ordained you to be. He said in 3 John 1:2, *“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”* He wants you to prosper spiritually, physically, and financially. Make a choice not to be anything less.

## MAKE UP YOUR MIND FOR EXCELLENCE April 30th, 2022

>***Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven (Matthew 5:16\).***

In our opening verse, the Lord Jesus instructs to let your light so shine that men may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. The word “good” here refers to something eminent, choice, surpassing, precious, useful, suitable, commendable, admirable—something excellent in its nature and characteristics, and therefore well\-adapted to its ends. 

This means that when you, as a child of God, commit to always executing your tasks and projects with excellence, your light will so shine before men that they’ll see your good works. Your good works will speak for you and men won’t be able to ignore you. God wants to deliver the world into the hands of His children who have been trained to walk in excellence; those who’ll go the extra length to deliver the best results. Does that describe you?

It’s time you appraised yourself and made the conscious choice to be the best at what you do. Reject half measures. Do excellent things. Excellence can’t be ignored. It reminds of what the Bible says in Proverbs 22:29: *“Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.”* When you have an excellent mind and do excellent things, you won’t take a back seat to anyone.

Excellence is for those who make a choice to do excellent things as a personal policy. Imagine it was revealed that an airline cut corners in their fleet maintenance and their pilots habitually skipped preflight checks, you wouldn’t want to board any of their planes. It’s for the same reason that you must refuse to cut corners or accept half measures in anything you do. It doesn’t matter whether or not someone would notice; just make the right choice for excellence and run with it.
