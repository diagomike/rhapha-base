>***And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions (Joel 2:28\).***

It’s quite significant how our opening verse likens the move of the Spirit in the last days to water: *“...I will **pour** out my Spirit upon all flesh….”* Prophet Isaiah puts it this way: *“Until the spirit be **poured** upon us from on high…”* (Isaiah 32:15\). Hosea 6:3 says *“… and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.”*

Also, in Zechariah 10:1, the Bible says, *“Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.”* So, the Spirit was going to be “poured” from on high in the last days like rain. On the day of Pentecost, this rain poured out from Heaven on Peter and all the other apostles and they were filled with the Holy Ghost: *“And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance”* (Acts 2:4\).

From then on, they spoke the Word of God with boldness. One day, while Peter was preaching in the house of Cornelius, a Roman Centurion, the Bible says the Holy Ghost “fell” on all of them that heard the Word (Acts 10:44\). He fell on them like rain.

Then in John 7:38, we read the beautiful words of the Master; He said, *“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.”* If you’ve received the Holy Spirit, this refers to you. Just like Peter, you can go out in the power of the Spirit to share the Gospel with others and the Holy Spirit will fall on them like He did in Bible days. Chains will be broken and sicknesses will disappear; curses will be lifted and many will receive salvation. Glory to God!

We’re clouds full of water and out of our bellies flow rivers of living water! Through us, righteousness and salvation spring up in the earth, just as the Bible says: *“You heavens above, rain down righteousness; let the clouds shower it down. Let the earth open wide, let salvation spring up, let righteousness grow with it; I, the LORD, have created it”* (Isaiah 45:8 NIV).

## THE DEITY OF CHRIST June 2nd, 2022

>***Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God (John 5:18\).***

Until you discover who Jesus really is, you can’t walk with Him. Jesus is Adonai; He’s the Lord God! The very thought of this blows the mind. No wonder the Jews had difficulty accepting Him. They accused Him of making Himself equal with God because He said God was His Father.

They knew that when someone says, “God is my Father,” it doesn’t mean God gave birth to that person, because God is a Spirit. They understood what Jesus was saying: He Himself was Jehovah in human manifestation! In John 10:30, He made another staggering declaration that made them angrier. He said, *“I and my Father are one.”* In other words, “We’re one and the same; if you’ve seen Me, you’ve seen the Father.”

Now, the Jews got really crazy and they took up stones again to stone Him. But Jesus interrupted them and asked, *“...Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?”* They replied, *“...For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God”* (John 10:32\-33\).

Notice the two charges brought against Jesus. The first one was blasphemy for saying God was His Father. The second was robbery, because being a man, He made Himself God. He was therefore condemned with robbers. But the Bible says in Philippians 2:5\-6, *“Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.”*

This verse was a direct response to the Jewish charge against Jesus that He was a thief for declaring Himself to be equal with God. Jesus didn’t think He was robbing God by being equal with God, because He was in the form of God. The Greek word for “form” is “morphe,” which means “nature.” In other words, He was in the very nature or essence of God. Though He looked like a man, He was in the form of God. In essence, Jesus is God! This is one of the cleverest communications in the New Testament about the deity of Jesus Christ. His claim to deity is right.

## HE DELIGHTS IN OUR PRAYERS June 3rd, 2022

>***And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full (John 16:23\-24\).***

Prayer is our way of bringing the power of the Spirit of God to bear on our world. That’s why He leads us always to pray and effect changes in our world. The prophets prayed; Jesus prayed; the apostles prayed, and they all taught us to pray. There are lots of results we’ll never see except we pray. It’s God’s way of relating with us; He asked us to do it.

Isaiah 45:19 shows us what God thinks when it comes to prayer: *“I publicly proclaim bold promises; I do not whisper obscurities in some dark corner so that no one can know what I mean. And I didn’t tell Israel to ask me for what I didn’t plan to give! No, for I, Jehovah, speak only truth and righteousness”* (TLB). He’ll never ask us to pray for something He didn’t plan to give to us. He tells us to pray because He plans to answer.

Some people don’t know this; so they get discouraged when they pray and it seems what they’re praying about hasn’t materialized. Some others pray “religiously,” not expecting to receive answers. If only they knew that the glory of God is in answering our prayers. He delights in answering our prayers. He loves to see us actualize our hopes and dreams, and then we praise Him for it.

Have the audacity of faith to expect answers when you pray, because the Lord derives glory from answering your prayers. It brings to mind the words of Jesus in John 15:8: *“Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.”* His joy is for you to have a fruitful, productive and effective walk in righteousness.

## THERE’S POWER IN YOU June 4th, 2022

>***Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us (Ephesians 3:20\).***

You’re full of power. There’s authority and there’s power. We have authority in the Name of Jesus, but we have power in the person and presence of the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah!

You have, not only the highest authority, but also the extraordinary ability of God within your spirit. It doesn’t flow from Heaven to you; you got it when the Holy Spirit came to make His home in you. Hallelujah! All of the power of divinity is at work in you.

No wonder Jesus said in Matthew 10:8, *“Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.”* You have it, and that’s why you can give it! Hallelujah! That’s why Peter could say to the lame man at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, *“…such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk”* (Acts 3:6\); and the man was gloriously healed.

Peter knew he had something to give. He had great confidence in what he had. Today, you have the same Holy Spirit that Peter had. You have power in you. Jesus said, “And you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you…” (Acts 1:8\). Recognize, affirm, and put the power in you to work every day. Glory to God!

## SERVE GOD WITH REVERENCE June 5th, 2022

>***For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers (Romans 1:9\).***

When you study the life of the Apostle Paul, it’ll be very clear to you why he was so successful in ministry. Paul understood what it meant to serve God with, and from, your spirit—with true reverence. Isn’t that akin to what Jesus said in John 4:23\-24? He said, “God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in Spirit and in truth, for the Father seeks such to worship Him.” This was the life Paul lived.

When he said, “I serve God with my spirit,” he was simply stating how he lived every day. Now you can understand why he said in Philippians 3:3, “We are the true circumcision that worship God in the spirit….” There was a conditioning of his spirit through the Word and fellowship of the Holy Spirit that made him a true worshipper.

This is the life we’ve been called to live. We’re to serve and worship the Lord with, and from, our spirits, with the reverence that He deserves. The Bible says, *“The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne…”* (Revelation 4:10\). They showed reverence to the Lord in worship.

Sometimes, that reverence could be an outward prostration, but the prostration of the heart is more important. Many don’t understand what it is to have reverence for God. Some Christians speak in tongues irreverently, forgetting that they’re speaking to God and not man. The Bible says he that speaks in an unknown tongue isn’t speaking to men, but unto God: in the spirit, he’s speaking mysteries to God (1 Corinthians 14:2\). Why then should a child of God speak to God so irreverently? Such irreverence among some Christians reflects in their lives, in their words and actions.

Always have the consciousness of the presence of God. It’ll help you maintain not just an attitude, but a life of reverence, where you give true worship to God.

## THE NAME ABOVE ALL June 6th, 2022
![June 6th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/june-22-day-6-the-name-above-all.jpg)

>***That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth (Philippians 2:10\).***

Our opening verse is so profound! It says every knee should bow to Jesus. Who could this be? Who is this Jesus that at His Name every knee has to bow? There’s only One who claims that every knee should bow to Him, and that’s the Lord God: *“Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear”* (Isaiah 45:22\-23\).

We then find in Psalm 138:2 that the name “Jehovah” is encapsulated in the very Name Jesus: *“… for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.”* Jesus is the Word magnified and personified. The Bible says He’s *“far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come”* (Ephesians 1:21 NIV). We’ve been given that Name to live by, to use, and it works all the time.

Some people have narrated how, when they were sleeping, some force came over them and pushed on their chest. They struggled to get rid of whatever it was to no avail and tried to call the Name of Jesus, but their mouths were heavy. However, the moment they were able to get the Name of Jesus out of their mouths, the thing disappeared instantly. Hallelujah!

When we call the Name of Jesus, things happen in the realm of the spirit. Angels are dispatched on your behalf. Demons bow and limitations are destroyed. Situations turn around for your good. Call that Name today. Call it over your city. Call it over your state. Call it over your country. Call it over this world! We’ve been given a treasure so great, and it behooves us to use it. It’s the Name of Jesus!

## THE POWER OF THE SPIRIT IN YOUR WORDS June 7th, 2022

>***It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life (John 6:63\).***

The excitement during our worship, praise and thanksgiving would not produce life if the contents of the songs aren’t delivered in words that are consistent with the New Testament of Christ. No matter the shouting, without the Spirit, it’s empty shout. The Spirit makes the difference.

When you speak the right words, the Spirit acts upon them. For example, it’s the reason we can speak from where we are and say to someone who’s thousands of miles away, “Be healed,” and a blind person in China will receive his sight, or someone in faraway Mongolia who’s been crippled from birth starts walking.

Such things happen because of the power of the Spirit in our words. Words recognize no seasons or barriers. Words are things; they’re tangible and potent with creative energy. So, don’t say, “Well, I wasn’t serious when I said it”; in the realm of the spirit, everything you say is living and active. It’ll work for you or against you. That’s the reason we emphasize speaking the Word only; speaking truth.

The Bible says, *“For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned”* (Matthew 12:37\). Don’t use words carelessly. Know, think, talk and sing the Word—whether in merrymaking or in praise to God! Let your life be consistent with God’s truths, and you’d be amazed at the resultant blessings in your life.

## THE BATTLE HAS BEEN WON June 8th, 2022
![June 8th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/june-22-day-8-the-battle-has-been-won.jpg)

 ---

>***...help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee (2 Chronicles 14:11\).***

In the Scriptures, we find certain instances where God’s people were overwhelmed by their adversaries in numbers and weapons. In the days of King Asa, Judah was completely outnumbered by Zerah, the Ethiopian King, who invaded Judah with an army of a million men and three hundred chariots.

Asa cried out to the Lord and the Lord gave him supernatural victory (2 Chronicles 14:12\). Then you find the story of Jehoshaphat, the King of Judah. Judah was surrounded by three enemy nations that were ready to attack her—Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir. The king gathered all Judah together to seek the Lord in prayer and fasting, and God said through a prophetic message, *“...fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you”* (2 Chronicles 20:17\).

God told them how to approach the war and was definite: He said, “Tomorrow, go out against them!” Not only that, He revealed the exact location of the enemies’ camp and gave them the strategy to defeat them. Employing the strategy God gave them, Jehoshaphat organized and placed singers, the Levites, in front to praise the beauty of God’s holiness.

The result was a great victory for Jehoshaphat and all Judah. Think about it; not a single sword lifted, yet God’s people recorded an overwhelming victory against three enemy nations. This is our reality as new creatures in Christ Jesus; we’re undefeatable. The battle was already won before we came on the scene. What God expects is for us to give Him praise. This is what we must do in our churches. Our churches have to be filled with songs of praise to God.

It makes no difference what you face in this world, be full of praise, and worship the Lord, because the battle has been won! No wonder He says, *“My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations”* (James 1:2\). Then in Romans 8:37, He says, *“Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.”*

## PRAYER AND THE SPOKEN WORD June 9th, 2022

>***And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God (Ephesians 6:17\).***

In Ephesians 6:10\-18, everything the Apostle Paul listed was a protective part of our armour. The only offensive tool is “the sword of the Spirit,” which is the “Rhema” of God—the Word of God that’s spoken from your mouth—the out\-breathing of the inspired Word of God for the hour and the season.

This is akin to the Apostle John’s description of the Lord in Revelation 1:16: *“…out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword....”* We find a similar expression in Revelation 2:16: *“…I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.”* This doesn’t mean a sword protrudes out of His mouth; rather, it refers to the Word of God!

Now, observe the connection between the 17th and the 18th verses of Ephesians 6 in the underlined portion: *“And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the **word of God**: **Praying** always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.”*

It says while you’re declaring the Word, getting on the offensive against the adversary, pray for all saints! He’s emphasizing prayer and the spoken word. So, declare God’s Word always, and pray that God’s people are strengthened and emboldened to continually take their place as agents of change in the nations of the world. Praise God.

## THE FLESH HAS BEEN CRUCIFIED June 10th, 2022
![June 10th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/june-22-day-10-the-flesh-has-been-crucified.jpg)

>***This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh (Galatians 5:16\).***

The flesh is basically about your senses and appetites, and the things you desire to do. And the Bible tells us, *“...they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts”* (Galatians 5:24\). Notice that verse doesn’t say, “They that are Christ’s are trying to or praying to crucify the flesh with the affections and lusts.” For the one crying to the Lord to help crucify the flesh, he’s praying the wrong prayer, struggling for nothing!

Don’t find yourself in a struggle. If that’s the case, stop right away and say, “From this day, Jesus Christ is the Lord over my mind, over my appetites and over my desires; I have overcome the flesh and its passions and appetites; I’m Christ\-minded.” Fill your thoughts with the words of Christ; that’s what you need.

If the Word of God controls your mind, you’ll be a master. The Lordship of Jesus is the end of all struggles. When Jesus is the Lord of your body, you do what Paul explained in Romans 12:1: you present your body to Him, because your body is His body.

1 Corinthians 6:15 says, *“Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.”*  Be bold and confident that you’re God’s headquarters. The body in which you live is God’s property; you’re living inside as a tenant and custodian; you’re taking care of it for God.

Romans 8:12\-14 says, *“Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”* You live in the Spirit; therefore, walk in the Spirit and you shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.

## GIVE ATTENTION TO PRAYER AND THE WORD June 11th, 2022

>***But we will continue to devote ourselves steadfastly to prayer and the ministry of the Word (Acts 6:4 AMPC).***

When we talk about being equipped and positioned for a life of consistent victory and dominion, it’s about giving attention to the Word of God, and prayer in its various dimensions and applications. In other words, prayer is of different kinds, and it’s important to know how to pray effectively by applying the different rules for different kinds of prayer.

Paul said, *“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit…”* (Ephesians 6:18\). So, you learn to pray ALWAYS. The Lord Jesus taught that, *“...Men ought always to pray, and not to faint”* (Luke 18:1\). 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says, *“Pray without ceasing.”* All through the Scriptures, there’s such strong emphasis on prayer because of its profound blessings and benefits.

Also, God’s Word is of utmost importance in our lives; you must study, understand and live by God’s Word. Jesus said in John 8:31, *“…If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed”* (John 8:31\). In John 8:32, He said, *“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”* His Word is truth.

2 Timothy 2:15 says, *“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”* Joshua 1:8, *“This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.”*

In Colossians 3:16, the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, says, *“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom….”* Place a premium on the study of the Word of God and prayer. It’s what you need for a balanced spiritual life, where you triumph gloriously every day.

## CHANGE THE COURSE OF YOUR WORLD June 12th, 2022

>***They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course (Psalm 82:5\).***

What a lamentation! It’s so striking that the Psalmist says, *“…all the foundations of the earth are out of course.”* This means things are out of direction; they’re in a state of confusion. It’s like what he says in Psalm 11:3: *“If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?”* In the world today, a lot of foundations are out of course. Some people have tried to destroy the economic foundations of different nations. They’ve also tried to crush the foundations of godliness in our societies. Same for health, education, family and more.

As Christians, we shouldn’t fold our hands and watch the devil wreak havoc in different nations and in the lives of men. God expects us to do something about it. He says, *“Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked”* (Psalm 82:3\-4\). Don’t be ignorant of this. Don’t be content with only meeting your personal needs and chasing your own dreams. You have what it takes to change the course of your world.

Hebrews 11:3 says, *“Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God….”* The word “framed” is “katartizo” (Greek), and it means to repair or adjust, to restore, mend or make perfect. This means that with faith, you can repair the foundations of the earth that are out of place and put them back on course. You can fix those circumstances and situations in your world that are inconsistent with the will of God.

By declaring faith\-filled words, you give shape, structure and beauty to your world. It makes no difference how bad the current situation is, you can mend what needs mending, you can restore what needs restoration, and you can fix anything that’s been ruined. What you need is to use the Word to keep the adversary in defeat. Use it to frame the course of your world to line up with God’s plan and purpose. Hallelujah!

## OPERATE FROM THE SPIRIT REALM June 13th, 2022

>***If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me... (1 Corinthians 15:32\).***

From studying the Scriptures on Paul’s ministry at Ephesus, we understand that he wasn’t fighting animals like a gladiator. It was actually illegal to make Roman citizens gladiators. We also know he never went into the bush to fight animals, neither was he engaged in any physical combat with men. So, what did he mean when he said he “fought with beasts at Ephesus?”

In 2 Corinthians 1, he again described this horrible experience, explaining that he and his companions were pressed beyond measure and despaired even of life: *“For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life”* (2 Corinthians 1:8\).

God, however, delivered them from this great peril. But they had been in prayer, and other saints were also interceding for them: *“Ye also helping together by prayer for us…”* (2 Corinthians 1:11\). They had been wrestling. Their struggle wasn’t with flesh and blood; it wasn’t against humans. It was spiritual.

Paul dealt with the wickedness of men against him from the realm of the spirit. When you come to spiritual maturity, you don’t confront human beings when they’re mistreating you; you confront the spirits responsible for their actions. That’s what Paul did when he said, “I have fought with beasts at Ephesus.”

When you exercise dominion over these evil spirits and break their influence over the people, they’ll stop thinking and acting the way they used to, because the spirits responsible for their actions have been bound or expelled.

Are the leaders of your country making wrong decisions? Don’t get angry with them. In many cases, they’re unaware that their wrong decisions are a result of demons talking to them and putting thoughts in their minds. With intercessory prayer and using our authority in the Name of Jesus over demons, we can change the situation in our cities and nations.

We must, in prayer, break the influence of demons over the governments and leaders of our nations. Be bold to exercise this power in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ!

## SERVE GOD IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HOLINESS June 14th, 2022

>***Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God (2 Corinthians 5:20\).***

From the verse above, we see the Apostle Paul’s careful use of words. In verse eighteen, he said, “We (all of us) have been given the ministry of reconciliation.” Then he presses home the importance of this ministry of reconciliation, urging the Corinthian church to take the message to the world.

But Paul was after something else as well, which he communicates to them. After asseverating the importance of reconciling men to God, he went on to his next subject and says, *“Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God”* (2 Corinthians 5:20\).

When he said, “We are ambassadors for Christ,” he wasn’t referring to the whole church of Christ; rather, he was referring to himself and his companions who were with him such as Timothy, with whom he wrote this letter. He counselled the Corinthian church to be reconciled to God. The same people he had told to reconcile the world to God are now being told to be reconciled to God. Why?

It’s because they had not been living right. Therefore, he says to them, “Just as the Spirit has said, ‘go to the people of the world and reconcile them to God’, He’s also saying to you, repent and be reconciled to God.” This is important because as God’s people, we’re encouraged to be involved in the work of the ministry, to take the message of salvation to the unsaved and reconcile men to God. But while you’re at it, live a life that’s pleasing to the Lord.

Christianity is a call to righteousness and a walk in righteousness. Don’t live in sin. The Bible says sin shall not have dominion over you (Romans 6:14\). Serve God in holiness and righteousness. Stay in the Word and practise your Christianity, regardless of the pressures. Live the life of a righteous person every day.

## SUSTAIN THE GLORY THROUGH PRAYER June 15th, 2022

>***Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again (John 12:28\).***

Luke, by the Spirit, reports what happened to Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration as He prayed: *“And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering”* (Luke 9:29\). That means the glory increased. But that glory and power were from within Him. This is the transformation that each one of us can and should have through praying in the Holy Ghost. That’s the secret.

If you pray for a short time, you may not sustain the glory or it could fizzle out. For example, when we minister to people and lay hands on them, it does something for them at that moment. But it’s a completely different thing for that power to stay. To sustain the effect and the impact of the glory, you must give yourself to prayer—praying in the spirit.

You can’t spend your time in godless chatter and experience this. 2 Timothy 2:15\-16 (AMPC) says*, “Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analyzing and accurately dividing \[rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth. But avoid all empty (vain, useless, idle) talk, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness.”*

If you want to see your life go from glory to glory, avoid empty, vain, useless, idle talk; rather, give yourself to the ministry of the Word and praying in the spirit. 2 Corinthians 3:18 AMPC says, *“And all of us, as with unveiled face, \[because we] continued to behold \[in the Word of God] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are constantly being transfigured into His very own image in ever increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another; \[for this comes] from the Lord \[Who is] the Spirit.”*

If you’ve been studying the Word, beholding the glory of God, you’ve contacted something. Don’t let it leave you. Hold on to it. Sustain it through prayer and meditation on the Word.

## HE GAVE US HIS NAME June 16th, 2022

>***Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name (Philippians 2:9\).***

At the mention of the Name of Jesus, the Bible says every knee should bow. This is the sovereign decree of Almighty God; it’s a law in the spirit\-realm. When the Name of Jesus is called, everyone submits to it in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth. It’s impossible to resist the power of His Name. This is the Name He gave us to live by.

The Bible says, *“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus…”* (Colossians 3:17\). Do you know what this means? Many people pray in the Name of Jesus; but for some, it’s just a religious observation or rite. Some don’t even believe, but they pray in His Name anyway.

For those of us who believe in Him, the Bible says in Mark 16:17\-18, *“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”* Hallelujah! Imagine all that we can do in His Name. Isn’t this amazing?

In His Name, you can cast out demons; if any deadly thing enters your system, it won’t hurt you. In His Name, we heal the sick, cleanse the lepers and raise the dead. The Bible says, *“oh, the utter extravagance of his work in us who trust him—endless energy, boundless strength! All this energy issues from Christ: God raised him from death and set him on a throne in deep heaven, in charge of running the universe, everything from galaxies to governments, no name and no power exempt from his rule. And not just for the time being, but forever”* (Ephesians 1:19\-21 MSG).

He gave us so much authority so we can fix things in our world. He gave us His Name so that we can use it to dominate and influence this world for His glory and establish His righteousness in all the earth, and we’re at it. Blessed be God!

>***And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone (Matthew 14:23\).***

Prayer is part of our priestly ministry. The Bible says men ought always to pray and not to give up. The Lord Jesus showed us, with practical examples, the importance and power of prayer. Mark 1:35 MSG tells us, *“While it was still night, way before dawn, he got up and went out to a secluded spot and prayed.”* Luke 5:16 says, *“And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.”*

Jesus was disciplined with his prayer routine, and we ought to emulate Him. You’re a soldier in God’s army, and the hallmark of a soldier is discipline. Christianity is a call to a life of spiritual discipline. There’s a disciplined prayer life you ought to cultivate, and you can’t leave it out or leave it to chance.

You can’t say, “I’ll pray whenever I feel like”; no! In the army, you don’t do things when or because you feel like; you do things because you have to do them. You stick to the schedule; excuses aren’t tolerated. Scheduled times of prayer must be an integral part of your daily routine. First, you must have a personal prayer schedule. At such times, nothing else should be more important. Discipline yourself and pray; avoid distractions.

Secondly, take your corporate times of prayer seriously, whether you’re participating onsite or online. It’s one of the many benefits of being a member of a local church. Churches have structures, and members of the body of Christ generally belong to a church. Through the church structure, there could be prayer times allotted to different cell groups or even the whole church could be praying together at specific times. Be sure to be a part of it.

I send out notifications for prayer on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for us to pray for 15 minutes at 12 noon and 10pm local time on Kingschat via the PastorChrislive superuser. If you haven’t been praying with us on that platform, sign up and turn on the notifications on your device to join millions around the world in these special times of prayer.

## USE HIS NAME WITH EXPECTATION June 18th, 2022

>***Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk (Acts 3:6\).***

The Bible tells us about a man in Acts 3 who was laid daily at the gate of the temple so he could beg for alms. He was above 40 years of age and been lame from birth. One day, as Peter and John were going together into the temple, the man reached out to them for alms. They both stopped, and Peter spoke up and said, “I don’t have silver or gold, but what I have, I give you. In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.”

Confident that a miracle had happened, Peter got the man by the right hand and lifted him up, and the man’s ankle bones received strength; he was gloriously healed by the power of God. Jesus gave us the power of attorney to use His Name, to call His Name upon situations and circumstances. His Name has all power; use it with expectation.

If you believe in Jesus Christ, you have to trust His Name. You have to use His Name with confidence and faith. When Peter said to the man, “In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk,” the Bible says the man’s ankle bones received strength.

But no one saw his bones receiving strength. No one saw how the power of God worked in his bones. In the realm of the spirit, when you use the Name of Jesus, there’s a change. You may not see it until you act, and you’ll only act because you’re expectant. Had Peter not been expectant of a miracle, he wouldn’t have pulled the man up.

Every one of us in Christ Jesus who has received the Holy Spirit has something to give to our city, our state, our nation, and the whole world. He sent us in His Name to announce the Good News to them, that righteousness has come; eternal life is now theirs. Go out in expectation that many will receive your message and turn to righteousness. Hallelujah!

## THE RAPTURE ISN’T A HOAX June 19th, 2022

>***For soon and very soon, “The One who is appearing will come without delay (Hebrews 10:37 TPT).***

Some people believe the Rapture of the Church is a hoax. Their argument is that the word “rapture” doesn’t appear anywhere in the Bible, and even Jesus never talked about it. Well, there are many things Jesus didn’t say much about. For instance, His disciples were with Him for the few years He ministered on earth, yet they knew nothing about the Gentiles receiving salvation. Though He had taught them many things, they couldn’t find anything that gave them a clear understanding that the Gentiles were to be brought into salvation.

In fact, when Peter went to the house of Cornelius, the Roman Centurion, and the other disciples heard about it, they were angry with him. He had to explain to them his experience with the Spirit of God and how, without his (Peter’s) permission, the Holy Spirit came upon the Gentiles while he was still speaking to them.

James then opened the Scriptures and found where the prophets said the Gentiles would come into salvation. This was their first clue, until the mystery and revelation of the Body of Christ was given to the Apostle Paul.

It’s the same thing with the Rapture. You may not find the word “rapture” in any verse because at the time of writing, Paul described it as a mystery: *“Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed”* (1 Corinthians 15:51\). In 1 Thessalonians 4:17, the Scripture says, we shall be “caught up.” The Greek word is “harpazo,” which means to seize and take away. The Latin version translation is “raptura”, which in English is “rapture”; so it’s erroneous for anyone to suggest it’s not in the Bible.

Let no one deceive you; the Rapture is going to take place anytime soon. It’s closer than it’s ever been. It’s going to happen so fast that those who aren’t prepared and looking forward to it won’t have time to prepare and will be left behind. That had better not be you. Hebrews 9:28 says, *“…Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”*

## WE’RE HIS SENT ONES June 20th, 2022

>***To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:19\).***

Every Christian is called into the ministry of reconciliation. That means we’re called to be soul winners. And in carrying out our ministry of reconciliation, we’re not alone. The Lord is working with us—confirming the Word with signs following.

We’re His witnesses to the world that Jesus is God manifest in the flesh. He sent us to the whole world, to let them know that God isn’t counting their trespasses against them. There’s no one on earth today who’s suffering or would go to hell because of his or her sins. Why? Jesus already paid the full penalty for sin for everyone. Does that excuse sin? Emphatically no! But it’s important for us to see from God’s perspective and put things in their right places.

Did you know that Jesus went to hell? He did on our behalf because our sins were laid on Him. He suffered that no man would ever need to suffer. The only reason anyone would be condemned and go to hell is for the ignorance and rejection of salvation in Jesus Christ. Then, they’d face judgment, because they didn’t receive what was paid for them—the sacrifice of the blood of Jesus—that’s the reason for hell and the lake of fire.

But it’s not God’s will that any should perish and go to hell. That’s why He sent us to tell them who Jesus is and what He’s done for them. They can only know, believe, and receive eternal life if we take the message to them*: “For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach, except they be sent...”* (Romans 10:13\-15\). We’re His sent ones. Jesus said in John 20:21, *“…Peace be unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.”* Hallelujah! We bear His message of love, salvation and righteousness.

## THE TEACHER IN YOU June 21st, 2022

>***But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him (1 John 2:27\).***

In the light of so many different Bible translations today, how can one know which is most accurate? Sometimes, some of them say the same things differently and that’s tricky enough; but at other times, they say opposite things and it becomes really tough. One might put a verse in a question form, while another puts it in the affirmative. So it makes you wonder: Which is right?

There are several rules for scripture interpretation, but those rules are mostly academic. When you use these academic rules, you’ll only be as good as the theologians can be. Having a theological explanation is good, but you won’t be any better than those who already have different or questionable interpretations of the Scriptures. The question then would be: How do you know the actual truth?

The Holy Spirit is the author of the Scriptures. He knows everything in the Scriptures because He gave them to us. The Bible says*, “All scripture is given by inspiration of God…”* (2 Timothy 3:16\); that God is the Holy Spirit. He lives in us and carries out His ministry inside us.

The Bible says, *“...the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints”* (Ephesians 1:17\-18\). The Holy Spirit is the One who opens the eyes of our understanding, unveiling mysteries and secrets to us in the Scriptures. He’s the Spirit of knowledge; He knows all things and teaches us all things so that we can deal wisely in all affairs of life. Take your fellowship with Him more seriously; He’ll unveil His truths to your spirit in ways you never thought possible.

## INCREASING IN STRENGTH AND GLORY June 22nd, 2022

>***But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ (Acts 9:22\).***

Years ago, while I was having a lot of opposition, I set my face like a flint and focused on something God had told me. He said, “Be courageous; I will not fail you, and I will not forsake you.” It was an instruction from God. Therefore, it made no difference who was against me or what was happening around me; I couldn’t be bothered. There wasn’t going to be any fear. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, I was endued with courage and I’ve been ever since. 

When God tells you to be courageous, it’s because He knows there’s trouble out there. He knows some things will try to frighten you, discourage you and dissuade you; so He says, “Be courageous.” I made up my mind that I was going to do what God said; I was going to be very courageous.

Our theme verse says, *“Saul increased the more in strength….”* To increase in strength means that the Lord enabled him. The Greek actually expresses it as “to be made strong.” He was increased in strength; this is an inner strength. He was empowered from within to be able to accomplish more. This is what the Lord does for His children; He strengthens you from within.

As you increase in strength, you increase in glory. This is what has happened with the Gospel of Jesus Christ in these last days: it has increased in strength and it has increased in glory. We’re in a special time in the world today with Rhapsody of Realities reaching billions of people in their native language. Millions of ministries are partnering together with us for the common goal of taking the Gospel to the ends of the earth!

These aren’t the kinds of things anyone could have planned. They’re happening by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ. That grace is at work in you today to accomplish more than you’ve ever done for the Lord. You won’t be afraid; you won’t falter. You’ll rise up to the occasion and win, because you’re empowered from within. Hallelujah!

## HE DOESN’T ALWAYS GO FOR THE MOST QUALIFIED June 23rd, 2022

>***But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty (1 Corinthians 1:27\).***

Many years ago, the Lord spoke to me as a young teenager. This was my very first time of hearing personally from God. He said to me, “I want you to take my people into their inheritance.” At that stage of my life, I knew nothing about any inheritance; I was just a beginner! No one had taught me that we had any inheritance in Christ.

In children’s church, we learnt about serving God with reverence and love, and many beautiful Bible stories, but no one ever mentioned an inheritance in Christ. However, when God said to me, “I want you to take my people into their inheritance,” I just accepted. I simply believed Him without understanding what the instruction was about. I knew He would have to show me what it was, and He did; and I’ve been about it ever since.

My experience with the Lord very much mirrors what Paul the Apostle said in Ephesians 3:8: *“To me, though I am the very least of all the saints (God’s consecrated people), this grace (favor, privilege) was granted and graciously entrusted: to proclaim to the Gentiles the unending (boundless, fathomless, incalculable, and exhaustless) riches of Christ \[wealth which no human being could have searched out”* (AMPC).

Think about it: If He was looking for the most qualified people, Jesus should have been born of Caesar and brought up in a palace, but He wasn’t. The Bible says, *“For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called”* (1 Corinthians 1:26\).

2 Corinthians 3:5 says, *“Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.”* The word “sufficiency” can also be translated as competence or ability. He’s the One who has called you and endued you with supernatural ability to carry out His work. Never look down on yourself or think there’s nothing special about you. He’s made you competent; so, look beyond your physical ability. Always remember that you’re special to Him, and He’s divinely enabled you to fulfil His calling on your life.

## WALK IN THE SPIRIT June 24th, 2022
![June 24th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/june-22-day-24-walk-in-the-spirit.jpg)

>***If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:25\).***

Our normal life in Christianity is walking in the spirit. To walk in the spirit is to walk by faith (2 Corinthians 5:7\). That means our eyes are always on what the Word says, not on circumstances or feelings; not what the senses tell us.

When man committed high treason in the Garden of Eden, his spirit became subject to his senses: in other words, his spirit fell. Hitherto, his knowledge was spiritual, but when he fell through his disobedience to God, he became subject to his senses and this was what God warned him about*: “But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die”* (Genesis 2:17\). This was spiritual death!

Man ate of the tree, and he died. He was separated from God instantly. Prior to that time, Adam loved to be in the presence of God, but after his disobedience, he hid himself from that same presence (Genesis 3:9\-11\). God is life; and once a man is separated from Him, he can’t see the things that God sees anymore; he can’t see the glory of God. No wonder Adam saw himself naked afterwards.

When you’re walking in the spirit, you see the glory of God, His light, His beauty; you see the things that God sees; you see from His perspective. But when your spirit isn’t walking in the light of God, you’ll see what darkness shows you; you’ll see what the senses see. That’s what happened to Adam in the garden.

Romans 9:8 says, *“...They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God….”* The children of the flesh are those who are ruled by their senses. But thanks be unto God! Your ties with the first Adam have been severed completely and forever. You’re born after the Lord from heaven, and should walk accordingly—in and by the Spirit.

If you walk in the spirit, you’ll see that you’ve been put over the elements, failures, frustrations, darkness, and corruption in this physical world. You’ll see that you live in, and are from, another realm, a heavenly realm that’s greater than this world. Hallelujah!

## THE SAME RIGHTS IN CHRIST June 25th, 2022

>***...there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:28\).***

In certain places around the world, it is said that women ought not to preach. But the Bible doesn’t say that. Rather, the Bible says as new creatures, we’re all one in Jesus Christ. In the Law, there were certain rights that men had that women didn’t have. But now in Christ Jesus, we’re all one. Hallelujah! 

This means there are no limits to the woman as it was in the Law. The only time you’ll have a difference between a man and a woman in Christ is if they’re married. The Bible addresses the wife separately from her husband. But as long as a man and a woman are unmarried, they’re entitled to the same rights in Christ. 

Someone might say, “But in the New Testament, the Bible says, *‘But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence’* (1 Timothy 2:12\). Isn’t this referring to Christian women?” If you read the verse in context, you’ll discover that it’s referring only to married people. The next verse says, *“For Adam was first formed, then Eve”* (1 Timothy 2:13\), meaning that it was looking at the context of marriage.

Now, when it says a wife shouldn’t teach her husband, the actual rendering means “to instruct” or “to dictate to” her husband. He didn’t mean she couldn’t explain or guide the other into knowledge. Also remember that these are the last days the Prophet Joel wrote about: *“And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy…”* (Joel 2:28\).

To prophesy means to speak words of power, words that come from the Kingdom of God. Of course, they won’t just be speaking these words to themselves alone; they’ll also speak them to the unlearned. That means they’ll be teaching the unlearned the Word. So you see, it makes no difference whether you’re a man or a woman; go ahead and preach the Gospel everywhere. Preach the Word with power, and don’t let anyone stop you out of their ignorance. The four daughters of Philip the evangelist prophesied: *“…the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy”* (Acts 21:8\-9\).

## THE WORD IN YOU June 26th, 2022

>***…the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life (John 6:63\).***

Did you ever hear the expression, “You’re what you eat”? It’s true, because what you eat gets into your body. Anything that gets into your body and doesn’t become one with it passes out as waste. Only that which becomes one with your body remains in your body.

When you receive and digest the Word, it gets into your spirit. Through meditation, you cause it to go from your spirit through your mind. From your mind, it filters into your body and starts working in it. It becomes one with your flesh, and you become one inseparable entity. This is important because the Word of God is where the life of God is.

Remember the parable of the sower who went forth to sow his seed. Jesus said, *“...The seed is the Word of God”* (Luke 8:11\). What’s a seed? A seed is the life\-giving principle of anything. This means the Word of God is the life\-carrying principle of God; the Word is the seed of God. When the angel spoke to Mary and she believed, she received the Word from the angel, and that Word became Jesus.

When you receive the Word into you, it produces in you what it talks about. What does that mean? Remember, the Bible says, “*In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”* (John 1:1\). The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. Jesus Christ was the living Word, the Word in flesh. Now, we have the written Word. When you meditate on the written Word, it gets into you as the Word, and lives in you as God. Hallelujah! This is why we’re indestructible. We live and abide forever, because the Word in you, lives and abides forever (1 Peter 1:23\).

## WE’RE MORE THAN HUMANS June 27th, 2022

>***When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, ‘The gods have come down to us in human form’ (Acts 14:11 NIV).***

The Bible tells us how in Lystra Paul healed a man that was lame from birth. When the crowd saw it, they went wild and called him and Barnabas gods. They were about to worship them when Paul and Barnabas rushed to stop them, saying, *“Friends, why are you doing this? We too are only human, like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and everything in them”* (Acts 14:15 NIV).

At this point in their lives, the apostles thought they were mere humans; they said so and thought so. They said, “Look, we’re humans like you.” Their humility was right, but their answer was wrong. They were supposed to say to the people, “Don’t worship us. This is the message we’ve brought to you: that you also have the potential to become gods if you believe in Jesus.”

The people found out what these men really were. They discovered they weren’t humans; they were gods in the form of men, and they were right. The Bible says, *“I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High”* (Psalm 82:6\). Yet, you hear some Christians say, “We’re just ordinary people.” They think talking that way makes them humble. No! It just shows how ignorant they are.

We were ordinary until we were born again. Now that we’re born again, we’ve become the house of God. Each one of us is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, the creator of the entire universe, lives in you! Your body is His living tabernacle. This is a reality and it has to come into your consciousness. You have to think this way.

Until you become conscious of it, the power therein won’t work for you. Never again say, “I’m just an ordinary human being.” When you believed in Jesus Christ, you became a God\-man, an associate of the God\-kind. You were literally born of God. You’re actually a supernatural being. God made you exactly like Himself*, “…as he is, so are we in this world”* (1 John 4:17\). You have the life and nature of God now. Hallelujah!

## IT’S ALL ABOUT THE MASTER June 28th, 2022

>***And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved (Matthew 10:22\).***

When you study a story in Matthew 17:24\-27, you’ll discover that when some Jewish officials came to harass Peter about taxes, they didn’t ask him about his own taxes. Rather, they said, *“...Doth not your master pay tribute?”* (Matthew 17:24\). In other words, “Doesn’t your Master pay taxes?” They overlooked Peter and focused instead on the Master.

It’s always been that way: it’s all about our Master. The world hates us, not because of who we are, but because of who we represent—Jesus Christ. They’ll hate you for your faith in Him. No matter how good you are, how helpful you are, how kind you are, how successful you are; it won’t make any difference to them because you’re associated with Jesus Christ.

The hatred of Satan for Jesus is called the spirit of the world. The world hates Jesus. Many individuals who don’t even know Jesus enough still hate Him, and you wonder why. How can they hate someone they don’t even know? It’s because of the spirit of the world. It has captured a lot of people in the world, and it moves them in a way that makes them think about the Master with hatred.

They want religion, they want to pray, they want to believe in something, but when you tell them about Jesus, they reject Him vehemently. A man named Simeon said that this Jesus is “set for a sign that shall be spoken against” (Luke 2:34\).

There’re people now who claim that when we say Jesus is the only way, it’s “hate speech.” They’re construing many of the things we say as hate speech, thereby laying the foundation for a massive persecution of Christians in the last days.

Jesus said in Matthew 10:25, *“…If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?”* When you’re persecuted, always remember that you were sent, not in your own name, but in the Name of Jesus. Therefore, the Lord Himself shall be your defense, and reward.

>***...and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6\-7\).***

Our opening text was a major revelation from God to the Prophet Isaiah. He told him about a child that would be born and listed certain names by which He would be called. The first is “Wonderful Counselor.” In the original Hebrew text, the name, “Wonderful Counsellor” means “Extraordinary Strategist,” and this immediately reveals to us the ministry of the Holy Spirit: *“And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener, and Standby), that He may remain with you forever”* (John 14:16 AMPC).

In God’s prophetic plan, the child is born, grows up as a son, and dies. After His death, burial and resurrection, He comes to minister to us throughout the Church Age through the Holy Spirit, the extraordinary counselor, who is a strategic guide that helps us win in life.

At the end of the Church Age, the Lord Jesus comes to deliver Israel as the mighty God: *“…the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ”* (Titus 2:13\). During the Armageddon, Israel is the battlefront. The Jews go through Great Tribulation, and many of them would flee from the Antichrist in terror. Jesus, however, comes out of heaven with a great army of saints and delivers Israel. He takes actions against the Antichrist and all the enemies of God.

The next thing Israel experiences is the Everlasting Father. Though they’ve rejected Him for 2,000 years and haven’t believed in Him, they suddenly realize He’s the One who delivered them from the Antichrist, and they come to Him crying, *“He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities…Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him”* (Psalm 103:10\-13\).

Finally, He’s called the Prince of Peace. After delivering Israel and opening His arms to receive them, He establishes His Kingdom for 1,000 years. This will be 1,000 years of peace, and we’ll reign with Him over the nations of the earth (Revelation 20:4\-6\).

These days that I tell you about are not so far away. The first one, where Christ is manifested to the Church through the Holy Spirit, has been going on for nearly 2,000 years now and is coming to its climax. The Rapture isn’t so far away. So, live your life in preparation for the Master’s soon return.

>***Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God (1 Corinthians 10:32\).***

Before Jesus came, God recognized only two races in the world—the Jewish race and Gentile race. A Jewish race was the result of God’s choice and promise to Abraham and his seed. Every other person that wasn’t a Jew was a Gentile, no matter where they came from. When Jesus Christ came, He said in Matthew 16:18, *“…I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”*

In Ephesians 1:22\-23, He told us what that Church is: *“And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.”* The Church is His Body. Ephesians 5:30 tells us what the Body comprises: *“For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.”* So, Jesus said He’d build His Church—His Body—and we’re the members of that Body. Hallelujah! 1 Corinthians 12:27 says, *“Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”*

The Church race is made up of those who are born again from among the Jews and the Gentiles. *“For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us”* (Ephesians 2:14\). In Christ Jesus, there’s neither Jew nor Gentile: *“For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus”* (Galatians 3:27\-28\).

You lost your identity as a Gentile when you were born again, the same way Paul lost his identity as a Jew when he was born again. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”*  You’re now a part of the Church race, and that, to God, is the chosen race*: “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light”* (1 Peter 2:9 ESV).
