>***But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit (1 Corinthians 6:17\).***

We’re joined to the Lord and one spirit with Him. Our oneness with the Lord was God’s dream and it’s been realized in Christ. The Holy Spirit is responsible for that oneness. Jesus said, *“I and my Father are one”* (John 10:30\). How was Jesus one with the Father? It was through the Holy Spirit. It’s the same with you today.

2 Corinthians 6:16 says, *“…for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”* Now, He lives in you and walks in you. You’re a God\-carrying vessel.

In John 14:20, Jesus said, *“…I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.”* That means you’re in the Father in Jesus Christ, and He’s in you. That’s a divine connection!

Thus, your ability or sufficiency is of Him (2 Corinthians 3:5\). You’re connected through the Holy Spirit to the unlimited power of God with limitless possibilities and unending glory. Blessed be God!

## IT’LL PREVAIL IN YOUR CITY November 2nd, 2022

>***So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed (Acts 19:20\).***

Luke gives a historical report of some of Paul’s activities during his missionary journey in Asia, particularly Ephesus. Acts 19:8 says, *“And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.”*

But something began to happen: as he preached the Gospel in the synagogue, resistance began to form. Some of the Jews didn’t believe; rather, they publicly maligned the way of the Lord! The Apostle Paul, who quickly observed this, separated the disciples, holding daily meetings with them in the lecture hall of Tyrannus (Acts 19:9\).

Verse 10 tells us that this went on for a space of two years. And the result was that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the Word of the Lord. Acts 19:11\-12 (NIV) says, *“God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.”* This is what happens when the Word of God gains the ascendancy.

The same will happen in your nation, city, town, or community if you’d preach and teach the Word. Paul gave sufficient time to the preaching and teaching of the Word, so much so that an entire city heard the Gospel. If the Word of God could dominate and change the city of Ephesus, it’ll produce the same results in your life and in your world.

Use and apply the Word of God to change things in your world. That Word is in your mouth and it’ll prevail. Even now, open your mouth and pour forth righteousness upon your community, city, and nation! Seed your environment with the Gospel.

## PRIDE YOURSELF IN HIS ABILITY November 3rd, 2022

>***I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing (John 15:5\).***

The Lord said, *“…without me ye can do nothing.”* By your own human ability, ingenuity, wisdom, skills and competence, you can’t achieve anything. Therefore, never pride yourself in your seeming human abilities. Trust in the Lord.

Your success is wholly dependent on your connection to the Lord. Your competence is of Him (Read 2 Corinthians 3:5 AMPC). No wonder Paul made his boast in the Lord, saying, *“I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me”* (Philippians 4:13\). He didn’t say, “I can do all things because I’m so knowledgeable”; no. It’s about Christ and who He is in you—His ministry in and through you.

It brings to mind the story of Asa in 2 Chronicles 14\. The Bible tells us Judah was invaded by an army of a million men and three hundred chariots. King Asa and his army were completely outnumbered. Asa realized that the only way to victory was to completely rely on the Lord. 

In 2 Chronicles 14:11, Asa cried unto the LORD his God in heartfelt prayers, and said, *“…LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.”*

The Lord responded and gave Judah a remarkable victory: *“So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled”* (2 Chronicles 14:12\). Now, here’s something to notice about Asa: he didn’t sit idly by, thinking, “Whatever will be, will be”; he took action. Your step of faith is important. Having prayed, Asa and his army charged against the enemy forces and got the victory. Hallelujah!

## BAPTIZED “INTO” HIS NAME November 4th, 2022
![November 4th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-day-4-baptized-into-his-name.jpg)

 ---

>***Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19\).***

The name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost in the New Testament is Jesus. The apostles understood this and baptized people in the Name of Jesus. In Acts 19, Luke recounts Paul’s encounter with the twelve men in Ephesus who, like Apollos, were zealous followers of John the Baptist’s teaching of repentance but weren’t conversant with the baptism of Jesus.

After Paul’s dialogue with them, the Bible says *“… they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus”* (Acts 19:5\). It further makes it evident that the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost is Jesus. But something else that isn’t immediately obvious in Paul’s encounter with those twelve disciples in Ephesus is when he asked them: *“...Unto what then were ye baptized...”* (Acts 19:3\).

The word “unto” is from the same Greek word as “into.” So, when you’re baptized, you’re baptized “into” something. In essence, Paul was asking those men, “Into what then were you baptized?” This suggests something deeper than just being immersed in water for baptism.

The connotation of that verse is better deciphered in some newer translations such as the NIV. It says, *“On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.”* When you’re baptized in water, you’re baptized into Jesus Christ, not just in the name; that’s the significance of it.

Apart from the minister who’s baptizing you in the Name of the Lord Jesus, which is one part of it, the most significant thing is actually being baptized into the Name of the Lord Jesus. Water baptism, therefore, seals the legal aspect of your union with Christ (Romans 6:3\-4\). Blessed be God!

<details>
  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Thank you, Father, for giving us the Name of Jesus to live in, and to live by. I’m baptized into Christ, and I’ve become inseparably one with Him, for in Him I live, move and have my being! I live in, and by, the Name of Jesus, and I rule and dominate my world by the power of that Name. Glory to God!

## SAME GOD—SAME TESTIMONIES November 5th, 2022
![November 5th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-22-day-5-same-godsame-testimonies.jpg)

>***Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them (Acts 5:15\).***

The Bible tells us in Hebrews 13:8, *“Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”* Some have wondered if what we read of Peter in the opening verse above is still possible in our day. Absolutely! We see the same miracles and testimonies today because it’s the same God.

The Bible says handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched Paul’s body were placed on the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them (Acts 19:12\).

Similarly, we’ve received countless testimonies of how this very devotional you’re reading—Rhapsody of Realities—was placed on the sick and even the dead, and there were miracles: the sick got healed and the dead were raised back to life! This has happened multiple times in different parts of the world, because this material is from God.

Think about the story of a lady whose husband had died. She said to someone, “I heard that when people use Rhapsody of Realities, they raise the dead in your church. Please come with a copy to the hospital; my husband is dead.” The lady whom she had called took a copy of Rhapsody to the hospital and placed it on the dead body, and the man came back to life. Hallelujah!

You can immediately see the similarity between this and the story of the woman with the issue of blood in Luke 8:43\-48: “she heard”, and because she heard, she pushed her way through a teeming crowd to touch the hem of Jesus’ garment and was healed instantly.

The difference is the book Rhapsody of Realities is a far better repository of the power of God in that it contains God’s Word that you can study again and again, rather than the handkerchiefs or aprons on which nothing is written. Praise God!

## HE REIGNS THROUGH US November 6th, 2022
![November 6th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-22-day-6-he-reigns-through-us.jpg)

>***And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it (Colossians 2:15\).***

From our opening verse, we see that Jesus made a spectacle of Satan and his cohorts in hell. He spoiled principalities and powers and openly humiliated them. All the spirits of darkness saw this happen. The Conybeare translation says He disarmed them. Hallelujah! Now, He’s reigning over them and over all things.

1 Corinthians 15:25 says, “*For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.”* Jesus is in Heaven, seated at the right hand of God, a place of power. So, how then is He reigning? How does He reign over His enemies? Romans 5:17 gives us an idea; it says, *“For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”* He reigns through us!

When we reign, He reigns. And remember, the Bible tells us that grace reigns through righteousness: *“That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord”* (Romans 5:21\). Thus, while we live for Him as His light, His grace works in and through us; His grace for reigning. Hallelujah!

Our job is well cut out for us: it’s to reign in the realm of life and display the virtues and perfections of Christ (1 Peter 2:9 AMPC). This is why He wants us to learn and grow in His Word and put it to work. He wants us to run this world for Him, using the Name of Jesus. We’re the light of the world and we have overcome the adversary and all adversities; we win by the blessed Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah!

## PEACE WITH GOD November 7th, 2022
![November 7th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-22-day-7-peace-with-god.jpg)

 ---

>***Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid (John 14:27\).***

I would to God that everyone in the world would understand the magnitude and import of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ! Prior to His vicarious sacrifice on our behalf, the Bible says we were *“...aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world”* (Ephesians 2:12\). We were enemies of God.

But blessed be God! Romans 5:10 says He reconciled us to Himself by the death of Jesus Christ. Ephesians 2:13\-18 says, *“But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace; And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh. For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.”* Hallelujah!

Jesus paid the price and brought us into peace and union with the Father. No wonder Paul declares in Romans 5:1, *“Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”*The word “peace” is from the Greek “Eirene.” It describes an end to hostilities. It means to be set at one.

Through Christ Jesus, you’ve been set at one with God; you’ve come home in Him! There’s no need to live in fear of judgment; Jesus has already taken the punishment for your sins. Isaiah 53:5 says, *“…the chastisement of our peace was upon him….”* Hallelujah!

## THE WORD IN YOUR HEART November 8th, 2022

>***The sower soweth the word. And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts (Mark 4:14\-15\).***

Whenever you receive the Word of God into your heart, the forces of darkness, knowing the power of the Word, come quickly to attempt to steal it from your heart. This is what the Lord Jesus brought to light in the parable of the sower.

It explains why some folks hear the Word and don’t understand it. They find it difficult to comprehend why, right after receiving a wonderful prophecy, all hell seems to break loose against them. It’s because Satan will do everything to steal the Word from their hearts; he’ll throw all his darts and accusations at you in a bid to steal the Word from you. He tried this trick even with the Lord Jesus, questioning the Word that had been spoken concerning Him by asking Him to prove Himself (Luke 4:3\). Of course, the Master successfully repelled the enemy because He had the Word well\-grounded in His heart.

You have to deliberately guard the Word in your heart. Colossians 3:16 says, *“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly…”*; that means let the Word settle and take root in your heart. That way, no matter how hard the enemy tries to steal it from your heart, he won't succeed.

The most valuable thing in your life that Satan seeks to go after is the Word of God in your heart. That’s why you must protect the Word in your heart. Don’t let the Word remain on the "surface\-soil" of your heart where the enemy can reach it and knock it out of you. Drive it deep into your spirit through meditation and praying in other tongues. Hallelujah!

## OUT OF SATAN’S DOMAIN November 9th, 2022
![November 9th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-22-day-9-out-of-satans-domain.jpg)

>***Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12\-13\).***

Being born again, you’ve been translated or transferred from the domain of darkness into the Kingdom of God. It’s the domain of life, light and great glory. Satan has no claims over you or anything that has to do with you because you’re not in his jurisdiction. You were called out of Satan’s domain into God’s marvellous light: *“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light”* (1 Peter 2:9\).

Those who aren’t born again, however, are by nature in bondage to Satan, buffeted by the adversities and terrors of life, unable to free themselves. They’re in gross darkness, with no hope of ever coming out, because they’re living without God. Their only hope is to receive salvation in Christ Jesus.

This should immediately get you thinking about your family members, friends, business associates, colleagues, and neighbours who haven’t yet known the Lord. You’re God’s vessel to bring them into salvation in Christ, to bring them out of darkness and the domain of Satan into the light and glorious liberty of the sons of God.

2 Corinthians 5:19 says, *“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.”* No human being can save himself; we couldn’t have done it by ourselves, and that’s why Jesus came.

Through His vicarious death, salvation became possible, and through His glorious resurrection, eternal life was made available. It’s what makes us superior to Satan and above the elements of this present world of darkness: we have eternal life—the God\-nature! Hallelujah!

## MAKE IT A HABIT TO STUDY THE WORD November 10th, 2022

>***As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious (1 Peter 2:2\-3\).***

Just as good nutrition is indispensable to proper physical growth, God’s Word is the essential nourishment for spiritual growth. When a Christian neglects God’s Word, he’ll be susceptible to attacks from the devil and subject to the elements and corrupting influences of this world. Remember, through the Word, we renew our minds, build faith and character. Hence, we must continually feed on the Word.

2 Peter 3:18 says, *“But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.”* Then in Chapter one verse three, it again stresses the importance of the knowledge of God’s Word. It says, *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”*

God has already done for you and given you everything you require for an excellent life of glory and righteousness.However, living that life of dominion, success and prosperity that He’s ordained for you depends on how much of His Word you know and put to work in your life. It’s about your knowledge and application of the Word.

So, get to know the Word. Jesus said you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. Have a compelling desire to grow by the Word, to know God’s truth. Have scheduled times when all you do at such times is studying and meditating on the Word. Get on the Pastor Chris Digital Library (PCDL) every day to watch and listen to faith\-building messages that’ll transform your life.

Every time you open the Scriptures to study, you can learn something new and meditate on specific things the Holy Spirit brings to your consciousness. Therefore, cultivate the habit of studying the Word for yourself.

>***No one in military service gets entangled in matters of everyday life; otherwise he will not please the one who recruited him (2 Timothy 2:4 NET).***

When Jesus said, *“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature”* (Mark 16:15\), it was a charge given to every Christian. You’re to take the Gospel to your world and the regions beyond. He also made us know it certainly wouldn’t just be a walk in the park.

In 1 Corinthians 16:9, Paul said a great and effectual door for the spread of the Gospel was open unto him, but there were many adversaries. In 2 Timothy 3:12, he said, *“Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”* None of these, however, dampened his zeal or impeded his passion for preaching the Gospel.

It should be the same with you. Preaching the Gospel is a job we must do, come what may. That’s why Paul said in Acts 20:24, *“But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.”*

This was Paul’s resolve. The statement was his response to those who tried to stop him from going to Jerusalem to preach because of the persecution he was sure to face. He had said in the preceding verses 22\-23, *“And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.”* Yet, he was undeterred.

In Chapter 21 verses 10\-11, a certain prophet named Agabus prophesied how Paul would be imprisoned in Jerusalem and delivered to the Gentiles. As a result, the other disciples prevailed on Paul not to go to Jerusalem; in fact, they wept. But here was Paul’s inspiring response: *“...What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus”* (Acts 21:13\).

How committed are you to the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ? This is no game! It deserves and demands our putting in everything, including laying down our lives if we must. Christ deserves it all. Therefore, let others be stirred by the urgency, passion and conviction with which you preach the Gospel.

## TRAVAILING IN PRAYER FOR THE NATIONS November 12th, 2022

>***Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession (Psalm 2:8\).***

The Message translation of our theme verse says, “*What do you want? Name it: Nations as a present? continents as a prize?”* I first came across this verse when I was 15 years of age, and I prayed to the Lord according to this scripture. In response, the Spirit of the Lord said to me, “I’ve given you the nations!”

At that tender age, I was concerned about the abysmal state of the unbelievers in the nations of the world; they’re in spiritual darkness and alienated from the life of God. They’re hopeless and without God in the world. So, I got the world map (atlas), and many times, I’d place my hands on it, speaking and prophesying over the nations of the world and over men’s lives.

I travailed in prayer for the needy people of the world. I’d pray and cry, broken before the Lord. Oh, how I wept in prayer for the nations of the world! Ever since, I knew that not one nation could shut its doors against me. Today, the Lord is doing many great things through us in the nations of the world.

When He says, *“Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance…,”* He’s talking about the souls of men, impacting them with the Gospel and the righteousness of God. That’s what the apostles did, and it’s what we must do today, and nothing can stop us.

When Paul preached the Word in Ephesus, there was a lot of resistance of course, but it wasn’t enough to stop the work of the Gospel. The Bible says, “*So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed”* (Acts 19:20\). The key to this kind of result is travailing in prayer. Travail in prayer for your nation, city, town, school, place of work, etc., and surely, the Word of God will grow mightily therein, and prevail. Hallelujah!

## A LESSON IN OBEDIENCE November 13th, 2022
![November 13th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-22-day-13-a-lesson-in-obedience.jpg)

>***And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross (Philippians 2:8\).***

In Luke 3:38, when you study the genealogy of Adam, he was called the son of God. So, if the first Adam was the son of God and the second Adam, Jesus Christ, is the Son of God, what’s the difference between the two sons of God?

The answer is in the parable that Jesus gave in Matthew 21:28\-31 of two sons: Their father told the sons to go work in his vineyard. The first son assured his father that he’d go, but he didn’t; he disobeyed. The second son told his father he wouldn’t go, but he went. Jesus then asked, “Which of the two sons obeyed his father?”

Clearly, the obedient one is the one who actually did his father’s will, though initially refusing to do so. Now, in the Garden of Gethsemane, in the final moments before Jesus was arrested to be crucified, He prayed earnestly *“Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done”* (Luke 22:42\).

Jesus didn’t want to do it, but He did anyway! So, our theme verse says of Jesus, *“And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.”* Jesus’ exaltation came because He was obedient unto death. But the failure of the first Adam was his disobedience.

The Bible says, *“For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous”* (Romans 5:19\). Had the first Adam obeyed, the second Adam wouldn’t have been necessary. So, the difference between the first Adam and the second Adam was obedience.

Obedience is very important; it pays to listen to God and follow His ways. Being born again, we’re born in the nature of the second Adam, Jesus Christ, and we have His obedient Spirit. Hence, in 1 Peter 1:14, we’re called His obedient children. Walk therefore in this nature of Christ in you and please the Father always.

## THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD November 14th, 2022

>***And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light (Genesis 1:2\-3\).***

When you read the Psalms, you’d notice that David knew the value of words, and he taught his son, Solomon, the same. It was Solomon who said, *“Death and life are in the power of the tongue…”* (Proverbs 18:21\). David his father taught him that. David knew that death and life weren’t in the power of the sword; they’re in the power of the tongue. And he proved it when he confronted Goliath of Gath. You need to understand how he defeated Goliath.

It’s easy to think that he defeated Goliath with a smooth stone and a sling. But no; it was with words! Study the account in 1 Samuel 17\. He was sure of defeating Goliath because he put his faith in words. He used the tools as guided by the wisdom of God. He had the stone and sling and words coming out of his mouth. He knew he didn’t take Goliath out with a stone; the Spirit of God was upon him, and the Spirit of God uses words.

Words release spirit\-power. Without words, the Spirit will do nothing. Read our theme verse again. The Spirit was all over the world, but nothing changed. Then the Bible says, “And God said…”; suddenly, the Spirit acted and whatever God said became! Hallelujah!

At the second coming of Jesus, the Bible says He’ll smite the AntiChrist *“...with the spirit of his mouth...”* (2 Thessalonians 2:8\), which refers to the sword of the Spirit, which is the *“Rhema”* of God—words coming out of His mouth (Revelation 19:15, Ephesians 6:17\).

When you speak the Word, you release the power of God into action on your behalf. So, when you face crises in life, don’t cower. Don’t panic. Speak words! Speak and effect a change. Jesus said you shall have whatsoever you say (Mark 11:23\). Remember, words are powerful, but God’s Word is all\-powerful. Glory to His Name forever!

## UNITY OF THE BODY November 15th, 2022
![November 15th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-22-day-15-unity-of-the-body.jpg)

>***Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ (Ephesians 4:13\).***

There’s a stronger unity among God’s people today than at any time in history. For instance, earlier this year, during our Global Ministers’ Classroom, we had over seventy million ministers of the Gospel from around the world who participated online, and it was a great blessing through the Holy Ghost.

It’s the same with our Global Day of Prayer, with several billions of God’s people in every nation and territory of the world praying together to establish the will and purpose of Christ in the earth. Hallelujah!

There’re two powerful forces that bind us together. Number one is the Word of God, the power of God’s Word that unites our hearts. The second force is the ministry of the Holy Spirit. These two bring us strongly together all around the world today.

Of course, I know that many of us have different ministry backgrounds and different trainings. But there’re major things that we do agree on that far more outweigh whatever differences we may have at any particular time.

I said, “At any particular time” because, given enough time, several of us will come to the same conclusions, especially when we have the same information. And that’s something that the Lord wants to see.

Ephesians 4:11\-12 says, *“And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.”* What’s his purpose for the equipping of the Church? The next verse shows us: *“Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God….”* This will bring about the unity of the Body of Christ. Amen.

The Bible shows us that our oneness will be a sign to the world that God sent Jesus (John 17:21\). And in these final moments of the Church, God’s people are going to come together in unity for an amazing impact for the Lord, more than this world has ever known. Praise God!

## JESUS CHRIST IS THE JUDGE OF ALL November 16th, 2022
![November 16th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-22-day-16-jesus-christ-is-the-judge-of-all.jpg)

>***…he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness… (Acts 17:31\).***

The verse above says Jesus will judge the world in righteousness. He is the judge. The Father judges no man; He committed all judgement to Jesus: *“For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son”* (John 5:22\).

Also, in Acts 10:42 NIV, we see that Jesus was appointed by God to be the judge of all men. A similar thought is communicated by the Spirit in 2 Timothy 4:1 NIV through the Apostle Paul: *“In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge.”*

The Judgement Seat of Christ is described in 2 Corinthians 5:10: *“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”* The Judgement Seat of Christ is the judgement of God’s people—Christians— where we each receive our rewards from the Master. Everyone will be praised (1 Corinthians 4:5\). 

At His return to the earth, Jesus will judge all nations: *“When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats”* (Matthew 25:31\-32\).

Then, in Revelation 20, we find Jesus executing the most terrifying of all judgements, which are reserved for sinners. It’s called The Great White Throne Judgement: *“And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them”* (Revelation 20:11\). These judgements aren’t far away. Therefore, serve the Lord truly and live for Him every day as we await His soon return.

## YOU HAVE ALL THINGS IN HIM November 17th, 2022

>***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27\).***

The essence of Christianity, the glory and joy of all that Jesus came to do, is Christ in you. Christ in you is everything. Christ in you is heaven in you; it’s divinity in you. Now that you have Christ, you have everything. No wonder Paul said, *“Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours”* (1 Corinthians 3:21\). Hallelujah! 

Here’s something remarkable to ponder on: Romans 6:23 says, *“…the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”* That’s a fundamental truth of the Gospel. However, as you get higher in the understanding of the Gospel, you’d discover that Jesus really doesn’t stand away and give you eternal life; He’s Himself eternal life. In giving you eternal life, He actually gave you Himself. Hallelujah.

The moment you come to terms with this reality, it’ll change your thinking and prayer life. You’d stop asking God for things. If it’s true that you have Christ (and thank God it’s true), what then could you possibly be in need of? Christ is everything, and everything is in Christ.

Stop asking God for what you already have in Christ. For example, don’t ask God for healing; take divine health, for it’s your nature in Christ Jesus. The victorious life is yours in Christ. Everything you require for an extraordinary life of glory and righteousness is already yours in Christ (2 Peter 1:3\).

Now, you can understand why the Lord Jesus said in Luke 12:22, *“...Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.”* He’s your sufficiency; in Him, you have all things. Hallelujah!

## THE LAST DAYS November 18th, 2022
![November 18th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-22-day-18-the-last-days.jpg)

>***First, I want to remind you that in the last days there will come scoffers who will do every wrong they can think of and laugh at the truth. This will be their line of argument: “So Jesus promised to come back, did he? Then where is he? He’ll never come… (2 Peter 3:3\-4 TLB).***

It’s not uncommon to hear some people scoff when they hear the term, “the last days.” They doubt its certainty because they think they’ve heard about it for too long. To understand what the Bible says about the last days, you’d have to first recognize that the term has several applications in prophecy. Secondly, you’ll need to know whom the prophet or writer was addressing with the term. 

For instance, in addressing the Jews, the Apostle Peter’s use of the phrase was very accurate, because he wasn’t dealing with the last days of the Church but the last days of Israel. They were in their last days, yet they didn’t realize how close they were. Someone may be wondering, “But Peter said these things almost two thousand years ago. So just how close were they?”

The end of their calendar had come very close. Daniel’s prophetic writing stated that 70 weeks of years were determined for Israel, leading up to the establishment of the millennial reign of the Messiah. God had been running a calendar with them until the Messiah was cut off in the 69th week.

Between the 69th and the 70th week came the Church Age. So, Peter was correct to have told the children of Israel they were in the last days at the time because they were already in the 69th week.

Today, not only is Israel in its last days, but the Church Age is also rounding off. We’re in a period that’s considered the fiercest part of the battle of the ages. We’ve however been trained and equipped for these times, and we’re carrying out a great onslaught against the forces of darkness as we get men and women in every nation ready for the soon return of our Lord and Master. Be sure to be a part of this great work, and win souls to Christ. (Read Luke 12:39\-46\).

## A ONE-TIME SACRIFICE November 19th, 2022

>***Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us (Hebrews 9:12\).***

The Bible refers to the first tabernacle in the old testament as that *“Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect…”* (Hebrews 9:9\). The Old Testament priests gave different offerings and sacrifices to God, such as *“...meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances…”* (Hebrews 9:10\).

But when Jesus Christ came, His sacrifice was His own blood; He offered Himself. Whereas the priests of the Old Testament had to offer sacrifices year after year for a yearly atonement, Jesus did it once and obtained eternal redemption for mankind. The previous will—the offering of the blood of animals—wasn’t God’s best, and not what He wanted. So, Jesus said, *“...Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God”* (Hebrews 10:7\).

The Bible says the Old Testament priests were *“...offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: But this man (Jesus Christ), after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God”* (Hebrews 10:11\-12\).

No wonder the Apostle Paul, while ministering to some unsaved Jews in Antioch, unveiled an extraordinary truth. He said, *“…through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses”* (Acts 13:38\-39\). Blessed be God!

Tell it everywhere and to everyone: Christ Jesus has consummated man’s eternal redemption once and for all. Hallelujah!

## WE’RE MINISTERS OF RECONCILIATION November 20th, 2022

>***And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18\).***

In the New Testament, you’d observe that the word “minister” is copiously used. It’s however important to note that there’re three Greek words from which it’s translated. The first one is “doulos,” which is like a servant or a slave. Paul sometimes called himself a “doulos” (a bondservant)—a slave or servant of Jesus Christ (Romans 1:1\).

Then another Greek word for “minister” is “huperetes,” which refers to the office of ministry, like we find in the story of the conversion of the Apostle Paul on his way to Damascus. During that conversion, Jesus said to Paul, *“…for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen…”* (Acts 26:16\).

Jesus appeared to Paul and called him into an office of ministry. We also find the same word in 1 Corinthians 4:1: *“Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers (huperetes) of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.”*

However, the third meaning of the word “minister” is the one every Christian has been called into, “Diakonia” (Greek), which refers to a person who serves, like someone who’s a waiter. In Acts 6:4, it was used to describe the ministry of the Word: *“But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.”* We all have the responsibility to be servants of Christ, servants of His message and of one another. You have a responsibility to be a witness for Christ, to deliver the Gospel to other people.

God has made you a competent minister of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 3:6 NIV). So, go wild for the Lord! Open your mouth and declare His Word of salvation boldly anywhere you find yourself. He’s counting on you.

## SPEAK GOD’S LANGUAGE November 21st, 2022

>***Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual (1 Corinthians 2:13\).***

In Galatians 4:1\-2, the Bible says, *“Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.”* An heir is someone who has an inheritance bequeathed to him, a legal inheritor of an estate or position of high authority and wealth.

However, as long as the heir is a child, he’s not different from a servant. The word translated “child” is “nepios,” one who’s unable to talk right or communicate wisely. Someone can be forty years in Christianity and still be a “nepios”; he can’t form the right words in the realm of the spirit.

Yes, the Word says we’re heirs of God and joint\-heirs with Christ, but “nepios” can’t live the life of an heir. 1 Corinthians 3:21 says, *“…all things are yours”*; but they’re suffering through life because they haven’t matured spiritually. They use the wrong terms because they’ve never learnt God’s language.

The way to learn and speak God’s language is by studying and meditating on the Word. Our theme verse says we’re to speak words which the Holy Ghost teaches— words of wisdom from and by the Spirit. So, get yourself trained in the Word of God and have the Word in your heart and on your lips always, irrespective of the circumstance.

## HE’S THE FIRST AND THE LAST November 22nd, 2022

>***I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty (Revelation 1:8\).***

As you study Jesus in the Scriptures, you come to an unequivocal conclusion: He is Himself God! He’s the First and the Last, the beginning and the ending. He’s the One described by Daniel as the Ancient of days.

John the Apostle, while exiled on the Island of Patmos, received revelations from the Lord. He said, *“I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last…”* (Revelation 1:10\-11\). That’s Jesus!

The Lord also said to him, *“…Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen…”* (Revelation 1:17\-18\). The only one who fits this description is Jesus. He’s the One that died but is alive forever more. Hallelujah!

Now, if He’s the beginning and the ending, that means you have nothing to fear or worry about in your journey of success. He’s with you, and in you. As you start, He’s right there. On the way, He’s right there. At the end, He’s also there. He absolutely got you covered. He’s with you at every phase of your journey.

No wonder the Bible says in Hebrews 12:2, *“Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith….”* That means you don’t need to worry about the future; from the very beginning, He already knows the end, and He says, “Fear not.” Therefore, be bold and confident always, knowing that you’re in Christ, and He’s in you, and He’s perfected all that concerns you. He’s the author (beginning) and perfecter (ending) of all things. Blessed be God!

## OUR ETERNAL ADVOCATE November 23rd, 2022
![November 23rd, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/nov-22-day-23-our-eternal-advocate.jpg)

>***My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous (1 John 2:1\).***

The greatness of the Father’s love for us is indeed beyond human comprehension. No wonder the Spirit had to pray through Paul for the Church to come to the understanding of the immensity, magnitude and unconditional love of the Father towards us (Ephesians 3:18\-19\). He sent Jesus to die for us; He raised Him from the dead and appointed Him as our eternal advocate. Hallelujah!

He said in our theme verse, “If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father—Jesus Christ the righteous.” No one else qualifies to plead your case, except the one who died in your place; He took your place as a sinner and gave you His righteousness. No one can condemn you before the Father.

When Satan, who is described in Scripture as the accuser of God’s people, accuses you and tries to declare you undeserving of God’s blessings, the Lord Jesus, your advocate, stands up in your defence. He pleads your case. The Bible says He loved us and washed us from our sins in His own blood (Revelation 1:5\). His blood speaks continually in your behalf, cleansing you from all unrighteousness and every stain of sin (1 John 1:7\).

Jesus did all that He did in order to present you holy, blameless and unreproveable in the sight of God (Colossians 1:22\). In heaven, Jesus isn’t trying to defend you from the Father’s wrath, for the Father Himself loves you (John 16:27\). The Father ordained Jesus to be your advocate—counsel for the defence. With Him on your side, it’s impossible for you to be defeated or disadvantaged. Hallelujah!

## THE BIBLE EXPLAINS IT ALL November 24th, 2022

>***Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear (Hebrews 11:3\).***

The statement above is so powerful. It lets us know that from invisible things, the visible things of this world are created. It brings to mind a major fundamental principle upon which modern physics is based: the wave– particle duality. It’s the confusion as to whether subatomic particles (if they should be called particles, electrons or protons) are waves or particles, because of a mysterious result in their experiments.

They demonstrated with an electron and found out it had, and produced, the characteristics of waves when you weren’t looking at it. In other words, if the observer or the one carrying out the experiment wasn’t looking at the electron, it produced waves. They thus concluded that the electron is a wave. However, the moment you turned to look at it, it seemed to know you were looking, and before you could see it, it became a particle.

How could it produce such patterns and characteristics of waves? How could it be that intelligent? Now, here’s something very interesting: if it’s a wave, it’s got energy, and energy isn’t matter; so, it’s not a particle. If it’s a particle, then that means it’s not a wave. It’s one of both, but it turns out to be both.

This is one of the most mind\-blowing experiments scientists have carried out, and for so many years, they’ve had no explanation for it. But all the explanation is in the Bible. It’s so simple. Think about it: When you’re not looking, it’s energy; when you turn to see it, it’s matter!

And what does the Bible say? It says, “Now faith is the substance of things in hope”; meaning that while you’re not looking with your physical eyes, the thing is real inside your spirit; it is substance; it exists as the Word of God! Since faith is the “substance” of hope, it means it has energy; it’s based on the Word of God. The Word of God is sound; God spoke and creation came to be. Sound wave is where the energy is. So, if scientists want to understand this stuff, they need to get out of New Age and get to the Bible; the Book explains it all. Hallelujah!

## FAITH IS THE COGENCY OF EVIDENCE November 25th, 2022

>***Now faith is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things \[we] hope for, being the proof of things \[we] do not see… (Hebrews 11:1 AMPC).***

The above definition of faith simply means that faith is the cogency of evidence. You’re convinced that something you’ve hoped for is real though it’s not visible in the physical realm. Faith is a substance; it’s the evidence of unseen realities.

Evidence is proof of something; it can be made available. If faith, therefore, is the evidence, it means there’s something it represents. It’s like when you own a property; the title deed to that property is your proof, the cogency of evidence that the property is yours. When your right to the property is contested, you simply present the evidence—the title deed.

Likewise, if at any time the devil tries to question your right to your blessings, privileges and inheritance in Christ, present your evidence, which is God’s Word. Declare with confidence what the Word says concerning you.

For example, you can present Romans 8:10\-11 and 3 John 1:2 as your evidence for divine health: Romans 8:10\-11 says, *“And if Christ be in you, (although) the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is (gives it) life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”* 3 John 1:2 says, *“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”* In affirming these scriptures, you’re putting your evidence to work. Hallelujah!

I’m fully persuaded by the Word of God! I anchor my life on God’s Word, and I refuse to be swayed by contrary winds or circumstances, for my faith is the title deed of unseen realities.

## DOMINION OVER DEATH AND HELL November 26th, 2022

>***I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death (Revelation 1:18\)***

Following Adam’s disobedience, the Bible says death came upon all men: *“Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned”* (Romans 5:12\). Death was associated with sin, so when Adam committed high treason back in the Garden of Eden by obeying Satan, death began to work in every man. Satan gained liberty to afflict men with sickness, disease, destruction and ultimately death, at his will.

But when Jesus came, things changed. Men and women who were all their lifetime subject to bondage because of the fear of death were liberated through the victory of Jesus Christ over death and the grave (Hebrews 2:14\-15\). Jesus went right into hell—Satan’s domain— paralyzed Satan and his cohorts, and obtained the keys of death and hell! He dealt with the problem of death when He triumphantly rose from the dead and ushered man into a new life.

Today, anyone who’s born again needs not fear death, for death has been defeated by Jesus. No wonder the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:54\-57, *“...Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”*

He’s given us victory over death and the grave. Today, Satan can no longer take anybody’s life at will because he doesn’t have the power of death anymore. Christ has given us life to live to the full. In His presence is fullness of joy and at His right hand are pleasures evermore: *“The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows)”* (John 10:10 AMPC).

## THE WORD IMPARTS FAITH November 27th, 2022

>***So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God (Romans 10:17\).***

The Word of God imparts faith. You might have noticed that sometimes as you sit listening to, or studying God’s Word, your spirit becomes energized. At such times, all the challenges you may have been facing suddenly seem like nothing. The reason is that at that moment, the Word you’re receiving stirs faith in your heart. 

The Word of God is spiritual; therefore, it’s even more real than the physical things that your senses perceive. That’s why, when you receive the Word into your spirit, a spiritual reaction is ignited between your spirit and the Word of God that gives you dominion over circumstances. When that reaction takes place, faith rises in you like a giant and you have the assurance of victory.

Even if you thought your faith was little or small, Jesus said that little faith can do great things; it can literally move a mountain (Matthew 21:21\). Or, perhaps, you’re thinking, “I don’t have faith”; our opening verse tells us how to get it: faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.

Whenever you think you don’t have enough faith, it means it’s time for you to hear more of God’s Word. The Word will of a necessity impart faith to you; it’s a principle of the Kingdom of God. You don’t have to struggle for it to happen; if you’d pay attention to the Word of God, faith will come to you.

It reminds me of a certain young man who came to one of our meetings years ago. He came in saying he didn’t believe and wasn’t going to believe any of the things we were sharing. But his friends convinced him to come nonetheless. So, he sat in the meeting, trying not to believe. But he was “hearing” the message (remember, faith comes by hearing).

Later on, when I had a chat with him, he said, “Somehow, I found myself accepting the things you shared; I believe everything you said.” He couldn’t escape it, because faith comes when you hear the Word! Hallelujah!

## YOUR “NEED” ACTIVATES YOUR FAITH November 28th, 2022

>***And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith (Mark 11:22\-23\).***

Someone once said, “I’ve never seen anybody move a mountain with faith; was Jesus just using symbolism or did He mean what He said in Mark 11:22\-23? Can you really command a mountain to move?”

Yes, Jesus meant it. But Jesus wasn’t talking about a game. He wasn’t saying that we go out in the street and say, “I’m here to show you how powerful I am”; then you start commanding mountains and buildings to move. No!

The question is, why would you want to move a physical mountain; to what intent and purpose? Our faith is always connected to our needs. If there’s no need for it, there’ll be no faith to it. So, you may find yourself trying to make something happen that’ll not happen because there’s no need to activate faith in the first place.

Faith is activated only when there’s a need for it. When you find yourself in a situation and you have a “need,” don’t despair; that need will activate your faith. It’s like the woman who was told she’d never be able to get pregnant. That news activated her faith, and soon enough, she had her baby. Until she heard that she would never have a baby, she didn’t know she could have one with her faith.

The same can be said of the fellow who was healed of cancer; he didn’t know he could make it happen until he was told he had only one month to live. The news triggered his faith, and he began to declare, “I shall not die but live,” and indeed, he was healed. Hallelujah!

Never be overwhelmed with your need; rather, let your needs connect to your faith. Let your needs excite you. Once you connect to a need, that’s your opportunity to overwhelm your need with your faith. Praise God!

## THERE’S SOMETHING IN YOUR PATH November 29th, 2022

>***For we are God’s \[own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, \[born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us \[taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them \[living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).***

Every one of us has a path that’s preordained by God for us to walk in life. It’s a path of success and greatness. However, as you journey, you’ll collide with forces or situations that’ll test your faith. For David, there was a bear and a lion. Afterward, there was a Goliath and the armies of the Philistines, and then lots of other armies. But he defeated them all. Hallelujah!

I’m not sure what’s in your path, but there’s surely something in your path. But one thing is certain: you’ve already won. That’s why the Bible says “Count it all joy when you go through diverse tests” (James 1:2\).

The challenges or obstacles in your path are a mirage. When you get to them, don’t cry. Don’t start begging God to do something. Don’t cower. When you meet that “masked devil,” which could mean a stumbling block in your business or job, a limitation or restriction in your soul\-winning or evangelical efforts, or some issues in your health, you say, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, get out of my way!” When you say that, it may seem the obstacle is still there; refuse to recognize it and keep journeying. Don’t keep observing it; instead, close your eyes against it and begin to utter incantations of the Spirit, speaking in tongues. Then, as David charged towards Goliath, charge towards that obstacle and walk through in the Name of Jesus, as the Spirit inspires you.

God took care of it before you got there. Now you understand the reason He tells you not to worry. It’s because when you face the biggest troubles, He steps in. You don’t need to shout. You don’t need to kick. You don’t need to push. Just keep going; just walk through! Hallelujah!

>***Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste (Isaiah 28:16\).***

It matters the foundation upon which your life is built. The Bible says, *“For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ”* (1 Corinthians 3:11\). Christ is the only sure foundation. He must be the foundation of your success. That way, when you face the adversities of life, you’ll remain standing, because you’re founded upon the Rock, Christ Jesus!

The Prophet Isaiah, in our opening verse, spoke prophetically about the “stone” that the Lord God would lay in Zion, and I want you to observe the way this “stone” is described. First, he refers to it as “a tried stone.” Then he calls it “a precious cornerstone.” Thirdly, he refers to it as “a sure foundation.”

Being a “tried stone” means it’s been tested and proven. As “a precious cornerstone,” it means it’s the most important stone for the stability of the building. As a “sure foundation,” it means you can stake your life on it. That’s who the Lord Jesus is; He’s the only true foundation upon which you should build your life.

No wonder He said in Luke 6:47\-49: *“Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like: He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.”*

Remember, the foundation is what makes the difference. Both houses in the illustration given by Jesus above were confronted by the same flood, but the one without foundations came to ruin. Let Christ, the Solid Rock, be the anchor of your life! Be a doer of God’s Word, for that’s how to build your life on the rock. That’s what will keep you standing when all else fails. That’s what will keep you in success and prosperity all your life.
