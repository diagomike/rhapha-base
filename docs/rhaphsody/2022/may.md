>***For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened (Mark 6:52\).***

In Mark 6, the Bible tells us how the disciples of Jesus were gripped with fear when they saw Him walking on the water. Why were they afraid? We find the answer in our theme verse: *“…they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart was hardened.”*

They had seen several miracles with Jesus and the latest of such miracles was that of multiplying bread and fish to feed thousands of people (Read Matthew 14:13\-21\). Yet, it didn’t seem to mean anything to them; they were still hardened in their hearts. Some are like that in the Church today; not considering as they should, the miracles of Christ, performed through the Spirit today.

It reminds me of an inspiring experience I had in 1981\. I was attending a crusade where the Archbishop Benson Idahosa had invited R.W Schambach who was the guest speaker on that particular night. After he had preached and prayed, there were several miracles. The first testifier to come up the platform was a young lady who had been deaf in both ears. R.W Schambach and the Archbishop Benson Idahosa tested her and confirmed she was indeed healed.

However, I observed something else that inspired me greatly: the reaction of those two great men of God to the young lady’s testimony. They both jumped and skipped like children, in celebration of that miracle. These were men of God who had seen so many mighty miracles, but it was so inspiring to see them celebrate as though that was the first or only miracle they had ever witnessed.

That’s the way it should be. Be excited always at the seemingly simple things that God does in your life and in the lives of others. Joyfully celebrate His goodness every day. There’s no such thing as a “small miracle”; every blessing from God is something to shout about, something worth praising Him for. Your heart should always go out to Him in worship, praise and gratitude for His great love, mercies and grace. The Bible says He daily loads us with blessings—benefits: *“Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah”* (Psalm 68:19\). Hallelujah!

## TRUE PRAISE AND WORSHIP May 2nd, 2022

>***For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh (Philippians 3:3\).***

The Church of Jesus Christ has come of age. Some of the things the Lord tolerated in the past, even though they didn’t make much spiritual sense, are now being corrected. This is because He’s perfecting the Church for the coming of the Lord. For example, true worship and true praise in the house of God: many don’t understand what it is. Some think that when they dance themselves high in church, they’re really praising and worshipping God. But dancing in the flesh is neither praise nor worship.

What is praise? And what is worship? Worship is the recognition and appreciation of the reality, blessings, character and greatness of God. This recognition and appreciation, we express in prayer, sacrifice and service. In the New Testament, we offer spiritual sacrifices called praise (Hebrews 13:15, 1 Peter 2:5, Psalm 69:30\-31\). Hence, praise is an expression of worship. When we praise God, we’re worshipping Him. When you say, “Lord, you’re good; you’re kind, gracious and loving; you’ve blessed me, you’re righteous, etc., you’re defining, recognizing, and appreciating His character and His works.

Praise is the fruit of our lips—giving thanks to God (Hebrews 13:15\). So, in worship or praise, you’re SAYING something to God thankfully. This profuse expression of appreciation of His character and personality in words of thanksgiving should be from the heart; that is the spirit, not the flesh.

The dancing that most people do in many churches is in the flesh. That may have its place outside the church. In the New Testament, you don’t dance in the flesh to worship God. Dancing in the flesh is based on the beat of the music. When the beat changes, the dance changes.

If you’re inspired to dance, it should be in the spirit and by the Spirit. The dance may not even synchronize or follow the beat of the drums. In such situations, you’ll find yourself jumping, spinning, rejoicing in and from your spirit. We’re the true circumcision who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh (Philippians 3:3\).

## TRAIN YOURSELF TO PRAY...... May 3rd, 2022

>***And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God (Luke 6:12\).***

Prayer is a spiritual exercise that you must train for. If you don’t train yourself to pray, you’ll never know how to pray effectively. If all you knew to do was mumble a few words in two minutes and you’re done, it’s time to get some training and discipline.

We see the example of the Master in our opening scripture. As long as your body is calling for food, or itching to go do some other things while you ought to be praying, that’s the more reason you must remain there and subject your body to the discipline of the Spirit.

However, the purpose of prayer isn’t merely to control or discipline your body, as good as that is. The main purpose of prayer is the conditioning of your spirit, and this is far more important. Prayer brings your spirit to a certain condition that makes your relationship and fellowship with God’s Spirit more real and synchronized with His will and purpose.

Then you find that His thoughts become your thoughts and His words become your words. That’s when He puts a word in your mouth which you speak forth and it produces results. It reminds of induced magnetism. If you keep an object beside a magnet long enough, the magnet will induce it to become magnetic itself.

It’s the same thing with the Holy Spirit and you; the more you spend time in fellowship with Him, the more His person, glory, character, wisdom and grace are revealed in your walk and in your talk! But if all you do is a few minutes of prayer occasionally, that’s not sufficient time for Him to condition your spirit and have Himself expressed in and through you in a remarkable way.

You need to give the Lord time and attention in the place of prayer and become so influenced by Him that you acquire His character and mannerisms. Then you find that your way of thinking and talking (your choice of words) have become so refined by Him. Train yourself for that conditioning to take place.

## PROTECT YOUR HEART May 4th, 2022
![May 4th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/may-22-day-4-protect-your-heart.jpg)

>***Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life (Proverbs 4:23\).***

One of the most remarkable things about David was Samuel’s testimony in 1 Samuel 13:14 about his heart; David had a heart that was after God. That’s one of the greatest blessings to ever wish for: having a heart that’s perfect towards God, and a willing mind to do His perfect will. It’s a great blessing from God, but it doesn’t work by itself, because you have a mind and a will of your own. Remember, God gave Saul, David’s predecessor, a good heart (1 Samuel 10:9\); yet, he didn’t serve God perfectly.

When Saul first met Samuel the Prophet, the Bible says the Spirit of God came upon Saul and he prophesied together with the prophets (1 Samuel 10:10\). That was the outward manifestation of what he had received; there was a change on the inside. The Bible specifically says that God gave Saul “another heart.”

But Saul didn’t maintain his perfect heart. He offered a burnt offering against spiritual instructions (1 Samuel 13:9\-11\). At another instance, he wouldn’t destroy the Amalekites and everything connected to them as the Lord expressly instructed (1 Samuel 15:1\-11\). Rather than being remorseful and repentant when he was confronted by Samuel, he was proud. As a result, he was rejected by God from being king over Israel (1 Samuel 15:26\), so much so, the Lord said, *“I regret making Saul king, for he has turned back from following Me and has not performed My commands…”* (1 Samuel 15:11 AMPC). What a terrible place to be! Observe the progression.

Saul then became envious of David and continued in his rebellion toward God. His heart went after other things. This is the reason you must protect your heart; keep it pure. Keep it sanctified with God’s Word. Never let anything unwholesome take root in your heart. Pride, anger, malice, bitterness, hatred—these are poisonous to the heart. Completely eschew them from your life and from your heart.

Your thoughts come from your heart; the character of your thoughts reveals the condition of your heart. When you were born again, you were given a heart of love. The Bible says, *“…the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us”* (Romans 5:5\). You have a heart of love, a heart that’s filled with God. Protect it; maintain it; keep it the way God wants it.

## SPEAKING IN TONGUES IS A GREAT BLESSING May 5th, 2022

>***…I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also (1 Corinthians 14:15\).***

There’re Christians who after several years of being born again have never spoken in tongues. They’ve done themselves a great disservice. Some only spoke in tongues on the day they received the Holy Spirit. They often reminisce over that spontaneous experience they once had as though it’s meant to be a one\-off experience. But the Scriptures teach that speaking in spiritual tongues is to be a regular part of your prayer life.

Speaking in tongues is a great blessing for every Christian, with inexhaustible benefits. Christians who speak in tongues often are hardly ever sick, fearful, or discouraged; they’re on top always, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.

Having received the Holy Spirit, you’re enabled to speak in tongues of the spirit. The Holy Spirit is the One that gives the utterance to speak in other tongues. On the day of Pentecost, the Bible says, *“And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance”* (Acts 2:4\).

Notice it doesn’t say the Holy Spirit spoke with tongues; it was the disciples that spoke with tongues. They didn’t form the words from their heads; they spoke as the Holy Spirit gave them utterance.

The latter part of Acts 2:4 in The Living Bible says the disciples *“...began speaking in languages they didn’t know, for the Holy Spirit gave them this ability.”* The Good News Bible says *“They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to talk in other languages, as the Spirit enabled them to speak.”*

Some say they’re waiting for the Holy Spirit to take over their lips before they speak in tongues; that’s not how it works. You can speak in tongues anytime, anywhere, and for as long as you choose. The Holy Spirit already gave you the ability; therefore, go ahead and speak in tongues even now, as an act of your faith in the Father’s fulfilled promise in Christ.

## HIS LOVE MANIFESTED IN YOU May 6th, 2022

>***For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh (2 Corinthians 4:11\).***

The proof that we know God’s love is how we share it. Did you ever stop to think about that? We don’t know God’s love until we share it and manifest it. Jesus was the manifestation of God’s love. He was God’s love in the flesh. That’s to say He was the “body” of love.

The gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John show Him as the embodiment of love. Jesus didn’t merely have love; He was love made flesh! That’s one of the most extraordinary truths ever revealed. Jesus is the perfect description of love.

We read in the Bible that God is love (1 John 4:8\), but this will never mean anything to you until you get to know Jesus. Many think of God with various imaginations. But Jesus said, “If you’ve seen me, you’ve seen the Father” (John 14:9\). Hallelujah! The Bible says as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17\). God’s plan is to reveal Himself—character, ability, and His nature of love and righteousness through each one of us.

The expression of His love in and through you is a key indicator of spiritual growth. You’re truly spiritually mature when the love of God is expressed more and more in your words, thoughts, attitude and actions. Walking in love is the manifestation of the life and nature of Christ that’s in your spirit. Praise God!

## SOUNDNESS OF HEALTH May 7th, 2022

>***Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth (3 John 1:2\).***

One of the areas Satan likes to take advantage of God’s people is in their health. Thus, in keeping yourself in health, the first thing you need to consciously recognize is that the Word of God is pure medicine. Meditating on the Word will keep you in soundness of health—spirit, soul and body.

Every day, meditate on the Word. Don’t wait for trouble to strike before you start “trying” to meditate on the Word. Meditate on the Word ahead of the evil day.

Something else you need that’s of equal importance is the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Be sensitive to the Holy Spirit about what you eat and how you treat your body. Such things aren’t too trivial for Him to give you clear guidance about. Trust Him; He’ll teach you how to be wise about food.

It’s God’s will and desire for you to be healthy and strong. That’s why, besides teaching and guiding you on the things to do to keep your body in health, He also “perambulates” in you to ward off sickness, disease and infirmities from your body: *“And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and **walk***(perambulate) *in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people”* (2 Corinthians 6:16\). Praise God!

## PRACTISE BEING ALONE WITH GOD May 8th, 2022

>***But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer (Luke 5:16 NLT).***

There’s something about solitude. If you don’t understand the value of solitude, there’s a lot that you can miss in life. It’s so important to have personal times alone with God. Before revelation comes isolation. When you learn the value of having private times of fellowship with the Lord, you’ll be amazed at the transformation that’ll take place in your life and how effective you’d be in the things of God.

Never take your private times with the Lord lightly. Maybe you have some people that every now and then are at your door because they need to see you or speak with you about one thing or the other. Be smart. If you spend most of your time in casual or vain chatter with others and spend lesser time fellowshipping with the Spirit, you’re not going to accomplish much in life.

Jesus understood the value and power of privacy with God. In Matthew 14:23, the Bible says, *“And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.”* Our theme verse shows us that He did this often: *“But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer”* (Luke 5:16 NLT). At the time everyone was clamouring for His attention, He withdrew into the wilderness to pray.

In fact, on a certain occasion, He “escaped” to go and pray, and they were looking for Him. The Bible says, *“And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. And Simon and they that were with him followed after him”* (Mark 1:35\-36\). Practise this. Make the effort to have your personal times with God every day.

## THE POWER IS RELEASED WHEN YOU SPEAK May 9th, 2022

>***For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Romans 10:10\).***

Perhaps you’re often described as a cool and calm person, very quiet. But when it comes to speaking or releasing the Word—using it against the adversary and adversities—be wild. Refuse to be cool and calm. It brings to mind the third of the three levels of meditation that the Bible talks about: “roaring!” The Hebrew word is “Hagar.”

Hagar means roaring or shouting the Word. In putting the Word of God to work, be on the offensive. When sickness tries to attack you or your loved ones, get wild in your affirmation of the Word. Don’t stop until the Word you speak prevails over that situation, because it’ll surely prevail!

The Bible says, *“So mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed”* (Acts 19:20\). As you speak the Word, it’ll keep growing; the necessary result, therefore, will be for it to prevail. So, use the Word to deal with any situation, irrespective of how dire or grave the situation is.

Every so often, declare, “I’m born again; I have the life of God in me. I refuse to accommodate sickness or infirmities in my body. My body is the temple of the Holy Spirit; therefore, it’s perfected in Christ Jesus. I live in health.” Talk like this every day, because the power is released when you speak.

The power doesn’t work just because you know it or believe it. The principle is that you must SAY it for it to work. That’s what we read in our theme verse. Your mouth isn’t just for communicating and eating; those are the lesser functions of the mouth. The primary function of your mouth is to frame your life aright.

The Prophet said, *“Take with you words...”* (Hosea 14:2\); not just any words but God’s Word. The Word of God in your mouth is a creative force; use it to change circumstances and make your life excellent, from glory to glory. Hallelujah!

## POWER OF A STRONG DESIRE May 10th, 2022
![May 10th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/may-22-day-10-power-of-a-strong-desire.jpg)

>***And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. And I will be found of you, saith the LORD… (Jeremiah 29:13\-14\).***

God never ignores a strong desire\-a strong desire to know Him, walk with Him and do His will. That strong desire births an unquenchable urge for prayer. That’s what we mean sometimes when we say someone is taken over by the “spirit of prayer.” It means the Holy Spirit has brought an overwhelming atmosphere and influence of prayer on your heart.

When that happens, prayer becomes all that you do and think about. That influence could stay on you for a protracted period of time. However, this isn’t just something that happens when God chooses to; rather, it’s what you invite by desire. The Bible says He satisfies the thirsty soul (Psalm 107:9\).

When you begin that fellowship of prayer, it won’t be long before that spirit of intercession comes on you and you find that you’re constantly praying. Every now and then the Spirit will pull you to His motivations, visions, plans and purposes, the things that He cares about and wants to do. He’d be expressing Himself through you in prayer.

This is something that should be evident in the life of every Christian; a strong desire for the Lord, His Word, and His influence in your life. When you have it, you can easily influence those around you with it. So, cultivate it. Stir your heart to have a strong desire and maintain your zeal, love and passion for the Lord at all times. David, inspired by a strong desire for the Lord, said, *“O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is”* (Psalm 63:1\).

## PROVE YOUR LOVE BY WINNING SOULS May 11th, 2022

>***To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:19\).***

Our evangelical responsibility is something that all of heaven takes seriously. Sadly, many don’t understand how serious this really is. There’re Christians who are still asking if whether or not someone who doesn’t win souls will go to heaven. The question to ask such people is, “If someone doesn’t love God, or love Jesus, will that person go to heaven?” That’s not going to happen.

The Bible says, *“…every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him”* (1 John 5:1\). If you love the Father, you must love Jesus. 1 Corinthians 16:22 says, *“If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.”* That means let him be accursed.

The proof of your love for Jesus is keeping His commandments—His Word (John 14:15\). His Word says, *“...Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature”* (Mark 16:15\). So you keep that word by being a soul winner. Someone might ask, “How about those who lived before Jesus came and didn’t quite have the opportunity to express their love for Him?” They had the Word of God—His laws and commandments.

Job said, *“…I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food”* (Job 23:12\). Jesus is the Word (John 1:14\). Hallelujah! Thus, every one of them had a clear opportunity to express their love for Him. He said in Matthew 28:19, *“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations….”*  That means make pupils of those in your world, teach them about God and the Kingdom\-life, establish His Kingdom in the earth. Your love and commitment to the Lord must reflect in your dedication to the preaching of the Gospel.

## CHRISTIANITY AND THE RESURRECTION May 12th, 2022

>***Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? (1 Corinthians 15:12\).***

Sometime ago, a certain well\-known “priest” publicly stated that he used to believe in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, but he now had reasons to question whether or not Jesus truly rose from the dead. The fact of the matter is, he never believed in Jesus even though he claimed to be a Christian. It’s impossible to be a Christian without believing absolutely in the resurrection of Jesus!

There’s no Christianity without the resurrection. Christianity only begins from the resurrection, not the Cross. The death of Jesus didn’t provide eternal life; it’s the resurrection of Jesus Christ that ushered us into eternal life. The Apostle Paul explains it in Romans 6:4; he said, *“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”*

To not believe in the resurrection is to deny the possibility and availability of eternal life. And if you don’t have eternal life, you’re not a Christian. A Christian is someone who has received eternal life. What is eternal life? It’s the life and nature of God—the quality of the divine essence.

For example, dogs aren’t goats, chickens aren’t ostriches; no matter the resemblance between them, they don’t have the same life and they’ll never produce or reproduce after the other. Dogs will never reproduce goats and vice versa. The Christian is literally born of God, with the God\-life. It was the resurrection of Jesus Christ that made that possible. Hallelujah!

More so, the Bible says Jesus was proven or declared to be God in human flesh according to the resurrection from the dead (Romans 1:4\). Then the Spirit of God, through the Apostle Paul, brought the doctrine to a climax in 1 Corinthians 15:12\-19; study the entire reference. The 19th verse says, *“If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.”* Thank God for the resurrection! It’s what gave us life. Blessed be God!

Dear Father, thank you for the glorious resurrection of Christ that ushered in Christianity and brought us into eternal life—the indestructible, uninfectable, and impregnable life.

## WE DON’T LIVE BY BLOOD May 13th, 2022

>***But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11\).***

Leviticus 17:11 says, *“For the life of the flesh is in the blood….”*  Before you were born again, your body lived by blood. But from the day you were born again and received the Holy Spirit, you received the God\-life that doesn’t require blood for its sustenance. Now, you can better appreciate what the Bible says in John 1:12\-13: *“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God… Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.”*

When you’re born of God, you’re not human; you’re divine. That old system of having life in your body through your blood ceased to be; it was replaced by the life of the Holy Spirit. No wonder Jesus said in Mark 16:18, *“…if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them….”*

There’s no poison that gets into your system through the blood vessels that’s potent enough to wreak a havoc. This is because the life in you is indestructible—it’s the life of the Holy Spirit! Those who don’t understand this truth live the ordinary human life. That’s the reason they can be buffeted and affected by sickness, disease, infirmities, failure, lack and the corrupting influences of this present world of darkness.

Refuse to think, talk, and act or live like a mere human being; otherwise, you’ll suffer what humans suffer. Don’t let the lamentation of the Psalmist in Psalm 82:5\-7 describe the reality of your life. It says*, “They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.”* Rather, live the God\-life, the divine life, because you’re born of God, which makes you a god. Gods don’t live by blood! Hallelujah!

## TO KNOW HIM IS TO LOVE HIM May 14th, 2022
![May 14th, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/may-22-day-14-to-know-him-is-to-love-him.jpg)

>***That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death (Philippians 3:10\).***

Notice what the Apostle Paul said in the opening verse: *“That I may know him….”* This was his dream, because to know Him (Jesus) is to love Him. Anyone who doesn’t love Jesus doesn’t know Him. If they ever get to know who He is, they’ll most certainly fall in love with Him. The more you know Jesus, the more you love Him. Hallelujah.

It brings to mind the story of Paul before his conversion. He was a Pharisee and a member of the critic—religious sect that spearheaded the persecution of Christians in the early Church. Authorized by the government of the day, the Bible says, *“...he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison”* (Acts 8:3\).

He didn’t stop at that. Luke tells us how he continued to issue violent threats of murder against the followers of the Lord (Acts 9:1\). But something happened that changed his life forever. He had a destiny\-shaping encounter with the Lord on the road to Damascus. The Bible says, *“And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do…”* (Acts 9:3\-6\). Hallelujah!

Paul, as a result of this new knowledge of the Lord, couldn’t keep back anymore; everywhere he went, he testified that Jesus is alive and that He’s real! Paul’s love for Jesus was unquenchable because he now knew the Lord.

No wonder he said in Ephesians 3:19, *“And to know the love of Christ…that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.”* This is God’s will for you: that you’d have a revelation of Christ beyond human understanding and be filled with His fullness, overflowing in His love, manifesting His life, nature, character and power. Hallelujah!

## THE SUPPLY ZONE May 15th, 2022

>***According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (2 Peter 1:3\).***

Blessed be God! The Word of God is so enthralling, edifying and fulfilling! Think about what we just read in our theme verse: we’ve been given everything we require for an excellent life of glory, dominion, righteousness and superabundance.

It reminds of what the Spirit says through Paul in Ephesians 1:3: *“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.”* As a Christian, you’re in the supply zone; you dwell in surplus.

David said, *“He maketh me to lie down in green pastures…”* (Psalm 23:2\); that’s your abode—the place of never \-ending, superabundant wealth, where you have no consciousness of want or need.

You need to know who you are as a child of God: you’re the seed of Abraham. You’re an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ. That means you own this world. Everything the Father owns belongs to you, because you’re His heir. How then could you be broke? Think about the monarchs of this world; their children are born into wealth. Do you think it’s any different with our God? He’s the Monarch of the universe.

No wonder the Spirit prayed through the Apostle Paul in Ephesians 1:18 that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened to know the hope of His calling, and the unfathomable riches of the glory of His inheritance bequeathed to His saints. You were born into an incorruptible, inexhaustible inheritance. Become conscious of this every day and it’ll change your life completely.

Christianity is a life you practise. As long as you remain in that babyhood stage of always needing and expecting some kind of financial miracles, you’ve not yet understood Christianity and your inheritance in Christ. What you need is a “mental crossover” into the zone of continual abundant supply.

Study 2 Corinthians 9:8 AMPC; it says*, “And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self\-sufficient \[possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].”* This is where God wants you to function; it’s the life Christ has given us!

## MANDATE TO SHINE May 16th, 2022

>***Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven (Matthew 5:14,16\).***

It’s estimated that there’re almost 9 billion people in the world today. Despite the statistics, it’s interesting to know that no other human was exactly like you in the past, none is like you now, and none will ever be like you. God made it so! Your uniqueness is such that can’t be obscured. It’s the reason you must live your best, be your best, and put your best into serving the Lord, Jesus Christ.

In our theme scripture, Jesus said, “You’re the light of the world, a city on a hill that can’t be hidden.” But He didn’t stop there; He added, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” This is significant; it lets you know you have a divine mandate to shine before all men–anywhere and everywhere.

This means you can always win and make progress, no matter the circumstances of your life. Joseph, the son of Jacob, is a notable example in this regard. He was sold into slavery by his brothers and later put in prison after being wrongly accused. Yet, he shone so brightly in the midst of all those difficult times and eventually went on to become the prime minister in a foreign country, according to God’s plan and purpose.

As you heed the Master’s instruction to shine, setting forth His wonderful deeds and displaying His virtues and perfections, the Scripture says men would glorify your Father in heaven. I encourage you to put your focus and best energies on what God has called you to do, no matter where you are in life. It won’t be long before you’re catapulted to a higher dimension of success, with your life continually bringing Him glory and honour.

## TRANSFORMATION BY THE WORD May 17th, 2022

>***But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18\).***

As you study the Word of God, you see a glorious you, because the Word mirrors you. The picture of you that you see in the Word is always one of glory. You’ll see that divinity is at work in you; you’ll see the power of an endless life. The more you see it, the more you’re transformed into the same image that you see in the Word. It’s an amazing spiritual principle. That’s the reality of how the Word of God works.

That’s why James admonishes us to keep looking into the Word of God, which he calls the perfect law of liberty (James 1:25\). Keep looking at the scriptures that talk about your righteousness, your oneness with the Lord, your triumphant life in Christ Jesus.

Jesus said in John 15:16*, “...I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain....”* This means He’s given you a life of endless prosperity; your success shouldn’t be short\-lived. Contemplate this, every day. As you behold such words, the reality of what they say becomes your vital experience.

Through the Word, you’re established in righteousness and flourish like the palm tree, with great grace and glory! Maybe it’s your health; Isaiah 33:24 says “they that dwell in Zion shall not say, ‘I am sick.’” Meditate on it consciously. As you do, you’d come to the realization that the reason you don’t say, “I’m sick” is that you don’t get sick. You’re an associate of the God\-kind; you have the indestructible life of God in you.

The same goes for your safety and protection. The Word says in Psalm 23:4*, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.”* That means no matter what happens, your safety is guaranteed in Christ. Christ is the environment in which you dwell; therefore, you’re forever in safety. Take this seriously. Outline areas where you want changes; search out the relevant scriptures and meditate on them consciously. Praise God!

## LET’S GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS May 18th, 2022

>***Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will (Romans 12:2 NIV).***

Right from the very beginning of my Christian walk, I always wanted to know what God wanted, what’s on His mind. I wanted to know His perfect will about everything, so I could serve Him rightly. I didn’t want to ever find myself in a certain direction, or doing something, only to discover that it wasn’t what God wanted.

So, oftentimes, He directed me to the Scriptures. But He did something even more: He opened my understanding in an extraordinary way, because He saw my heart. It’s one of the ways I get to know His heart about anything, about what He wants.

Therefore, in serving God, it’s about Him, what He wants and how He wants it. It’s not about our feelings, impulses or sense knowledge. For example, in praising and worshipping Him, we shouldn’t find ourselves doing it in a way that He isn’t pleased with. Praise and worship in the Church is so important to God; it’s something we must do according to the prescribed order—according to His Word.

Some believe clapping is a way to praise and worship God, but it isn’t. Clapping is applause; you don’t applaud God. These are some of the things we’ve done in the past that God wants us to correct. He is perfecting His Church for His return. We don’t clap for God. You may say, “But Psalm 47:1 says*, ‘O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.”*’ That was written for those in the Old Testament and it wasn’t for us to copy because those in the Old Testament mostly walked in the flesh. If you want to know how you’re supposed to serve God, how you’re to praise and worship Him as a new creation, study the New Testament, the epistles. There, we’re told *“For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh”* (Philippians 3:3 NKJV).

The Lord is perfecting His Church with His truth. So, we’ve got to put things in their proper places so we’ll get the right results. Let’s give Him what He wants, which is true spiritual worship through the Holy Spirit.

## PROTECT YOUR HEART WITH GOD’S TRUTH May 19th, 2022

>***My child, listen and be wise. Keep your heart on the right course (Proverbs 23:19 NLT).***

There’re things that some people do that invite demons into their lives without them knowing. They yield themselves to the influence of demons through certain kinds of music, dance, among several other things. For example, Christians who visit pornographic websites open themselves to demons. In the Old Testament, God forbade His children from looking at the nakedness of others (Read Leviticus 18\). 

Such things aren’t acceptable to God. They’re not consistent with the life of righteousness. Think about it: How does Christ come into the heart of a man? When you believe in Jesus Christ and confess His lordship, He comes into your heart in an instant. That’s the same way a man can open his heart to demons when he exposes himself to things that are inspired by demons. 

Protect and keep yourself from all unrighteousness. The Bible says*, “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness”* (Romans 1:18\). Refuse to harbour unclean thoughts. Use the Word to purify your heart of anger, bitterness and malice.

The Word of God is a cleanser. As you meditate on the Word, you’re cleansed from ALL unrighteousness: *“Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you”* (John 15:3\). Live as a Christian. Our theme verse says to keep your heart on the right course, on God’s truth. Protect your mind and spirit with the Word.

In Proverbs 23:26 (NIV), God says, *“My son, give me your heart and let your eyes delight in my ways.”* Let your heart delight in His Word, in His righteousness, and live a life worthy of Him—pleasing Him in every way. Hallelujah!

## WE LIVE IN HIS PRESENCE May 20th, 2022

>***Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you (John 14:17\).***

In Christianity, we don’t go in and out of God’s presence. His presence is our home; we were born therein. When you study Psalm 87:4, you’d observe the prophetic reference: *“I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.”*  “This man” refers to the new creation. “There” refers to our place in Christ—our place in God’s presence.

This is the reason it’s an absurdity when a Christian says, “Father, I come to you today”; or “Let’s get into the presence of God through worship.” I often wonder: if they’re about to get into the presence of God, where then have they been? God’s children must understand that we live in His presence.

There’s no such thing in the New Testament as us “getting into” the presence of God. In Him we live and move and have our being. His presence is in us and with us. When you come into a place, you come with His presence. If you’re born again, nobody can take you into the presence of God, because you were born right into His presence, and you live in His presence, both legally and vitally. Hallelujah!

## PRAYING FOR OUR EVANGELICAL WORK May 21st, 2022
![May 21st, 2022](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/may-22-day-21-praying-for-our-evangelical-work.jpg)

>***In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them (2 Corinthians 4:4\).***

The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 9:37, *“…The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few.”* The harvest He’s referring to is the souls of men, the world of sinners. The labourers are those who are reaching out with the Gospel to win these lost souls to Christ. That’s why we have to pray and intercede for the harvest field, for the souls of men that we intend to reach within and beyond our catchments, because the harvest is ripe.

Prayer is our number one requirement in our evangelical work. As we intercede for them, we’re to prophesy by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Our prophetic prayer is how we pour out righteousness and salvation on the nations. Set times for prayer, either as an individual, family, group or as a Church. Plan and map out definite prayer times for your evangelical work.

If we would pray correctly and effectively as He has asked us to, our preaching will be effective. In some cases, you wouldn’t even have to preach much or preach at all before sinners start crying out to the Lord for salvation.

Through prayer—particularly praying in the Spirit— you pour forth gushers of living water (John 7:38\). Your words become so effective just like Paul said in 1 Corinthians 2:4: *“And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.”* Then you find that through you, the heavens constantly rain down righteousness, and salvation is springing up everywhere. Hallelujah!

## HIS ETERNAL GLORY IN US May 22nd, 2022

>***For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 4:6\).***

The opening verse is an extraordinary description of something scientifically impossible. Notice the verse isn’t saying that God commanded the light to shine into the darkness; that would have been wonderful because the question then would be, “Where did the light come from?” Then we’d say, “It came from God; He shone into the darkness.”

But this time, God didn’t shine the light into the darkness; rather, He commanded the light to shine forth from it. So, the light came out of darkness! This is the same God that has shined in our hearts—to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

Remember, there was the glory of God in the old tabernacle, in the days of Moses. That glory, the Bible says, faded away. But the one from Jesus Christ is eternal glory, excellent glory. That’s the glory that resides in you today: *“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels. That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us”* (2 Corinthians 4:7\).

Every day, declare that you’re a carrier of God’s divine presence, a bearer of His glory. Your life isn’t empty; there’s a treasure of power, love, light and divine perfection in you. The excellence of His power permeates through you, causing everything you do to prosper. Glory to God!

## A MORE EXCELLENT WAY TO GIVE PRAISE May 23rd, 2022

>***And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod (2 Samuel 6:14\).***

There’re those who thought that in the verse above David was merely dancing in the flesh. So, oftentimes they’d say they want to dance like David danced, and they start gyrating with all their might. No! David was a man of the Spirit. When the Ark of God was being brought into the city of David, our theme verse says *“...David danced before the LORD with all his might; **and David was girded with a linen ephod.**”*

Notice the underlined part. In those days, dressing with a linen ephod represented the office of the priest. Whenever the priest was in that regalia, he functioned in his spiritual office. David was girded with a linen ephod; being also a prophet, evidently instructed by the Spirit, his dance as described in the Hebrew text was very different from the fleshly dance of normal celebrations.

When the Bible says he danced before the Lord, the Hebrew word for dance is ”karar”, and it doesn’t refer to the kind of whirling and gyrating that most people think. “Karar” means to skip and jump and spin, turning around about your own axis, like a child.

David’s dance is similar to what Jesus did in Luke 10:21; the Bible says, *“In that hour Jesus rejoiced (Greek: agalliao) in spirit….”* He was skipping and jumping like a child. So, that David danced with all “his might” doesn’t refer to exerting himself physically on the dance floor, like most people do today. The term is “oze, oze” in Hebrew, meaning that he danced with all his glory, all his majesty; he danced with all of God’s regalia on him. Glory to God!

The best description for it in the New Testament is the Greek word “agalliao”; it’s a dance from the inside. Dancing in the flesh distracts your spirit from true reverence and worship; it dissipates spiritual power, and many don’t realize this.

In these last days, the Spirit of God is showing us a more excellent way to give God true praise and worship. The days of fleshly dance in Christian congregations are over. When we worship the Lord, it must and should always be in the spirit: *“For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh”* (Philippians 3:3\). Also, John 4:23\-24 says, *“But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”*

## CALLED TO LEAD May 24th, 2022

>***Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen (Matthew 28:19\-20\).***

In our bid to evangelize the world, we must fully understand activism, advocacy and real leadership. Jesus said, *“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations….”* It means we’re to make pupils of the nations. The word “nations” is from the Greek “Ethnos.” Ethnos refers to different groups with some common factors that bring them together. For example, a family, a group of politicians, an association of doctors, etc.

So, when Jesus used the term “nations” you could interpret it as countries, families, groups, professional bodies, and so on. The Lord instructs that we go into all such places and lead. Remember, He said in Matthew 5:14, *“Ye are the light of the world….”* You’re a leader in your world. Take up your role as a protagonist.

A protagonist is an advocate or champion of a particular cause or idea. One of the ways a protagonist works is through innovation. You open your mind and find new ways of getting in and getting ahead with the Gospel. As a protagonist, develop more cutting\-edge means and strategies for the advancement of the Kingdom.

Always think about how you can reach more people or a whole “nation” for the Lord. Then, come up, by the Spirit, with innovative ideas to accomplish it. Remember, you’re the Lord’s voice where you are. He sent you into that world so you could show others how to live the Kingdom\-life. You’re there to make a difference! Create new opportunities for the spread of the Gospel.

## LOVE LIKE CHRIST May 25th, 2022

>***Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins (1 Peter 4:8 NIV).***

If someone does something that upsets or offends you, rather than become bitter or enraged, let it go. Jesus showed us a good example of how to walk in love. He loved everyone, including His accusers and persecutors. Then He tells us in Matthew 5:44, *“But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.”* 

Emulate the Master. Have the love language and culture. Love everyone unconditionally. The Bible says*, “For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously”* (1 Peter 2:21\-23\).

Someone once asked, “In the case where the people you respect are those that hurt you, what should you do?” Honour them nonetheless. Love them. Grow out of that place where you can still be hurt. Live in God’s Word. Live like Christ and love like Him: *“Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour”* (Ephesians 5:1\-2\). 

1 Corinthians 13:4\-8 AMPC says*, “Love endures long and is patient and kind; love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy, is not boastful or vainglorious, does not display itself haughtily. It is not conceited (arrogant and inflated with pride); it is not rude (unmannerly) and does not act unbecomingly. Love (God’s love in us) does not insist on its own rights or its own way, for it is not self\-seeking; it is not touchy or fretful or resentful; it takes no account of the evil done to it \[it pays no attention to a suffered wrong]. It does not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness, but rejoices when right and truth prevail. Love bears up under anything and everything that comes, is ever ready to believe the best of every person, its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances, and it endures everything \[without weakening]. Love never fails \[never fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end] ….”*

>***And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated (Deuteronomy 34:7\).***

Have you ever heard the word “agelessness”? It’s part of our heritage in Christ. We grow, but we don’t age! Hallelujah! So never say, “You know, I’m no longer as strong as I used to be; age isn’t on my side.” As a Christian, you shouldn’t talk like that because when you were born again, eternal life was imparted to your spirit. Eternal life is life with agelessness.

In Christ, you’ve been brought into His glory and the glorified life. So, every so often, declare to yourself, “I only get stronger! I’m stronger today than I was ten years ago!” Consider Moses: at one hundred and twenty years of age, his physical stature wasn’t abated, his eyes weren’t dim. Yet, the Bible says the glory that Moses had isn’t anything compared to what we have today in Christ Jesus (2 Corinthians 3:7\-11\).

It was the same with Caleb: At the age of eighty\-five, Caleb said, *“I’m as strong today as I was when I was forty; therefore, give me this mountain”* (Read Joshua 14:7\-12\). That’s our story! Our youth is renewed like the eagle’s (Psalm 103:5\). For us, there’s only one way: We get stronger and stronger, greater and greater, we move upward and forward. Hallelujah!

Never see yourself as weak. The Bible says, *“For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day”* (2 Corinthians 4:16\). We’re continually strengthened, invigorated from within by the Holy Ghost. Take these thoughts that I share with you seriously and live the supernatural life in Christ. Praise God!

## THE WALK OF A CHRISTIAN May 27th, 2022

>***I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called (Ephesians 4:1\).***

One of the dynamics of Christianity is derived from a very important word from the verse above: WALK! There’s the walk of a Christian. When you’re born again, the first thing God wants to help you learn is how to walk in Christ in your daily life. Colossians 2:6 says, *“As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him”* (Colossians 2:6\).

How you live every day, how you relate with other people, how you relate with God—and the kind of mind you have—these are very important to God. There’s a way a Christian should and must live that distinguishes him or her from a non–Christian. Someone may be born again and not live the Christian life. In fact, some don’t even know what a Christian life really is. But the Bible says, *“This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind”* (Ephesians 4:17\).

This is one of the reasons churches and pastors are important, because the spiritual life requires training. God brings His children into congregations, church assemblies, and gives them pastors after His heart to train them, teach them, and build them through the Word (Read Ephesians 4:11\-14\).

God expects that in the Church, every new person that receives Christ, that becomes a member of the church, is trained in the Christian walk. Then, He tells us why: *“That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive”* (Ephesians 4:14\).

In the 15th verse, He tells us the end\-result—growth: *“But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.”* The Christian walk isn’t just for baby Christians. You begin learning it as a new convert, but God expects you to grow unto maturity and become firmly rooted in the faith, and live triumphantly every day to the praise and glory of His Name.

## MUSIC IS BEYOND LYRICS May 28th, 2022

>***And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD: And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them (Exodus 6:2\-3\).***

There’re some things that have crept into the house of God for many years, ruining people’s lives and many never knew. For example, some of the different styles of music and dance in some churches today, where did they come from? What spirits are behind such music and dance? The spirit behind certain music or dance is the significance of it.

If, for instance, a Christian likes to sing or dance to Reggae music, as much as we may appreciate Reggae music, the question would be, “What’s the source of Reggae music?” Music isn’t just the lyrics; make no mistakes about it. The sound of music is important just as the source is important.

Certain music could attract demons into people’s lives without them knowing. There’re things that God allows us to do for a certain time of our lives, and after a while He’ll demand a change, knowing that it was within His permissive will. When He brings in that change, we must be willing to embrace it.

We read in our theme scripture what He said to Moses. He said to him, “Abraham, Isaac and Jacob knew me as El Shaddai; they didn’t know me as Jehovah; but I am Jehovah.” Why was this important? By the revelation of EL Shaddai, Moses wouldn’t be able to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt. Moses would need the “Jehovah” revelation, and by the hand of Jehovah, he’d deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt. That’s the purpose of the revelation that was given to Moses.

Likewise, as we prepare for the coming of the Lord, there’re certain things we must change based on the guidance of the Spirit and revelation from His Word. There’s a way He wants us to live, serve and worship Him, especially through music. We must be open and willing to receive His guidance and correction. Praise God!

## THE CHURCH IS GOD’S SECURITY SYSTEM May 29th, 2022

>***Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils (1 Timothy 4:1\).***

In some parts of the world today, there’s a satanic plan to go after the children. Some are peddling the idea that children don’t have to listen to their parents, because they (the children) belong to the state. But beyond the children, the strategy is actually an outward expression of a spiritual attack that’s also taking place. There’s a satanic move to give people an impression that churches aren’t important. So, they say, “You don’t have to be a member of a church; just serve God generally and you’ll be fine.” They spread the idea that you can just be raised through the internet, listening to different preachers online.

What they’re trying to do is an attempt to pull those Christians out of the security system that God created for families, thereby exposing them to satanic attacks. Therefore, be smart. The Bible says an heir, as long as he’s a child, he’s placed under tutors and governors until a time set by the Father (Galatians 4:1\-2\). Also, he tells us to not forsake the assembly of the local church as some do in bad behaviour (Hebrews 10:25\).

When someone says, “I go to many churches, I don’t have any particular one,” it’s proof that he or she has been deceived by the modus operandi of Satan. The structures that God has set in His Word are important; they have to be used for the purposes for which the Lord set them. You not only grow in the church, you also learn and participate in ministry to others.

In the church, the pastoral ministry nurtures the brethren, trains them in the prayer life, faith, and to live the Christian life victoriously daily as we await the imminent return of Christ. So, when you win souls, salvation is only the beginning; guide them to church. It’s for their security, spiritual growth, edification and ministry.

Dear Lord, thank you for the opportunity to be a member of the body of Christ and participate actively in a local assembly. I pray for new converts around the world alongside those who may have been misled; that they’d understand the Church as your security system for them, a place of refuge, comfort, and refreshing. And as they come in, they’ll grow spiritually and be effective in the work and ministry of reconciliation, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## GRACE HEAPED UPON GRACE May 30th, 2022

>***But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever Amen (2 Peter 3:18\).***

Did you know that you could walk in ever\-increasing grace? This is what God wants for your life: grace heaped upon grace such that no matter the challenges you face, the grace to put you over is available. John 1:16 says, *“And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.”* The Amplified version says, *“For out of His fullness \[the superabundance of His grace and truth] we have all received grace upon grace \[spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing, favor upon favor, and gift heaped upon gift].”*

The Greek margin actually says, “Grace heaped upon grace.” This encompasses spiritual blessings, favours, gifts, etc. Every day, be conscious that you have grace for whatever you need and for anything you have to do. The grace of God on your life is the inner working of the glory and power of God that radiates excellence. That grace causes you to have uncommon results.

Your contemporaries might be as gifted as you or even have more abilities than yourself, but God’s grace at work in you will take you to a higher plane and cause you to have results that completely outclass theirs. Hallelujah.

Promotion in your life means more grace. If you’re promoted with more responsibilities without the accompanying grace, you may not succeed at that new level. We understand how this works from a simple verse in the Bible: James 4:6; it says*, “But he giveth more grace….”*

Notice it doesn’t say, “He gave more grace”; rather, it says, “He GIVES more grace.” That means you can enter into that verse every day, every week, every year; it’s a word that’s active and can be activated anytime. That’s how the prophetic word of God works; claim this for your life today.

Dear Father, I receive more grace and increase in the workings of your power in my life. The knowledge of your Word causes me to walk in an overflow of grace, and that grace produces favour, beauty, goodwill, loveliness, perfections, glory and ability in my life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## BE VISIONARY WITH THE GOSPEL May 31st, 2022

>***In such ways I have trailblazed a preaching of the Message of Jesus all the way from Jerusalem far into northwestern Greece. This has all been pioneer work, bringing the Message only into those places where Jesus was not yet known and worshiped (Romans 15:19\-20 MSG).***

Paul was a trailblazer, a visionary apostle. What we read in our opening verse reveals his mindset and passion to preach and share the Gospel in places where Christ hadn’t been known. He was in the vanguard of taking the glorious Gospel to new, unconverted souls.

Wherever Paul went, he began to research if Christ’s name had already been known in such a place. And when he found that the Gospel had been established in that city, he simply moved into new cities and regions where the message wasn’t known, and pioneered the work. This was the kind of ministry that Paul had: ever\-increasing vision!

It wasn’t that Paul was ignoring other places and looking only for places where Christ hadn’t been preached; no! Read the statement he made before what we read in our opening scripture; he said, ***“...from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ”*** (Romans 15:19\). Think about that!

Emulate Paul’s kind of vision, where you take the map of your city and research to know where the light of the Gospel is still dim or non\-existent, with the goal of moving in with the Gospel. If there’re places you can’t go physically, you send in Bibles and Rhapsody of Realities.

*“...This Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come”* (Matthew 24:14\). Those are the words of Jesus; they must be personal to you. Be passionate about spreading the message of the Gospel, not just in your catchment but also to the regions beyond. Pioneer new cells, fellowships and churches in places where you’re aware they don’t exist. The Lord’s mandate is still in force. He said, *“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature”* (Mark 16:15\). 

Utilize every opportunity to preach the Gospel. The harvest is ready. Hallelujah!
