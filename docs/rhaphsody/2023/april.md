## PARALYZE HIS INFLUENCE April 1st, 2023

 >***Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience (Ephesians 2:2).***

***Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience (***[***Ephesians 2:2***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:2&version=kjv)***).***

The expression, *“…the power of the air…”* in the scripture above refers to an atmosphere or behaviour indicative of some quality or trait; like you’d say, “An air of unbelief.” It could be the atmosphere in a region indicative of something foul, evil or dark about that place; it’s the work of the prince of the power of the air. But you’re to paralyze his influence.

Churches, people, families and individuals could be influenced by “the air” of their city without their knowing. The church that was in Corinth, for example, was influenced by the city of Corinth; likewise the church at Ephesus.

However, through the teaching of God's Word, the apostles made the people understand that only through the Holy Spirit could they rise above the spirit of their environment and break the power of that prince of the power of the air.

The prince of the power of the air brings an air of poverty into a place, a feeling of inadequacy; he causes the destruction, hatred, killings, murders, wickedness and violence in the world today. He can run families, cities, kingdoms and nations, determining a lot of things that happen in them.

But the Bible says, *“For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, which smote with a rod”* ([Isaiah 30:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2030:31&version=kjv)). The Assyrian is prophetic of the Antichrist spirit. The “voice of the LORD” is contextualized for us here as the Word of God spoken by the power of the Holy Spirit. That’s the “rhema” of God, which is the sword of the Spirit! It discomfits Satan and the princes of darkness.

With the Word on your lips, you destroy the activities of the prince of the power of the air; you paralyze his influence over your nation, your city, your family, personal life and environment. Hallelujah!

## STAY POSITIVE April 2nd, 2023
![April 2nd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/apr-23-day-2-stay-positive-new-min.jpg)

 >***Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things (Philippians 4:8).***

***Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things (***[***Philippians 4:8***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204:8&version=kjv)***).***

One of the ways to live happily every day is to always stay positive with the Word, and think good thoughts about other people. Never allow anyone bring some negativities into your life to defile the purity of your heart and the joy of seeing others with the eyes with which God sees them. Stay with the good thoughts about everyone.

God’s love believes only the best about others every time. Some people get in awkward situations for believing all the wrong and negative things they heard about others, and end up losing good relationships. For example, you probably know a lot of things about certain people in your congregation, family or neighbourhood. But never dwell on the negatives.

The Bible shows us clearly what we should give our minds to; how to think and what to think about. That’s what we read in our opening verse. Don’t dwell on allegations against people. When you set your thinking on thoughts that are contrary to those listed in the opening verse, you become the reflection of such thoughts.

But imagine if your life is the reflection of things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report. How beautiful your life would be! Your character is the reflection of your thoughts. The more positive your thoughts are, the more peaceful and excellent your life would be.

## USE YOUR FAITH April 3rd, 2023

>***For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world; and this is the victory that conquers the world, even our faith (1 John 5:4 AMPC).***

In [Romans 12:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:3&version=kjv), the Bible says, *“…God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.”* We all have faith, and according to our theme verse, the faith that was administered to us from God's eternal Word conquers the world! It’s the faith of the Kingdom. Our hearts are receptive to God’s Word and we can always trust His Word to produce faith in our hearts, and with our faith, we have victory over the world, its system, and its fears. Hallelujah! 

We’re not victims in this life. In [Mark 9:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:23&version=kjv), Jesus didn’t say, “Some things (or most) things are possible”; neither did He say, "All things are possible to God." Rather, He declared, *“... If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.”* That means anything is possible to anyone who believes; that includes you. So, how are you going to make all things possible unto you? It’s with your faith! That’s your instrument. You can use your faith for anything.

When you face challenges, put your faith to work. If you ever think that your faith isn’t strong enough, all you have to do is listen to, or study the Word of God. The Word of God will produce faith; that’s the miracle power of God’s Word: it stirs faith. That’s the source of faith in the heart of any man.

That’s why this devotional, Rhapsody of Realities, is very important, because the more you study it, the more faith comes to you. His glory is in His Word; His power is in His Word; His character is in His Word. Therefore, it’s impossible for the Word not to produce faith in you and put you over all adversities. Don’t cry or complain when you face challenges; use your faith and win!

## LIVING IN THE SPIRIT April 4th, 2023

>***If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit (***[***Galatians 5:25***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:25&version=kjv)***).***

As Christians, we don’t go in and out of the Spirit; we live in the Spirit. Our theme verse makes it clear: it says, “Because we live in the Spirit, we should walk in the Spirit.” There’re two common expressions that you find in the Bible for being in the Spirit. One is to be in a vision or trance where your physical senses are more or less suspended. However, that’s a temporal experience.

The other and more important expression of being in the Spirit is being born into the Spirit, where you become aware and alive to the spirit\-realm through the Word and the Holy Ghost. You live in that consciousness even though you’re in this world and your physical senses are conscious of your natural environment.

In the latter, you’re living with the mindset of the heavenly being that you are. You see the same things with other people, but you have a different interpretation and a different understanding. You're Spirit\-ruled; you see things the Kingdom way; the Word of God dictates your actions and responses to life and everything around you. You dominate your environment with the atmosphere of the Spirit. Hallelujah!

## WHEN THE SPIRIT TAKES OVER April 5th, 2023
![April 5th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/apr-23-day-5-when-the-spirit-takes-over-min.jpg)

 >***Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (Romans 8:26).***

***Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (***[***Romans 8:26***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:26&version=kjv)***).***

If as a Christian, you’ve come to a point in your life where it seems everything is now a drag, you don’t seem to be making the kind of progress you desire or that’s expected, there’s a way out! Maybe you’ve even tried everything you know to do, but there’s still no commensurate progress, don’t be frustrated. You can have a complete turnaround today.

First, understand that life is spiritual and except you operate from the realm of the Spirit, you can’t achieve meaningful success. Our opening verse lets us know that we can take charge of our lives and situations from the realm of the Spirit by praying in the Spirit.

When we pray in tongues, the Spirit Himself gives us utterance in spiritual vocabulary. Beyond this utterance in tongues, we have deep sighs or groanings as in the opening verse: *“Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered”* ([Romans 8:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:26&version=kjv)).

This is a better and higher way to pray. When you’re faced with serious crises in your life, it may get to the point where you don’t know or have words with which to express yourself or deal with the situation. At that point, you might want to just get on the floor before the Lord, in absolute dependence on the Holy Spirit, until He takes over for you. Hallelujah!

With these groanings, the Holy Spirit makes intercession for you and God’s people. You can learn and train yourself in this by giving more time and attention to prayer; yielding yourself to God. These are Kingdom secrets given to us from the Word, for us to live victoriously in life. Glory to God!

## MENDING YOUR WORLD April 6th, 2023

>***Through faith we understand that THE WORLDS WERE FRAMED by the word of God… (***[***Hebrews 11:3***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:3&version=kjv)***).***

The Greek word, “aion” is what is translated as “worlds” in the verse above. It refers to course of life; an era, or the structure and administration of things as they are in the world. Every now and then, the devil tries to turn the course of this world in his direction; he likes to impose his own system on the world and force us to live in his system. But he’s subject to us, so we can’t allow him to have his way.

For example, when a city or a nation gets new leaders, Satan often attempts to make such leaders follow his agenda. Those leaders may never know when they're being influenced and caused to lie and deceive their people and nation.

Even when the people find out that they’re being deceived, they can’t reverse the damage; they can’t free themselves. But the Bible says, *“For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God…. Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now”* ([Romans 8:19\-22](https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Romans%208:19-22kjv)).

We’re the ones to deliver the world—all of creation— from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. How? It’s with the Word of God (the “rhema” of God) on our lips. With the Word of God, you can repair, construct and reconstruct the course of your life and your world.

That’s what the men and women of faith did in Bible days. Through faith, they framed or repaired their world with the Word of God. It's what God expects of us today: we must frame our era with the Word of God through faith.

## THE FAITH OF JESUS CHRIST April 7th, 2023

 >***I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me (Galatians 2:20).***

***I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me (***[***Galatians 2:20***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:20&version=kjv)***).***

In our theme verse, Paul alludes to the faith of the Son of God—the faith of Jesus Christ! Did you know that He had faith in you? The Bible tells us that for the joy, the glory, that was set before Him, He endured the Cross, despising the shame ([Hebrews 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:2&version=kjv)). You’re that joy and glory He saw for which He gave His life, not minding a criminal’s death. He saw what you'd become by virtue of His vicarious death.

The Bible says God’s dream was to indwell man, for man to be His living tabernacle. In [Proverbs 8:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208:31&version=kjv), the Bible says the Spirit rejoiced in the habitable part of His earth; but His delights were with the sons of men. Jesus gave His life to realize God’s dream: His dream of us becoming the glory of God; His dream of us becoming the righteousness of God; His dream of us becoming associates of the God\-kind. He gave His life so God’s plan for us to have and enjoy life to the full would be realized.

Now we live in righteousness, prosperity, health, dominion, victory and excellence forever, because of the faith of Jesus Christ! He had faith in what He did. He had faith in you and trusted you with His life. He knew if you’d believe His Gospel, you’d become like Him, and now you’re like Him: *“...As He is, so are we in this world”* ([1 John 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&version=kjv)).

Believe in what He did, who He is, and what He’s made you. Believe in yourself. Live by His faith. Decide that you’re going to be everything He died and came back to life for you to become, achieve, and enjoy. Make up your mind your life will be for His glory and for His praise as you fulfil your destiny in Him.

## HE’S ALL LOVE April 8th, 2023

>***He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love (***[***1 John 4:8***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:8&version=kjv)***).***

Oftentimes, we say that God is loving; yes, He is. But it’s important to understand that love isn’t just a quality He possesses; it’s who He is. God is love. Love is His nature. Everything He does is love\-inspired. 

[Ephesians 2:4\-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:4-5&version=kjv) talks about His great and amazing love. It says, *“But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved).”*

When Jesus restored sight to the blind, healed the deaf, made the lame to walk, restored maimed limbs and raised the dead, they were all acts of love. He was love made flesh; love personified. The Bible tells us how a certain woman who suffered haemorrhage for twelve years pressed through the crowd to touch the hem of His garment for healing. She pressed through the crowd at the risk of her life to get to Jesus. Remember, the Law forbade anyone to make physical contact with others during a blood issue; she’d have been stoned to death if her blood condition was discovered.

But the Bible says she thought to herself, "If I can just put a finger on His robe, I'll get well." She did and was healed instantly. Everything Jesus is and represents is love. His communication and actions pointed everyone to the Father’s love. He was the revelation of God’s love.

He said in [John 15:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:9&version=MSG) (MSG), *"I've loved you the way my Father has loved me. Make yourselves at home in my love.”* He loves you unconditionally and unequivocally. Let this inspire you today and always, and provoke in you such audacity of faith.

## HE DIDN’T DIE FOR “CHRISTIANS” April 9th, 2023
![April 9th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/apr-23-day-9-he-didnt-die-for-christians-min.jpg)

 >***Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).***
---
***Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (***[***2 Corinthians 5:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=kjv)***).***

When we speak generically, we say, “Jesus died for the whole world.” Yes, that’s absolutely correct. But in some sense, He didn’t die for Christians. There’s a huge difference when we say, “all of us,” meaning everyone in the world, and “all of us,” referring to Christians.

In the generic sense, Jesus died for all of us—the whole world; He was judged for us. But when you believed that He died for you and was raised back to life for your justification, it became possible for eternal life to be imparted to your spirit. Once that happened, you were born again; you became a Christian—a new creation.

The new creation is a brand\-new man, a brand\-new species of being; he has no past. You aren’t the same person that was born of your father and your mother; that’s the “old man” with the sin nature. That “old man” or “old you” died with Christ: *“Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin”* ([Romans 6:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:6&version=kjv)).

The new you—the new creation—came from the resurrection: *“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life”* ([Romans 6:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:4&version=kjv)). This “new you” is created in righteousness and holiness: *“And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness”* ([Ephesians 4:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:24&version=kjv)). Hallelujah!

If it's true that the new creation has no past (and it's true), then he isn’t the one that Jesus died for. Understanding this will help you a great deal in your Christian walk. It’ll make it easier for you to understand why you’re justified. The Bible says Jesus Christ was raised back to life for our justification ([Romans 4:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:25&version=kjv)). You’ve been justified in Him. In other words, in the mind of justice, you never sinned. You’re the righteousness of God in Christ.

The new creation has no past (and it's true), then he isn’t the one that Jesus died for. Understanding this will help you a great deal in your Christian walk. It’ll make it easier for you to understand why you’re justified.

## LIVING IN THE VICTORY OF CHRIST April 10th, 2023
![April 10th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/apr-23-day-10-living-in-the-victory-of-christ-b-min.jpg)

 >***Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us (Romans 8:35-37).***

***Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us (***[***Romans 8:35\-37***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:35-37&version=kjv)***).***

Life may be filled with adversities, but the Word says you’re more than a conqueror through Christ. This should give you comfort, peace and joy. You’re living in the victory of Christ. He assured us of victory over crises and challenges when He said, *"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulations: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world”* ([John 16:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:33&version=kjv)).

The Bible says in [1 John 4:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&version=kjv), *"Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."* You’ve been lifted over and above the corrupting influences of this world.

Our opening scripture states clearly that neither tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril nor sword could separate you from the love of God. Then it concludes by saying you’re more than a conqueror. Being more than a conqueror means you conquered in Christ before the foundation of the earth. Hallelujah! There’s nothing to struggle with or try to overcome anymore. When He arose from the grave a victor and a champion, you were in Him.

Don't allow the circumstances of life make you a victim. You were born into the victorious life in Christ: *“Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place”* ([2 Corinthians 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%202:14&version=kjv)).

## WORDS ARE SEEDS April 11th, 2023
![April 11th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/apr-23-day-11-words-are-seeds-min.jpg)

 >***Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap (Galatians 6:7).***

***Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap (***[***Galatians 6:7***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%206:7&version=kjv)***).***

While explaining the parable of the sower, the Lord Jesus emphasized in the eleventh verse that the seed the sower sowed was the Word of God. He lets us know that words are seeds and that what you sow is what you reap.

If you sow the right words into your life and future, they’ll produce the right harvest. Always steer your life in God’s direction for you with the right words. You can’t keep speaking negatively and expect to have an excellent life.

[Proverbs 15:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2015:4&version=kjv) says, *“A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.”* Here, see how Solomon connects words with seed, tree and fruits. A wholesome tongue is one that speaks life, health, healing, righteousness and abundance. That wholesome tongue is a tree of life.

Many unknowingly bruise their spirits by speaking words that are inconsistent with the provisions of the Gospel. This is why you must train yourself to talk right. Speak blessed words. Your life goes in the direction of your words.

[Colossians 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%204:6&version=kjv) says, *“Let your speech (your words) be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.”* In other words, don’t speak idle, inoperative and uninspiring words, for you’d give account of your words: *“But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment”* ([Matthew 12:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:36&version=kjv)).

Your life today is the harvest of all the words you’ve been speaking. Therefore, always speak righteousness, peace, health, wealth and joy.

## ALIVE TO SPIRITUAL REALITIES April 12th, 2023
![April 12th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/apr-23-day-12-alive-to-spiritual-realities-new-min.jpg)

 >***Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 6:11).***

***Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord (***[***Romans 6:11***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:11&version=kjv)***).***

What we just read is absolutely life\-transforming: we’re alive to God, alive to spiritual realities of the Kingdom. The Apostle Paul made a similar statement in [Ephesians 2:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:1&version=kjv); it says, *“And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins.”*

To be quickened is to be made alive. When Jesus died, you died in Him. When God raised Him from the dead, you were raised together with Him. You were awakened in God; you came alive in the spirit. This is the reason you can understand the realities of God’s Kingdom.

The one who isn’t born again isn’t alive to God; he’s dead spiritually and gropes in the darkness. [1 Corinthians 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:14&version=kjv) says, *“But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.”* In [Luke 8:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:10&version=kjv), the Lord Jesus said it is given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of God. 

Every so often, declare that you’re filled with the knowledge of God’s will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. Affirm that you have an understanding heart. This is part of your heritage in Christ.

The Lord Jesus said in [John 8:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:12&version=kjv), *“…I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”* [1 Corinthians 2:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:12&version=kjv) says, *"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."* You have insight into the mysteries and realities of the Kingdom, into your inheritance, rights, benefits, privileges and blessings in Christ. Hallelujah!

## ALL BLESSINGS FULFILLED IN CHRIST April 13th, 2023

 >***Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light (Colossians 1:12).***

***Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light (***[***Colossians 1:12***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:12&version=kjv)***).***

In [Exodus 19:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2019:5&version=kjv), God spoke to Moses and instructed him to tell the Israelites that if they’d obey his voice, then they’d be His treasured possession—a priestly kingdom and a holy nation: *“Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation…”* ([Exodus 19:5\-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2019:5-6&version=kjv)).

But thanks be unto God! The promise that was preconditioned on their obedience to God’s commandment has been given to us and fulfilled in us in Christ. God ushered us into this by the new birth in Christ. Hallelujah!

Hence the Apostle Peter declares in his epistle, *“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, \[God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light”* ([1 Peter 2:9 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&version=AMPC)). In [Revelation 1:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201:5&version=kjv), observe the tenses used: *“And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood.”* He loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood!

The 6th verse says He has made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. No wonder the Spirit says through Paul in [2 Corinthians 1:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%201:20&version=kjv)*, “For all the promises of God in him (Christ) are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us."* Hallelujah!

## THREE RESPONSIBILITIES OF PRIESTS April 14th, 2023
![April 14th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/apr-23-day-14-three-responsibilities-of-priests-min.jpg)

 >***And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen (Revelations 1:6).***

***And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen (***[***Revelation 1:6***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201:6&version=kjv)***).***

As God’s people in the earth, we’re king\-priests; that is, royal priests. [1 Peter 2:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&version=kjv) says, *“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people….”* What are the responsibilities of a priest? The responsibilities of a priest are in three folds.

First, a priest offers gifts to God. When people bring material gifts to the house of God, the priest is empowered by God to convert these from material substance to spiritual substance, useful to God. Without the office of a priest, material things presented to God remain mundane and thus of no spiritual value.

Secondly, the priest is called to intercede for men; he stands between God and men. It is his office to do so, and when he does that, God is also obligated to hear the priest’s voice and respond accordingly.

Thirdly, the priest is called to teach the Word and reveal the principles and way of life of the Kingdom of God to men. He’s called to teach the people how to live for God and towards God. These are the three assignments given to the priest. So, as God’s priests, we offer gifts, we intercede in prayer, and we teach the knowledge of God. Hallelujah!

***But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light (***[***1 Peter 2:9***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&version=kjv)***).***

In our previous study, we outlined three important roles of the priest: to offer gifts, intercede in prayer, and teach the knowledge of God. These are responsibilities for us to carry out now, not at the millennial reign of Christ; it’s our ministry now!

A study of the prophetic writings concerning the millennial reign of Christ shows us what Israel will be doing during that time and also our own roles. The millennial reign of Christ is Israel’s restoration and millennial exercise of the Christ\-life which we already had throughout the Church age.

Thus, the millennial reign isn’t towards the Church; the Church already reigned in the earth for two thousand years THROUGH Jesus Christ ([Romans 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:17&version=kjv)), and will reign WITH Him in the millennial period. But when do we function as priests? When do we teach the knowledge of God, intercede for men, and offer gifts? It’s NOW! Our priesthood is now!

[Revelation 1:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201:6&version=kjv) says, *“And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.”* [Revelation 5:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%205:10&version=kjv) also says He has *“…made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth."* We’re in office as king\-priests of God, in the earth.

He’s given us the responsibility to alter the course of events and happenings in our world today through intercession, sacrifices of praise to the Name of the Lord, and the propagation of His truth in all the earth. Blessed be God!

## GUARD YOUR HEART WITH THE WORD April 16th, 2023

***Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness (***[***2 Peter 3:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203:17&version=kjv)***).***

Notice some cautions and exhortations to the saints, given by the Spirit through the Apostle Peter in the verse we just read. When you study this same verse from the New International Version, it says, *“Therefore, dear friends, since you have been forewarned, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of the lawless and fall from your secure position.”* 

Peter, by the Spirit, calls it the error of the lawless. The Living Bible renders it slightly differently. It says, *“I am warning you ahead of time, dear brothers, so that you can watch out and not be carried away by the mistakes of these wicked men, lest you yourselves become mixed up too.”* Here, it’s called the mistakes of the wicked: their miscalculations because of their ignorance.

Then, the Bible also talks about an evil heart of unbelief which comes from disobedience: *“Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief,in departing from the living God”* ([Hebrews 3:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%203:12&version=kjv)). The Greek word for unbelief is “Apistia” which means disbelief, or arising from disobedience.

Then it says in the 13th verse, *“… exhort one another daily, while it is called Today; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.”* How do we exhort one another daily? It’s with the Word. The Word is the only material to help us grow and be shielded from the error of the lawless and the miscalculations of the wicked.

With the Word, you can diligently guard your heart against unbelief and anything that tries to change or destroy the excellence that God already programmed in you. Study and meditate on the Scriptures until your whole spirit, soul and body are programmed to only think God’s thoughts and influenced only by His ideas and opinions. Hallelujah!

## A DIVINE PARENTAGE April 17th, 2023

***Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world (***[***1 John 4:4***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&version=kjv)***).***

Being born again means you’re God’s offspring; you’re a divine being. You’re not an ordinary person, because you have in you the same life that God has. When Jesus walked the earth, He had this consciousness. In John 6:38, He said: *"For I came down from heaven…."* He affirmed His divine origin.

This is how you must think, talk, and live. Be conscious of your divine origin. You hail from God. Your true parentage is divine. Like the Lord Jesus, speak with confidence and authority in affirming who you are. Recall what the psalmist said in [Psalm 82:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2082:6&version=kjv), *“I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.”*

We're gods because we’re born of God. Just in case you’re thinking the psalmist might have gone too far, read the words of the Master Himself in [John 10:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:34&version=kjv); He reiterated the same words. He said, *“…Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?”* Align yourself with God’s Word, His thoughts and visions of you, and speak accordingly.

Every so often, affirm that you’re an associate of the God\-kind; as Jesus is, so are you: *“Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world”* ([1 John 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&version=kjv)). Let your consciousness of who you are in Christ—the consciousness of your divinity—control everything you say and do. Let it control everything about your life.

***And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self\-sufficient \[possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation] (***[***2 Corinthians 9:8 AMPC***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&version=AMPC)***).***

What we just read is simply mind\-blowing. It unveils God’s will for you; the life that He’s given you: it doesn’t require aid or support. Meaning that it doesn’t matter what you face, the solution is inside you. Being born again, you’ve already been given everything you’d ever need: *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue”* ([2 Peter 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&version=kjv)).

[Colossians 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv) says, *“…Christ in you, the hope of glory.”* It doesn’t get better than that! Christ in you is everything. Jesus said in John 14:16, *“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever.”* The Holy Spirit is in you NOW! With the Holy Spirit in you, you have everything you could ever want in life; you can be anything and can do anything.

No level of greatness or height of success is too lofty for you to attain. You have infinite possibilities, limitless and unparalleled advantages in life. It’s part of the result of the God\-life—the God\-nature in you. God didn’t create you to be in want of anything. Everything is inside you. Eternity is in your heart ([Ecclesiastes 3:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%203:11&version=kjv)).

That’s why He said, *“A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things…”* ([Matthew 12:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:35&version=kjv)). What are the good things you desire? What do you want? What do you want to see? Bring them forth from within you with your faith\-filled words! [John 7:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207:38&version=kjv) says, "Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water"— words of life and power. Hallelujah!

## THE NATIONS ARE HIS FOCUS April 19th, 2023

 >***How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (Acts 10:38).***

***How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (***[***Acts 10:38***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010:38&version=kjv)***).***

Some things happen by God's choice. When they do, there're often no human ways of explaining them. Only through the Scriptures do we discover the reason He does such things. In [2 Chronicles 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%209&version=kjv), for example, the Queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame and came to Jerusalem to see for herself.

When she arrived, she was stunned! She asked every question she could think of and was left amazed at Solomon's wisdom, his responses, and the many things she saw. This prompted her to extol God’s divine love for His people: *“Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice”* ([2 Chronicles 9:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%209:8&version=kjv)).

God made Solomon the king of Israel because He loved Israel. He chose a man that He loved ([2 Samuel 12:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2012:24&version=kjv)), and made him the king of a people He loved. So, Israel was His focus.

It brings to mind something the Lord told me years ago; He said the number one thing He wanted me to do was to take healing to the nations. The nations were His focus—the rendezvous of broken humanity—the sick, the weak, and all those who had become incapacitated due to sickness and disease. He loved them. His focus was on them to bring them healing and health.

And thanks be unto God that He created the platforms and opportunities for us to reach them through the Healing Streams Live Healing Services. Previous editions have seen billions of participants from nations receive healing from chronic ailments in real\-time, through the power of the Holy Spirit.

## ENTHRONED WITH HIM April 20th, 2023

>***For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet (***[***1 Corinthians 15:25***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:25&version=kjv)***).***

Talking about the Lord Jesus, the Apostle Paul in [1 Corinthians 15:24\-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:24-25&version=kjv) tells us, *“Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.”* That means He’s enthroned!

Notice that Paul didn’t say, “For he must reign, after he hath put all enemies under his feet,” no! Rather, he explained that He would reign till all enemies are under His feet. When did He start reigning? He started reigning when He sat down on the seat of the Majesty on high—at the right hand of the Father after His ascension.

Thanks be unto God! We’re seated together with Him, far above all principalities and powers. We’re enthroned with Him. He’s reigning right now through us over demons, hell and the grave. [Romans 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:17&version=kjv) says, *“For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”* 

We’ve received abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness. Now, we’re in office, reigning through Christ over the world and its systems, circumstances, Satan and his demonic community. Refuse sickness, failure, defeat, and death. Reign in life as a king. Reject everything that’s not of God, and endorse only that which is consistent with His perfect will for you. You’ve been enthroned to reign. Hallelujah!

## SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR April 21st, 2023

 >***Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (Ephesians 5:20).***
---
***Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (***[***Ephesians 5:20***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:20&version=kjv)***).***

In your life, you must learn to count your blessings and be genuinely grateful to the Lord for all He’s done in your life. A grateful heart is very important to the Lord. 

Some people hardly appreciate or recognize when they’re making progress or when God is doing something beautiful in their lives. It’s because they’re negatively programmed. They’ll rather wear a worried look, troubled all the time, only seeing their inabilities and what they don’t have.

Take stock of your life from the beginning of the year till now, for example, and you’d discover how much progress you’ve made. I’m sure you’ve learnt some new things; your knowledge and understanding of God’s Word improved. Perhaps you used to always arrive late to work or for meetings; but at the beginning of the year, you decided to work on it. Now, you’re always punctual; these are blessings the Lord has made possible for you that you should be grateful for.

Never think that such blessings are insignificant. Perhaps your prayer life has become richer; you pray better than you used to; that’s a huge blessing. Always consider these and other improvements the Spirit of God has brought into your life; centre your mind on them and be grateful.

Be thrilled by such blessings as the ministry and work of the Holy Spirit in your life! That’s greater than any material blessing or promotion you could ever get. In fact, it’s what will give rise to all other kinds of material blessings and promotions.

Therefore, learn to be content and grateful for all things, serving the Lord joyfully, irrespective and independent of circumstances. Praise God!

## BE THE GIVER AND THE BLESSER April 22nd, 2023

 >***Don't be obsessed with getting your own advantage. Forget yourselves long enough to lend a helping hand (Philippians 2:4 MSG).***

***Don't be obsessed with getting your own advantage. Forget yourselves long enough to lend a helping hand (***[***Philippians 2:4 MSG***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:4&version=MSG)***).***

As a child of God, be known as one who remembers, cares for, and loves people genuinely. That’s what counts with God. Be the giver and the blesser. The Bible says, *“…It is more blessed to give than to receive”* ([Acts 20:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:35&version=kjv)).

The blessing you receive because of those who remember you is little compared to that which you receive when you remember others and give to them. When you receive from others, all you have is what you got. God’s promise isn’t to the one who receives but to the one who gives. So, rather than seek attention, give it instead. Don’t seek love; give love.

Demonstrate love to everyone, including those who might have offended you, and the ungodly that have no hope. That’s how God wants you to live. He said in [Luke 6:27\-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:27-31&version=kjv), *“But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also. Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.”*

There’re people who only want to receive from others and enjoy attention from others; they only crave for others to love them. But read what the Lord said, *“And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.”* You’re the seed of Abraham, and the seed of Abraham reaches out in love; he hears the cry of the needy and responds.

Isn’t that what God said concerning Abraham and His seed? He said in you shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. You’re the answer; you’re the solution. Fulfil your calling as the blesser and the giver; it’s the higher way of life! Hallelujah!

## NEVER TOO LATE OR IMPOSSIBLE April 23rd, 2023

***And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (***[***Romans 12:2***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:2&version=kjv)***).***

It makes no difference where you are in life and the circumstances in which you find yourself today; you can still win; you can be a success. Perhaps you’ve had certain dreams and pursuits that you think are now impossible to achieve, or you think you’re now too old to achieve meaningful success in life; don’t give up. Renew your mind with the Word. Change your thinking.

Moses answered the call of God at the age of eighty. His old age didn’t truncate his destiny. It was the same with Abraham, who received the promise at seventy\-five years of age. With God, nothing is ever too late or impossible. Therefore, don’t despair.

As you grow spiritually, there could be times of difficulties and tough challenges. But those challenges are your opportunities to demonstrate your faith in the Lord and prove His Word. God gave us His Word to live by, and to use in creating our glorious and triumphant lives. So, it’s your responsibility to use the Word; to work the Word. 

[Philippians 2:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:12&version=kjv) says, *“…work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”* That was what Abraham did. God said to him, *"(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were”* ([Romans 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:17&version=kjv)).

At this time, Abraham was nearly a hundred years old and didn’t have a child, but he believed and acted on the Word. [Romans 4:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:20&version=kjv) says He didn’t stagger at the promise of God through unbelief, but he was strong in faith, giving glory to God!

The change you desire in your ministry, finances, health and family is possible and dependent on you. Act on the Word. Insist that nothing but what the Word of God says will prevail in your life, and it shall be so. Be ever joyful, declaring your glorious life, righteousness and victory in Christ Jesus.

## WE’VE RECEIVED THE KINGDOM April 24th, 2023

>***Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom (***[***Luke 12:32***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:32&version=kjv)***).***

Hebrews 12:28 tells us something similar to what we just read in our opening verse. It says, *“Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.”*

The King James almost gives the impression that you’re in the process of receiving the Kingdom, but when you study the verse in the original Greek rendering, that's not what it’s saying; you got the Kingdom already.

The Complete Jewish Bible makes it clearer. It says, *“Therefore, since we have received an unshakeable Kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may offer service that will please God, with reverence and fear.”* We’ve received the Kingdom that we should live in it and express the life of the Kingdom. What is the life of the Kingdom? How can we know the true Christian life that God expects us to live today?

The first thing to do is to study the Book of Acts. The epistles also give us a lot of insight. Finally, the prophetic Word of blessings to the Jews about the millennial reign of Christ shows us an amazing picture of what the life of the Kingdom is. That’s what He’s already given to us to live in and experience NOW! Anything less than these isn’t full Christianity, and isn’t the life of the Kingdom.

This is the reason we’re raising and educating God's people on the Kingdom\-life and the Kingdom\-way of doing things. There’s a Kingdom way to think. Now that you’re in the Kingdom, you must learn to live by the principles of God’s Word. His Word is our blueprint and roadmap on how to live the ever\-glorious, joyous and transcendent life of the Kingdom.

## RUN TO WIN April 25th, 2023

***Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain (***[***1 Corinthians 9:24***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:24&version=kjv)***).***

What we read in our theme verse lets us know that in Christianity, there’s godly competition; we run to win, to obtain the prize. We’re likened to sportsmen: *“And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air”* ([1 Corinthians 9:25\-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:25-26&version=kjv)).

The Bible shows you what to do to be at the top of your game: become temperate in all things; exercise self\-control. Like an athlete, there’re things you should do and there’re things you shouldn’t, just so you can keep in form. Those athletes do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we do ours for an incorruptible crown. Hallelujah.

Notice what He says in the 27th verse: *“But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway”* ([1 Corinthians 9:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:27&version=kjv)). He instructs us to do everything to win, but according to the rules, so you’re not disqualified. Don’t run to miss the prize.

In [Hebrews 12:1\-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:1-2&version=kjv), the Bible says, *“Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith....”*

As you run your race, as you fulfil your ministry in the Gospel, lay aside every weight. Don’t let sin be an encumbrance in your life. Refuse to allow anything to take your focus off the Master. Remain steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord ([1 Corinthians 15:58](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:58&version=kjv)).

***LET US THEREFORE COME BOLDLY UNTO THE THRONE OF GRACE, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need (***[***Hebrews 4:16***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:16&version=kjv)***).***

In the Old Testament, there was a place called the Mercy Seat; it was the place of grace. When the High Priest came into the Most Holy Place where the Ark of God was, he consulted with God from between the cherubim of glory, which sat over the Mercy Seat, where the blood was offered.

But in [Hebrews 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204&version=kjv), writing to the Jewish Christians to help them understand what God had done in the New Testament, Paul said, *“…we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God…”* ([Hebrews 4:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:14&version=kjv)). Jesus is our High Priest. While all the other priests ministered in the first sanctuary, the High Priest alone went into the inner sanctuary.

But [Hebrews 4:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:16&version=kjv) says, *“Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”* That Mercy Seat in the Old Testament is now called the throne of grace, meaning that grace has now been enthroned! Hallelujah! [Romans 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:2&version=kjv) says we have access by faith into this grace.

The word translated “throne” is the Greek, “thronos” and it means seat. Our underlined portion in our theme verse can read as “Let us come boldly unto the seat of grace!” We don’t need an intermediary anymore. We now have access in Christ Jesus into this “throne of grace,” to obtain mercy and find grace to help in times of need.

The throne of grace is the place where grace reigns like a king! In that place or seat of grace, you don’t ask God for anything; you “obtain” what you want. The word translated “obtain” is the Greek, “lambano”, which means you come in there to collect or obtain grace!

Do you require grace for anything in your life today? Collect the grace you want; you’re already in the throne room where grace reigns; so boldly obtain the grace you need for that assignment, and for your next and higher level of glory in your walk with God.

## NO SICKNESS IN OUR KINGDOM April 27th, 2023
![April 27th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/apr-23-day-27-no-sickness-in-our-kingdom-new-min.jpg)

 >***And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity (Isaiah 33:24).***

***And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity (***[***Isaiah 33:24***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2033:24&version=kjv)***).***

There’re those who aver stoutly that sickness is for everybody, but it’s not true. God doesn’t get any glory out of us being sick. We belong in His Kingdom, and the Scripture shows us that divine health is one of our Kingdom rights; it’s one of the blessings we have in Christ.

Read again the inspiring description of Zion by Isaiah in our theme verse! He calls it a beautiful place where the inhabitants have no reason to say, “I am sick,” because there’s no sickness in Zion! Hallelujah! Being born again, you’re an inhabitant of this glorious land of health and abundance.

In [Colossians 1:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:13&version=kjv), it’s called the Kingdom of God’s dear Son. You’ve been translated into that Kingdom, and all the blessings of the Kingdom are yours. So, become Kingdom conscious; live in the blessings of the Kingdom of God, in health and in strength.

If sickness tries to attack your body, remember that you’re in the Kingdom of God where His will is operational and in force. Take charge and rule over your body with the Word of God. Refuse to yield your body to sickness, disease or infirmity!

God gave you a life that’s superior to sickness, so you can serve Him and live for Him; so you can manifest His glory and His grace, and impact your world with the message of Christ’s salvation.

## A KINGDOM OF LIGHT April 28th, 2023

 >***Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12-13).***

***Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (***[***Colossians 1:12\-13***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:12-13&version=kjv)***).***

Being born again, you’ve been translated from the domain of darkness into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son. But it’s important for you to understand the process. It wasn’t after you became a Christian that you were transferred from the place of darkness into the place of light. No! You were born from death: from darkness into light.

Remember, Jesus is called the first begotten of the dead ([Revelation 1:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201:5&version=kjv)), because He died spiritually when our sins were laid on Him. He was cut off from God. Spiritual death isn’t just the cessation of life; it’s total separation from God ([Ephesians 2:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:12&version=kjv)).

Before you were a Christian, you were dead spiritually. You had to be born again! And when you were born again, you were born right into the Kingdom. You were born from the domain of darkness, into the Kingdom of God. So, your day one as a Christian was in the Kingdom of light—the Kingdom of God's dear Son.

This is why you never have to pray that God would “deliver” you from darkness; you don’t need deliverance from Satan, because you’re not in his jurisdiction. You’re not in the darkness; you’re in the light. What you need is to know the truth, for the Bible says, *“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free”* ([John 8:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:32&version=kjv)).

For the one who seems to be experiencing anything of darkness despite being born again, the solution is simple: Receive God’s Word—His light—into you and walk accordingly; it’ll eject every satanic presence. You dwell in the Kingdom, seated with Christ, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named ([Ephesians 1:19\-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:19-21&version=kjv); [Ephesians 2:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:6&version=kjv)). Blessed be God!

## LIVE IN THE WILL OF THE FATHER April 29th, 2023

>***Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven (***[***Matthew 6:10***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:10&version=kjv)***).***

The verse above is part of the prayer format that the Master taught His disciples. He said, *“Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth…”,* because when the Kingdom comes, God’s will is done. When Jesus came, He was the manifestation of the will of the Father; He was the will of God in human flesh. Hallelujah!

Jesus was the embodiment of God’s will; He was at the right place at the right time for the right purpose, in the right way. Even when they wanted to arrest Him on a certain occasion, and He sneaked out from there ([John 10:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:39&version=kjv)), He was still in the will of God.

God's will is manifested in His Kingdom, and the Kingdom executes His will. This means that the will of God is expected to be wrought in your life one hundred per cent, as it was with Jesus.

Living in the will of the Father is very simple. All you have to do is to live according to the Word and walk by the Spirit. The Bible says, *“...Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh”* ([Galatians 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:16&version=kjv)). How could there be confusion in your life when you’re living in the will of the Father? Never!

The Bible says, *“The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know…”* ([Ephesians 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:18&version=kjv)). If the eyes of your understanding are enlightened—if your heart is flooded with light, with an abundance of the Word of God in your spirit—you become acquainted with the will of God, and the result is a life of unending victory!

## HIS LOVE IS PERFECT AND ETERNAL April 30th, 2023
![April 30th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/apr-23-day-30-his-love-is-perfect-and-eternal-new-min.jpg)

 >***Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not (1 John 3:1).***

***Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not (***[***1 John 3:1***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:1&version=kjv)***).***

[Romans 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:8&version=kjv) tells us something remarkable. It says, *“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”* Think about that! It’s the reason when Christians miss it and walk away from Him, to go the way of the world, the Holy Spirit never leaves them. He goes after them to win them back. Why doesn’t He ever give up on us?

It’s because He loves each one of us personally. He genuinely loves you. When He made you, He made you in His image. He sees Himself in you. Even when you're badly behaved, He looks at your potentials. He knows that if you’d listen to Him, you’d make amends and do the right thing. So, in [Hebrews 13:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:5&version=kjv), He says, *“…I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”* How gracious He is!

The word “bestowed” in our theme verse also means “lavished”; the Father has lavished His love on you. It’s love without limits. When I found out that God loved me personally, it changed everything for me. I became bold and confident in His love for me. Hallelujah!

Maybe you’re a preacher, and some members of your congregation probably don’t like you. Perhaps, it’s even your children, your spouse or some family members; they don’t seem to be very proud of you. Or you have a neighbour or those at the office who despise you; don’t be bothered. God loves you and He’s always very proud of you. That’s what really counts.

He cares so much for you. You’re special and valuable to Him. His love for you is perfect and eternal; nothing can change it and nothing can taint it: *“…Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee”* ([Jeremiah 31:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2031:3&version=kjv)). Hallelujah!
