## LUMINOSITY BY THE WORD August 1st, 2023

>***The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple (***[***Psalm 119:130***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119:130&version=kjv)***).***

I’ll like you to observe what the entrance of God’s words brings: "light." The Hebrew word translated “light” in the opening verse is “'or”; and it means to make luminous or lambent; to shine, to be glorious, to kindle or to set on fire. It also alludes to coming from the dark nights and breaking into a new day.

Therefore, what this verse is saying is that the entrance of God's Word into your heart will make you luminous or shine; your life will be like the dawning of the morning and glorious. Hallelujah!

Observe that I didn’t say the entrance of the Word will illuminate you, but that it’ll make you luminous. Even though these two words are often used in related contexts, they have distinct meanings and connotations. To illuminate something means to shine light on it and to make it brighter and more visible. That’s different from being luminous which means emitting light to be radiant or shiny, glowing or effulgent.

When something is described as luminous, it means it has the quality of producing or reflecting light. The entrance of the Word makes you glow; you become a burning and a shining light—you produce from within you such brightness, radiance and brilliance of the Spirit!

It brings to mind the Lord’s testimony of John the Baptist whom He described in [John 5:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:35&version=kjv) as a burning and a shining light: *“He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.”* Let the Word get into you; feed on the Word; it’ll shine through you.

Dear Father, your Word is the true light that lights my heart. Through diligent study and constant meditation on the Word, my heart is flooded with light and I shine forth with such intensity, glowing ever so brightly, radiating your goodness and exhibiting your kindness and graciousness to my world, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## DISCRETION AND SOUND JUDGMENT August 2nd, 2023
![August 2nd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-2-aug23-discretion-and-sound-judgment-min.jpg)

>***The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple (***[***Psalm 119:130***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119:130&version=kjv)***).***

The word translated “simple” above is the Hebrew, “pethiy”; it means to be foolish or silly. It also connotes being open\-minded or seducible. It aptly describes someone who's open to any new thinking about anything.

The open\-minded or seducible person could hear, “There are three gods,” and agrees. Then, he listens to a podcast where the speaker says, “There’re actually five gods,” and he also agrees to that. Soon, someone else comes up with another theory that says there’s no God; and he nevertheless agrees. No! That’s being a simpleton.

Such folks need the entrance of God’s Word to give them understanding. It’s guaranteed: God’s Word will eject foolishness and impart wisdom to you. [2 Timothy 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:15&version=kjv) tells us that the Holy Scriptures are able to make you wise. Hallelujah!

When people aren’t behaving or acting right, refer them to the Word. When the Word gets into them, there’ll be a transformation. If they were timid, they’d become bold, sagacious, discerning, discrete, perceptive and prudent. The Word will cause them to deal wisely in the affairs of life ([Joshua 1:8 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:8&version=AMPC)).

[Colossians 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:16&version=kjv) says, *“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom….”* The more of the Word you have inside you, the wiser you become, such that even your choice of words in dealing with others will be gracious, excellent and loving.

## THE WORD HAS POWER August 3rd, 2023

>***He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions (***[***Psalm 107:20***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20107:20&version=kjv)***).***

The scripture above brings to mind an amazing testimony of a young lad who had a ghastly accident, resulting in a gruesome leg injury. The doctors said he’d never walk again, and if he did, it would take some years for that to happen.

This young lad took Rhapsody of Realities and began to meditate on the Word. He studied it voraciously and took the confessions seriously, reflecting on the healing power of God's Word over his leg. Soon enough, he began to see changes. Eventually, his leg was completely restored and he was able to walk again. Praise God!

Always remember that we were made or created by the Word. We’re products or offsprings of the Word. Before God formed man from the dust of the ground, He already created Him with His Word. He only formed from the dust, the man He had created in the spirit with His Word. That Word is where life comes from; that Word brought creation into being!

Therefore, when you want to change anything, use the Word! Proclaim the Word. The Word of God is a force; it’s a “thing.” In fact, one of the translations of the Word, “Rhema,” is “THING”; the Word is a thing; it’s a spiritual substance. That’s why, when you proclaim it, it goes out into the spirit realm and has the capacity to produce exactly what it talks about.

So, when you're talking the Word, don't think you're just making statements; no! The Word has energy: potent and creative power. As you affirm the Word, the message that it carries is the power that it transports. Glory to God!

## MADE WHOLE AND DELIVERED FROM PITFALLS August 4th, 2023
![August 4th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-4-aug23made-whole-and-delivered-from-pitfalls-min.jpg)

>***He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions (***[***Psalm 107:20***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20107:20&version=KJV)***).***

The Hebrew word translated healed is “raphah”; it means to mend, to cure, to heal, repair, or thoroughly make whole. This is what the Word does in your life; it rids you of all kinds of sicknesses, diseases, and infirmities; it has curative ability.

You can use the Word to keep your body in divine health. [Proverbs 4:20\-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:20-22&version=KJV) says, *“My son, attend to my words…they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.”* So the Word produces health in your physical body.

“Raphah” also means physician. It brings to mind God’s promise of healing and blessings as the Israelites journeyed in the wilderness after their deliverance from Egypt: *“...if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: **for I am the LORD that healeth thee**”* ([Exodus 15:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2015:26&version=KJV)). 

The word “healeth” is the same word, “raphah”; thus, the underlined portion can also be translated, “I am the Lord, your physician”; that’s where you get the name, “Jehovah Raphah,” which means “Lord, your physician.” So, He was their physician.

Secondly, the word translated “destructions” in the same opening verse is the Hebrew, “shechiyth”; it means pitfalls. Pitfalls are sudden, unforeseen troubles. So, a pitfall could be a sudden loss of money or even the loss of a job, life savings, assets, properties etc., as a result of a particular course of action or policies.

But thanks be unto God! He’s able to deliver from pitfalls, from sudden unforeseen difficulty, calamity or quagmire. Blessed be His Name forever.

## THE BIBLE: AN EPIC OF THE SPIRIT August 5th, 2023
![August 5th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-5-aug23-the-bible-an-epic-of-the-spirit-min.jpg)

 >***All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works (2 Timothy 3:16-17).***

***All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works (***[***2 Timothy 3:16\-17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:16-17&version=kjv)***).***

When you study the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, you’ll come to the realization that indeed, the whole Bible is an epic of the Spirit. Moses, by the Spirit, wrote, *“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth…And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters”* ([Genesis 1:1\-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:1-2&version=kjv)). This extraordinary person of the Godhead—the Holy Spirit—is introduced to us in the very beginning.

In the book of Proverbs, we read about His intent which was to dwell in us and have fellowship with us. The writer, by the Spirit, pens that the Spirit’s desire wasn’t to live in heaven without us, but to be with us, and in us ([Proverbs 8:30\-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208:30-31&version=kjv)).

In the four gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John— the Lord Jesus gives us an even greater light to tell us who the Holy Spirit is, and in [Matthew 12:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:32&version=kjv), He warns against offending the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the one who brings the presence of God to us and communicates the love of God to us. You can't read the Bible and miss who the Holy Spirit is. Over in the Epistles, Paul also highlights, *“And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption”* ([Ephesians 4:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:30&version=kjv)).

Those who haven’t received the Holy Spirit often find the epistles confusing. If only they knew that the epistles are an effusion of an extravagant discourse of the Christ; they’re a compendium of extraordinary truths for today. In other words, they have a message of the now, not by way of the timelessness of the message, but by way of the timelessness of the man of whom He speaks.

And the only way to have a full grasp of this discourse is by the Spirit. How important it is to recognize and be fully yielded to the ministry of the Spirit!

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Holy Spirit, I acknowledge your ministry and presence in my life, as you guide me to know and walk in the realities of the Kingdom of God. I thank you for your presence in me, for you’re the captain of my life. I follow as you lead me to fulfil my destiny in Christ. Through your ministry, dear Holy Spirit, I’m demonstrating the glory, wisdom and excellence of divinity, bearing fruits of righteousness, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## PURIFIED BY THE WORD August 6th, 2023

***And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God (***[***1 Corinthians 6:11***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:11&version=kjv)***).***

The Apostle Paul, in the 11th verse of 1 Corinthians 6 makes a striking statement to establish the present state of the Corinthian Christians, emphasizing that they were washed, sanctified and justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God. How profound!

Observe the Spirit’s communication through Paul; He didn’t say, “Such are some of you”; rather, He said, *“…and such were some of you,”* referring to the unrighteous characters listed in verses 9 and 10\. But how were they washed by the Spirit? Through the Word!

In [John 15:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:3&version=kjv), the Lord Jesus addressing His disciples said, *“Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.”* He purified them by His Word. As He spoke His words of sanctification and righteousness to them while they listened, they were purified. Blessed be God! The same thing happens today as we share the Word of God; as the people listen, their hearts are purified from all unrighteousness.

Many have testified that as they listened to us share the Word of God or as they meditated on the scriptures, suddenly, they seemed to have been transported in the spirit. They felt enraptured in God's bliss and love. The Word got rid of everything unwholesome, unpleasant or unclean. How wonderful! We’re made pure by the Word. Hallelujah!

## INVOKE HIS AUTHORITY August 7th, 2023

***Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth (***[***Philippians 2:9\-10***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:9-10&version=kjv)***).***

In the 3rd chapter of the book of Acts, we read that Peter healed a certain man who was crippled from birth. Afterwards, he made an emphathic and unambigous statement. He said, *“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved”* ([Acts 4:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204:12&version=kjv)). Peter was referring to the Name, Jesus!

All authority in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth is vested in that Name. So, when you affirm your healing and health or anything in the Name of Jesus, you’re invoking His authority.

The one who’s crippled is able to walk again, in the Name of Jesus. Even maimed limbs are restored in His Name. In [Mark 16:17\-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17-18&version=kjv), Jesus said, *“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils… they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”* When you call the Name Jesus, demons scamper in terror; all of nature responds.

Therefore, be confident to use the Name of Jesus, and live every day in, and by, the power of His Name; it’s your heritage. The Name was given to you to use, and to live by. Even now, receive strength into you in the Name of Jesus! If you’ve been sick or afflicted, be made whole; be healed in Jesus’ Name! Right away, rejoice and thank Him for healing you, and act accordingly. Hallelujah!

## CHRIST—OUR RIGHT-STANDING BEFORE THE FATHER August 8th, 2023

I’ve often said that the biggest subject in all of God’s Word is righteousness. Righteousness is the nature of God that defines His character and ways of doing things. It is the rightness of God; His attribute of always being right. 

This nature and attribute of God when imparted to the human spirit at the new birth gives him right\-standing. Right\-standing refers to the right or ability to stand in the presence of God without guilt, fear, inferiority, or condemnation. Now, you can talk to the Lord in fellowship and even ask Him questions; you’re bold in His presence. 

This is part of the result of who we are, and what we have in Christ. We read in our opening scripture that Christ has become our righteousness—our right\-standing before God. Hallelujah! What a blessing! As great and glorious and mighty as God is, you’re not afraid of Him, nor are you guilty or inferior in His presence. Rather, before Him, you’re holy, unblameable and unreproveable ([Colossians 1:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:22&version=kjv)). Glory to His Name forever!

## “RIGHTWISENESS” AND THE JUDGMENTS OF GOD August 9th, 2023

 >***But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption (1 Corinthians 1:30).***

***But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption (***[***1 Corinthians 1:30***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:30&version=kjv)***).***

In our previous study, we referenced “Right Standing” as one of the attributes of righteousness. Today, we’ll be considering another attribute of righteousness called “Rightwiseness.” Rightwiseness is not a term that’s often used in everyday communication, but it’s an important element of righteousness.

“Rightwise” means to be rightward; or towards the right. This, however, is not talking about the physical position of being towards the “right\-hand side.” It refers, instead, to rightness—the ability to always be and do right in the presence of a holy God.

Remember, righteousness is God’s nature: His character, ability and attribute of being right and perfect. How He thinks, what He says, and what He does is always right, because He’s God and He could never be wrong. This quality of the rightness of God is captured in the old English term, “rightwiseness.”

God alone knows what’s right; when He imparts His righteousness to your spirit, you also begin to know what’s right just like Him, and you’re given the ability to do it. The judgments of God, from thence, are wrought in your spirit. What do I mean by the judgments of God?

This has to do with how God perceives and judges things; how He sees things and what He thinks about them. Now, because of His nature in you, you now carry the judgments of God in your spirit. You have His opinions and know His will.

The prophet Isaiah, speaking about the Christ, said, *“…he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth...”* ([Isaiah 11:3\-4\)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2011:3-4&version=kjv).

This means He would not judge according to His senses but by the Spirit. It’s the same with you now that Christ has been made unto you righteousness! His “rightwiseness” and His judgments are in your spirit. You judge by the Spirit. Hallelujah!



---  
<details>
  <summary>Confession</summary>
  
I’m the unveiling of the Father’s righteousness; His “rightwiseness” and sound judgments are heard in me, seen in me, and dispensed through me. I judge by the Spirit in righteousness, and reprove with equity because I’m the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. Amen.

## ETERNAL LIFE IN YOU August 10th, 2023
![August 10th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-10-aug23eternal-life-in-you-min.jpg)

 >***For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life (John 3:16 NIV).***

***For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life (***[***John 3:16 NIV***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:16&version=NIV)***).***

The opening verse is a profound statement from Jesus. It says whoever believes in Him, shall not perish but have eternal life; that’s you. It also brings to mind the words of Scripture in [Colossians 1:26\-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:26-27&version=kjv): *“Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”*

Christ in you means eternal life within! This subject in scripture calls for deep meditation. First, let’s consider the definition of eternal life. What exactly is it? Eternal life refers to the life and nature of God: that is, the God\-life. Just as there is plant life and animal life, the animal life can further be categorized into human life and various other forms of biological life.

However, there’s a distinct kind of life—the God\-life. God is the author of life, and everything we consider as “life” emanates from Him. He is life personified. Thus, His very life, His nature, was birthed within us when we were born again. Does this mean we possess two lives?” No!

When you were born again, a new life was introduced into your spirit, and the human life with which you were born of your earthly parents was supplanted by the life and nature of God. The Bible says, *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new”* ([2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=kjv)).

This simply implies that we’re divine beings, divine creatures, and our divine nature makes us masters over circumstances, with dominion over Satan and the world’s deplorable systems. No wonder the Apostle Peter calls us associates of a heavenly pantheon—comrades of the God\-kind ([2 Peter 1:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:4&version=kjv)). Hallelujah!

My divine nature has made me a master over circumstances, with dominion over the world’s deplorable systems. My old life has been completely supplanted by the divine life, which is superior to sickness, disease, defeat and all depravities that affect the natural man.

## HIS NAME CHANGES EVERYTHING August 11th, 2023
![August 11th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-11-aug23-his-name-changes-everything-b-min.jpg)

 >***And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (Mark 16:17-18).***

***And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (***[***Mark 16:17\-18***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17-18&version=kjv)***).***

God vested all authority in the Name of Jesus ([Philippians 2:9\-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:9-10&version=kjv)). His Name has the greatest honour, and the greatest authority. It doesn’t matter what might have plagued you; it doesn’t matter for how long you’ve been under, or on the sidewalk of life, your victory is guaranteed in His Name.

What you have to do is live your life with the consciousness of the power, glory and dominion of the Name of Jesus. When you do this, you won’t struggle with some health troubles; your life will be an unending stream of victories, blessings and the supernatural. You’ll have no consciousness of need, because the power and glory of His Name make all things right with you and work for you.

If you’d learn to use the Name of Jesus in your life, in everything you do, you’d be amazed at the extraordinary blessings you’d experience every day. His Name is an instrument, a great blessing for us in the New Testament. The Word tells us to use the Name of Jesus in all things ([Colossians 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:17&version=kjv)).

What many have lacked is the consciousness of the power and authority of His Name. When you make demands in His Name, He sees to it that they happen ([John 14:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:14&version=kjv)). When someone is sick in your home, for example, take charge and declare, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke the pain; I rebuke the affliction!” Mention the sickness and command it to go!

He told us to heal the sick; so, it’s our responsibility to do it in His Name; and His Name never fails! Even now, rebuke the infirmity. Use the Name of Jesus to bless your home, bless your family, effect the changes you desire and create blessings for yourself and others.

## THE THRUST OF CHRISTIANITY August 12th, 2023
![August 12th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-12-aug23-the-thrust-of-christianity-min.jpg)

 >***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27).***

***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (***[***Colossians 1:27***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv)***).***

The ultimate message and vision of Christianity is “Christ in you!” Yet, not all Christians have fully grasped this reality; some are unaware of what Christianity truly entails because they lack a comprehensive understanding of it.

Without being taught the Word of God and enlightened by the Scriptures through the Spirit, one cannot fully comprehend the essence of Christianity. Many perceive it merely as one of the world's religions, but they’re sorely mistaken.

Christianity stands far apart from the conventional definitions of religion. In truth, the Bible elucidates that Christianity incorporates certain aspects of religion, but itself isn’t a religion. It's like prayer for example; there's prayer in Christianity, but Christianity is not “a prayer.”

Let’s also consider salvation: salvation occurs when one is born into Christ. The Bible says in [2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=kjv), *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature....”* When we witness and share the Gospel with those who have not yet known the Lord and lead them to salvation, they come into Christ, receiving eternal life. But Christianity goes further to living the life initiated by salvation.

Thus, salvation brings you into Christ, which is “you in Christ,” but the Christian life is “Christ in you.” This is the thrust of Christianity. When you truly discover Christ dwelling within you, you live a glorious life, fulfilling God's purpose. The moment you uncover the presence of Christ within you, your life becomes a melody, a symphony of joy. This is not a mere ideology but a tangible reality.

The true essence of Christianity lies in understanding that it is not merely a religion but a divine relationship with the Father by Christ Jesus. This is one of the reasons you must take your study of "Rhapsody of Realities" seriously; in it, you can receive the enlightenment needed to grasp this profound reality that Christ now dwells within you, in the very quarters of your heart.

Dear Father, I thank you for the revelation of this glorious reality and profound truth that Christ dwells in me. I’m ever conscious of this reality, permeating and penetrating my world with the same truth, and ushering many into the same life of joy and unending victory, in Jesus' Name. Amen.

## AFFIRM THE WORD WITH CONFIDENCE August 13th, 2023

 >***For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7).***

***For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind (***[***2 Timothy 1:7***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201:7&version=kjv)***).***

In our opening verse, it’s clear what God hasn’t given to us, and what He has given us: He’s not given us the spirit of fear, cowardice or timidity. Rather, He’s given us the spirit of power, love, and a sound mind. Every so often, declare this as the reality of your life.

Never express difficulties in comprehending or retaining anything. Never confess dullness of the mind; rather, affirm that you possess an extraordinary amplitude of comprehension and exceptional intellect, marked by wit and intelligence. You have an expansive understanding and brilliance of mind through the Holy Spirit. Say this often of yourself.

Also, don’t build vocabulary around forgetfulness. Don’t say, “O, I just forgot; what a forgetful me!” No! You have a sound mind; a mind that retains and recalls information effectively. You have a sharp memory and a firm capacity to remember important details, experiences and knowledge. Your mental acuity and your cognitive abilities are top\-notch. That’s what the Word says about you.

Furthermore, don’t express fear. Some think it’s fashionable to talk fear, but the Christian isn’t built to fear. We’re creatures of faith. Eschew the language of fear and talk faith always. Talk boldly. You’re born of God, therefore, fear has no place in your life. Proclaim the Word of faith with conviction and confidence.

## PASSIONATE ABOUT HIS MANDATE August 14th, 2023

 >***For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek (Romans 1:16).***

***For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek (***[***Romans 1:16***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201:16&version=kjv)***).***

As a teenager, I was compelled to share the message of Jesus Christ and His saving power with everyone. I would pray with a resolute heart, wailing and travailing in prayer for the sick, the afflicted, and crying out for the salvation of the lost. In my prayer times, I often thought, “How can we reach them? What more can we do?” 

This burning desire led me to hit the streets, going from house to house, and from door to door, preaching the Gospel. Some people got furious and warned me never to return. But I was undeterred. I visited hospitals and schools, preaching wherever I could—in buses, taxis, and any place where people gathered.

All I wanted to do was to tell the untold about Jesus Christ and reach the unreached. Yet, it never felt enough. I sought to motivate my friends to join me in this endeavour. I would talk to them about going out to preach, and we did. Still, it felt insufficient. We organised crusades from place to place. But even then, it didn't seem enough.

The more I preached, the more I realized the immense need to reach the unreached and snatch many out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God’s Love\-Son. The Bible says, *“…This Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come”* ([Matthew 24:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:14&version=kjv)).

Those are the words of Jesus; they were personal to me. They must be personal to you. They must be your motivation to do more for the Gospel. Be passionate about spreading the message of the Gospel, not just in your catchment but also to the regions beyond. Take the Lord’s mandate seriously: He said, *“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature”* ([Mark 16:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:15&version=kjv)).

## LIVE AS ONE WHO HAS ETERNAL LIFE August 15th, 2023

>***I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life (1 John 5:13 NIV).***

The Apostle John’s emphasis in our opening verse above is for God’s people to “know” that they have eternal life. The word “know” is translated from the Greek word "eido" and it refers to having knowledge or awareness of something.

It signifies the understanding and certainty of the fact that you possess eternal life. Sadly, not many Christians know they have eternal life. So, they pray for it, some fast for it, and others hope to receive it. Some others even think they can only enjoy this God\-life in heaven, no!

Eternal life isn’t a mere promise or a future expectation. When you were born again, eternal life was imparted to your human spirit, and at once, you were awakened to the Fatherhood of God. Eternal life is the God\-life; it’s the transcendent life. It’s indomitable and uninfectable.

If someone had a tumour growing in his or her body, upon receiving eternal life, that tumour should die and dematerialize. Thank God for the teaching of His Word and the increased knowledge in the Body of Christ! Many are becoming more aware of the essence, import, and impact of this divine life in us.

When troubles strike, deal with them from the perspective of your knowledge of who you are and what you have in Christ. You live in the realm of incorruptibility, immortality, everlasting joy, peace, and glory; reigning and ruling over Satan, his demons and the elements of this world. Hallelujah!

Have that consciousness every day of your life. Live and think as someone who has eternal life. It doesn't matter the troubles you face in this world, the solution is within you. Blessed be God!

The verse above was written to Christians; so, it’s talking about you; there’s a treasure in you. You carry the divine essence; you’re not ordinary. Acknowledge this about you all the time. That’s how to get it effectual in your life. The Bible says, *“…the communication of thy faith may become effectual **by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus**”* ([Philemon 1:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philemon%201:6&version=kjv)).

Acknowledge that you’re a bearer or carrier of the divine life: a carrier of God’s divine presence, and as a result, the excellence of His power permeates through you, causing everything you do to prosper. Glory to God!

The Bible says the mystery of Christianity and the glory thereof is Christ in you ([Colossians 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv)). Your life isn’t empty; there’s a treasure in you: a treasure of power, dominion and glory. Your body may be an earthen vessel, but the glory of God is in your spirit, and that glory inundates and perfects your physical body.

Even now, affirm that through you, the light of God, His glory, power and grace are revealed to your world. Make such proclamations often, because the effectiveness of the Word in your life depends on your response to the Word of God. You’re a God\-carrying vessel: a package of divine blessings and treasures. Hallelujah!

## HE GAVE US LIFE AND MADE US LIFE-GIVERS August 17th, 2023

***The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows) (***[***John 10:10 AMPC***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&version=AMPC)***).***

When we say that as Christians, we aren’t mere humans, some might view it as heresy or call it the 'little god' syndrome. Those who question the validity of our oneness with the Lord—our sublime identity with Him—lack the understanding of why Jesus came; His true purpose for coming to this world. Read our opening verse again.

Jesus didn’t come to merely save us from sin; that was a means to an end. So, what did He come to do? He came to give us life and to bring us into fellowship with God. [John 5:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:26&version=kjv) says, *“For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.”*

Think about that: just as the Father has the fullness of life, so also, Jesus Christ has the fullness of life; He's not drawing life from the Father. Remember what Paul said in [1 Corinthians 15:45 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:45&version=NIV): *“So it is written: "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam, a life\-giving spirit.”* Jesus, the life\-giving spirit, imparts the same life to us.

Therefore, just like Jesus, you’re a life\-giving spirit. He gave us life and made us life\-givers. Isn't that amazing? When you show up, life is manifested, not in bits, but in its fullness.

No wonder Jesus charged us in [Matthew 10:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010:8&version=kjv), *“Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils….”* When you touch the sick and the afflicted, the life in you is transferred and transmitted into them, bringing them healing, wholeness and perfection.

The Bible says, *"For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones"* ([Ephesians 5:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:30&version=kjv)). Have you ever contemplated the significance of this statement? It means we are the very limbs of His body. In another of his letters to the Corinthian Church, Paul said, *“What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you…”* ([1 Corinthians 6:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:19&version=kjv)).

In [1 Corinthians 12:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012:27&version=kjv), the Bible says, *“Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”* In other words, you’re the carrier of His divine essence. Eternal life is unveiled to others through you. Grasp the magnitude of this truth and walk in its reality.

 >***Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you (Luke 17:21).***

***Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you (***[***Luke 17:21***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017:21&version=kjv)***).***

Now that you’re born again, the Kingdom of God is at work and operational in you and through you. You’re a Kingdom vent for righteousness, the outworking of God’s righteousness.

When Jesus came, He offered the Kingdom to Israel, but they didn't believe Him; they rejected His message. He then extended the offer to the Gentiles—to all nations. Today, anyone who believes in Jesus Christ has received the Kingdom—a magnificent kingdom!

In [Isaiah 35:5\-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2035:5-6&version=kjv), the prophet Isaiah declared, “*Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert."* This is a manifestation of the Kingdom.

It was the understanding of this that made me go preaching in the backside of civilization where there was darkness, pain, and poverty. In those crusades, I’d command blind eyes to open, deaf ears to be unstopped, the mute to speak, and the lame to walk, and they did.

Knowing that the concluding part of the 6th verse referred to the end of poverty and lack, I’d declare to the crowds that irrespective of their circumstances, they possessed a supernatural life now that Christ was alive in them. They believed and were transformed by the Truth. The evidence of the Kingdom was undeniable!

Christ in you brings forth righteousness and the outworking of His Kingdom. It is a transformational reality that manifests in the ability to live righteously and experience the abundant life of God's Kingdom. Hallelujah!

## CALLED TO EXCELLENCE August 19th, 2023
![August 19th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-19-aug23-called-to-excellence-min.jpg)

 >***According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (2 Peter 1:3).***

***According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (***[***2 Peter 1:3***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&version=kjv)***).***

Notice what the Apostle Peter said in the latter part of the scripture above; he said God has called us to glory and virtue. We have a calling to a life of glory and virtue, that is, a life of excellence. Poverty and sickness have no place in this calling. Hallelujah!

It’s important to know that your life of excellence isn’t a future plan or a promise to be fulfilled when we get to heaven; no! It's a present reality, for here and now! The Amplified Classic helps us to get a fuller grasp. It says, *"For His divine power has bestowed upon us all things that \[are requisite and suited] to life and godliness, through the \[full, personal] knowledge of Him Who called us by and to His own glory and excellence (virtue)."*

There’s no room for mediocrity or mundanity in our lives. We are excellent in every way because we have been called to it. There’s more. In [1 Peter 2:9 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&version=AMPC), the Bible says, *“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, \[God's] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”* 

You’re God's own purchased, special individual, bought by the blood of Jesus to set forth the wonderful deeds and showcase the virtues and perfections of the One who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light. Blessed be God. Never think less of yourself. Never underestimate your worth.

Every day you’re in this world, wherever you go, understand and be conscious that you’re born for excellence. It’s your destiny to be excellent. You have an excellent path of life. Therefore, do and manifest excellent things.

## HIS FULLNESS IN US August 20th, 2023
![August 20th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-20-aug23-his-fullness-in-us-min.jpg)

 >***For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him (John 3:34).***

***For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him (***[***John 3:34***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:34&version=kjv)***).***

“Christ in you" signifies that God resides in you in His fullness, not in parts, nor in a measure. This is an immensely significant truth, one that cannot be overstated. Just as the Holy Spirit dwelt in Christ, He now dwells in you. Have you really taken the time to contemplate this truth?

[Colossians 1:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:19&version=kjv), referring to the Lord Jesus, says that in Him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell. We can readily accept that the fullness of God dwells in Jesus. But the same is true of us in Christ Jesus. Just as we read that it pleased the Father to have all the fullness of God dwell in Jesus, [Colossians 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:10&version=kjv) says*, “And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.”*

Now, you can better understand why Paul would pray in [Ephesians 3:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:19&version=kjv) *“…that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God."* He wanted them to experience this ministry of the Holy Spirit and come to the realization of this truth about the indwelling fullness of God. [Ephesians 1:22\-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22-23&version=kjv) says we, the Church, are His body; we’re the fullness of Him that fills all in all. Hallelujah!

[John 1:16 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:16&version=AMPC) says, *“For out of His fullness (abundance) we have all received….”* This is God's purpose for us—to be filled with His fullness. So, not only is this a possibility, it’s our reality in Christ. He lives within every fibre of your being; in your spirit, soul and body. Understanding this message is transformative. It is what will change the world, but we must act upon it.

## BEING BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST August 21st, 2023
![August 21st, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-21-aug23-being-baptized-into-christ-min.jpg)

 >***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27).***
---
***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (***[***Colossians 1:27***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv)***).***

The first thing that happens when you come to Christ or receive eternal life is that you are baptized or immersed into Christ. Paul captures it vividly in [2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=kjv), when he said, *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”*

Therefore, to be in Christ or be born into Christ is to be recreated; you're now a new person in Christ. This first experience is when the Holy Spirit receives you into Him, just as the Bible says in [1 Corinthians 12:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012:13&version=kjv), *“For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free….”* This is the new birth—being born again.

The second part of the verse refers to the second experience *“…and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.”* This is receiving the Holy Spirit to dwell in you to become one with Him in the same body ([1 Corinthians 6:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:17&version=kjv), [John 7:37\-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207:37-39&version=kjv)).

Receiving Him is a separate experience that follows the first experience. On the day of Pentecost, for example, the disciples were born again and also received the Holy Spirit to dwell in them on that same occasion.

The same experience happens to many people today; immediately they’re born again, they receive the Holy Spirit. But this isn’t always the case. In [Acts 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019&version=kjv), for example, the Apostle Paul encountered some disciples in Ephesus and asked them if they had received the Holy Spirit since they believed.

They replied that they hadn’t even heard that there was a Holy Spirit. So, for some individuals, there might be a period of waiting, maybe due to a lack of knowledge about the Holy Spirit and His ministry in the saints, like these disciples Paul encountered in Ephesus.

The Apostle Paul Himself received Christ and was born again on the road to Damascus, but received the Holy Spirit after three days when Ananias, a disciple of Damascus, came to him and laid hands on him ([Acts 9:9\-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:9-11&version=kjv),[17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:17&version=kjv)).

So, being born again is actually being baptized into the Holy Ghost, into Christ, and into God. John refers to it as "being in God" and distinguishes that from "He in you" ([1 John 4:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:15&version=kjv)) much as Paul the apostle distinguishes ‘being in Christ’, which begins at the new birth, from ‘Christ in you’, which evidently is initiated when you receive the Holy Spirit into you ([2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=kjv), [Colossians 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv)).

## FERVENT AND PERSISTENT IN PRAYER August 22nd, 2023
![August 22nd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-22-aug23-fervent-and-persistent-in-prayer-min.jpg)

 >***So Peter was kept in prison, but fervent prayer for him was persistently made to God by the church (assembly) (Acts 12:5 AMPC).***

***So Peter was kept in prison, but fervent prayer for him was persistently made to God by the church (assembly) (***[***Acts 12:5 AMPC***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2012:5&version=AMPC)***).***

The Lord Jesus emphasised the need for us to watch and pray always. In [Luke 21:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2021:36&version=kjv), for example, He said, *“Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.”* In [Luke 18:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018:1&version=kjv), He also said, *“...Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.”* The Apostle Paul further emphasises this in [1 Thessalonians 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:17&version=kjv): *“Pray without ceasing.”* Why is there so much emphasis on us praying?

Recall the words of Jesus, *“…Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”* ([Matthew 6:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:10&version=kjv)). He wants His will established in the earth as it is in heaven. He holds His people responsible for making His will come to pass in the nations. He lets us run the world with Him, enforcing His will in the nations of the world through our priestly ministry of intercession.

Luke, in [Acts 12:1\-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2012:1-5&version=kjv), for example, shows us the impact of the heartfelt, continued, intercessory prayer of the saints. Herod, the king, sought to oppress the Church and executed James, one of the Lord’s disciples, in order to please the Jews. Motivated by the exciting response of the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter.

Herod must have considered killing Peter, the leader of the group, as the most strategic way to destroy everything the Church stood for. However, the Church remained steadfast in prayer for Peter. As the Church prayed fervently and persistently, there was an intervention from heaven. An angel of the Lord appeared and freed Peter from his chains and guided him to safety. He then went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, where the Church had gathered in fervent prayer ([Acts 12:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2012:12&version=kjv)).

Learn to be persistent and fervent in prayer. Remember what the Bible says in [James 5:16 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205:16&version=AMPC), *“…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available \[dynamic in its working].”* Persist in prayer until there’s a change. We have the power to change anything through our prayers. God made it so. Hallelujah!

## WE RULE BY HIS NAME August 23rd, 2023

***And now he is exalted as first above every ruler, authority, government, and realm of power in existence! He is gloriously enthroned over every name that is ever praised, not only in this age, but in the age that is coming! (***[***Ephesians 1:21 TPT***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:21&version=TPT)***).***

As you study the books of Isaiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah, Amos, Hosea, and the book of Revelation, as well as 1st and 2nd Thessalonians, you’ll gain clarity about God's timeline from the creation until the establishment of the heavenly city, the New Jerusalem. 

Some of these books tell us about different world governments that ruled the world as opportunities were given to them by God. These empires governed nations and kingdoms for thousands of years until the Church age. God didn’t give any individual or group the opportunity to govern the world in the Church age. Instead, He established the Name of Jesus Christ as the name by which anything can be legally done in this world, as far as heaven is concerned.

The Church age is exclusively left for the Name of Jesus Christ. His Name is to be used in governing things in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth. So, we’re the ones in charge and in control of things in this world; we’re the ones to determine the destinies of the nations, not Satan.

Until the Rapture of the Church, we have the final say on what becomes of our world. The Lord made us partakers of His divine nature; we’re members of the heavenly pantheon; and in His Name, we reassign the desolate heritages. That’s God's plan.

Satan isn’t going to be able to enforce his will and exert his influence on the nations as long as we are in this world. We can discern his works and stratagems through the wisdom of God's Word. And with our authority in the Name of Jesus, we cut him off from the nations and establish the righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## IT TAKES THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD August 24th, 2023

>***So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed (***[***Acts 19:20***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:20&version=kjv)***).***

Imagine being invited to a special conference to minister the Word, and you undertake a long, tedious, journey to get to the city. You went through the mountains, sailed on a boat, or even encountered some dangers on the way.

When you finally arrive at the city, you’re greeted by a group of twelve people who express excitement at your arrival. After the pleasantries, you say enthusiastically, "Shall we proceed to the conference?" and they all chorus, "Sir, this is the meeting; it's only us twelve in the city."

That was Paul’s experience at Ephesus. He had heard reports about this city, but upon his arrival, he found only twelve disciples there, though he expected to meet more. Paul recognized the challenge before him and also knew the solution to the issue. We can tell from his question in [Acts 19:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:2&version=kjv) and the answer the twelve disciples gave him: they hadn’t received the Holy Spirit.

Paul then explained to them the baptism of John and the need to believe in Jesus Christ. Upon hearing this, they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Afterwards, he laid his hands on them to receive the Holy Spirit and they began to speak in tongues and prophesy. Paul knew that when they received the Holy Spirit, they’d go wild for the Gospel.

Paul didn’t stop there. Learning that they had been baptized only with John's baptism gave him clarity about their situation. He decided to do a “sewing machine job,” that is, a three\-month step\-by\-step teaching of the Word ([Acts 19:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:8&version=kjv)).

An important lesson to learn from Paul was that he wasn’t discouraged even though his audience was relatively small. He worked with the twelve men, ministered to them, and embarked on an evangelistic endeavour in the city, reaching out to both Jews and Gentiles.

The subsequent result was that all of Ephesus was impacted with the Word of God! As read in our opening verse, the Word of God grew mightily and prevailed throughout the nooks and crannies of the entire city. Hallelujah! If you've received the Holy Spirit, go wild for the Gospel! The power of God is at work in you to preach the Word and minister life to your hearers.

## THINK LIKE THE APOSTLES August 25th, 2023

***Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John (***[***Acts 8:14***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208:14&version=kjv)***)***

In [Acts 8:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208:14&version=kjv), the apostles in Jerusalem received news that Samaria had embraced the Word of God. Promptly, they sent Peter and John to minister to them. These apostles possessed a remarkable mindset that we should emulate. To them, Samaria belonged to them because the Word of God had taken root there.

Understand that not everyone in Samaria had become a Christian, but the seed of the Word had been sown, and the spiritual ground had received it. Consequently, the apostles considered Samaria taken over by the Gospel.

When Peter and John arrived in Samaria, the first thing they did was similar to what Paul did after he journeyed to Ephesus in Acts 19: they ministered to the people to receive the Holy Spirit (read [Acts 8:14\-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208:14-17&version=kjv)).

We are to have the same mentality with the apostles. Their conviction stemmed from the words of Jesus, who likened the Kingdom of Heaven to a mustard seed that grows into a towering plant, surpassing all others. The growth is unstoppable ([Luke 13:18\-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2013:18-19&version=kjv)).

Once the Word of God was planted in a place, be it a city, town, community, country, or nation, the apostles knew they had taken over the place; they knew what to do with the Word in such places.

We need to seize cities and communities with the Gospel. Think like the apostles; adopt their mindset. Think like Paul, who, when he arrived at Ephesus, knew he was conquering not only that place but the regions beyond.

The light of your glorious Gospel that I bear dispels the darkness in the hearts of the unconverted, destroying the bonds of wickedness, and establishing them in your righteousness. Indeed, the Word prevails in my city, and the regions beyond, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

We are to have the same mentality with the apostles. Their conviction stemmed from the words of Jesus, who likened the Kingdom of Heaven to a mustard seed that grows into a towering plant, surpassing all others. The growth is unstoppable.

## A PRODUCTIVE LIFE August 26th, 2023
![August 26th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-26-aug23-a-productive-life-min.jpg)

 >***And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth (Genesis 1:28).***

***And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth (***[***Genesis 1:28***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:28&version=kjv)***).***

In [Genesis 1:26\-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:26-28&version=kjv), the Bible shows us that God created man in His image and in His likeness, and blessed them with the ability to have dominion over all the earth, including every living creature. "To bless" (Hebrew “Barak”) is to praise or give thanks. When you bless God, you’re praising and giving Him thanks! But when you bless another or God blesses you, it means to confer some benefit or to empower. So what God did in [Genesis 1:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:28&version=kjv) was that He empowered Adam and Eve to be fruitful and productive, to multiply, replenish and refill the earth.

In [John 15:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:16&version=kjv), Jesus tells us, *"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you, that ye should go forth and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you."* The word "may" in the King James translation carries a firm affirmation rather than mere speculation. Thus, we are called to go and bring forth fruits.

Secondly, our fruits are meant to remain and have a lasting impact. This means that He has made you efficacious. You have the ability to produce desired results. If you were given a target, your efficacy can be trusted. There’s an ability introduced into your life to produce desired results. It’s your nature in Christ.

You can approach life with confidence, knowing that every endeavour you’re engaged in, will turn into success. It’s the life God has given us—a life of purpose, power, and productivity. Embrace this truth and walk in the confidence of being chosen and appointed by God to live a productive life.

## KEEP YOURSELF IN THE PURITY OF THE SPIRIT August 27th, 2023
![August 27th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-27-aug23-keep-yourself-in-the-purity-of-the-spirit-min.jpg)

 >***…but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God (1 Corinthians 6:11).***

***…but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God (***[***1 Corinthians 6:11***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:11&version=kjv)***).***

In Christ Jesus, we’ve been washed, sanctified, and justified in the Name of the Lord and by His Spirit so we can serve Him in holiness and righteousness all the days of our lives. [Luke 1:74\-75](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201:74-75&version=kjv) says, *“…we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.”*

Some Christians want to manifest the glory of God in their lives, yet they don’t live right. They don’t maintain the purity of the Spirit. But Christianity is a call to righteousness. The Christ\-life in you must be lived accordingly, and the Word of God is your light. You can’t live the way you choose.

The Lord Jesus in [John 17:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:19&version=kjv) said, *“And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.”* Here, He emphasized the power of sanctification; the power of separating yourself from the wrong things; the power of purifying your mind and your life.

There’s a way of life that’s not right for a Christian, and if you’re going to fulfil the purpose of God for your life, you must live a pure and holy life. You’re God’s vessel; you’ve been sanctified to be in fellowship with the Holy Spirit on a clean life. Don’t jeopardize that communion because of a bad attitude, behaviour, or worldly lifestyle.

Don’t live in sin, for the Bible says sin shall not have dominion over you: *“Remember this: sin will not conquer you, for God already has! You are not governed by law but governed by the reign of the grace of God”* ([Romans 6:14 TPT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:14&version=TPT)). You’ve been called into liberty, to live righteously for the Lord. Yield to the authority and Lordship of the Word, and submit to the guidance of the Holy Spirit in your life. [Romans 8:14 TPT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:14&version=TPT) says, *“The mature children of God are those who are moved by the impulses of the Holy Spirit.”*

## HE’S THE GLORY OF OUR LIVES August 28th, 2023
![August 28th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-28-aug23-hes-the-glory-of-our-lives-min.jpg)

 >***But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his (Romans 8:9).***

***But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his (***[***Romans 8:9***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:9&version=kjv)***).***

The Holy Spirit is the glory of the Father ([Romans 6:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:4&version=kjv)). He’s also called the Spirit of glory ([1 Peter 4:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%204:14&version=kjv)). He’s the glory of our lives and the glory of Christianity. You couldn’t know God or love Jesus without the Holy Spirit.

Christians who don’t have the Holy Spirit live as victims in life. They’re buffeted by Satan and vulnerable to the elements of this world. The Apostle Paul emphasized the importance of having the Holy Spirit when he asked certain disciples he met at Ephesus: *“…Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed...”* ([Acts 19:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:2&version=kjv)).

When they answered and said, *“…We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost”* ([Acts 19:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:2&version=kjv)), Paul was stunned. Forthwith, he explained the Scriptures to them and got them to receive the Holy Spirit ([Acts 19:3\-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:3-6&version=kjv)).

No one can live the authentic Christian life without the Holy Spirit. The one who’s born again but hasn’t received the Holy Spirit easily falls into temptations and sin; unable to control his fleshly appetites or restrain himself from evil. It’s only through the Holy Spirit that you mortify the deeds of the body and carnal desires: *“For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live”* ([Romans 8:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:13&version=kjv)).

Without the Holy Spirit, you can’t have the character of Christ. Jesus had to have the Holy Spirit. The apostles had to have the Holy Spirit. Life without the Holy Spirit is empty. So, if you’re reading this and you haven’t received the Holy Spirit, do so right away. Simply say, “Blessed Holy Spirit, I receive you into my heart now in the Name of Jesus Christ”; and be filled with the Spirit of God. Amen. Otherwise, you may go to your church Pastor or a trusted and faithful Christian who’s filled with the Holy Spirit to pray for you.

## LOOK BEYOND YOURSELF August 29th, 2023

 >***But you shall receive power (ability, efficiency, and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you... (Acts 1:8 AMPC).***

***But you shall receive power (ability, efficiency, and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you... (***[***Acts 1:8 AMPC***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:8&version=AMPC)***).***

[2 Corinthians 3:5 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:5&version=AMPC) says, *“Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us, but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God.”* Blessed be God! This means you don’t lack ability for anything.

It brings to mind what the Scripture says in [Philippians 2:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:13&version=kjv), *“For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”* The Holy Spirit makes you willing and able to perform; to deliver at the highest level of excellence all the time. No wonder the Bible says, *“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us”* ([2 Corinthians 4:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:7&version=kjv)).

It’s not your power, but His divine ability that’s at work in you. Therefore, look beyond yourself. Take advantage of the person, power, grace and ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life! The Holy Spirit is your advantage. In your ministry, career, business, job or academics, be conscious of His grace and power at work in you and through you.

Do all things by His mighty power. Follow His wisdom and guidance, conscious that you’re up to any task because He lives in you—walking and working in and through you. [Zechariah 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%204:6&version=kjv) says, *“... Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.”* He’s filled you with supernatural ability to do things that are beyond human ability and comprehension. Hallelujah!

## HIS NAME, THE WORD, AND THE SPIRIT August 30th, 2023

 >***Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts (Zechariah 4:6).***

***Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts (***[***Zechariah 4:6***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah%204:6&version=kjv)***).***

[Colossians 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:17&version=kjv) says, *“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.”* Then [John 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:3&version=kjv), referring to the Word, says, *“All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made that was made.”* Then we come to [Ephesians 5:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:18&version=kjv); Paul, by the Spirit tells us, “*And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.”* Hallelujah!

As you study the Scriptures, you find that it’s about these three: the Name of Jesus, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. The apostles ministered in the Name of Jesus, with the Word of God, and by the power of the Holy Spirit. That’s why they had such extraordinary results. It’s the same today. We do all things in His Name, live in and by His Word, and the power of the Holy Spirit.

The Name of Jesus never fails. Doing all things in His Name means that you live your life every day in and with the consciousness of the power, glory and dominion of His Name.

Some people try so hard to succeed through their own might and natural wisdom, yet, true success eludes them. This is because they’re not acting on the Word; they’re not living the Word. They function from the mind— the sense\-realm—which is grossly limited. Yet, true and lasting success is the result of meditation on the Word of God ([Joshua 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:8&version=kjv)).

Thirdly is the power of the Holy Spirit. If you’ve been trying to succeed by your own power or ability, it’s time to quit the struggle and rely on the strategies of the Spirit and His wisdom to guide you. Our competence—the ability, wisdom and grace by which we function are of the Spirit ([2 Corinthians 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:5&version=kjv)). Trust in Him. He’s the key to a life of joy, praise, endless victories and extraordinary success.

***Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths (***[***Proverbs 3:5\-6***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%203:5-6&version=kjv)***).***

There’s more to our existence than the ordinary thinking process we engage in, the guesswork, and even the dependence on so\-called experts who often disappoint us.

The world has witnessed countless disappointments throughout the ages in various professions, fields of knowledge, and industries. It amplifies an obvious reality: you cannot rely solely on human wisdom to live a successful life. It’s with this understanding that we must appreciate and depend on the guidance and leadership of the Holy Spirit. Remember Jesus said, *“…I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen”* ([Matthew 28:20 NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:20&version=NKJV)). This He makes possible through the presence and power of the Holy Spirit.

Consider the words of Jesus in [John 16:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13&version=kjv): *“Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.”* Isn't that wonderful? The Holy Spirit is our sure and dependable guide.

With Him, you're not going to be left groping in the dark, speculating about what to do or where to go, wondering what to do in life, what choices to make, for He will guide you into all truth. He also reveals the future to you. We’re not left to guess and hope without direction. Our hope is focused and well\-directed because the Holy Spirit shows us the future.

Something absolutely remarkable is the fact that He empowers us to change the future that He reveals to us that’s not consistent with His perfect will. We have the ability to shape our own destinies. Some may find this hard to fathom, but it’s the truth revealed in the Word.

So let your faith be in God’s holy Word, and be ever\-reliant and dependent on the Holy Spirit for guidance and direction in and for all things. Blessed be God!
