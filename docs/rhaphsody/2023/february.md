## A DIVINE REALITY February 1st, 2023

***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (***[***Colossians 1:27***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv)***).***

Throughout this month, take some time every day, or at least for the next two weeks, to meditate on the verse of scripture above. Lie on your bed and repeat them out loud again and again. Walk around thinking and muttering, “Christ is in me.” I did this many years ago and it sure transformed my life. I needed to capture the essence and reality of that verse. I wanted it to soak into my spirit, and it did!

“Christ in you” isn’t a religious talk; it’s a divine reality. Sadly, the power of that reality isn’t yet as effectual in the lives of some as it should be. That’s the reason for their whining and grumbling; the lack, headaches and fevers they complain of. It’s the reason some have wounds, sicknesses and diseases that are said to be incurable.

How could you be sick if indeed Christ indwells your physical body? Remember Aeneas who, though a Christian, had been paralysed and bedridden for eight years. Then came Peter to his house. All that Peter said was, “Aeneas, Christ makes you well: get up!” Immediately, the man was healed.

Peter understood the reality, the power and the essence of Christ living in a man. What did Paul say in [Romans 8:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:10&version=kjv)? He said, “And if Christ is in you, although the body may be dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.”

Before Christ came into you, your body was death\-doomed or death\-prone. You were susceptible to the curse of sin and were therefore subject to Satan, condemnation, sickness, disease, poverty and death. But then, the Bible says, *“…if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you"* ([Romans 8:11 NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:11&version=NKJV)). This has already happened. The Spirit lives in you now and has given life, vitalized your mortal or hitherto death\-doomed body.

Your life, now that you’re born again, is death\-proof. You have to insist on that; otherwise, you’ll be buffeted by the elements of life. But when you consciously meditate on Christ and His life in you, He’ll manifest Himself in your physical body and dispel everything that’s not of God. Christ in you is the greatest blessing of all!

## HEIRS OF BLESSINGS February 2nd, 2023
![February 2nd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-2-perfect-as-he-is-perfectt.jpg)

 >***And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise (Galatians 3:29).***
---
***And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise (***[***Galatians 3:29\)***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203:29&version=kjv)***.***

Our theme verse says if you belong to Christ, then you’re Abraham’s seed and an heir according to the promise. This is so profound. It also brings to mind what the Apostle Paul said in [Ephesians 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&version=kjv), *“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.”*

You've already been blessed with "ALL" spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You’re an heir of a Kingdom of blessings. This just takes the struggle out of life. Think about the Master’s gratifying words in [Luke 12:32 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:32&version=NKJV), *“Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”* Why would anyone know this and struggle in life? Then, to think He’s even done it already makes it super transcendent. He’s already given you the Kingdom.

The lesser is included in the greater. If you already have the Kingdom, then you have everything the Kingdom represents: divine life, righteousness, love, joy, wealth untold, divine health, peace and more are already yours. They’re part of your inheritance and rights in Christ.

In Christ, you have the keys to the Kingdom of heaven, which means you have access to both spiritual and earthly blessings. Live every day with the consciousness that the Kingdom is yours. And the Kingdom didn’t come to you empty; it’s loaded with blessings. Blessed be God!

I’m an heir of God’s Kingdom of blessings; divine life, health, prosperity, success, joy, peace and victory are mine in Christ.

I thank you Lord, for the Kingdom belongs to me; therefore, I have all things that pertain to life and godliness, and I flourish exceedingly in every good work, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## SPIRITUAL INCANTATIONS February 3rd, 2023
![February 3rd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-3-spiritual-incantations.jpg)

 >***Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (Romans 8:26).***
---
***Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (***[***Romans 8:26***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:26&version=kjv)***).***

In [Acts 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202&version=kjv), the apostles, along with the other disciples of Jesus, were gathered in an upper room in Jerusalem during the Feast of Pentecost. Then something remarkable happened: they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.

Some of those present made a joke of it and derisively said they were simply drunk and full of intoxicating wine. But the truth is, they were making spiritual incantations. What exactly were they saying?

To the mockers, these disciples were only “stammering,” just as the Prophet Isaiah said in [Isaiah 28:11](https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Isaiah 28:11 kjv), *“For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.”* It was the best way Isaiah could relate with or interpret this awesome blessing of the New Testament. They knew nothing about this in the Old Testament.

In Isaiah’s visions, he might have heard some kinds of stuttering or something similar to a speech disorder—a disorder involving hesitations and involuntary repetitions of certain sounds—revealed to him in the Spirit. But Paul had a greater insight and tells us that through those “stammerings” or “stutterings,” we speak the wisdom of God in esoteric language (1 Corinthians 2:7\).

In other words, the Holy Spirit orchestrated the utterances given to us, which we speak in tongues; therefore, they’re not mere involuntary recitations or repetitions; these are incantations. Incantations are ritual recitations of words or sounds with supernatural effect, synonymous with conjuration. This is what we do when we speak in tongues.

While praying, you may find yourself repeating just one syllable; continue. You’re making incantations of the Spirit; you’re speaking forth God’s plans in words and sounds orchestrated by the Holy Spirit that’ll change things and your life forever.

Dear Father, thank you for the blessing of speaking in other tongues, and incantations of the Spirit.

Amen.

## THERE’S HELP FOR YOU February 4th, 2023
![February 4th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-4-theres-help-for-youu.jpg)

 >***And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams (1 Chronicles 15:26).***
---
***And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams (***[***1 Chronicles 15:26***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%2015:26&version=kjv)***).***

The Bible tells us how David got some Levites to move the ark of God into a place he had prepared for it in Jerusalem. But something striking that we observed is that the Bible says, *“…God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord....”* Isn’t it amazing?

Though the Levites were called to bear the ark, God helped them to carry out their ministry. God also helped a man named Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah. He had gone to battle against the Syrians in alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel. Having no idea that Jehoshaphat was in the battle, the king of Syria instructed his commanders to go after Ahab, the king of Israel.

“Don’t fight anyone else; just go after King Ahab and kill him,” he told them. When his men saw Jehoshaphat, they thought he was the king of Israel and cornered him. But the Bible says, *“…Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him”* ([2 Chronicles 18:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%2018:31&version=kjv)).

The Bible also tells us about a young king, Uzziah, who started out as a teenager. He was responsible for several inventions and technological transformation of Judah. The Bible specifically says that he was marvellously helped of the Lord until he became strong ([2 Chronicles 26:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%2026:15&version=kjv)).

Isn’t this and more what we have today in the Holy Spirit that lives in us? He’s your helper! Is there anything you’re trying to achieve? Or are you experiencing some form of trouble? There’s supernatural help available for you.

The Holy Spirit is in you to help you in ministry, in business, in your finances and relationships. He’ll move trouble away from you just as He moved Jehoshaphat’s enemies away. He’ll give you creative ideas that’ll make your name spread abroad. You’re not disadvantaged in any way; the Helper is in you, and that’s the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah!

## THE TABERNACLE OF PRAISE February 5th, 2023
![February 5th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-5-the-tabernacle-of-praise.jpg)

 >***And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord (Psalm 27:6).***
---
***And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord (***[***Psalm 27:6***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2027:6&version=kjv)***).***

In the days of David, there were two tabernacles: one was in Gibeon, while the other was in Jerusalem. 1 Chronicles 16 talks about both of them. The Tabernacle in Gibeon, which was the tabernacle of Moses, was the place of sacrifice (Read [1 Chronicles 16:39\-40 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%2016:39-40&version=NIV)).

The tabernacle in Jerusalem, which was the tabernacle of David, had Levitical singers whom David had appointed to minister before the Ark of God: *“And he (David) appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord, and to record, and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel”* ([1 Chronicles 16:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%2016:4&version=kjv)). The Levites were to minister before the ark night and day, singing praises to the Lord.

While in Gibeon, they were offering the sacrifices of bulls and goats in Jerusalem; they offered sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving continually to the Lord. David said, *“I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs”* ([Psalm 69:30\-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2069:30-31&version=kjv)).

Many years later, in the New Testament, James, while debating with some Church elders about God’s plan for the Gentiles, quoted a prophecy: *“After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up”* ([Acts 15:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015:16&version=kjv)). Notice the Lord didn’t say, “I will build again the tabernacle of Moses.” Rather, He said He would build again the tabernacle of David where was unending praise.

This tells us what we're supposed to have in the Church today: unending praise in the sanctuary! It’ll usher us into a higher and more glorious arena of life and ministry, as we build a living tabernacle that'll never be destroyed.

## THERE’S AN URGENCY February 6th, 2023
![February 6th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-6-theres-an-urgency.jpg)

 >***And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come (Matthew 24:14).***

***And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come (***[***Matthew 24:14***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:14&version=kjv)***).***

One important thing the Holy Spirit is causing the Church to do in these last days is to speed up the preaching of the Gospel. This Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. This is God’s mission for the Church today. The time is short.

We all must understand the urgency of the hour, the day we’re living in, and get serious about the things of the Kingdom. Preach the Gospel; preach it with all your heart and with all the boldness and love that God has given you.

In [Matthew 28:18\-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:18-20&version=kjv), Jesus said, *“…All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world, Amen.”* What an assurance!

Nothing could bolster more confidence in us to speed up the preaching of the Gospel and take it to the ends of the earth than the words of the Master in the verses we just read. We’re in the times of the signs, and the final sign is already unfolding before our eyes, which is the massive salvation of souls around the world!

Already, we’ve taken the Gospel to billions of people around the world and in every known living language, through Rhapsody of Realities. But we must keep at it until we’ve reached everybody, just as the Lord instructed. Remember, the Holy Spirit is in us, and brought us this far; He’ll take us to the finish line.

<details>
  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, I thank you for the opportunities I have to preach the Gospel and reach more people with the message of salvation. I move with the speed and urgency of the Spirit, guided by your wisdom in leading many to righteousness. I receive increased grace and ability to fulfil the ministry of reconciliation to those in my world, and in the regions beyond, in Jesus' Name. Amen.

## GLORIFIED IN CHRIST February 7th, 2023
![February 7th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-7-glorified-in-christ.jpg)

***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (***[***Colossians 1:27***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv)***).***

In His prayer to the Father in [John 17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017&version=kjv), the Lord Jesus made some of the most enthralling statements that encapsulate His love for us and oneness with us. Think about what He said in verse 22: *“And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.”* This is huge! Jesus has given you glory.

Glory means beauty, excellence, success, greatness and prosperity. Glory includes health. The Bible says *“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth”* ([3 John 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=3%20John%201:2&version=kjv)). God doesn’t want you sick; He wants you healthy all the time. That’s a life of glory.

[2 Peter 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&version=kjv) says, *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”* Your life is for the glory of God.

Talking about you, the new creation, the Bible says: “*Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified”* ([Romans 8:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:30&version=kjv)). You’ve been glorified! Many Christians have believed that God predestinated them, called them, and justified them; but not many know they’ve been glorified.

Manifest the glory of God in your job, in your finances, and your family. Every so often, declare, “I’m glorified in Christ. The dominion of sin, darkness and sickness is broken from my life. There’s joy in my life and my home. I walk in the glory of God always!” Blessed be God!

## THREE IMPORTANT THINGS JESUS CAME TO DO February 8th, 2023
![February 8th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-8-three-important-things-jesus-came-to-do.jpg)

 >***He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8).***
---
***He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil (***[***1 John 3:8***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:8&version=kjv)***).***

Jesus had a clear purpose for coming to this world. The first is to destroy the works of the devil. The Bible tells us in [Acts 10:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010:38&version=kjv), *“How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”*

Not only did Jesus come to destroy the works of the devil, He also came so that we may have and enjoy life. The Bible says in [John 10:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&version=kjv), *“The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows)”* (AMPC). He made us dispensers of life—the God\-life.

Thirdly, and this is the chief of all that He came to do; He came to bring us into fellowship with divinity. The Bible says, *“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord”* ([1 Corinthians 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:9&version=kjv)). This means we’ve been brought into oneness with Jesus Christ. We’ve been brought into friendship with Him.

In this fellowship, He knows you personally and shares His life and EVERYTHING He has and represents with you. Hallelujah! That’s why the Bible calls us joint\-heirs with Him ([Romans 8:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:17&version=kjv)). We’re partakers—associates or comrades of the God\-kind.

No wonder Paul said, *“...all things are yours”* ([1 Corinthians 3:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:21&version=kjv)), because you’re one with the Monarch of the universe—the One who owns and reigns over all things.

  <summary>Confession</summary>
  
I take charge of my life and enjoy it to its fullest, for Christ has made me a sharer, partner and participator of the divine nature. I'm an associate of the God-kind, having been made free from the corrupting influences, decadence and destruction in the world. Therefore, I take advantage of the immense treasures and blessings of the Christ-life. Glory to God!

## THE SOURCE OF LIFE February 9th, 2023
![February 9th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-9-the-source-of-life.jpg)

 >***For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us (1 John 1:2).***

***For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us (***[***1 John 1:2***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:2&version=kjv)***).***

All around us are living things: people, plants, animals and even microscopic organisms. But what gives them life? What’s the substance of life? Men may have been able to form the human body and to create plants, but no one has ever created life. The best they’ve done is to take life from a living thing and put it into another, as the very source of life is unknown to man; he can’t create it.

The opening verse above says, *“For the life was manifested….”* What a construction! This is referring to Jesus Christ; He’s the embodiment of life. He’s the real essence. Life in its entirety was encapsulated in a human body and manifested to us in the Person of Jesus Christ.

He is that life which was with the Father and was manifested to us [(1 John 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:2&version=kjv)). Everything gets life from Him. When He walked the earth, He didn’t need life from God; He was life! In [John 5:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:26&version=kjv), He said, *“For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.”* This explains why He’s able to give life to anyone and to everything.

[1 John 5:11\-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:11-12&version=kjv) says, *“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.”* Blessed be God! The life that Jesus gives destroys and repels the works of darkness in the human body.

Always be more conscious of your divinity and walk in victory, for Christ our life is now in you, and as He is, so are we in this world. Amen.

## HE SHARES HIS GLORY WITH US February 10th, 2023
![February 10th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-10-he-shares-his-glory-with-us.jpg)

 >***And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one (John 17:22).***
---
***And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one (***[***John 17:22***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:22&version=kjv)***).***

There are Christians who say God won’t share His glory with another. Some have said it for so long that they now believe it’s scriptural, but it’s not. They misunderstood what God said in [Isaiah 42:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2042:8&version=kjv) and use it to buttress their position. There, the Lord said, *“I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.”*

If you understand Isaiah’s prophetic ministry and his expressions, you’d understand that he portrays a dual communication of the same truth in most of his prophecies. For instance, what he refers to as “another” is also, spiritually, what he refers to as “graven images.”

You’ll observe the same thing in [Isaiah 48:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2048:11&version=kjv) where the Lord says, *“For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another.”* How’s God’s name polluted? It’s by mixing the worship of God with idolatry. Every time the Lord talked about not giving His glory to another, He was referring to idols, not human beings.

It was always God’s plan from the beginning to share His glory with human beings; He always wanted to do it. When He made man, He glorified man, but when man sinned, he fell short of the glory of God: *“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God”* ([Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:23&version=kjv)).

It was sin that took man out of the glory of God. But when Jesus came, He restored man to the glory of God: *“To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory”* ([Colossians 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv)). This is the revelation and essence of Christianity.

We’re not trying to take glory from God; He gave us His glory. Every day of your life, thank Him that you’re in the glory. That’s what He’s given to you; and that’s what He’s made you: you’re the glory of God! Hallelujah!

## IT’S YOUR HERITAGE TO KNOW HIS WILL February 11th, 2023
![February 11th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-11-its-your-heritage-to-know-his-will.jpg)

 >***And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth (Acts 22:14).***
---
***And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth (***[***Acts 22:14***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2022:14&version=kjv)***).***

Our opening verse was a message addressed to Saul of Tarsus, who was later known as Paul. The Lord had sent Ananias, a disciple at Damascus, to lay hands on him and also to tell him that he’d been chosen to know the will of God. What a message!

Not everyone knows the will of God, yet it's the most important thing in life. To please Him, you first have to know His will. Only when you know His will can you begin to fulfil it and live accordingly. That’s why, as a child of God, the first and most important thing you have to do is to discover what God's plan is: What’s He saying to you now, and what does He want you to do?

You may ask, “Is it really possible to know the will of God? Can one actually know His will?" Absolutely! Read [Ephesians 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:9&version=kjv); it says, *“Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself.”* Jesus said, *“…it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven...”*([Matthew 13:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:11&version=kjv)). It’s your heritage to know the will of the Father.

In [Colossians 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:9&version=kjv), the Lord also expressed His desire for you to *“…be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.”* You know His will from studying His Word. God’s Word is the revelation of His will.

As you study the Word, the Father’s heart—His thoughts, plans and purposes are unveiled to you. His light will dawn in your heart as truth unveils. Then you understand God’s way of thinking and are synchronized with Him.

## WE ALWAYS WIN February 12th, 2023
![February 12th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-12-we-always-win.jpg)

 >***Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place (2 Corinthians 2:14).***

***Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place (***[***2 Corinthians 2:14***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%202:14&version=kjv)***).***

There’s a reason for the Church being the most persecuted of the demographics in the world: Satan is terrified of us; therefore, he’s making so much effort to cause fear in the hearts of many. But he’s a failure. The mighty things that are happening in, with and through the Church of Jesus Christ in our day are even about to be taken to a higher level.

In [Matthew 16:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:18&version=kjv), Jesus said, *“…I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”* The word “Gates” is symbolic in prophetic language for “power and dominion.” The powers and dominion of hell shall not, and can never, prevail against the Church.

The Church, right from inception, has survived and endured many terrible persecutions, and will always outlive her enemies and detractors. That’s because the Word of God is clear: *“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us”* ([Romans 8:35\-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:35-37&version=kjv)).

The Church will always have the victory; it’ll crush every opposition and conquer everyone who ever stands against it. That’s the blessing upon the Church. The Holy Spirit is the Boss of the Church, and He’s God. He’s doing His work, and we’re labourers together with Him. It’s impossible for us to fail.

We won before we started; we’re just acting out the script that’s already been written. The Amplified version of our theme verse says, *“But thanks be to God, Who in Christ always leads us in triumph \[as trophies of Christ's victory….”* That’s what’s happening. We’re in a Holy Ghost victory parade. What you need is to stay focused on the work of the ministry, carrying it out with joy. Hallelujah!

## HE NEVER COMPELS YOU February 13th, 2023
![February 13th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-13-he-never-compels-you.jpg)

 >***I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live (Deuteronomy 30:19).***
---
***I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live (***[***Deuteronomy 30:19***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2030:19&version=kjv)***).***

As you study the Scriptures, you’ll discover that God gave man the power to choose. He may give several options and show you which one is right for you, but He never forces you to make a choice. In our theme scripture, He told Israel what to choose: life over death; blessings and not curses; but He didn’t force them.

This is an important lesson for leaders. Only tyrants compel or force obedience. In [Matthew 20:25 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2020:25&version=AMPC), Jesus said, *“…You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men hold them in subjection \[tyrannizing over them].”* The Lord isn’t that way.

Think about Jesus and His message of love: He gave His own life for all. Through the ages, many rulers and religious leaders forced people to accept their beliefs through intimidation, fear and terror. But the Lord Jesus gave His own life in our place and still lovingly lets us know we have a choice to accept or reject Him. Think about that!

However, even though He doesn't force us into the choices we make, He lets us understand the consequences of making the wrong choices. What you must do, therefore, is to live according to His Word and by His Spirit.

To the one who’s yet to be born again, I encourage you to do so NOW. Don’t live another day without making Jesus Christ the Lord of your life! You have the power to choose; so, make this right choice NOW. The Bible says, *“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved”* ([Romans 10:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:9&version=kjv)). It’s so simple, yet so powerful.

To be born again is to have the very nature of God in your spirit; it’s to have the active life of Christ in every fibre of your being—in your spirit, soul and body. Hallelujah!

## RESULT ORIENTED PRAYER February 14th, 2023
![February 14th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-14-result-oriented-prayer-new.jpg)

 >***While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could deliver him out of death. And God heard his prayers because of his reverence for God (Hebrews 5:7 NLT).***
---
***While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could deliver him out of death. And God heard his prayers because of his reverence for God (***[***Hebrews 5:7 NLT***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%205:7&version=NLT)***).***

The Lord Jesus is the perfect example of one who prayed result oriented prayers. His prayers produced the right results always. He didn’t pray merely out of routine or as a religious obligation. His disciples noticed this about Him; they were intrigued by how effectual his prayers were; hence, they said to Him, “Master, teach us to pray” ([Luke 11:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2011:1&version=kjv)).

The astounding results that Jesus had while He walked the earth can’t be divorced from His ever\-amazing prayer life. In [Mark 1:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:35&version=kjv), the Bible tells us, *“And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.”* In another instance, the Bible says, *“…he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed"* ([Luke 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%205:16&version=kjv)).

Luke also showed us that sometimes, Jesus went into the high hills to spend the entire night in prayer to God ([Luke 6:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:12&version=kjv)). He had such an effective prayer life and ever\-amazing results! That's the way it should be for us. 

Spend time to pray in tongues often. Have a robust prayer schedule and discipline yourself to stick with it, and you’ll find yourself operating at a new level of spiritual maturity and efficiency. You’ll make tremendous progress and experience great success in all your affairs.

Recall what [Jude 1:20 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201:20&version=AMPC) says, *“But you, beloved, build yourselves up \[founded] on your most holy faith \[make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit.”* Praying in the power and inspiration of the Holy Spirit will help you make remarkable progress, and cause you to rise like an edifice, higher and higher.

The more you pray in tongues, the more sensitive you are to the Spirit, to receive and follow His guidance. And with His guidance, you operate in dominion and triumph always. Hallelujah!

## BUILD ACCORDING TO HIS DESCRIPTION February 15th, 2023
![February 15th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-15-build-according-to-his-description-b.jpg)

***…Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain (***[***Hebrews 8:5 NIV***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%208:5&version=NIV)***).***

When God told Moses to build a tabernacle, He gave him a clear description and instructed him to build according to the description: *“According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it”* ([Exodus 25:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2025:9&version=KJV)).

In your walk with the Lord and work in His Kingdom, don’t just run off with every idea just because you think it’s nice. Be sure that you’re following God’s blueprint; the pattern and description that He’s given. It’s one of the reasons you must know the Word for yourself.

In His Word, you find samples, patterns and descriptions of how He wants us to live, the things He wants us to do and how to do them. The psalmist said in [Psalm 127:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20127:1&version=kjv), *“Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it…”*; we must build according to His plan.

In these last days, the Lord Jesus is building His Church. He said, *“…I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it”* ([Matthew 16:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:18&version=kjv)). There’s a description given to us in the Word of God that shows how He’s doing this. The Bible says He (Christ Himself), *“…gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up”* ([Ephesians 4:11\-12 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:11-12&version=NIV)).

His plan is to build through these leaders, but everyone is involved; each one of us contributes to the building of this great body of Christ: *“From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love”* ([Ephesians 4:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:16&version=kjv)).

Every time you lead someone to Christ, you’re adding to the building of the Body of Christ, and it's a magnificent building. Hallelujah! Keep playing your role by winning souls into the Kingdom. You’ll be contributing to the building of the magnificent structure according to the description given.

## RELEASING THE RIGHT CODES February 16th, 2023
![February 16th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-16-releasing-the-right-codes.jpg)

 >***For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries (1 Corinthians 14:2).***

***For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries (***[***1 Corinthians 14:2***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:2&version=kjv)***).***

There’re things that’ll not happen for you in your life and in this world until you learn to use the coded words. Paul called them hidden wisdom, spiritual mysteries and secrets ([1 Corinthians 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:7&version=kjv)). For example, as you start out praying in the spirit, you’ll get to a point where you begin to conjure or summon things from the spirit realm into the natural. Life is spiritual and we win by the Spirit.

Through the Holy Spirit, you can know the right words to use in prayer. Those words are spiritual codes. He may have you repeat a word or make a sound repeatedly; that’s because He knows the details of the “code.”

The Holy Spirit knows the number of times you may need to repeat those words for them to form the right code. In prayer, you might be speaking some words or making some sounds that may require twenty\-five of those sounds for the code to be complete or connected. But if you stop at the twenty\-fourth sound, it won’t work, because the code will be incomplete.

It’s like trying to get into a passworded system or account; you never get in with the wrong codes even if it’s just one letter or sign that you missed. So, in praying and making conjurations in the Spirit, continue until the Spirit moves to the next level. Remember, He’s the One that gives you the utterance.

There’re issues people go through in life and even though they might have been speaking in tongues, there seem to be no results. It’s because there’s a code in the realm of the spirit that’s still missing. Use the codes and you’ll have the baby you’ve desired for so long. Use the codes and the money will come; you’ll have the new venue for your church or business.

That house you’ve so desired is in that coded language; use the right codes and you’ll have it. The answer to that problem is “coded” but the Holy Spirit knows the code. Pray in tongues until you get the complete codes from the Holy Spirit and release them.

## UNITED BY THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD February 17th, 2023

 >***…being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad (John 11:51-52).***

***…being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation; And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad (***[***John 11:51\-52***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011:51-52&version=kjv)***).***

The verses above bring to mind the words of Jesus in [John 10:16\.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:16&version=kjv) He said, *“And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”* He made this statement in reference to the Jews and the Gentiles who would believe in Him. He was going to get all of them together as onefold to be their shepherd. Blessed be God!

How the Lord Jesus wants the Church to be one! He wants us to speak with one voice, to have the same vision, knowing that we have one Father and one Lord, Jesus Christ. Praying to the Father for all God’s children, He said, *“… that they may be one, even as we are one”* ([John 17:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:22&version=kjv)).

God’s dream is to gather His children together in the spirit of unity. Don’t mix this up with the One World Religion that elitist globalists are trying to set up. Understand that when God does something, Satan always wants to come up with counterfeits. God is gathering us together, not necessarily in the physical, but in our hearts—uniting us by the Spirit and the Word.

Today, many of us, God’s people around the world, think the same things about the Lord, love Him the same way with so much passion, preach the Gospel and win souls like never before. We love one another more, and understand better, the mystery of the Body of Christ in the unity of the spirit. This is God’s dream, and each one of us must strive for the unity of the Body of Christ.

Think about it: with so many of us working together from around the world, we’ve made God’s Word, through Rhapsody of Realities, available in every known living language in the world. We’ve been united by the Spirit for the same vision and by the same message.

Through the Holy Spirit, we understand and proclaim the same message. This will continue even in greater measure as the Church age comes to a close. Glory to God!

## OUR CONFIDENCE IN HIS NAME February 18th, 2023
![February 18th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-18-our-confidence-in-his-name.jpg)

 >***That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (Philippians 2:10-11).***
---
***That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (***[***Philippians 2:10\-11\)***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:10-11&version=kjv)***.***

There’re those who wonder why we use the Name of Jesus in prayer. That’s because they don’t understand the Scriptures and the power in the Name of Jesus. His Name is the name of the God\-head; it’s the greatest name there is. Everything in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth is subject to His Name. Nothing and no one is exempt from the dominion and authority of this Name.

Furthermore, we use His Name because He asked us to. In [John 14:13\-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:13-14&version=kjv), He said, *“And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.”*

In [John 16:23\-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:23-24&version=kjv), we also read the words of Jesus where He says, *“And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.”* Here, He says we can pray in His Name. He gives us the power, the legal authority, to use His Name.

We read in our theme scripture that God made a sovereign decree, a law in the realm of the spirit, that at the Name of Jesus, every knee should bow: “of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.” 

The Greek word translated as “things” also means “whatever.” This refers to anything that exists—people, beasts, birds, the elements—whatever—they all submit to the Name of Jesus. This includes everything under the earth, which refers to hell.

No wonder, He tells us we can raise the dead. Even if someone went to hell, we can call him back because the Name of Jesus Christ has power in heaven, in earth and under the earth. See why you should always use the Name of Jesus and have confidence in His Name? Live every day in His Name and your life will be excellent and full of glory; you’ll always be triumphant.

## WHEN YOU LIVE IN HIS NAME February 19th, 2023

***And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him (***[***Colossians 3:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:17&version=kjv)***).***

The Name of Jesus never fails. That’s why the Bible says we must do all things in His Name. What does this mean? It doesn’t mean when you want to eat, for example, you say, “I eat this food in the Name of Jesus”; or anything you want to do, you say, “I do it in the Name of Jesus.” No! It’s not in the constant announcement.

Rather, what it means is that you’re living your life in the Name of Jesus in all situations, having the consciousness that you live for Him, in Him, and as His representative in all circumstances.

When you live in His Name, you’ll live in dominion over sickness, disease and infirmities. His Name is a place; a place of absolute victory and safety. That’s why Solomon said in [Proverbs 18:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:10&version=kjv), *“The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.”* That was in the Old Testament.

Today, we don’t “run into” His Name; we live in His Name. His Name is named upon us. When you live in His Name, you have no fears. When you live in His Name, you live triumphantly over and above circumstances, evil, decadence, depravity, corruption and the perils of this world; you live in unending peace, prosperity, health, success and greatness, to the glory of the Father. Hallelujah!

## THE FIRSTBORN OF THE FATHER February 20th, 2023
![February 20th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-20-the-firstborn-of-the-father.jpg)

 >***And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence (Colossians 1:18).***
---
***And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence (***[***Colossians 1:18***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:18&version=kjv)***).***

Notice that the Bible didn’t call Jesus the firstborn from Mary; rather, He’s called “the firstborn from the dead.” It’s talking about spiritual death, because Jesus died spiritually. Our sins were laid on him ([Isaiah 53:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:6&version=kjv); [1 Peter 2:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:24&version=kjv)) as He was the representative of all sinners. But upon fulfilling the righteous demands of justice, God raised him from the dead. Hallelujah!

When He was raised from the dead, God declared: *“…Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee”* ([Acts 13:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:33&version=kjv)). That’s why He’s called the first begotten or firstborn of the Father. Before His death, He was called the only begotten of the Father.

Jesus being the firstborn of the Father means He’s the Head and we, the Church, are His Body. God raised Him from the dead together with His Body. We’re therefore inextricably one with Him. He heads up the new creation who are begotten of the Father.

The Bible says *“For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren”* ([Romans 8:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:29&version=kjv)). He’s the first among us, and as He is, so are we in this world! Hallelujah!

He is the glory of God; and like Him, we're the glory of God. The Bible says He has brought many sons to glory ([Hebrews 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%202:10&version=kjv)). He was the first to be born again; and like Him, we’ve been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which lives and abides forever ([1 Peter 1:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:23&version=kjv)). Blessed be God!

## REAL WORSHIP—BEYOND FORM OR RITUAL February 21st, 2023
![February 21st, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-21-real-worship-beyond-form-or-ritual.jpg)

 >***Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all (1 Chronicles 29:11).***

***Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all (***[***1 Chronicles 29:11***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%2029:11&version=kjv)***).***

Some people don’t understand what worship is and so they miss out on its blessings and benefits. Worship is the recognition and appreciation of the goodness, blessings, kindness and righteousness of God. It is the appreciation and recognition of His character, and therefore, the confession of His character. Hence, true praise is worship.

When, for instance, you give thanks to God and say “Lord, you’re good; you’re kind; you’ve blessed me; you’re righteous,” you’re defining, recognizing, appreciating and promoting the character of God. The Lord appreciates that because it shows who He is in your life; it separates or distinguishes Him from everyone and everything else.

When you thank Him for His goodness, provision, blessings, and all the wonderful things He’s done in your life, you’re saying “Oh Lord, I know it’s you who did all these things.” You’re attributing those beautiful works to Him, and the necessary result is that He’ll do more for you and reveal Himself to you in a greater way.

Worship always brings a greater revelation of God. This is why we worship only God, and not men, angels, or any other creation. How important worship is! It should be for you something beyond a form or ritual. It should be a time of true recognition, perception and a real encounter with who God is.

## LIVE ABOVE THE WORLD February 22nd, 2023
![February 22nd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-22-live-above-the-world.jpg)

 >***If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you (John 15:19).***

***If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you (***[***John 15:19***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:19&version=kjv)***).***

God expects you to live above this world because you’re not of this world. No wonder the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, cautioned in [Colossians 2:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:20&version=kjv): *“Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances.”*

Refuse to allow your actions, reactions, thoughts, words and responses to be influenced or conditioned by the elements and rudiments of this world. The world is subject to you.

Now that you’re born again, you live in two worlds: the physical world and the spiritual world. Be more conscious of the spiritual realm into which you’re born of God, and function therein. Live the life of heaven on earth, because you’re a citizen of heaven: *“But our citizenship is in heaven…”* ([Philippians 3:20 ESV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203:20&version=ESV)).

Your outlook on life, and your contemplations should be guided by the Word. That way, no matter what happens, you’ll always win. Recall the words of Jesus in [John 16:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:33&version=kjv), *“These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”*

You overcame the world in Him. Therefore, dominate this world with the principles of God’s Kingdom and with your faith: *“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith”* ([1 John 5:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:4&version=kjv)).

## HIS NATURE IN US February 23rd, 2023
![February 23rd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-23-his-nature-in-us.jpg)

>***Put on your new nature, created to be like God—truly righteous and holy (***[***Ephesians 4:24 NLT***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:24&version=NLT)***).***

In [Ephesians 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:1&version=kjv), we’re admonished to be “imitators of God” as His beloved children. His life and nature in us makes this possible. We can walk in absolute mastery and dominion in the earth as Jesus did, for as He is, so are we in this world ([1 John 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&version=kjv)).

Being born again, you’re born after the Second Adam, Jesus Christ; you were created after Him in righteousness and true holiness. [2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=kjv) says, *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature….”* This new creature has the God\-nature. This is the reason you can please God and live the Christ\-life.

No matter how much you train a dog to act like a human, it can never be human, because it doesn’t have the human life. To be human, you have to be born that way. We’re Godlike, and can emulate our heavenly Father, because we were born with His life and nature in us. It’s the reason we can do the same things Jesus did.

He said in [John 14:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:12&version=kjv), *“Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do….”* You can heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers and cast out devils as Jesus did. He gave you the authority in His Name.

Moreover, we can emulate Him in our love\-walk. [Ephesians 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:2&version=kjv) says, *“And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.”* His nature in you makes it possible to express love to those in your world, whether or not they deserve it. Hallelujah!

## YOUR LOVE FOR HIM February 24th, 2023

***For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead (***[***2 Corinthians 5:14***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:14&version=kjv)***).***

The love Paul had for the Lord was the drive behind his overwhelming passion to preach, defend and stand on the truth of the Gospel. Read [Galatians 2:11\-13 NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:11-13&version=NKJV) and see how he defended the truth to Peter. He said, *“Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. And the rest of the Jews also played the hypocrite with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.”*

In the 20th verse, he said, *“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me.”* What a conviction! It was about his love for the Lord.

Christ’s love for us, which was demonstrated in His vicarious death, must elicit from us such love as Paul writes about here, and as John says in [1 John 4:19 NKJV:](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:19&version=NKJV) *“We love Him because He first loved us.”* How much do you love Him?

It’s important that every so often, you open your heart to Him in prayer, and tell Him, “Lord Jesus, I love you with all my heart, today and forever; this is what I want to do—loving you and doing your Word.” Your love for Jesus Christ means more to God than anything you could ever give to Him. So, love Him with all your heart and prove it in keeping His Word.

## WE REIGN OVER ALL THINGS February 25th, 2023
![February 25th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-25-we-reign-over-all-things.jpg)

 >***And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church (Ephesians 1:22).***

***And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church (***[***Ephesians 1:22***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22&version=kjv)***).***

Legally, God has put all things under the feet of Jesus [(Ephesians 1:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22&version=kjv)). Isaiah 9:6 says, *“…and the government shall be upon his shoulder….”* This is so powerful, because it lets us know how it connects to us—the Church!

If Isaiah’s prophetic words had been “…and the government shall be upon His head,” that would have meant the Lord Jesus, because He’s the head and we the Church are His body. The government being upon His shoulders means His reign, His dominion and authority are borne by us. Blessed be God!

Thus, every single member of the Body of Christ is above all things, because all things have been placed under the feet of Jesus. God already said so and nothing can change it. The Lord Jesus, through the Church, reigns over all things.

[1 Corinthians 15:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:25&version=kjv) says, *“For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.”* This isn’t about Him reigning in heaven but in the earth through us. In these last days, you’re expected to “king” in your world and in the earth! Take up the arms of faith and be strengthened in the things of God.

Speak the Word with boldness. Declare that there’s peace in your world and in the nations; speak to every contrary storm to be calm in the Name of Jesus! Rule over circumstances and reign over all things.

## GUIDED BY HIS LIGHT February 26th, 2023
![February 26th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-26-guided-by-his-light.jpg)

>***Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path (***[***Psalm 119:105***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119:105&version=kjv)***).***

The Bible describes the Word as *“…the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world”* ([John 1:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:9&version=kjv)). That means no one has an excuse to stumble, falter or fail in life because we’re all privileged to receive guidance and direction from the Lord.

No wonder Jesus said *“…I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life”* ([John 8:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:12&version=kjv)). Then, David points out something remarkable in [Psalm 119:130](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119:130&version=kjv): *“The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.”*

These thoughts highlight the importance of light and direction from the Lord, through His Word. His Word is light. If you’ve ever attempted to find your way in the dark, you’d agree it wasn’t a smooth sail. You probably bumped into objects or obstacles that you couldn’t see as a result of the darkness.

Moreover, if you were journeying in the dark, you wouldn’t know when you arrive at your destination or hit a crossroads. So think about it: if natural light is that important, what do you think of God’s light—His Word?

It’s one of the reasons you must know the Word for yourself. Without the Word of God, your decisions will be made in darkness, and the decisions that are made in darkness can only produce more darkness, making the person’s life a web of uncertainties, confusion and utter frustration.

In [1 John 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:7&version=kjv), we’re enjoined to walk in the light as He (God) is in the light. In His light, we see light ([Psalm 36:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2036:9&version=kjv)); our paths are illuminated to see and get rid of every obstacles and encumbrances as we journey through life. Hallelujah!

## AT HOME IN HIS PRESENCE February 27th, 2023
![February 27th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-27-at-home-in-his-presence.jpg)

 >***Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? (1 Corinthians 3:16).***

***Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? (***[***1 Corinthians 3:16***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:16&version=kjv)***).***

There’s a consciousness that I have: I’m always in the presence of God! When you have that consciousness, nothing ruffles you. You’re never agitated about anything. You’ll always be full of joy, for in His presence is fullness of joy and at His right hand, pleasures evermore ([Psalm 16:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2016:11&version=kjv)).

Some Christians have the mentality that it’s only when they come to church that they’re in the presence of God. When they leave, they’ve left the presence of God. Some even pray for the presence of God to come down or follow them everywhere. Something is wrong. In Christianity, we don’t come in and go out of God’s presence; we’re forever in His presence.

His presence is our home. When you come into a place, no matter where it is, you come in with God’s presence. You bear His presence. You’re the temple of the living God. When you were born again, Christ took up His abode in you. He’s in you now, and you’re in Him. He didn’t come into you to leave again after some time; He’s forever in you.

In [John 14:16\-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:16-18&version=kjv), the Lord Jesus said, *“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”* The Holy Spirit is in you today and forever; it’s an everlasting indwelling.

Be ever more conscious that you’re a God\-carrying vessel and you live in His presence every day—in the divine environment. Hallelujah!

## THE NEW YOU February 28th, 2023
![February 28th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/feb-23-day-28-the-new-you-new.jpg)

 >***Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).***

***Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (***[***2 Corinthians 5:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=kjv)***).***

Did you know that being born again, your life is new and divine? Therefore, embrace the new you. [Ephesians 4:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:24&version=kjv) says this new you is created in righteousness and true holiness. You’re the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus; as Jesus is, so are you in this world. You’re His icon.

Don’t see yourself as a “sinner” who’s struggling to please God; it’ll make you ineffective in your Christian walk. Rather, have the consciousness that you’re the righteousness of God in Christ.

Always meditate on [Colossians 1:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:22&version=kjv); it tells of the amazing result of Christ’s vicarious sacrifice in your behalf! He did all that He did so as to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in God’s sight. And He succeeded. His life and nature in you gives you the power to live above sin. The new you is fashioned to yield to the dominion of the Word and as a result, produce fruits and works of righteousness.

Even when the Apostle Paul rebuked some of the Christians in Corinth because their way of life didn’t reflect their new nature of righteousness, he didn’t call them sinners (Read [1 Corinthians 6:9\-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:9-11&version=kjv)).

Paul understood that in Christ, we’ve been cleansed of all unrighteousness. We’ve been washed, separated from sin unto God and declared righteous in the Name of the Lord, and by the Spirit of our God! Hallelujah!

Recognise the new you and live accordingly. Study the Word more, for it mirrors and describes the real you; it shows your true glory in Christ. Praise God!
