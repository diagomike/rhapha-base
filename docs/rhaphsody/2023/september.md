## BUILD YOURSELF AND BUILD OTHERS September 1st, 2023

***Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine (***[***2 Timothy 4:2***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:2&version=kjv)***).***

The Apostle Paul, writing to Timothy, said, *“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth”* ([2 Timothy 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:15&version=kjv)). Notice that he emphasizes showing yourself approved, not unto men, but unto God. This means you’re to present yourself to God as one who’s ready and trained for the work of the ministry, soul winning, and discipleship.

There’re those who only study the Scriptures to preach; yes, this will benefit others because it’s the Word, but it's crucial that you consciously build yourself with the Word; allow the Word to work within you first! Merely being a conduit for the Word isn’t enough; how about your personal growth? You have to build your spirit with the Word.

Building yourself involves allowing the Word to mould and shape your character, allowing the Word to build your person and frame the way you think and live. The Word of God must determine your priorities and interests and regulate every area of your life.

In [Romans 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:2&version=kjv), the Word shows you how to cultivate the right thoughts and experience continuous transformation: *“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”*

By studying and meditating on the Word, you establish proper priorities and align your interests with godly principles. The concluding part of [2 Timothy 2:15 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:15&version=AMPC) talks about *“…rightly handling and skillfully teaching the Word of Truth."*

The Bible instructs that the servant of the Lord must be apt to teach ([2 Timothy 2:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:24&version=kjv)). So, most definitely, you have the responsibility to teach and build others, but it begins with you. Build and edify yourself with the Word of God, and also build and edify others.

## HONOUR SPIRITUAL AUTHORITY September 2nd, 2023
![September 2nd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-2-honour-spiritual-authority-sept-23.jpg)

 >***He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm (Psalm 105:14-15).***
---
***He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes; Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm (***[***Psalm 105:14\-15***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20105:14-15&version=kjv)***).***

In [Numbers 12:1\-16,](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2012:1-16&version=kjv) the Bible tells us how Aaron and Miriam spoke against Moses because of his Cushite wife. They questioned Moses' authority and claimed that God could also speak through them. God heard their words and called them, along with Moses, to the Tabernacle. 

There, He appeared to them in a pillar of cloud and rebuked Aaron and Miriam, affirming Moses' unique position as His servant. He declared that, unlike the other prophets that He spoke to through visions and dreams, He spoke to Moses face to face, revealing His glory, and He queried Aaron and Miriam who’d dared to speak against His chosen servant.

Here’s what I want you to notice as a consequence of their error; the Bible says, *“…the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; **and he departed**”* ([Numbers 12:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2012:9&version=kjv)). He gets angry and what does He do? He “walks away!” But here’s the thing: when the presence of God leaves like that, trouble comes.

There are many people who don't realize this is what happens to them when they get unruly, create insurrection, become disobedient and dishonour authority in the house of God. They don't even know when the presence of God leaves.

It also brings to mind the story of Samson. The Lord was always with him until he disobeyed. When the enemy came, Samson woke up thinking, *"…I'll get loose and go free, as always." He did not know that the LORD had left him”* ([Judges 16:20 GNT](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%2016:20&version=GNT)). The Spirit of God didn't come on him as He used to, and the enemies got a hold of him and took out his eyes.

It’s important to honour the Lord always, follow His Word and His ways, and never dishonour spiritual authority as Aaron and Miriam did. Don’t speak against God’s ministers; don’t judge them. Remember what the Bible says: *“Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand”* ([Romans 14:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:4&version=kjv)). Hallelujah!

## THE OUTWORKING OF LOVE September 3rd, 2023
![September 3rd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-3-the-outworking-of-love-sept-23.jpg)

>***Love does no harm to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law (***[***Romans 13:10 NIV***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2013:10&version=NIV)***).***

It makes no difference how others mistreat you; there’s only one way God expects you to respond: in love! The bad behaviour or attitude of others should never get you to be vengeful or resentful.

Even when you feel that your kindness is being taken advantage of, maintain who you are; remain loving, tender\-hearted and forgiving. The only way to truly win is through the power of love. The outworking of love in your life is what elevates you.

The quality of your personality is measured by the outflow of God’s love from you. Before God, love is the ultimate measurement of everything. So walk in love without compromise; be the manifestation of God’s love.

Your nature as a child of God is the nature of love; you’re programmed to love. Speak the love language and sow seeds of love. The Bible says for us to be imitators of God in our love\-walk: *“Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet\-smelling aroma”* ([Ephesians 5:1\-2 NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:1-2&version=NKJV)).

God is love ([1 John 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:8&version=kjv)). Therefore, the outworking of God in your life is synonymous with the outworking of love. If the love of God remains unseen in your life, then God is also unseen. So, always, let the Father’s love guide your thoughts, actions and interactions with others.

I walk in love and respond always with love. The love of God governs my thoughts, actions and responses. I continually experience the fulfilment and blessings that come from walking in love and living in alignment with God’s truths. Amen.

## CONTENDING FOR LOST SOULS September 4th, 2023
![September 4th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-4-contending-for-lost-souls-sept-23.jpg)

 >***But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them (2 Corinthians 4:3-4 NKJV).***

***But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them (***[***2 Corinthians 4:3\-4 NKJV***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:3-4&version=NKJV)***).***

When it comes to winning souls, we must recognize that we are engaged in a “fight.” The Apostle Paul calls it the good fight of faith, because there're evil and desperately wicked spirits that seek to keep people away from experiencing salvation.

If the sinners don't receive the Gospel, it's not because our gospel is difficult or obscure; it's because Satan has blinded their minds. That’s what we read in our opening verse. Satan is actively working to obstruct their understanding and reception of the truth; that’s why we must intercede for them.

Soul winning is more than just telling someone about Christ; there’s also the fight we fight in prayers. Even when they hear and accept our message, Satan still tries to hinder their growth and progress in Christ, attempting to impede their journey of spiritual maturity. What are we supposed to do? Fight! We contend for their souls in prayer.

It brings to mind what Paul said in [Galatians 4:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%204:19&version=kjv), *“My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.”* This is soul\-travail! You pray passionately that every resistance to their spiritual growth and progress is broken; and that their desire for the things of the Spirit is sustained in them as they grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Have these in mind as you go forth preaching the Gospel everywhere. Always pray that those with whom you share the message will receive it with faith, and that Satan’s bondage and deception are destroyed. Amen.

Dear Father, I am grateful you entrusted me with the sacred task of sharing the message of eternal life with those around me and in distant lands.

I declare that this light dismantles the chains of religious bondage and dispels darkness, bringing forth freedom and salvation, in Jesus' Name. Amen.

## KEEP SATAN IN CHECK September 5th, 2023
![September 5th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-5-keep-satan-in-check-sept-23.jpg)

 >***So be subject to God. Resist the devil [stand firm against him], and he will flee from you (James 4:7 AMPC).***
---
***So be subject to God. Resist the devil \[stand firm against him], and he will flee from you (***[***James 4:7 AMPC***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:7&version=AMPC)***).***

Our opening scripture implies that you have a responsibility to keep Satan in check, to restrain him from carrying out his manoeuvres, manipulations and destructive acts of wickedness. The Bible describes him as a liar, the father of lies, and the originator of deception.

Jesus said in [John 8:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:44&version=kjv), *“…He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”* That’s his role: he’s a killer.

Satan doesn’t seek friendship but rather aims to kill. Deception and destruction are among the many works attributed to him. He is referred to as the evil one and the wicked one, meaning that all his works are evil. These descriptions clearly demonstrate that we can’t give him a chance.

Thank God we have the ability to take action against him! In [Mark 16:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17&version=kjv), the Lord Jesus said, *“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils….”* So we must cast him out of our nations, cities, streets, homes and our environments. Otherwise, he will keep doing things that are inherent to his nature: evil, wickedness, killings, and deception.

God didn't say, “…resist the devil and he might flee,” no! When you resist the devil, James, by the Spirit, tells us the result: he’ll run away from you in terror. When you see the works of Satan in your city, in your country, in your family or anywhere—do what the Word says: resist him by affirming the Word of God, and on certain occasions, cast him out.

<details>
  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
In the Name of the Lord Jesus, I resist the devil's influence in my life, in my family, city, and nation. Through the Word and by the Spirit, I discern and identify the works of the devil and stop him in his tracks from manipulating, deceiving and misleading the nations, the leaders and the people. Amen.

## MORE THAN A "MASTERPIECE" September 6th, 2023
![September 6th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-6-more-than-a-masterpiece-sept-23.jpg)

 >***All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works (2 Timothy 3:16-17).***
---
***All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works (***[***2 Timothy 3:16\-17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:16-17&version=kjv)***).***

There're those who even though revere the Bible, merely think of it as a magnum opus. By this, they mean that the Bible is a great work or masterpiece, as it were, one of the most significant or renowned piece of work in any field, often used to describe a literary, artistic, or musical work of exceptional quality or significance.

But all such nice descriptions still fall short of what the Bible is and represents. First, the Bible is Spirit inspired: *"Every Scripture is God\-breathed (given by His inspiration) …”* ([2 Timothy 3:16 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:16&version=AMPC)). Thus, the Bible is a revelation; a compilation of the out\-breathings of God; it’s God’s revelation given in words.

When we read the Bible, from the Old Testament into the New Testament, we’re reading God's message, or what God said—His testimony. Of course, the Bible also contains what others said, such as angels, humans, demons, and even Satan. Even what an animal (a donkey) said is recorded for us in [Numbers 22:28\-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2022:28-30&version=kjv). But still, the Bible is God's testimony that they all said what they said.

Therefore, much more than a magnum opus, the Bible is God’s document of truth, and it’s trustworthy and dependable. Let your faith in it be unshakeable.

## THE DEPTH OF HIS LOVE September 7th, 2023
![September 7th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-7-the-depth-of-his-love-sept-23.jpg)

 >***O GIVE thanks to the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever (Psalm 136:1 AMPC).***
---
***O GIVE thanks to the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy and loving\-kindness endure forever (***[***Psalm 136:1 AMPC***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20136:1&version=AMPC)***).***

Our heavenly Father is so gracious and kind. The depth of His love is infinite, absolutely unsearchable. The Bible says while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us ([Romans 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:8&version=kjv)). His love is for everybody, including the worst criminals; no one is too evil or wicked for Him to love.

No wonder the Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, had to pray for the Church to be able to grasp—empowered to discover—the great magnitude of the boundless and amazing love of the Father. How deeply intimate, far\-reaching, enduring and inclusive His love is; endless love beyond measurement that transcends our understanding ([Ephesians 3:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:18&version=kjv)).

Think about a man like King Nebuchadnezzar, for example; many only remember him as a devilish figure or an evil ruler because of what we read of him in [2 Kings 24:11\-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%2024:11-16&version=kjv). But not many observe God’s enduring love and mercy for him after he repented, and the incredible authority God granted him over the nations as revealed in Daniel chapter 4\.

After he had lived like a beast of the field for seven years, God, in His love and mercy, returned Him to the palace, and everyone received him. God preserved the throne for him. Read of his beautiful testimony in [Daniel 4:34\-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%204:34-36&version=kjv).

Another astonishing example is that of Manasseh. Manasseh's reign was marked by wickedness and rebellion against God. But when he repented of his sins, God showed him mercy. Then we come to King Ahab; the Bible says he did evil in the sight of God above all the other kings before him.

Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him ([1 Kings 16:30\-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2016:30-33&version=kjv)). But as soon as Ahab repented, God spoke to Elijah, saying, *"Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days…"* ([1 Kings 21:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2021:29&version=kjv)).

Sometimes, when we think about people who have committed grave wrongs, we wonder why God tolerated them. It’s the depth of His love. He’s full of compassion. If God would show such grace to Nebuchadnezzar, Ahab and Manasseh, I don't see anyone in this world whom He wouldn’t love. God didn’t send Jesus to die for us because we were living right; He did it while we were yet sinners ([Romans 5:8\-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:8-9&version=kjv)).

## SAVIOURS AND CHAMPIONS September 8th, 2023
![September 8th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-8-saviours-and-champions-sept-23.jpg)

 >***And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S (Obadiah 1:21).***
---
***And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD'S (***[***Obadiah 1:21***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Obadiah%201:21&version=kjv)***).***

In Nehemiah 9, the prophet Nehemiah speaks of how God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, led them to the Promised Land and blessed them abundantly. They took strong cities, possessed fruitful lands and enjoyed God's goodness.

However, the Bible says, *“Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations”* ([Nehemiah 9:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah%209:26&version=kjv)). As a result, God delivered them into the hands of their enemies.

But here's the beautiful part: In their time of trouble, when they cried out to God, He heard them from heaven. Out of His manifold mercies, He sent them saviours who rescued them from the hand of their adversaries. It's amazing to see how God responded with grace and deliverance even after their disobedience—sending them saviours.

It also brings to mind the story of Joseph. [Genesis 45:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2045:7&version=kjv) recounts how Joseph revealed himself to his brothers after they had sold him into slavery. Despite the years of separation and the hardships he endured, Joseph recognized that God had sent him ahead to Egypt to preserve his family's posterity and save their lives through a great deliverance.

The foregoing mirrors what the Church is in the earth today. God has entrusted the Church with the responsibility to run His Kingdom, His reign of righteousness in the earth. We, the Church, are the posterity of faith just as Joseph preserved his family's posterity.

We’re preservers of the earth. No wonder the Lord Jesus said we are the light of the world and the salt of the earth. Through us, the nations of the earth are blessed, because we’re the seed of Abraham. We’re the hope of the world, saviours and champions from Zion, empowered to bring people out of darkness into the glorious light of their inheritance in Christ. Hallelujah!

## IT’S THE RESULT OF HIS LOVE September 9th, 2023
![September 9th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-9-its-the-result-of-his-love-sept-23.png)

>***What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him (***[***Psalm 8:4***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%208:4&version=kjv)***).***

When you ponder on the words of the Psalmist in our opening scripture, you’ll come to one amazing conclusion: God loves man. The Psalmist was awed at God’s consummate and everlasting love for man. 

How do you even begin to comprehend it; that the great God of glory, the Monarch of the universe, the maker of heaven and earth, would, not just “visit” man, but make man His dwelling place? It’s such an amazing reality. The Bible says the Angels are still looking into it; they’re unable to figure it out.

But it’s God’s love for us that made it possible. [1 John 3:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:1&version=kjv) says, *“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God....”* Then in [Colossians 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv), it says, *“To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”*

God Himself has tabernacled in us so that we are no longer ordinary beings but divine beings. Now we are full of God. That was God’s plan from the foundation of the world. That was the mystery, which was hidden for ages and from generations, which has now been made manifest to the saints. Hallelujah!

The fact that this was God’s plan and will for us is further revealed in [Ephesians 3:17\-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:17-19&version=kjv). It says, *“That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.”* Blessed be God! Think about that! It’s all the result of His love for us to be filled with all the fullness of God as Jesus was filled with the fullness of God. How He loves us!

## YOU ARE THE LIGHT: PERSONALIZE IT September 10th, 2023
![September 10th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-10-you-are-the-light-personalize-it-sept-23.jpg)

 >***While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them (John 12:36).***

***While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them (***[***John 12:36***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2012:36&version=kjv)***).***

Remember the words of Jesus in [Matthew 5:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14&version=kjv): "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid." The world is in darkness, but you’re the light of the world. In [John 8:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:12&version=kjv), Jesus said, *"...I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."*

He also said in [John 9:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%209:5&version=kjv), *"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."* Remember Jesus has ascended to heaven; therefore, we’re now the light of the world because we live in His stead; He lives in us and reigns through us.

[1 Thessalonians 5:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:5&version=kjv) says, *"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."* Being children of light means we’re light. You might say, “Pastor Chris, isn't that a conjecture?” Read Paul’s beautiful revelation in [Ephesians 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:8&version=kjv); it says, *"For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light."*

Notice that it says we used to be darkness, but now we are light in the Lord. Blessed be God. As long as you’re in this world, you’re the light of the world. This should be your declaration! As long as you're in that family, that school, town, community, city, or that region, you are the light! You have to personalize it.

## LEARN TO TALK TO THE HOLY SPIRIT September 11th, 2023
![September 11th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-11-learn-to-talk-to-the-holy-spirit-sept-23.jpg)

 >***The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen (2 Corinthians 13:14).***

***The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen (***[***2 Corinthians 13:14***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013:14&version=kjv)***).***

Many of us are familiar with praying to God the Father, and talking to the Lord Jesus Christ all the time. It’s also essential for us to recognize the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, and commune with Him often and about everything. Talk to Him every day. I talk to the Holy Spirit more than I talk to any human person. Practise it.

In the same way you’ve been talking to the Father and the Lord Jesus, consciously talk to the Holy Spirit. Address Him with recognition and reverence. Remember, He’s the conveyor of the presence and blessings of God; He’s the One who manifests God’s presence and His power wherever God wants it.

Think about the fact that this awesome infinite personality of the Godhead lives in you and wants to communicate with you always. Interestingly, although His name is not "Holy Spirit," He understands that you're referring to Him or addressing Him because that's how the Scripture refers to Him. It's also amazing to realize that every time you talk to the Lord Jesus or pray to the Father, it's the Holy Spirit who acts in response.

So, while He responds to the Name of Jesus and fulfils the petitions you make of the Father, recognize and commune with Him as the doer of the work! Notice again what [2 Corinthians 13:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013:14&version=kjv) says, *“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.”* Who do we have the communion with? The Holy Spirit!

While our legal fellowship is established through the Lord Jesus Christ, we are called to cultivate a vital relationship with the Holy Spirit. Talk to Him often. If you've been doing it, keep at it and encourage yourself in it. You’ll be amazed at how transcendent, impactful and excellent your life will be. Through His guidance, you’ll find your life propelled from glory to glory. Hallelujah!

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Holy Spirit, thank you for dwelling in me, and for the privilege of such a great union and fellowship with you.

## A CUE FROM ESTHER September 12th, 2023
![September 12th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-12-a-cue-from-esther-sept-23.jpg)

 >***Go and get all the Jews living in Susa together. Fast for me. Don't eat or drink for three days, either day or night. I and my maids will fast with you. If you will do this, I'll go to the king, even though it's forbidden. If I die, I die (Esther 4:16 MSG).***

***Go and get all the Jews living in Susa together. Fast for me. Don't eat or drink for three days, either day or night. I and my maids will fast with you. If you will do this, I'll go to the king, even though it's forbidden. If I die, I die (***[***Esther 4:16 MSG***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Esther%204:16&version=MSG)***).***

In the 4th chapter of the book of Esther, we read how Esther had become queen, enjoying a wonderful life in the palace. However, she was unaware of a decree issued by Haman—a prominent but wicked figure who held a high position in King Ahasuerus’s cabinet. Haman’s plan was to exterminate the Jews, including Esther herself.

Esther's perspective changed when her uncle, Mordecai, sent her a message to convey the dire nature of the situation. He warned her not to be complacent as she herself, despite being queen, wouldn’t be spared should Haman execute his wicked plan.

Here was Mordecai’s thought\-provoking question to Esther, *“…and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?”* ([Esther 4:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Esther%204:14&version=kjv)). Perhaps, Esther had been divinely positioned in the palace to make a difference at that critical moment. She decided to take advantage of it and do something that’ll save her people.

She decided to go before the king to intercede for her people even though it was against the law and carried the risk of death. I love her resolve; she said, “…if I perish, I perish.” In other words, “I’m going ahead with this, even if it’s going to cost me my life.” That was the moment she won!

There comes a pivotal moment when you must make crucial decisions about the Gospel and your role in it, just like Esther. Until you learn to make such decisions, fear may keep you in bondage. It’s in those moments that fear must not hold you back.

Irrespective of the daunting challenges and the imminent perils or danger, stand your ground on the truth of God’s Word. Recognize and take advantage of God’s grace in you to win for others. Have the courage to act on the truth. Make bold choices, and be willing to face anything in pursuit of what is right. Hallelujah!

## LEVERAGE ON HERITAGE September 13th, 2023
![September 13th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-13-leverage-on-heritage-sept-23.jpg)

 >***…I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold (Acts 7:32)***

***…I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold (***[***Acts 7:32***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207:32&version=kjv)***)***

Though the Word of God teaches us about greatness, being greater than another should never be your dream. You can desire to advance or surpass previous generations in your exploits, but don’t make it about greatness. Leverage on heritage.

For example, the children of Israel could never imagine or pray to be greater than Abraham, Isaac or Jacob; their greatness was dependent on the greatness of these patriarchs. Jacob couldn't have imagined being greater than Isaac; he recognized that his blessing came from being Isaac's son.

Likewise, Isaac honoured Abraham as his father, knowing that his own greatness stemmed from being the son of Abraham. In [Exodus 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203:15&version=kjv), the Bible says, *“And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.”*The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob became His memorial forever.

The Lord Jesus is another example. God had promised David that his throne would be established forever ([2 Samuel 7:12\-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%207:12-13&version=kjv)). Read how Jesus was identified in [Matthew 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%201:1&version=kjv): *“The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.”*

So, even if you’ve achieved higher educational success than your biological father, for example, remember that his role in bringing you into existence makes him greater than you. As great as you are, you’re his product, you came from him, so that makes him greater than you for you to honour him the way God wants you to.

Recognizing this principle is vital. It’s one of the reasons we have great honour for those whom God sent before us in ministry, because without them, we wouldn't have what we have today. Through them, the Scriptures have been preserved through the ages; they diligently protected and passed down these precious teachings—the Scriptures that guide our lives. So, we remain grateful for what was done for us, leveraging on our heritage.

## YOUR LEGAL AUTHORITY TO USE HIS NAME September 14th, 2023

>***And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils… (***[***Mark 16:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17&version=kjv)***).***

In the days of Jesus, exorcism wasn’t a new thing as the Jews knew that demons were responsible for some afflictions. Jesus referred to it in some portions of the gospels; so, it was already in existence in His day. For example, in [Matthew 12:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:27&version=kjv), Jesus asked, “And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.”

But the people noticed something unique about the way Jesus ministered and cast out demons; He only spoke words and the demons were cast out. He exercised authority that others marvelled at. No wonder they wanted to know who He was, and why He was so different. [Luke 4:36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%204:36&version=kjv) says, *“And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.”*

Today, He has given us the power of attorney to use His Name, the legal authority to act in His stead. Thus, you can cast out devils using the Name of Jesus. The Bible says, *“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils…”* ([Mark 16:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17&version=kjv)).

Notice the three\-word phrase: “In my name”; it means you can use the Name of Jesus and be heard. So, when He says “in my name, they shall cast out devils,” it means that in dealing with Satan and his demons, no need for fruitless arguments; cast them out! In His Name, you can frustrate the influence and manipulations of Satan in your family, workplace, city, and country.

No demon can resist or stand against the Name of Jesus. [Philippians 2:9\-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:9-11&version=kjv) says, “*Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”*

## BE MINDFUL OF SATAN'S MANIPULATIONS September 15th, 2023
![September 15th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-15-be-mindful-of-his-manipulations-sept-23.jpg)

>***Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices (***[***2 Corinthians 2:11***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%202:11&version=kjv)***).***

In a crucial moment when Jesus spoke about His impending death, Peter, one of the foremost disciples, took Jesus aside, objected and rebuked Him, saying, *"...Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee"* ([Matthew 16:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:22&version=kjv)). The Lord’s response was swift and clear. He turned to Peter and said, *"...Get thee  behind me, Satan…"* ([Matthew 16:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:23&version=kjv)).

The Lord Jesus recognized that it was Satan speaking through Peter. But here’s something I’d like you to notice. In addressing Peter, Jesus didn’t look into the air as though the devil was somewhere around speaking through Peter. He knew where the devil was; he was right in Peter.

Now, here’s where a lot of people miss it. They say, “Can you imagine; Peter was once demon\-possessed”; no! Peter was not demon\-possessed, but the words he spoke were influenced by Satan. When people accept Satan’s words, they receive of him to themselves. This doesn’t imply that they’re now demon\-possessed.

Demon possession occurs when an individual is completely overtaken by that spirit, in which case he can’t free himself, as he’s compelled to do only what that evil spirit dictates.

Another example similar to Peter’s case is seen where Satan moved David to number Israel, as recorded in the Old Testament ([1 Chronicles 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%2021&version=kjv), [2 Samuel 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2024&version=kjv)). David, a righteous man, was unaware that he had been swayed by Satan's prompting. Similarly, Peter too was unaware that Satan was operating through him.

O, how important it is to learn to follow the Holy Spirit in the Word, by the Word, and through the Word! It’s part of the reasons we pray and intercede for people, especially leaders, that they’ll always have the will, desire and boldness to do what is right, be led by the Holy Spirit, and never be in conflict with the Scriptures.

Therefore, in line with the Scriptures, always make intercessions and giving of thanks for all men, for kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty ([1 Timothy 2:1\-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:1-2&version=kjv)).

## TRUST IN THE LORD September 16th, 2023
![September 16th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-16-trust-in-the-lord-sept-23.jpg)

 >***Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths (Proverbs 3:5-6).***

***Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths (***[***Proverbs 3:5\-6***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%203:5-6&version=kjv)***).***

Society is built on trust; we have to trust its systems and structures; we have to trust the seeming goodness of the human person, but we cannot do it blindly. 

The courts, for instance, are sometimes corrupt, yet we still have to rely on them for their judicial authority to hear and resolve disputes in civil, criminal or other cases. It’s the same with the police or civil service; we still have to somehow trust them in spite of these inadequacies. 

How about the educational system? It’s an important institution where you entrust your children's education and well\-being. You take your little kids to school, leave them there even though you have heard time and time again that children have been abused by officials and so on; still, you have to trust.

That's why there are those who take advantage of this trust that has been bequeathed to them; they manipulate the system and continually erode the trust in our society. However, the Bible warns us not to put our trust in earthly leaders; instead, we’re encouraged to trust in the Lord.

[Proverbs 3:5\-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%203:5-6&version=kjv) says, *"Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths."* If the society we live in has become so degenerate, squalid and polluted, that leaves you no choice than to trust only in the Lord, Christ.

However, trust, just like faith, must be directed to the Word of God. It must be based on God's Word. How important it is to put the Word into you especially in these days in which we live. Irrespective of the incongruities, depravities, decadences, and immoralities in today’s society, put your trust in the Lord and His unfailing Word.

The Bible warns us not to put our trust in earthly leaders; instead, we’re encouraged to trust in the Lord. However, trust, just like faith, must be based on God's Word. How important it is to put the Word into you especially in these days in which we live.

## GOD’S AWESOME GIFT TO ALL September 17th, 2023
![September 17th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-17-gods-awesome-gift-to-all-sept-23.jpg)

 >***And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh... (Acts 2:17).***

***And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh... (***[***Acts 2:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:17&version=kjv)***).***

Did you know that the Holy Spirit is God’s glorious, gracious, awesome gift and blessing not just to us Christians but to the whole world? The blessing of the Spirit was to be poured upon all flesh. No one in the world could believe in Jesus Christ without the conviction of the Holy Spirit. It’s the Holy Spirit who opens the hearts of men to the Gospel that we preach, as He did with Lydia in [Acts 16:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016:14&version=kjv).

[1 Corinthians 2:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:12&version=kjv) says, *“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.”* Through Him, we know the blessings that are freely given to us by God and enjoy them. He sees to it that we walk in the reality of our divine heritage and heavenly blessings.

It also takes the Holy Spirit to give you the understanding of God’s Word: *“Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth…”* ([John 16:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13&version=kjv)). He unveils the mysteries and secrets of the Kingdom to you and sees to it that you’re not deceived, but are walking in truth.

It takes the Holy Spirit for you to know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. There’s no way human reasoning can figure out the divinity of Jesus. It takes the Holy Spirit to help you understand and accept the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, His sacrificial death, His triumphant resurrection, and His glorious ascension.

Only the Holy Spirit can convince you that the blood of Jesus Christ was adequate for our salvation. Without the Holy Spirit, there’s no way we could have ever known and be able to walk in the reality of that truth. There’re no human parameters for deciphering such realities. So when you accept these truths about Christ and the Gospel, understand that the Holy Spirit has ministered to you. Hallelujah!

Become more conscious of the impact, blessing and glory of having the Holy Spirit live in you. He’s one of the extraordinary cardinal gifts and blessings of God to us. Recognize and encourage His ministry in your life and you’ll walk in dominion and victory always.

## THE HOLY SPIRIT DOES THE WORK September 18th, 2023
![September 18th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-18-the-holy-spirit-does-the-work-sept-23.jpg)

 >***Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works (John 14:10).***
---
***Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works (***[***John 14:10***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:10&version=kjv)***).***

The Lord Jesus, in the verse above, referred to the Holy Spirit as the Father that dwells in Him. He’s the “doer” of the works. Yes, we don’t see the Holy Spirit, and we can’t touch or relate with Him through our senses, but His presence, impact and ministry in, through and for us is so real and profound.

The Holy Spirit is God; the Holy Spirit is the voice of God. The Holy Spirit is the extension of God. Sometimes, even when He ministers to us, we don’t realize He’s the one. For example, in [Matthew 16:13\-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:13-17&version=kjv) when Jesus asked His disciples, “Whom do men say that I am?” In answering, they weren’t sure; but Peter said, “You’re the Christ, the son of the living God.”

The Lord’s response to Peter was, “Simon, flesh and blood didn’t reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.” It takes a revelation to know who Jesus is, and that revelation is granted by God. Peter didn’t know it was a knowledge from God that was granted him.

The Gospel we’re commissioned to take to the nations of the world is something that can’t be humanly devised, accepted, and understood. There’s no way for an ordinary man to accept it. The Bible says, *“For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God”* ([1 Corinthians 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:18&version=kjv)).

We need help from the ministry of the Holy Spirit for others to accept the Gospel just as we had to be helped to accept it. [Psalm 127:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20127:1&version=kjv) says, “*Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it...."* We all must be conscious of this as soul winners.

If you’re trying to build the Church of God without the Holy Spirit, it’s not going to work. He’s the Lord of the harvest. He does the work. Read the inspiring and life\-transforming words of the Lord Jesus in [John 16:7\-8 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:7-8&version=AMPC): *“However, I am telling you nothing but the truth when I say it is profitable (good, expedient, advantageous) for you that I go away. Because if I do not go away, the Comforter (Counselor, **Helper**, Advocate, Intercessor, Strengthener, Standby) will not come to you…And when He comes, He will convict and convince the world and bring demonstration to it about sin and about righteousness (uprightness of heart and right standing with God) and about judgment.”* Hallelujah!

## AN EXCELLENT CHARACTER September 19th, 2023
![September 19th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-19-an-excellent-character-sept-23.jpg)

 >***Moral character makes for smooth traveling; an evil life is a hard life. Good character is the best insurance; crooks get trapped in their sinful lust (Proverbs 11:5-6 MSG).***

***Moral character makes for smooth traveling; an evil life is a hard life. Good character is the best insurance; crooks get trapped in their sinful lust (***[***Proverbs 11:5\-6 MSG***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2011:5-6&version=MSG)***).***

In Genesis 49, the Bible gives us insight into Jacob's final words to his sons. In addressing his firstborn, Reuben, Jacob acknowledged the immense potential he possessed. He described him as his firstborn, his might, the beginning of his manly strength and vigour, and emphasized that his birthright gave him the pre\-eminence in dignity and power.

However, Jacob highlighted Reuben's character flaw and how it ruined his future: *“Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch”* ([Genesis 49:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2049:4&version=kjv)).

Despite the promises and blessings associated with being the firstborn, and the encomiums of being Jacob’s strength, the strongest of all his sons, Reuben would not attain the greatness he could have achieved.

Your character as a person is very important. It doesn't matter the prophecies that may have been spoken over your life and who gave them; your character can ruin prophecy, and ultimately, your life, just as Reuben’s character ruined his life.

God's desire is for the prophecies spoken over your life to come to pass. He wants His good word concerning you to be fulfilled just as He has said. Your role is to recognize His lordship and behave correctly, walking in His righteousness.

How important it is to walk faithfully in alignment with God’s will, in His light, and have an excellent character. Now you can better understand the import of the Spirit’s prayer through Paul in [Ephesians 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:16&version=kjv) for you to be strengthened with excellence by the Holy Spirit in your inner man. Hallelujah!

## IT’S A LIFE OF JOY September 20th, 2023
![September 20th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-20-its-a-life-of-joy-sept-23.jpg)

 >***Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory (1 Peter 1:8).***

***Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory (***[***1 Peter 1:8***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:8&version=kjv)***).***

Our spirit\-filled life is one of indescribable joy, irrespective of circumstances. The Word declares, “The kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit” ([Romans 14:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:17&version=kjv)).

It’s one of the reasons God tells us to be constantly filled with the Spirit: *“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit”* ([Ephesians 5:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:18&version=kjv)). Imagine if every member of the church is filled with the Spirit, and not with doubt and fear. Then you’d understand what true Christianity is; it’s a life of joy.

Imagine everyone coming into the church meetings singing and praising God with joy and carrying that same atmosphere everywhere. That’s how it ought to be. When you’re filled with the Spirit, your joy overflows.

The Bible says the joy of the Lord is your strength (Nehemiah 8:10\). Your spirit will continually be energized for victory and success when you’re full of joy. Joy is an elixir. Moreover, the Bible says in [Isaiah 12:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2012:3&version=kjv), *“Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.”*

So, in spite of the things happening in the world today, be full of joy every day, and express it in the liberty of the spirit.

## UNDERSTAND THE ESSENCE OF PRAYER September 21st, 2023
![September 21st, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-21-understand-the-essence-of-prayer-sept-23.jpg)

 >***And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints (Ephesians 6:18 NIV).***
---
***And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints (***[***Ephesians 6:18 NIV***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:18&version=NIV)***).***

For some people, prayer is a mere ritual or religious ceremony. For example, the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Scribes in Bible days were given to the religiosity of prayer but not to its true essence and significance. But it wasn’t so with the Patriarchs of faith like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; they understood the importance and power of prayer as effective communication with God. 

The Lord Jesus also demonstrated the power of prayer with amazing results. His disciples noticed this and asked Him to teach them how to pray effectively; they desired to pray in a way that God would hear and answer them. They wanted a genuine connection with God, where their prayers would have a meaningful impact, and that became their experience.

As you study the Book of Acts, and particularly the Epistles, you’d observe valuable insights and practical guidance on how to pray effectively. The apostles followed in the footsteps of Jesus and they too experienced remarkable results and passed this valuable knowledge to the Church.

So, we understand that prayer is God’s idea. He wants us to pray because He wants to answer. Prayer gives Him the right to intervene in the affairs of men and establish His will in the earth. Therefore, we pray with the understanding that our prayers make tremendous power available, dynamic in its working ([James 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205:16&version=kjv)).

We have books on prayer that’ll help your understanding of the subject; order or download these books from the Rhapsody app store.

## YOUR WORDS AND YOU September 22nd, 2023
![September 22nd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-22-your-words-and-you-sept-23.png)

>***For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned (***[***Matthew 12:37***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:37&version=kjv)***).***

As a Christian, you ought to always examine your life, especially with respect to your words, because your words reveal your character. If a man’s words are harsh, bitter and biting, then that’s who he is inside. But if your words are gracious and loving, that’s the character of your personality. Your words reveal you.

[James 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%203:2&version=kjv) says, *“For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.”* Jesus said in [Matthew 12:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:35&version=kjv), *“A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.”*

There’s love, beauty, goodness and excellence in your spirit. So when you speak, it should be out of that abundance. The presence of the Holy Spirit in your life means you’re enabled to let out rivers of blessings from within you, coming forth in words. Your speech is the true measure of your maturity as a Christian.

Read [James 3:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%203:2&version=AMPC) again, this time, from the AMPC: *“…And if anyone does not offend in speech \[never says the wrong things], he is a fully developed character and a perfect man….”* Bring life, health, healing, hope, strength and courage to others through your wholesome words.

## HIS ULTIMATE PURPOSE September 23rd, 2023
![September 23rd, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-23-his-ultimate-purpose-sept-23.jpg)

 >***Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints (Colossians 1:26).***

***Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints (***[***Colossians 1:26***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:26&version=kjv)***).***

The purpose of Jesus' coming to this world was not just to die for our sins. His ultimate purpose was to make us sons of God, so we could have eternal life and be like Him in this world, and in fellowship with God. This is what Satan knows and hates with a passion!

The Apostle John wrote, *“And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life”* ([1 John 5:11\-13 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:11-13&version=NIV)).

Now that you’re born again, you have the life and nature of God in you. This is the essence of Christianity according to the Bible; it is Christ alive in you! [Colossians 1:26\-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:26-27&version=kjv) says, *“Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”*

O, how He wants the whole world to know that they don’t have to live the ordinary human life that’s depraved and mortal! Remember that Jesus died for everyone in the world, and thus the God\-life is available to all. Today, anyone who believes in Jesus Christ and confesses His lordship, receives this God\-life and is brought into oneness with God. This was Christ’s ultimate purpose.

## CHRIST AND HIS CHURCH September 24th, 2023
![September 24th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-24-christ-and-his-church-sept-23.jpg)

 >***And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all (Ephesians 1:22-23).***

***And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all (***[***Ephesians 1:22\-23***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22-23&version=kjv)***).***

Christ and the Church are one. He is the head and we, the Church, are His body. We’re inextricably one with Him. In [Acts 9:3\-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:3-5&version=kjv), for example, we have a clear reference of the union of Christ and the Church in the dialogue between the Lord and Saul of Tarsus, who later became Paul.

That passage reads*, “And as he (Saul) journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks"* ([Acts 9:3\-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:3-5&version=kjv)).

Prior to his conversion, Saul wreaked havoc in the early Church and persecuted Christians everywhere, until he had an encounter with the Lord, who intercepted him and asked, *“...Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me”* ([Acts 9:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:4&version=kjv)). The Lord intimately identifies Himself with the Church. An offence or evil committed against the Church is committed against Jesus. The Lord takes it personal because we’re of the same stock.

He’s the Vine, and we—the Church—are the branches. He’s the head of the Church: *“And he is the head of the body, the church…”* ([Colossians 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:18&version=kjv)). The head and the body have the same name, authority and identity; together we’re called Christ!

We’ve been baptized into the body of Christ. [1 Corinthians 12:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012:27&version=kjv) says, *“Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.”* [1 Corinthians 12:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012:13&version=kjv) says, *“For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body… and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.”* The Church, which is the body, doesn’t answer a name that’s different from that of the head.

This is to help you see who you are, where you are, and what you have; you’re one with Christ. When He was raised from the dead, you were raised up together with Him. Now that He’s seated on the throne, you’re seated together with Him in the place of dominion, glory and authority. Blessed be God!

Christ and the Church are one. He is the head and we, the Church, are His body. We’re inextricably one with Him. When He was raised from the dead, you were raised up together with Him. Now that He’s seated on the throne, you’re seated together with Him in the place of dominion, glory and authority. Blessed be God!

## MAKING DISCIPLES September 25th, 2023
![September 25th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-25-making-disciples-sept-23.jpg)

 >***Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen (Matthew 28:19-20).***

***Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen (***[***Matthew 28:19\-20***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:19-20&version=kjv)***).***

The opening text from the New International Version says, *“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations….”* The Lord Jesus commanded us to make disciples of all nations. A disciple is someone who follows their leader.

So, if someone refuses to “follow” you, then you’re yet to truly make that one a disciple. The Master's vision is for them to become our disciples, accompanying us and emulating our actions in doing the things the Lord asked us to do.

In [1 Corinthians 11:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:1&version=kjv), the Apostle Paul said, *“Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.”* Notice that he didn't say, “I've led you to Christ, so follow Him.” No! He explicitly stated, “Follow me as I follow Christ.” Therefore, when we lead souls to Christ, we must teach them to do what we do and help them cultivate the habit of going to church.

Let them know that church gatherings are mandatory for us as Christians ([Luke 4:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%204:16&version=kjv)). Don’t be satisfied if they only attend special church programs and neglect the actual church services. They must become disciples, and for that to happen, we must lead by example. Remember, the local church is a place of growth, teaching, training and protection. Everyone needs a family; so bring them into the church family.

## LABOURING FERVENTLY IN PRAYERS September 26th, 2023
![September 26th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-26-labouring-fervently-in-prayers-sept-23.jpg)

 >***Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God (Colossians 4:12 NKJV).***
---
***Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God (***[***Colossians 4:12 NKJV***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%204:12&version=NKJV)***).***

The apostle Paul cites Epaphras as one “Always labouring fervently in prayers.” Those two words “labouring fervently” are rendered that way to provide a good understanding of what he actually did and how. Both words are from the same Greek word 'agonizomai'—fight! 

You can read that verse thus, "Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, greets you, always fighting for you in prayers." A question to ask would be, “If Epaphras was fighting for them in prayers, who was he fighting against?” It certainly wasn’t God, as it was God who inspired him to pray in the first place; it’s God who hears and answers prayers. So, certainly, God is not the enemy.

Now, the purpose of his prayer gives us an idea of the enemy. His prayer was for the Christians in Colossae to stand perfect and complete in all the will of God. This must be because there's an enemy, Satan, out there trying to stop them from becoming perfect and complete in the will of God. This he tries to do by hindering or attempting to hinder their Christian growth.

Paul describes these demoniacal forces in [Ephesians 6:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:12&version=kjv) when he said, *“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”* These evil forces are the ones darkening the minds of men, swaying them from the path of God’s truth.

It’s the reason we must fight for them in prayers as Epaphras did. I encourage you to write down names of people who you might have noticed or heard are not walking in the light of God’s Word or have strayed from the faith, and fight for them in prayer. Pray fervently for them every day, and you’d see remarkable results. Hallelujah!

## INCONTROVERTIBLE BENEFITS OF FELLOWSHIP September 27th, 2023
![September 27th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-27-incontrovertible-benefits-of-fellowshipp-sept-23.jpg)

 >***The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen (2 Corinthians 13:14).***

***The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen (***[***2 Corinthians 13:14***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013:14&version=kjv)***).***

The incontrovertible benefits and blessings of fellowship with the Holy Spirit can’t be overemphasized. The Holy Spirit wants to be involved with every part of your life, and you must let Him. He wants your progress, advancement, prosperity, and success to be evident for all to see.

Sometimes, a Christian might experience a period of remarkable growth and progress where things are moving swiftly and smoothly. However, there may be occasions when everything suddenly seems to stall. Despite attempting various strategies and ideas, nothing appears to change.

Such scenarios often arise when one starts neglecting the ministry of the Holy Spirit in their personal lives. When the speed or rate of growth reduces or completely stalls, either in numerical growth, finances, or both, and it becomes evident that the previous approaches that worked for others and yourself are no longer yielding the same results, what should you do?

The best thing to do if you want to come out of that situation and elevate your work to a higher level is to fast and pray with the understanding that you are initiating a change and transition within yourself.

The focus of the fast, therefore, should not be about changing the situation, as that is not the root problem. Rather, the key lies in strengthening your personal fellowship with the Holy Spirit.

Fasting is a way of turning your spirit and mind away from the carnal things of this world in order to focus them on the Spirit; you set your heart and your mind on the Word in study, meditation and prayer.

Remember, the objective of the prayer and fasting is to nurture and develop an intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit. By prioritizing this aspect of your life, you can expect to experience the desired changes and growth in other areas as well.

## PRAY FOR A RECEPTIVE HEART September 28th, 2023
![September 28th, 2023](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-28-pray-for-a-receptive-heart-sept-23.jpg)

 >***Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls (James 1:21).***

***Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls (***[***James 1:21***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:21&version=kjv)***).***

When you share God’s Word with others, no matter what you say, it may not work unless the Holy Spirit ministers to their hearts. You may preach and teach, but if the Spirit of God isn’t ministering to their hearts, it's not going to be effective; that's the reason why prayer is crucial.

When you pray for others in this context, it's not about you, but your hearers, that the Lord will give them a receptive heart, and that the darkness that blinds their hearts be dispelled and the power of evil holding them in bondage is broken.

Remember the words of Paul the apostle: *“And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God”* ([1 Corinthians 2:4\-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:4-5&version=kjv)). As a result, I learnt to pray, saying, “In the Name of the Lord Jesus, you evil spirit of darkness that has blinded and put a mist in the heart of so\-and\-so to stop him from seeing and understanding the Word, I break your influence on his heart and mind.”

When I started doing this, I got amazing results; the Holy Spirit opened their hearts to receive the truths and teachings of the Word of God without distractions. If there was any hardness or resistance prior to meeting them, it would melt away, and in them, a deep hunger and thirst for the spiritual would be awakened. Praise God!

Always pray earnestly for those to whom and with whom you share the Word of God. When you do, the transformative power of the Word that brings conviction, understanding, and a desire for a closer relationship with the Lord will be kindled within their hearts. Amen.

## PRAYING IN TONGUES IS KEY September 29th, 2023

 >***But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit (Jude 1:20 AMPC).***

***But you, beloved, build yourselves up \[founded] on your most holy faith \[make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit (***[***Jude 1:20 AMPC***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201:20&version=AMPC)***).***

If you desire to improve yourself and operate at a new level of spiritual maturity and efficacy, the Scripture tells you what to do: pray in tongues often. This will work for any area in which you desire to make tremendous progress and take giant strides, be it in your health, academics, job, business, or finances.

Even in contending for the souls of men, or interceding for those who have issues understanding the Word, or those who’re dull in the things of the Spirit, praying in tongues is key! When you pray in tongues, the Holy Spirit gives you insights and specific guidance that you need to deal with the situation. You’d be able to discern whether you have said enough or if there is more to be said or done.

Also, in praying in tongues, learn to wait on the Lord, because what you need above all is direction—direction during or after the prayer. Sometimes, you may pray for a long time and experience spiritual changes, but no tangible changes manifest in the physical realm. Why? There may be specific actions or steps to be taken that you haven't accessed or discerned.

The Bible says, *“The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant”* ([Psalm 25:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2025:14&version=kjv)). So, the secret is kept for you. But if you don't access that secret and apply it to the specific situation, the situation may remain unchanged.

If you want to see amazing results and changes in your life and circumstances, speak in other tongues. You’ll also be guided with the wisdom to know you’ve received the answers.

## IT’S A MATTER OF THE HEART September 30th, 2023

>***For neither did his brethren believe in him (***[***John 7:5***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207:5&version=kjv)***).***

In [John 7:3\-4 MSG](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207:3-4&version=MSG), we’re told something quite staggering about the siblings of Jesus: they were sceptical and didn’t believe in Him. They said to Him as they were getting ready to go for the Feast of Tabernacles, *"…Why don't you leave here and go up to the Feast so your disciples can get a good look at the works you do? No one who intends to be publicly known does everything behind the scenes. If you're serious about what you are doing, come out in the open and show the world."*

The 5th verse specifically says, *“His brothers were pushing him like this because they didn't believe in him either”* (MSG). They were aware of the circumstances surrounding His birth, having heard the story from their mother, Mary, and their father, Joseph, who also had received angelic visitations about Jesus’s birth. Yet, they didn’t believe.

That’s because believing is of the heart. And thanks be unto God, the perspective and opinion of the siblings of Jesus changed when they witnessed His miraculous ascension! That was when they believed. It was a most remarkable event!

As they stood with the other disciples, the “Jesus, whom they had known all their lives,” didn't suddenly vanish or disappear; rather, in His glorified physical body, He levitated before their eyes right into heaven. For once, they realized that the one whom they had the privilege of growing up with was truly God.

This incredible event left no room for doubt or speculation in their hearts about His origin. Now, they really understood that the Lord Jesus was truly from above ([John 8:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:23&version=kjv)). If you study the book of Acts, Luke tells us in the very first chapter that His mother and His siblings joined the company of disciples and continued with them in fellowship (read [Acts 1:13\-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:13-14&version=kjv)). Hallelujah!

That’s why, no matter the stories you hear and how many angelic visitations you receive, you still have to make the choice to believe from your heart. It’s a matter of the heart, just as Paul puts it in [Romans 10:10 NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:10&version=NKJV), *"For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."*

True faith stems from the heart. However, the mind must be open to receive the information, and a decision must be made to embrace it. Hallelujah!
