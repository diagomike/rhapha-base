## FORGIVENESS IS IMPERATIVE May 2nd, 2020
![May 2nd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-2-forgiveness-is-imperative-min.jpg)

>***Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven (Matthew 18:21\-22\).***

Forgiving others of their wrong isn’t an option for a child of God. If you ever have an issue with anyone, whether your brothers and sisters in the Lord, or with outsiders, don’t let it go beyond that day. The Bible says, *“...Don’t let the sun go down on your wrath”* (Ephesians 4:26\).

But what if you forgive them and they wrong you again the next day? You’ll have to forgive again. That’s what we read in our opening scripture. Jesus said we’re to forgive others “seventy times seven” times, in response to Peter’s question. That number symbolizes boundlessness. And these things were written for our learning, for our admonition. In essence, Jesus was saying, “Forgive, no matter how many times someone offends you,” because you have enough capacity to forgive.

If Christ Jesus forgave you, why should there be anything too much for you to forgive? The Bible says, *“Put up with each other, and forgive anyone who does you wrong, just as Christ has forgiven you”* (Colossians 3:13 CEV). Someone may say, “I’ll never forgive so\-and\-so, because what he did was so terrible”; no! Not when you’re born again. We have the nature of God to forgive. This is why forgiveness is imperative; it’s not a piece of advice. You must always forgive, and quickly too. Let God’s love in your heart flow through you lavishly.

The love of God is shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit; that love mantles my heart and mind, causing me to see others as God sees them. There’s no one and there’s no wrong I can’t forgive. I have the capacity to absolve others of their faults, and demonstrate the God-nature in me; the nature of love, through my words and actions, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## LIFE IS A RACE May 3rd, 2020
![May 3rd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-3-life-is-a-race.jpg)

 ---

>***Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain (1 Corinthians 9:24\).***

The Amplified Classic Version of the scripture above says, *“Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but \[only] one receives the prize? So run \[your race] that you may lay hold \[of the prize] and make it yours.”* Life is a race, a competition. Thus, in the race of life, you’re to run in such a way as to win the prize. Don’t “run” (live) like it doesn’t matter.

In the 25th verse of 1 Corinthians 9, Paul said, *“And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.”* To be temperate in all things means to exercise self\-control; to play by the rules. In the race of life, you must be careful what you do and how you live, because you’re in the race to win.

If those who compete in Athletics for “a corruptible crown” buffet themselves and run with purpose and definitiveness, how about us whose race is spiritual, and our crown, incorruptible? Always live with the consciousness to obtain the prize from Jesus Christ.

Our walk of faith and in the faith isn’t for nothing. There’s a prize to be won, but there’s a discipline to go through, if you must win. To have a great life, there’s a discipline required; the discipline to do the Word and be yielded to the leading of the Spirit. That’s what guarantees your victory.

## EMPOWERED FOR SOUL WINNING May 4th, 2020
![May 4th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-4-empowered-for-soul-winning.jpg)

>***And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness (Acts 4:31\).***

The only serious evidence that shows anyone has genuinely received the Holy Spirit is soul winning; dynamic evangelism. Everyone who is filled with the Holy Spirit speaks the Word with boldness. The Word enjoins us not only to receive the Holy Spirit, but to be filled with Him continually (Ephesians 5:18 AMPC).

Jesus said, *“...If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink”* (John 7:37\). Having drunk of Him, what should follow? He gave the answer in the very next verse: *“…out of his (your) belly shall flow rivers (gushers) of living water”* (John 7:38\). The evidence that you’ve drunk of the Spirit is the gushers—the fountain of words of life that flow from you to the world.

Read the Bible! The most consistent thing that happened after men were filled with the Holy Spirit in Bible days was that they spoke the Word of God with boldness. When the apostles had prayed and got filled with the Holy Spirit, as read in our theme verse, the result was that they spoke the Word with boldness! Their lives manifested that glory to win souls.

The Holy Spirit came into your life to make you a witness. Jesus said: *“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me…”* (Acts 1:8\). If you’re timid about preaching the Gospel, it means you haven’t recognized the Holy Spirit in your life, because the Spirit grants you boldness to stand up for Jesus Christ.

You can’t have the Holy Spirit and not know how to win souls. All it takes is for you to take the step; decide to speak to someone about Jesus, and as you open your mouth, the Holy Spirit will put words in your mouth that they can’t resist or gainsay. The boldness of the Spirit will be stirred within you. There’s a depth in God you’ll never know until you begin to win souls; therefore, be excited to do it. As you do, you’d enjoy the glory and blessedness of Christianity, beyond what you ever thought possible. Praise God!

## THE HONOUR OF SERVICE IN GOD’S HOUSE May 5th, 2020
![May 5th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-5-the-honour-of-service-in-gods-house.jpg)

>***If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire (1 Corinthians 3:15\).***

To be a leader is a great honour; whether it’s in politics, government, education, it doesn’t matter. To be called a leader of people is always a great honour. However, to be a leader in the house of God is even a far greater honour, because that’s a role that belongs to Christ. It’s about His work. It means some of His work has been given to you.

In Matthew 16:18, Jesus said, *“…I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”* Notice that He didn’t say, “Let us build my Church”; rather, He said, “I will build my Church.” Part of how He builds His Church is through those He’s appointed to lead and teach His people; the leaders of the Church. Every part of the work that we carry out to fulfil His vision is a huge responsibility, because it means He’s carrying it out through us. If that’s the case, we’re only expected to do whatever we do in His Name and according to His will; not our will, because He’s only given us the honour of service in His house. This should let you know the level of appreciation we should have for such recognition in God’s house. Whatever assignment is given to you to carry out in the house of God, hallow it. Relish and cherish it, and do it as unto Christ. Handle it with great care, because at the end of the day, the Bible says we’ll all give account to God for all that we did.

Remember, there’re two major judgements at the end of all things. One of them is the judgement seat of Christ, which will be to receive our rewards and praises from Him; but some will have more honour than others. Some may lose on theirs due to their motives. He doesn’t want us to serve Him out of human ambitions or fleshly desires. He wants us to do His work in love, in humility, in obedience to Him, and to serve His purpose. Serve the Lord gladly with wholehearted devotion, and please Him in all things.

## DIVINE WISDOM VERSUS INTELLIGENCE May 6th, 2020
![May 6th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-6-divine-wisdom-versus-intelligence.jpg)

 ---

>***Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory (1 Corinthians 2:6\-7\).***

There’s a difference between intelligence and wisdom. There’re lots of people who are living by intelligence, and despite their “intelligence,” life defeats them. Intelligence is part of our animal characteristics. Humans are only given the highest intelligence, but when you’re born again, you’re translated from human intelligence to divine wisdom.

Wisdom is what gives you divine interpretations; it gives you insight into reality. For example, in Luke 8:51\-56, a child was sick, and the father invited Jesus. But before Jesus arrived, the child died. So, they informed Him that the child had died, but He went anyway. The Bible says, *“The house was filled with people weeping and wailing….”* Jesus said to them, *“...Stop the weeping! She isn’t dead; she is only asleep”* (Luke 8:52 NLT). That was wisdom talking. But they thought He was insane, because according to their “intelligence” (biological understanding), the little girl was dead; her heart had stopped.

But life is spiritual, and Jesus understood this. He was wisdom personified. Wisdom knew that the child was sleeping. All He said was, “Little girl, get up”; and the Bible says the girl came to life! This is what God is bringing you into: a perfection of His wisdom in you that brings you into alignment with His thoughts and ways of doing things. Then you see as God sees; you understand from His perspective.

The only way you can see how God sees is by using the spectacles of His Word. Suddenly, your thinking process will be elevated; your mindset will be renewed. Even your perception of yourself and your interpretation of life’s circumstances would all change, because of the ministry of divine wisdom in your life.

## HIS THRONE IN YOUR HEART May 7th, 2020
![May 7th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-7-his-throne-in-your-heart.jpg)

 ---

>***Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? (1 Corinthians 3:16\).***

The scripture above is so profound. It shows that the throne of God is in your heart, since He lives in you in His fullness. The same thought is expressed in 2 Corinthians 6:15\-17\. It says, *“…for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people….”* What a blessing this is!

The word translated “temple” is the Greek word, “naos.” It doesn’t refer to the ordinary everyday temple, but to an inner shrine; the shrine that houses the image of the “god”; the inner sanctuary where the image of the god is kept. For the Jews, it was the Holy of Holies; that’s where the presence of God was. They didn’t have an image inside, but the presence of Jehovah was there.

When the Holy Spirit took up His abode in the quarters of your heart, you became that “shrine”; the place of His presence. Think about that! It means you carry heaven in you. When Jesus came to this world, He came with heaven in Him to bless the world with. He brought it in His heart, because the Holy Spirit lived inside Him. He came with the throne of God in His heart. No wonder He was such a blessing to the world!

The same applies to you. You’re much more than a religious person; by reason of the New Birth, you’ve been translated into the Kingdom of God, and now carry His throne in your heart. You’re heaven’s ambassador to this world. In reality, everywhere you go, God goes, because you’re His house. He talks in you, and He looks through your eyes. Therefore preach the Gospel; cast out devils; heal the sick; cleanse the lepers; raise the dead. Bless the world with the grace and glory of heaven that’s in you. Hallelujah!

## SPEAKING YOUR BELIEVING May 8th, 2020
![May 8th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-8-speaking-your-believing.jpg)

 ---

>***We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak (2 Corinthians 4:13\).***

Our opening verse parallels the principle in Romans 10:9\-10; the “believe and affirm” principle. It says, *“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”* In Christianity, we speak our believing. Remember, believing is acting your faith. 

Faith must speak; it doesn’t remain alone; you affirm the Word. Express your faith with your mouth; it’s the instrument with which you chart your course in perfection, prosperity and success. You’re to use the power of words to create and sustain your victorious life.

Our salvation has already been consummated and made available in Christ Jesus, but to catapult yourself into the blessings and benefits of salvation, you must go beyond believing in the heart, to speaking. This is because with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation. This is the reason some people, even though they’ve been Christians for long, have never really enjoyed the blessings of Christianity. They haven’t acted on the Word.

You’re to make confessions of the Word; that means you speak the same things that God has said concerning you. That’s your faith\-response to the Word. He gave you His Word so you might respond. Your confession or affirmation is that response, and it activates the power of God’s Word in your life. Until you make those confessions, your faith won’t produce results. Your believing and your “speaking” must go together. That’s what we read in our opening verse. So, speak the Word only, and always, for a life of constant victory and excellence. Praise God!

## BEAUTIFY YOUR LIFE WITH FAITH-FILLED WORDS May 9th, 2020
![May 9th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-9-beautify-your-life-with-faith-filled-words.jpg)

>***For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body (James 3:2\).***

The words you speak are a true measure of your spirituality. It makes no difference what others might think or say about you; what matters are the words that come out of your mouth every day, irrespective of who you may be talking to: God, men, yourself, circumstances, or nature. Be sure to only and always speak faith\-filled and spirit\-filled words.

The Apostle James likened the tongue to the rudder of a great ship that the captain uses to navigate the ship aright, irrespective of the fierce winds driving against it (James 3:4\-5\). This means that with your words, you can keep yourself in health, in faith, in success, and in excellence. Don’t talk fear, lack or your inabilities. Consciously speak faith\-filled words.

There’s no need praying and asking God to make His promises real in your life; they’re already real. Simply acknowledge and affirm who you are in Christ and your inheritance in Him, and walk accordingly. Don’t say, “Lord, you promised to bless me; you promised to make me fruitful”; rather, say, “Lord, I thank you for you’ve blessed me with all things; you’ve made me fruitful and productive.” Hallelujah!

It’s wonderful that with your faith\-filled words, you can disallow sickness, disease, infirmity and weakness from your body. Always speak health, strength and abundance. Use your tongue to come out of trouble, depression, poverty and frustrations. Today, where you are, and what you are in life, are the result of yesterday’s words. Jesus said you shall have what you say (Mark 11:23\). Therefore, beautify your life with your faith\-filled words.

## LIVE TRIUMPHANTLY EVERY DAY May 10th, 2020

>***For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith (1 John 5:4\).***

There’s a higher life in Christ to which we’ve been called. We’re not ordinary. Jesus didn’t only give us this supernatural life, but also came to demonstrate to us how to live this life. When He walked the earth, His life and ministry were an absolute demonstration of the righteousness of God, and dominion of the Spirit. He had a mind\-set of absolute mastery. He wasn’t subject to the corruption and darkness of this world. He ruled over nature and lived above the elements. Hallelujah!

Christ’s triumphant life on earth was an example for us to follow. Since we have the same life and nature with Him, we’re to live victoriously every day, with dominion over circumstances. The Bible says as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17\). You’ve been built with possibilities within your system. You’re in this world, not as a victim, but as more than a conqueror. God has given you dominion over all things (Genesis 1:28\). He gave you a life that’s superior, not only to circumstances and the forces of nature, but also to spiritual beings of evil—Satan and his cohorts.

Refuse to live an ordinary life. Take a cue from the Master: He walked on water, opened blind eyes, unstopped deaf ears, made the lame to walk, restored speech to the dumb, raised the dead, and literally transcended natural laws. We can, and are to do likewise, because we’re of the same stock with Him. Divinity is at work in you. Christ is alive and at work in you; therefore, nothing can put you down. Live triumphantly every day.

## BE CONTENT WITH WHAT YOU HAVE May 11th, 2020
![May 11th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-11-be-content-with-what-you-have.jpg)

>***Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, “Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you” (Hebrews 13:5 NIV).***

God wants our lives to be void of covetousness; don’t lust after what belongs to others. Be content with what you have. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t dream or desire to attain greater levels of success; rather, it emphasizes being fulfilled and understanding that what you have is enough to get whatever else you want. But the truth is that there isn’t really anything that you don’t have.

The Bible says all things are yours (1 Corinthians 3:21\); better than that, Christ is in you, and Christ is everything. So, in Him you have all things. When the crippled beggar at the gate of the temple called ‘Beautiful’ asked Peter and John for alms, Peter didn’t say, “I don’t have what you’re asking for,” and walk away; he knew he had something, and what he had was enough to produce whatever else may be required. He used what he had: the Name of Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit, to effect a cure and restore life to the man’s hitherto dead and crippled limbs.

Always be conscious of what you have: the power and glory of Christ in your spirit. Your heart is the habitation of the Lord; do you know what that means? The ability of God is operational in you. How could anyone know this and ever be in lack or need or be envious of others? That’s why this knowledge is coming to you now, so you’d be content and confident in who you are, what you have, and all that Christ is to you and in you, and has wrought in your spirit.

Never think, “If I only had this or that”; you have what’s most important: Christ; and that’s all you need. Christ in you is the hope, the guarantee that everything else you could ever require is already in you. Glory to God!

## HUMILITY AND GREATNESS May 12th, 2020
![May 12th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-12-humility-and-greatness.jpg)

>***But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble (James 4:6\).***

When Jesus walked the earth, He demonstrated humility. When it was time for Him to be baptized, He didn’t feel superior to John the Baptist, even though He was the Son of God. Rather, He allowed the Scriptures to be fulfilled (Read Matthew 3:13\-15 NKJV). That’s because truly great people are humble and motivated by one thing only: fulfilling God’s Word; doing things God’s way. They’re also inspired to serve.

Jesus said to His disciples, “Whoever must be great amongst you, must have the heart of a servant” (Matthew 20:26\). Not only did He say this to them, He acted it by washing the feet of His disciples. Then He explained His action, saying, “*You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them”* (John 13:13\-17 NKJV).

In Philippians 2, we read again about His unparalleled humility. Though He was Himself God, He humbled Himself and died a criminal’s death in our behalf. But see the result of His humility: *“Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father”* (Philippians 2:9\-11 NKJV). Hallelujah!

Philippians 2:5 says, *“Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus”*; meaning, emulate His humility. It’s the pathway to greatness; there’re no shortcuts. Pride goes before a fall, but humility promotes.

## POWER TO HEAL May 13th, 2020
![May 13th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-13-power-to-heal.jpg)

>***Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk (Acts 3:6\).***

The Christian isn’t the sick, wanting to be healed. Sadly, that’s been the understanding of many. Being born again, you have the God\-life; the “imperishable” life. As Jesus said, the Christian has the power to heal; he’s called of God to take healing to the world. Study the Scriptures and you’d find that’s what Jesus did; the Bible says He went about doing good, healing ALL that were oppressed of the devil (Acts 10:38\).

The Apostles did the same thing; they ministered healing to the sick. We read, for example, about Peter and John in Acts 3, going into the temple and were attracted to a lame beggar who sat at the gate of the temple, asking alms of everyone entering and leaving the temple. Peter’s response was very inspiring; he said, *“…Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength”*(Acts 3:6\-7\).

Notice that what Peter had to give him wasn’t “prayer” or the power to pray. This is where some Christians miss it; they think God gave us “power to pray for the sick”; no! He gave us power to heal the sick. Read Matthew 10:1; it says, *“And when he*(Jesus) *had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.”* Jesus gave us power to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease; not some manner, but ALL. So, it makes no difference what the case is; you have power to heal it.

Jesus said in Mark 16:17\-18, *“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”* Put what you’ve got to work. Refuse to allow the devil run rampage in your life or in the lives of your loved ones in the form of sickness. You’re a healer; walk in this consciousness.

## THE “KNOWING” OF FAITH May 14th, 2020
![May 14th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-14-the-knowing-of-faith.jpg)

>***Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Hebrews 11:1\).***

Our relationship with the Lord is one of faith. It makes no difference how you “feel” outwardly; physical feelings have nothing to do with it. Oftentimes, our experience of Him and with Him can’t be described with human words; but then, there’s a deep inner “knowing,” an awareness in your spirit. 

It brings to mind the account of the woman with the issue of blood in Mark 5\. She had suffered hemorrhage for twelve years, and the doctors weren’t able to help her. The Bible says, *“When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment...And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague”* (Mark 5:27\-29\). How did she know that the “feeling” she felt in her body was one of healing? It was her faith at work!

The Bible doesn’t say, “She saw that the bleeding had stopped,” but that “she felt in her body that she was healed.” That’s the feeling of faith. In the case of the lame man at the gate of the temple called Beautiful as recorded in Acts 3, when Peter ministered to him, the Bible says his feet and ankle bones received strength (Acts 3:7\). Bones don’t feel, so it couldn’t have been a physical “feeling.” But something got injected into his feet and bones, and God knew, and said his feet and ankle bones received strength. The result was that the man leapt and walked. His faith was operational; he responded, and in his response, the power of the word spoken by Peter was manifested, and his miracle happened.

It also reminds of what we read about David; the Bible says he “perceived” that God had confirmed him king over Israel. This wasn’t mere mental or physical knowledge; it was a knowing in his spirit. There’s the knowledge of faith, the hearing of faith, the feeling or perception of faith, as you’re sensitive to the leading and guidance of the Holy Spirit, and the Word.

## GLORIFIED IN HIM May 15th, 2020
![May 15th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-15-glorified-in-him.jpg)

 ---

>***Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified (Romans 8:30\).***

Jesus Christ is the effulgence of the Father’s glory, the express image of His Person (Hebrews 1:3\). And that’s exactly what He’s made us; we’ve been glorified in Him. He said in John 17:22, *“And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one.”*

The Christian is the fruit of Christ’s suffering. The Bible talks about the glory that should follow His sufferings (1 Peter 1:11\); we’re that glory; the joy He saw that made Him endure the Cross and despise the shame (Hebrews 12:2\). Thus, for the Christian, there’s no more shame, because Jesus already bore your shame. He paid the price for you to live a glorious life. Everything required for your success has been consummated. He died so you can live a life of honour, dignity and excellence. Hallelujah!

The most beautiful part of His vicarious death is that it didn’t end with the grave. He rose triumphantly back to life on the third day. Blessed be God! Just as death couldn’t hold Him, nothing today can hinder your glorious life in Him. If you couldn’t walk, rise up and walk! Walk out of that sickness, for the glory has come: Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27\).

This is the Gospel of Jesus Christ! He’s brought us victory, success, health and prosperity. He’s brought us into His glory and ordained us to manifest the same in the earth: *“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light”* (1 Peter 2:9\).

## LIVING BY FAITH May 16th, 2020
![May 16th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-16-living-by-faith.jpg)

>***(For we walk by faith, not by sight:) (2 Corinthians 5:7\).***

These profound words of the Spirit penned by Paul the apostle to the Corinthian Christians give a succinct and precise overview of the Christian life: we live by faith, not by sensory perception. The same truth is reiterated in Romans 1:17*: “…The just shall live by (his) faith.”*

It’s imperative to understand that Christianity is a life of faith; it has nothing to do with your senses. You were born again by faith, and you can only live the Christian life successfully by faith; there’s no other way!

Faith is a lifestyle; it’s not something you pick up to use whenever you want to get something from the Lord. You can strengthen your faith, stir it, grow it or increase it. Living by faith is living from your spirit according to God’s Word. You look into the mirror of God and are metamorphosed (changed, transfigured) into the same image of God’s glory that you see, from glory to glory (2 Corinthians 3:18\).

As you do this, the forces of life in the Kingdom are revealed to you and released into your world. They work within you and attract to you the men, resources, circumstances and materials that are consistent with your new nature in Christ Jesus. When you declare that you have dominion over the devil, the world, and its circumstances, that reality is established as you proclaim. Hallelujah!

Hebrews 11:6 says without faith, it’s impossible to please God; that means you can’t live for Him. To please Him is to live by faith every day, meaning that everything in your life is directed according to His Word; your confidence is on the eternal realities of the Kingdom and not the earthly, transient, temporal circumstances of life (2 Corinthians 4:18\). Glory to God!

## CONSECRATED UNTO HIM May 17th, 2020

>***These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office (Numbers 3:3\).***

Consecration is a word mostly used in the Old Testament section of the Bible in reference to items that were to be set apart as holy for sacrifices and worship. It’s also used to describe the “setting apart” of the priests who were to be dedicated to the Lord. It generally refers to devoting or sacredly setting apart anyone or anything to the worship or service of the Lord.

In the Old Testament, the tribe of Levi were thus consecrated to the service of God in the priestly order (Numbers 3:12\). The Hebrews consecrated or devoted their fields and cattle, and sometimes the spoils of war, to the Lord (Leviticus 27:28\-29\). Also, according to the Law, the first\-born of both man and beast were consecrated to God. For us in the New Testament, the Scriptures describe us as consecrated to the Lord; holy and sanctified, not because of our works, but by God’s choice.

1 Peter 2:9 says, *“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.”* However, too many of God’s people aren’t living in the vital reality of this consecrated life. As a result, they’ve missed out on the blessings of living and functioning with the knowledge that they’ve indeed been set apart unto God; set apart from sin, sickness, poverty and death, unto righteousness, holiness, victory, prosperity and divine health. See yourself this way and walk accordingly.

Ephesians 1:4 says, *“According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.”* We’re His “called out” ones; His chosen and sanctified ones. No wonder we’re holy and without blame before Him in love. Hallelujah!

## IF HE ISN’T LORD OF ALL, HE ISN’T LORD AT ALL May 18th, 2020

>***The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all) (Acts 10:36\).***

A certain man had just given his life to Christ but was still being buffeted by the devil. He called on the Lord complaining, “I thought that with you in my life, I wouldn’t have any more problems!” The Lord, in His response, showed the man how he had given Him only one room in his entire house. In that revelation, God was in that one room when the devil came into the house, fought the man and wounded him.

The man thought about it and said, “All right Lord, I give you three additional rooms.” That night, the devil came again and troubled him. This time, he was mad at God. He asked angrily, “I’ve now given you four rooms and still you allowed the devil in. What more should I do?” Then the Lord answered him kindly, “The house isn’t mine; you gave me four rooms in your house and the devil can’t come into any of those rooms.”

Finally, the man got the message and said, “All right, Lord, I turn the entire house over to you; it’s all yours now.” The next night, the devil came again, but there was a new owner. God was at the gate and the devil couldn’t come in. That’s what happens when Jesus has it all in your life.

Christianity isn’t just a casual acceptance of Jesus Christ as your Saviour; He wants to be Lord (Master or Boss) of your life, not just legally but vitally. If He isn’t Lord of your life and everything about you, then He isn’t your Lord at all! He said in Luke 9:23, *“...If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.”* Today, this statement is largely interpreted as enduring the persecution, ridicule, harassment and criticism the world throws at us, but at the time of Jesus, “taking up a cross” meant going to one’s death by crucifixion. That Jesus implied this is obvious from His next statement: *“For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it”* (Luke 9:24\). 

True consecrated Christianity isn’t a flippant, casual relationship but a radical commitment to Christ and His cause. You’re to give Him your all, and live for Him fully and truly. Hallelujah!

>***For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s (1 Corinthians 6:20\).***

I love the story I heard many years ago of a Chinese brother. It’s a powerful expression of our consecration to the Lord and oneness with Him. The story goes that he was travelling on the same train as three gentlemen who wanted to play a card game that required a fourth person. So, they asked him, “Sir, would you mind joining us to play this game?” He replied, “Oh, I’m sorry. I would have joined you, but I’m not here with my hands.”

“You’re not here with your hands?” they chorused in bewilderment. “No, I’m not,” he affirmed. They looked at him closely; he seemed complete and his hands didn’t look like prostheses. “So, what about these hands here?” they queried. “They’re not mine,” he replied. Now they thought he was out of wits. Knowing their thoughts, he quickly spoke up and explained: “I’ve been bought with a price. I now belong to Jesus. These hands now belong to Him and I only use them for what He wants.” He then went ahead and explained the Gospel to them to receive Christ.

What a beautiful thought this is! What a mindset this brother had! This is what happens when you understand the significance of the salvation you’ve received from Christ. You recognize that you’re not your own; it’s no longer you that live, but Christ that lives through you. You belong to Him, and can only do the things that He approves; only those things that please Him. You glorify Him in your spirit, soul, and body, for they’re His. Hallelujah!

## YOU’RE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR LIFE May 20th, 2020

>***Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear (Hebrews 11:1\-3\).***

Our theme scripture is quite instructive; it reveals an important faith\-principle with which you can make your life excellent, from glory to glory. It says the things that are obvious to our natural eyes weren’t made of things that appear; they came out of things that aren’t observable to the senses. The context shows that these things came from words, for it says, “Through faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God.”

In Genesis 1, we read that God spoke and brought order, beauty and form to a world that was formless, chaotic and in darkness. He framed the world. In the same way, your life and your future have been framed, only that this time, it was by you. What you’re going to be like in the next few months and years is already planned and laid out by none other than you! And if you currently don’t like what you have (that is, how your life has turned out), you alone can change it.

Some people may argue with this, but God’s Word lets us know that’s how it is. You planned the life you’re living now with your words. You are today exactly what you described yourself to be years ago. You’re responsible for the quality of life you have today. Of course, there would have been several other factors of influence: sociological, environmental, family, etc., but they only gave you a foundation; they gave you material with which to build your life. Whatever you eventually built on that sub\-structure came from you.

If you’re having a wonderful life that you’re really glad about, you built it. If you’re living in defeat and as a victim, it’s also the result of your tongue\-work. God isn’t responsible for the life you’re living. He gives you a vision; He shows you a picture and lets you know the kind of life He wants you to have. He may even be specific and tell you exactly what He wants your life to be. However, He’s not going to build it for you. He’ll only deliver the necessary materials and tools into your hands.

There’re also those materials you’d have to acquire, and He’ll show you where they are and how to acquire them. The responsibility is yours to locate them, take possession of them and use them to build your victorious life.

## YIELD YOURSELF TO HIM May 21st, 2020

>***Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace (Romans 6:13\-14\).***

The Greek word translated “yield” above is “Paristemi,” and it also means to present. In other words, you’re to present yourself unto God as one who’s alive from the dead. You might ask, “Why do I have to present myself to God again? Isn’t my acceptance of His salvation enough?”

First, for the Lord to instruct us to present ourselves to Him means He chose us for that purpose. You can’t give God something He doesn’t want or hasn’t chosen. God, in His sovereignty, instructs us to present ourselves to Him, and it behooves us to do just that. Secondly, we have an example to follow in Jesus, *“... who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God...”*(Hebrews 9:14\).

Also, in Romans 6:9\-10, we read that *“…Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.”* In the same manner that Christ died unto sin once and now lives unto God, we must consider ourselves dead to sin but alive unto God (for indeed, we are). In other words, you must live for Him and unto Him, because you belong to Him.

Jesus didn’t merely send some angels to save you; He took your place of condemnation and died in your place. He paid the ultimate price for you. Having accepted the salvation He purchased for you with His life, you have to accept the responsibility that comes with it, and live as one who understands the worth and value of that sacrifice. And you do that by consecrating your life to Him; by living for Him and serving Him with whole\-hearted devotion, keeping His Word, fulfilling His purpose for your life, and producing works of righteousness. Hallelujah!

## TRAINING YOURSELF IN THE FAITH-LIFE May 22nd, 2020

>***But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him (Hebrews 11:6\).***

The Bible says, “The Just shall live by faith”; that means faith is our lifestyle. Therefore, you must train yourself in the faith\-life. When you came into Christ, God gave you a perfect life and showed you how to live that life to the full. His will is for you to be in charge and in control of your life, with everything working out right for you. But the extent to which you live that life is a function of your faith. That’s why it’s so important for you to understand how faith works, and to learn to use what you’ve got.

For example, when you feel some discomfort in your body, the first thing shouldn’t be to call the doctor or dash to the drug store. Speak to your body. You say, “I speak perfection, health and wholeness to all the systems of my body; they respond to the divine life in me and function rightly, in the Name of Jesus!” Stick to the Word, and you’ll surely have a testimony!

Sometimes, when people face challenges, they’d say, “I’ve been using my faith, but nothing is happening.” That’s because they’re struggling to make their faith work. Speak faith\-filled words ever before trouble shows up, so that when it does, your faith will be steadfast.

Learn from Jesus: He talked to trees, winds, waves, water, fishes, food, etc., letting us know that everything in life has intelligence and that sound conveys energy. Therefore, apart from talking to your body to be in health, learn to talk to things in your home, your work tools, your money—everything in your care and under your watch—they all have intelligence. Use your mouth to retain their value and keep them perfect.

It makes no difference the circumstances you face; stick to the Word. Maintain your confession, and the only guaranteed outcome would be the triumph of your faith. Hallelujah!

## HE’S THE ONLY WAY OUT May 23rd, 2020

>***Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12\).***

There’re three kinds of sin. The first one is inherited sin. The Bible says, “*Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned”* (Romans 5:12\). The sin of Adam was passed to all men. Everyone that came from Adam became an heir of Adam’s transgression. How terrible! But that’s the reality.

The second one is “imputed sin.” Imputed sin is based on Law, and you may not be the guilty one. In Joshua 7, we read how the children of Israel paid dearly for the sin committed by just one man, Achan. Having recently conquered a greater nation, the children of Israel were preparing to go wipe out a smaller one. Before going to capture Jericho, God had instructed them, “When you get to that place, don’t keep anything that’s theirs; destroy everything” (Joshua 7:11 AMPC).

But Achan took a coat and other items, and hid them for himself (Joshua 7:20\-21\). And the result? The whole country (Israel) lost the battle. The man’s sin was imputed to the whole country. Aside the inheritance, Adam’s transgression was also imputed to all men. You didn’t have to be guilty personally; it’s a class sin; everybody becomes part of it. It’s like when the President of your country signs a bad deal or initiates a bad policy; it affects the entire nation.

The third class of sin is “personal sin.” This is the one that you committed by yourself. Clearly, everyone born into this world has the sin\-nature and requires salvation. If a man says he’s free from personal sin, how about inherited sin, and or imputed sin? But thanks be unto God! Salvation—the deliverance of man from his fallen nature and the depravity of sin and its effects, the recreation of his spirit and the restoration of fellowship with God—is possible and available through Jesus Christ! He’s the only way out!

This is why we preach the Gospel; that all men may believe in Jesus Christ and receive remission of sins and the life and nature of God. Hallelujah!

## YOUR REASON FOR BEING May 24th, 2020

>***Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake (John 14:11\).***

One of the things I believe God helped me to find out for myself early in life was my purpose for being. I often wondered, “Why do people live in the first place if they’d eventually end up dying?” It became a question I needed an answer to. Then as I studied about Jesus, I wanted to know, “Why did Jesus come?” As the years passed, by the Spirit of God, I got the answer for life; I found out why we lived, and life changed for me.

Think about it: what is it on earth that you could consider to be lasting, to be eternally rewarding? Do you want the whole world to be yours? There’ve been people before you who ruled the whole world. Think about the Pharaohs, the Caesars; they ruled the world; they had everything. In fact, they were esteemed to be gods. But guess what? When their time came, they passed on, and it all ended. So, what do you want in life? The applause of men? Fame? Self\-satisfaction? There’ve been many who had those in abundance, but it didn’t change anything.

Until and unless you discover your purpose for life, you haven’t lived. Fellowship with God is the idea. Fellowship with God isn’t just being friends with Him; it’s not just being close to Him; it’s being in oneness with Him, united in purpose and in pursuit. That’s the greatest thing you could ever know—to be in fellowship with the Lord and relate with Him as One that you know and that knows you. That’s the reason for life: to know that God loves you and you love Him, and walk with Him; to understand what it is to be in God and God in you. This was the prayer of Jesus to the Father concerning us*: “…that they may be one, even as we are one”* (John 17:22\). The greatest thing that a human being could ever know is to discover Him, discover yourself in Him, and to discover Him in you. Then you can say, like Jesus, *“...I am in the Father, and the Father in me...”* (John 14:11\); a glorious relationship which changes your perception and everything about your life. With this understanding, you discover your place in His body—the body of Christ—and go on to fulfil that role.

## USE WHAT HE GAVE YOU May 25th, 2020

>***That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth (Philippians 2:10\).***

I learnt very early, as a young Christian, how to put the Word of God to work. I wanted to deal with issues and situations right away, using the Word. 

For example, back then, if I mistakenly dashed my foot against something, I’d immediately place my hand on it and say, “Heal, in Jesus’ Name!” I was learning to use authority. I might still experience some pain, but I found out I had no swelling, and I knew it was supposed to swell. Instead of getting worse, it quickly got back to normal! If it was a cut and it was bleeding, I’d say, “Seal up, in Jesus’ Name! No bleeding!” and I continued with whatever I was doing.

As I practised the Word like that, and I saw the result, I testified to those around me, sharing my experience of the efficacy of the Word of God. I practised the Word on my body, using the all\-conquering Name of Jesus and authority that He gave us.

I remember one night, as a teenager, after an encounter with Juju priests and their shrines, while sleeping, I felt some weight on me, pressing on me; it was a spiritual attack; the only time I ever experienced such. I found myself struggling to call the Name of Jesus, but I couldn’t even open my mouth. I finally got that figure off me, as I called out, “Jesus!” Then I went straight on my knees and said, “You devil, in the Name of Jesus, you’d never repeat this; and wherever you are, I bind you, in the Name of Jesus! Never again!” From that day till now, it never happened again, and never will.

Use what you have. Use the Name of Jesus. Otherwise, the devil will prey on you. Use that name to change the atmosphere in your home; use it to change the state of your business. Reign and rule over circumstances in His Name. Hallelujah!

## BE CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER IN YOU May 26th, 2020

>***But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8\).***

2 Corinthians 4:7 says, “*But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.”* There’s power in you. Ephesians 3:20 says, *“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.”* All of the power of divinity is at work in you; it’s not in heaven, but in your recreated human spirit. There’s no telling what you can do, how far you can go—the limitless extent of your success and prosperity— if you’d recognise and put the power in you to work.

What has affected many is their lack of consciousness of who they are and what they carry in them. The consciousness of the power of God in your life is the activating force. If you’re not conscious of who you are and what’s in you, it’ll not work. The Lord Jesus walked the earth with the consciousness of His divine origin and personality. He said, “All power is given to me in heaven and in the earth!” (Matthew 28:18\). He knew it, and affirmed accordingly.

When He entered the synagogue, He said, *“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised”*(Luke 4:18\). What a consciousness! When He made that declaration, the devils couldn’t stand it; then He uttered words that brought healing and restoration to the sick and the afflicted. Glory to God!

1 John 4:17 says as He is, so are we in this world. The power of the Spirit is vested in you, because you’re one with Him; you’re a member of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones. You’re the representative of His Kingdom. The Holy Spirit came to live in you so the Kingdom, power, glory, righteousness and dominion of Christ would be manifested in and through you. Become conscious of this reality. Hallelujah!

## GROW YOUR FAITH May 27th, 2020
![May 27th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-27-grow-your-faith.jpg)

>***We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth (2 Thessalonians 1:3\).***

It’s your responsibility to increase the measure of faith God has given to you, and the way to do that is by learning more of God’s Word: *“…faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”* (Romans 10:17\). The less of God’s Word you receive into your spirit, the less faith you’ll be able to express when you’re faced with the challenges of life. So, every day, grow your faith by feeding voraciously on God’s Word.

Someone once said, “My faith is very little; that’s why I sometimes feel weak spiritually.” Then grow your faith! That’s your job. Don’t stay at the level of little faith. Little faith exhibits fear and doubt (Matthew 8:26\). In Matthew 14, Simon Peter was walking on water toward Jesus until he saw the winds and waves and began to sink. The Bible says Jesus immediately *“…stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?”* (Matthew 14:31\).

Little faith is also carnal or given to carnal reasoning. We see an example of this in Matthew 16:6 when Jesus said to His disciples, *“...Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.”* The Bible says they reasoned among themselves, saying, *“It is because we have taken no bread”* (Matthew 16:7\). They didn’t understand what Jesus was teaching and thought He meant physical loaves of bread. Jesus perceived their carnal reasoning and said to them, *“...O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?”* (Matthew 16:8\).

When the one with little faith feels a discomfort in the stomach, he’s quick to say, “I think it’s because of something I ate or something I drank.” Yet Jesus said, *“...and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them…”* (Mark 16:18\). God wants your faith to be stalwart; not weak, and not little. Therefore, study and practise the Word of God; that’s how to grow your faith to be strong. Be like the ones described in Thessalonica, whose faith grew exceedingly, and also those in the Faith’s hall of fame (Hebrews 11\) who used their faith for exploits.

## HUMILITY IN SERVING THE LORD May 28th, 2020

>***Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble (1 Peter 5:5\).***

Over the years, I’ve seen highly spiritually gifted Christians, including ministers, whose work turned to emptiness, because they weren’t walking in humility. No matter how highly gifted you are, when it’s mixed with pride, it’s not acceptable to God. Your desire should be that whatever you offer to the Lord in ministry and in your service to Him be accepted, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

Everything you do in the house of God is an offering to Him; your service is a sacrifice to God. But God won’t accept your sacrifice if it’s mixed with selfishness and greed; pomposity, pride and arrogance. Greatness in the house of God isn’t measured by some results that you have achieved or attained. Our opening verse says, “God resists the proud, but He gives grace to the humble.” Humble yourself. It’s something you must consciously and deliberately practise.

When thoughts of pride arise in your heart, rebuke them. The Bible says, *“And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted”* (Matthew 23:12\). So, you see that it’s either humility or humiliation. The Scriptures are replete with stories of those who were proud and how they ended up abased. But God doesn’t want us to go in that direction.

Correct and guide yourself with the Scriptures, with the wisdom of God at all times. Being born again, you were born great, and truly great men are always humble. Keep walking in humility, for it’s a great blessing and the pathway to promotion with God.

## THE CHRIST CULTURE May 29th, 2020
![May 29th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-29-the-christ-culture.jpg)

 ---

>***And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2\).***

In Christianity, we have a culture; it’s the Christ culture. Many come into Christ with their own culture, and try, in many ways, to influence the Church with their earthly culture. But the only culture we must follow and imbibe is the culture of the Spirit and of the Scriptures. Our theme verse tells us to be transformed by the renewing of our minds (Romans 12:2\); that means be cultured by the Word. It’s a decision that you must make.

If you’d renew your mind with the Scriptures, you’d have the Kingdom culture. For example, in Christ, we have a culture to honour and respect everyone, not only those we think are deserving of honour. Romans 12:10 says, *“Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another.”* Also, in Matthew 5:44, Jesus said, *“But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.”* This is Kingdom\-culture; it’s different from that of the world.

Matthew 5:42 says, *“Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.”* It’s our culture to give in love; you don’t turn away from the one who comes to borrow from you. We help and don’t despise anyone. This is how Jesus lived, and we’re to emulate Him. Therefore, train yourself in the Christ culture; the culture of love, kindness, forgiveness and righteousness.

## A CHRISTIAN CAN’T BE DEMON-POSSESSED May 30th, 2020
![May 30th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-30-a-christian-cant-be-demon-possessed.jpg)

>***And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 2:6\).***

Many have asked, “Can a Christian be demon\-possessed?” A Christian may be influenced by a demon, but he really can’t be possessed by a demon. For a Christian to be demon\-possessed means he or she has consciously and deliberately given up his faith in Jesus Christ, which is apostasy.

According to the Bible, there’s no recovery from such a state, because the person has wilfully given himself to Satan. But a true Christian can’t be in such a situation, because he’s superior to Satan. No matter how a Christian has yielded to the oppression of Satan, the day he realizes himself and says “No,” that’ll be the end of Satan’s manipulations in his life. James 4:7 says, *“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”*

For the Christian, the problem is never about demon\-possession; rather, it’s about yielding to evil spirits that cause them to do terrible things, and in the process, destroy their own lives. Oftentimes, such Christians aren’t knowledgeable enough in God’s Word to live otherwise (Hosea 4:6\).

The Christian is seated with Christ, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named (Ephesians 2:6; 1:19\-21\). Hallelujah! If the foregoing is true, (and thank God it is), why would he require “deliverance” from Satan, let alone being possessed of him? Even if a Christian is being influenced or oppressed by the devil, the solution is God’s Word. Psalm 119:130 declares, *“The entrance of thy words giveth light….”* If you’d receive God’s Word—His light into you and accept it—it’ll eject every satanic presence; darkness will be dispelled. 

This is why studying and meditating on the Word should be top priority for you as a child of God. Know and stay in the Word, and exercise your dominion in Christ.

## THE “PILL” OF FAITH May 31st, 2020

>***Jesus replied, “Why do you say ‘if you can’? Anything is possible for someone who has faith!” (Mark 9:23 CEV).***

Imagine that you were given a pill and told that if you’d take the pill, it makes no difference the infirmity, disease or sickness that attacks your body; irrespective of the location of the problem, the pill would effect a cure. What would your response be? I’m sure you wouldn’t hesitate to place an order for that pill immediately. You’d even want to have it in excess. But did you know that there’s actually such a pill?

It’s called the pill of faith! In Mark 9:23, Jesus said, “*If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.”*The word “believe” as used in the King James Version and several other versions is wrongly applied. It’s from the same word as “faith,” only that it’s the verb form. Faith is the noun, and “believe” is the verb of faith. This means the verse should actually read, “All things are possible to him that has faith.”

The CEV, which we quoted in our theme verse puts it more accurately; it says, *“...Anything is possible for someone who has faith!”*How reassuring! And reading it from the 21st verse makes it even more so. Jesus didn’t say, “Many things are possible if you have faith,” but that “ANYTHING is possible.” Meaning that it doesn’t matter what the situation is; God has given you power to make your life beautiful. You can do anything and change anything that’s contrary to God’s will for you with your faith.

When the disciples were terrified and cried to Jesus for help when they faced turbulent weather, the Bible says He turned to them and said, *“...Where is your faith?”* (Luke 8:25\). In other words, use the pill! It can do anything. There wouldn’t be any hopelessness or despondency in your life if you’d put your faith to work. Hallelujah!
