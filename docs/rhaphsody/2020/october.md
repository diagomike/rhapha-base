## PREACH IT BOLDLY October 1st, 2020

***But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me*****… (Acts 1:8\).**

Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth and the Life, and no one comes to the Father, but by Him. Be convinced and compelled by this truth, and preach it boldly. Don’t be afraid of being persecuted for proclaiming His Name.

2 Timothy 3:12 says, *“In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted”* (NIV). The early apostles were beaten and threatened never to proclaim the Name of Jesus. But rather than give in to the faithless religious and government authorities, they preached Christ even more boldly and filled the whole of Jerusalem with their doctrine (Acts 5:28\).

There’re antichrist spirits in the world today, working against the preaching of the Gospel, but they’re not a factor, because we’ve already overcome them. 1 John 4:4 says, *“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”*

Emulate Paul’s resolve; nothing could daunt his love for Christ and passion for the Gospel. In Acts 20:22\-24, he said, *“And now, you see, I am going to Jerusalem, bound by the \[Holy] Spirit and obligated and compelled by the \[convictions of my own] spirit, not knowing what will befall me there—Except that the Holy Spirit clearly and emphatically affirms to me in city after city that imprisonment and suffering await me. But none of these things move me; neither do I esteem my life dear to myself, if only I may finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have obtained from \[which was entrusted to me by] the Lord Jesus, faithfully to attest to the good news (Gospel) of God’s grace (His unmerited favor, spiritual blessing, and mercy)”* (AMPC).

Have the same conviction! This glorious Gospel which has been committed to your trust is worth everything. Preach it boldly everywhere.

## YOUR RESPONSE ACTIVATES THE POWER October 2nd, 2020

>***…for he hath said…So that we may boldly say… (Hebrews 13:5\-6\).***

In Christianity, you believe and speak: *“We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak”* (2 Corinthians 4:13\). You don’t receive the Word to be quiet. If you don’t respond, the Word will do you no good.

Responding to the Word means more than “reciting” what God has said; you have to say something that’s consistent with what He has said. For example, He has said His divine power has granted you all things that pertain to life and godliness. Your response should be, “There’s no lack or want in my life, because all things are mine! I prosper everywhere and in all things to the glory of God!”

Your confession of the Word is your response to the Word; this is what will change your life and circumstances. Every time God speaks, anything He says is loaded with power. His words are never empty. So, what has God said to you? What have you discovered about you in the Word? Respond to the Word.

Even now, speak words that are consistent with God’s divine provisions, plans and purposes in Christ. Affirm that you’re making progress and manifesting the glory of Christ everywhere. Declare that good things are happening for you, through you and around you, because you’re the seed of Abraham. Activate the power of the Word in your life.

## YOU’RE WORTH HEAVEN’S BEST October 3rd, 2020

>***Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold…But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot (1 Peter 1:18\-19\).***

Your value to God is revealed in the price He paid for your salvation, which is the precious blood of Jesus Christ. It shows how priceless you really are to God.

Never be deceived by voices that tell you you’re not special or those who treat you like you’re nothing. The fact that you’re worth the blood of Jesus Christ says a lot; it defines your true value. This realization should inspire greater boldness and confidence in your spirit. Nothing is too good for you. You’re worth heaven’s best.

Meditate on this truth! Think, talk and live as God’s treasure of inestimable value. The Bible says He rejoices over you with singing (Zephaniah 3:17\). That’s because you’re His glory and His righteousness. See yourself the way He sees you, and your faith will be more effective. Hallelujah!

## A HIGH CALLING October 4th, 2020
![October 4th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-4-a-high-calling.jpg)

 ---

>***And all things are of God, who hath… given to us the ministry of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18\).***

2 Peter 3:9 tells us that God isn’t willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. He proved His commitment by sending Jesus to die for the salvation of all men (John 3:16\). However, despite God’s commitment to saving the lost, He wills to do it through us—His saints—and has committed to us “the ministry of reconciliation.” 

Jesus said in Mark 16:15, *“...Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”* We have the greatest honour on earth: the opportunity to preach the Gospel. God gave us the rare privilege of being His partners in changing the world: His partners in transforming lives.

Think about the fact that God didn’t give the charge of soul winning to angels, but to you and me. The glorious Gospel of the blessed God has been committed to our trust (1 Timothy 1:11\); be faithful in it. Be on the go with the Gospel; don’t stop until the knowledge of the glory of God covers the earth as the waters cover the sea.

What a marvellous blessing, privilege and honour that the Lord would do all He did, and send us to herald the news around the world! Then to ensure you succeed at it, He gave you the Holy Spirit to be with you, and in you. The Holy Spirit makes you an able, competent, and effective minister of the Gospel (2 Corinthians 3:6\). He gives you the ability to be a bold witness of the resurrected Christ and to fulfil your calling.

Taking the Gospel to the ends of the earth is my passion and high calling in Christ Jesus.

## KNOWING HIS VOICE ISN’T A MYSTERY October 5th, 2020
![October 5th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-5-knowing-his-voice-isnt-a-mystery.jpg)

>***My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me (John 10:27\).***

The Lord Jesus said, *“My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me”* (John 10:27\). Many wonder if it’s possible to hear God speak in a world where there’re so many voices. The words of the Master in John 10:2\-5 clarify this. He said, “*But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice. And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.”*

The key is understanding God’s Word. The more you study the Word, the more you recognise and know the voice of God, because God and His Word are one. He speaks through His Word. Everything He tells you: every direction or guidance you receive from Him, always sides up with His Word. Through meditation on His Word, His voice becomes clearer to you, even in the midst of all the noise and distractions.

If you’ve hitherto found it difficult to recognize God’s voice, the solution is simple: spend more time studying the Word! Colossians 3:16 says, *“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom….”* Proverbs 4:20\-21 says, *“My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.”* If you keep the Word in your heart, you’ll hear the Word in your heart.

In addition, pray in the spirit often; pray in tongues. This helps to condition your spirit to discern God’s voice, visions and promptings.

## YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED October 6th, 2020
![October 6th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-6-you-have-everything-you-need.jpg)

 >***After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward (Genesis 15:1).***
---
***After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great** **reward (Genesis 15:1\).***

The underlined words spoken by God to Abraham in our opening verse reminds of what He said later to Aaron in Numbers 18:20: *“…I am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.”* We understand from the Scriptures that the Lord apportioned inheritance to the different tribes of Israel except the Levites, to whom He said, “I am your inheritance.”

How rich can you get when the Lord is your inheritance? How glorious would your life be? Psalm 24:1 says, *“The earth is the LORD’S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.”* Since this is true, then the earth and everything in it belongs to you because you’re His heir. Paul understood this and said, *“...all things are yours”* (1 Corinthians 3:21\).

Now you can understand why your prayer times shouldn’t be spent asking God for things for yourself. What do you want to ask of one who’s already given you everything, including Himself? You have Christ, and Christ is everything. This truth should change your mentality and life forever.

Is it strength you require? The Bible says He’s your strength! Therefore, testify like the Psalmist, *“… the LORD is the strength of my life...”* (Psalm 27:1\). Is it wisdom you think you need? The Bible says Christ is your wisdom (1 Corinthians 1:30\).

You’ve been granted all that you require for life and godliness; you’ve been launched into a life of glory, excellence and superabundance. No wonder the Psalmist exclaimed, *“The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage”* (Psalm 16:6\). All things are yours!

## MAINTAIN YOUR PASSION FOR THE GOSPEL October 7th, 2020

>***But that which ye have already hold fast till I come (Revelation 2:25\).***

As a Christian, every day presents opportunities for you to keep the faith and maintain your confession of who Jesus is and what He means to you. Nothing should take your focus off the Master; He’s all that truly matters. Declare your love for Him, and your passion for the Gospel.

Some allow anger or bitterness to douse their zeal and effectiveness in ministering to others. Hebrews 12:15 says, *“Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.”* Don’t stop winning souls or become cold about the things of God because someone offended you.

The privileges of service we have in the house of God are sacrosanct; don’t take them lightly. You’ve been endowed with the ability and grace to lead people to Christ, unveiling to them the mysteries of the Kingdom; keep at it. There’s a crown of glory awaiting you at the end.

The Bible says those that turn many to righteousness shall shine as stars forever (Daniel 12:3\). Keep shining evermore in leading many to Christ. Let it be your life’s work and priority.

## WE ARE HIS “MANNER OF MEN” October 8th, 2020
![October 8th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-8-were-his-manner-of-men.jpg)

 ---

>***...What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? (Mark 4:41\).***

The Lord Jesus, when He walked the earth, was a marvel; a master over circumstances. One day, the disciples, in awe of Him, asked the question we read in our theme verse. This was after He hushed a billowing tempest to sleep.

On another occasion, the disciples had sailed far out at sea when they suddenly saw a figure walking towards them on the water; it was Jesus. Again, they wondered, “What manner of man is this that defies nature?” Think about His ascension to heaven! He simply levitated and went through the clouds into heaven.

It pays to know who Jesus really is. Until you know Him, you can’t have true faith in Him, and you wouldn’t know yourself. Here’s something most extraordinary: anyone who believes in Jesus receives the same life that He has. John 1:12\-13 says, *“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God…Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.”*

Notice that the latter part says you’re born of God, meaning that you’re born of the same Word that became Jesus. 1 Peter 1:23 says, *“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”* James 1:18 says, *“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth….”*

We’re the same manner of men as Jesus, because we’re offsprings of the Word. No wonder John said, *“...as he is, so are we in this world”* (1 John 4:17\). All of divinity was tabernacled in Jesus; He was God alive—walking and talking in a man’s body. That same fullness of divinity dwells in you today. Like Him, you’re the living, moving house of the living God. Hallelujah!

## IT’S ABOUT YOUR DIVINE ORIGIN October 9th, 2020

>***And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise (Galatians 3:29\).***

The life of Jesus on earth was an unending stream of extraordinary blessings, victories and manifestation of the divine life. He was conscious of His divinity and oneness with the Father and spoke about it unequivocally. In John 8:42, He said, *“…for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.”* As a result of this connection, He said, *“All things that the Father hath are mine...”* (John 16:15\).

Christ’s purpose in the earth was to bring you into fellowship with the Father. The Bible says our fellowship (oneness) is with the Father and with the Son, Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3\). You’re an heir of God and a joint\-heir with the resurrected Christ (Romans 8:17\). Therefore, everything He owns belongs to you. You can affirm boldly, *“All things that the Father hath are mine....”* The Kingdom of God is yours.

The Bible says Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27\). Since you have Him, you have all that He owns. Blessed be God! No wonder Paul said, *“Therefore let no man glory in men…”* (1 Corinthians 3:21\). Don’t pride yourself in any human connections. Rather, recognise and celebrate your divine ancestry and all that your union with Christ has bequeathed to you.

## SPEAK AND CREATE WHAT YOU WANT October 10th, 2020

>***Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear (Hebrews 11:3\).***

What we just read in our opening verse reveals your limitless power and glory in Christ Jesus: what you can do with the Word (rhema) of God in your mouth. Recall that in the Book of Genesis, the Bible says the earth was a chaotic mass. But after the Holy Spirit incubated upon it, God gave the Word, and everything He spoke leapt into being. This is the same ability He’s given us; the ability to speak whatever we want into existence.

An important key to this is meditation. Just as the Holy Spirit brooded (hovered, fluttered) upon the earth’s chaotic mass, when there’s a situation you want to change, take out time to meditate on God’s Word. During that meditation, there’ll arise within you inspired words that’ll cause the change(s) that you desire.

Hosea 14:2 says, *“Take with you words....”*; what do you want in your life? The Bible says without the Word was not anything made that was made! So, what do you want to “make”? Don’t cry about the situation; don’t gripe over the pain! The question is, what do you want to see? What do you want to create out of that precarious situation? The Bible says God commanded light to shine out of darkness. Don’t focus on the problem; focus on what you want and speak it forth.

Don’t say, “I have cancer” or “I have diabetes”; it’s not about what “you have”; it’s what you want in place of that cancer or diabetes. God had darkness at the beginning, but He spoke light into being. You’re created in His image and in His likeness, with His ability in your spirit, and His Word in your mouth. Speak and create what you want. Hallelujah!

## OUR UNION WITH THE FATHER October 11th, 2020

>***But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit (1 Corinthians 6:17\).***

Being born again, and having received the Holy Spirit, you’re one with the Lord. He’s come to dwell within you and has mingled with your spirit. His purpose from the foundation of the world was to be inseparably united with you.

He’s one with Jesus; He was so much one with Jesus that when Philip asked Jesus in John 14, “Show us the Father and we will be satisfied,” His response to Philip was, “Have I been such a long time with you and have you not known me, Philip?” Then He added, “Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. I’m in the Father, and the Father is in me.”

He wanted us to understand His oneness with the Father, and that oneness with the Father is what He brought us into. 1 John 1:3 NKJV tells us, *“…truly our fellowship (our oneness, our union) is with the Father and with His son Jesus Christ.”*

Jesus prayed about this before He went to the Cross; referring to all those who’d believe in Him, He said, *“That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us…”* (John 17:21\). He so wanted us to be inseparably one with Him and the Father that the world wouldn’t be able to separate us from Him. And that’s what has happened. Even the angels are enthused by this, because they now look at us, and see Jesus! That’s Christianity—Christ in you; the Father’s Kingdom at work in you. Hallelujah!

1 Corinthians 1:9 says, *“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the **fellowship** of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.”* This was all God ever wanted, but it was a mystery from the foundation of the world (Colossians 1:26\-27\). But blessed be God! The Lord Jesus gave us His life to make it possible. Now, anything that belongs to the Father belongs to us, because we’re one with Him; you’re His heir, and a joint\-heir with Christ. Hallelujah!

## TAKE YOUR PLACE AS A KING-PRIEST October 12th, 2020

>***Violence shall no more be heard in your land, nor devastation or destruction within your borders, but you shall call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise (Isaiah 60:18 AMPC).***

The spate of evil, wickedness and deception perpetrated by Satan and his cohorts around the world today is something only the Church of Jesus Christ can cut a swathe through. We’re the restraining force against evil in the earth today. We have the authority in the Name of Jesus to frustrate these satanic activities.

Through prayers, we can establish God’s righteousness in places hitherto governed by agents of darkness and the principalities of evil. Don’t sit idly by; take your place as a king\-priest, taking sides with the Lord in bringing His will to pass on earth.

Read the Psalmist’s inspiring words about our calling: the honour and privilege that belong to us, God’s saints: *“Let the saints be joyful in glory…Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people; To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD”* (Psalm 149:5\-9\).

Even now, declare boldly that the wicked spirits responsible for the upheaval and evil in the nations of the world are unseated; they’re cut down, and God’s glory reigns in the earth. Take a moment to pray fervidly in the spirit, affirming that all those instigating or sponsoring the agenda of the anti\-Christ in our day, their folly is made manifest, and their wicked works exposed and thwarted.

In these last days, God’s people shall continually declare His righteousness and praise boldly, leading more and more souls into salvation in Christ Jesus. Amen.

## JESUS—THE INCARNATE WORD October 13th, 2020

>***In the beginning, was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made (John 1:1\-3\).***

Just as no other apostle gave us the revelation of the Church like Paul, no one gave the Church the revelation of the Person of Jesus, the incarnate Word, like John. He tells us the story of the Word and starts from the beginning. In John 1:10\-14, he says, *“He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not…And the Word was made (became) flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.”* Hallelujah! Who was in the world that the world didn’t know?

You may answer, “Jesus!” But John that gave us this account didn’t say Jesus; he was referring to the Word. Read verse 14 again; it says, *“And the Word was made (became) flesh, and dwelt among us….”*John is letting you know the origin of Jesus. While the other Gospel writings (Matthew and Luke) began their accounts by tracing the earthly genealogy of Jesus, John’s Gospel declares His divinity, giving us the actual origin of the man, Christ Jesus—who He really is.

Jesus Christ is the Word that pre\-existed creation and by whom all things were created (John 1:1\-3\). His birth was a marvel, for the creative Word of God was wrapped in swaddling clothes; “the Word” had come to be with, and walk amongst men! That’s why they called Him “Emmanuel” (God with us) (Matthew 1:23\). Every step Jesus took was the Word of God in motion: the Word personified.

## HIS NAME HAS ALL POWER October 14th, 2020

>***And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues (Mark 16:17\).***

When you study and understand what the Bible says about the Name of Jesus, it’ll strengthen your faith and change your general attitude and approach to life. Philippians 2:9\-10 says, *“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.”*

At His Name, every knee bows, demons tremble and hell quakes. Hallelujah! He said, “In my name shall they (those who believe in Him) cast out devils.” You never need to sweat to cast out devils. All it requires is that you use the Name of Jesus.

The devil may play on your mind and tell you you’re not “qualified” or “powerful” enough to cast him out. Never accept his lies. Jesus gave you the authority. He said in Luke 10:19 NKJV, *“Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”*

You have all it takes to cast out devils—the Name of Jesus. Everything that exists in this world and beyond is subject to that Name. Live victoriously and dominate circumstances in His Name.

## OFFSPRING OF LOVE October 15th, 2020
![October 15th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-15-offspring-of-love.jpg)

>***Love endures long and is patient and kind; love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy, is not boastful or vainglorious, does not display itself haughtily (1 Corinthians 13:4 AMPC).***

The Bible tells us that God is love (1 John 4:8\); love is His nature—who He is. When we talk about the attributes of love, therefore, we’re talking about the attributes of God. Apply this to our theme verse and it’ll read, “God endures long and is patient and kind; God never is envious nor boils over with jealousy, God is not boastful or vainglorious, God does not display Himself haughtily.” Hallelujah!

Recall how Jesus lived when He walked the earth; He was love manifested. His works were works of love. His words were words of love. He was love in motion. Jesus in Galilee was the intrusion of love in the streets of Galilee. Love invaded that atmosphere. Now, what about you? The Bible says you’re God’s offspring (1 Peter 1:23\), meaning that you’re the reproduction of love.

The offspring of an eagle would be an eagle. The offspring of a human would be a human. The offspring of Love (God), therefore, is love! So, if your name is Philip, for example, you should say, “Philip endures long; Philip is patient and kind. Philip is never envious nor boils over with jealousy. Philip is not boastful or vainglorious. Philip does not display himself haughtily.” Praise God!

God’s Word shows us who we are; it’s a mirror. When you look at that mirror, don’t forget what you look like: patient, kind, tolerant, loving and humble. If arrogance or hatred tries to gain vent through you, refuse and declare, “I’m not arrogant; I’m humble. I’m full of love as Jesus is; I live in His Name; therefore, I walk and act like Him.”

Let the love of Christ, which is the bond of perfection, rule your heart always. Lavishly express the love\-nature of God in your spirit and radiate the beauty and glories of heaven to your world.

## KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND LIVE ACCORDINGLY October 16th, 2020

>***That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish (Ephesians 5:27\).***

As Christians, we’re different from those in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, they were called to obey the Word; but in the New Testament, we’re Word practitioners; we’re the expression of the Word; it’s called the mirror principle. God’s idea is that if He shows you who you are, you’d live accordingly.

Therefore, when you come across a verse such as Ephesians 4:25: *“Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour...,”* act exactly as He said by putting lying away. The mirror shows you as one who puts lying away, so do it. It’s not a commandment. In the Old Testament, it was a commandment not to lie; but in the New Testament, we do the Word and walk in truth. The Bible says *“...the law is not made for a righteous man...”* (1 Timothy 1:9\), and we’re God’s righteous ones (Romans 1:17\).

In the Old Testament, He gave them laws, but in the New Testament, He gave us His nature, His life of righteousness, so we can live right. It explains why if you did something that isn’t consistent with your nature of righteousness, you’re troubled from within. By your own spirit, you’re able to tell and judge, because of His light in you. This is why we teach righteousness, so God’s people can become conscious of who they are in Christ and live accordingly.

## FOLLOW THE WORD, NOT YOUR FEELINGS October 17th, 2020
![October 17th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-17-follow-the-word-not-your-feelings.jpg)

>***So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God (Romans 8:8\).***

In Christianity, we don’t judge by our feelings; we follow the Word. That you “feel” close to God or far from Him doesn’t make any difference. You live in Him and He lives in you. How much closer can you get to someone who lives in you?

God wants you to know and grow in the knowledge of His Word, and walk in the light of your oneness with Him. He wants you to live by what the Word says about you, and not by your feelings or the opinions of others. The devil may lie to you and make you feel you’re still a sinner, but don’t be deceived. The day you gave your heart to Christ, you were recreated and became the righteousness of God in Him.

2 Corinthians 5:17 says, *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”* God had to tell you this because your mind doesn’t know it and can’t comprehend it. It’s revelation knowledge for the human spirit, through the Holy Spirit.

Irrespective of how you may “feel,” He wants you to “see,” to reckon that you’re in Christ now. The old habits are passed away; the old frustrations and struggles are passed away. You have a brand\-new life of glory and righteousness. Hallelujah!

## YOU OWN THE WORLD October 18th, 2020

>***All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you (John 16:15\).***

Nobody ever talked like Jesus. Imagine His audacious words in the verse above! He said, *“All things that the Father hath are mine.”* The beautiful thing is that He’s made it so for you too. Romans 8:17 says you’re an heir of God, and a joint\-heir with Christ. Hallelujah!

In 1 Corinthians 3:21, the Apostle Paul said, *“Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours.”* He went further in the 22nd verse to say the world is yours. How can anyone know this and be in lack or want? Peter understood it and declared, *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness…”* (2 Peter 1:3\).

If you’d accept, meditate and live by this truth, you wouldn’t be intimidated by anything, whether circumstances, powers or government. You’d think big, because you’re conscious that the world belongs to you in Christ Jesus.

Interestingly, He didn’t say the world belongs to those who live in the “best” countries of the world. Think about it: where was Jesus born? A very small town in a small country. But from that small country, He dominated the world. He told His disciples, *“… be of good cheer; I have overcome the world”* (John 16:33\). He couldn’t be limited by His earthly nativity or geographical location.

Your success or greatness has nothing to do with where you live, where you were born, who your parents are, or the job you do. It’s about who you are in Christ. As heirs of the Sovereign God, the Word declares that all things are yours; have this consciousness and live in dominion and self\-sufficiency every day.

>***But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me (Romans 10:20\).***

There’re still many who haven’t understood true Christianity; therefore, they go about seeking God. You may say, “But Jeremiah 29:13\-14 says, *‘And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity….”’* This scripture isn’t for the Christian. Being born again, you’re not in captivity. Jeremiah was referring to Israel. Don’t live an Old Testament life in the New Testament. Stop seeking God! He lives in you.

Colossians 2:6 says, having received Christ Jesus the Lord, we should continue to live in Him. Therefore, we’re not seeking Him; we have Him. We’ve arrived, for we’re born of Him, into His presence.

Christianity isn’t about pressing into God’s presence; Christianity is carrying God’s presence. You’re His living tabernacle of witness. When you arrive anywhere, God’s presence arrives! You’re “the presence.” Hallelujah! Paul said we make manifest the savour of His knowledge in every place (2 Corinthians 2:14\). When you show up, He shows up, because you’re one with Him.

The moment you realise this, your search is over. From that moment, your worship changes; your prayer\-life changes; your faith\-life changes; everything changes! You’d find that you’re walking in fulfilment twenty\-four hours a day, every day of your life, pleasing Him in all things. Blessed be His Name forever!

## JESUS IS THE EXPRESS IMAGE OF GOD October 20th, 2020

>***Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? (John 14:8\-9\).***

The Bible says in Jesus dwells the fullness of the Godhead in bodily form (Colossians 2:9\), meaning anyone who wants to know what God looks like should look at Jesus. No wonder Jesus said to Philip, *“…he that hath seen me hath seen the Father.”*Jesus is the express image of the Father’s Person. 

Some believe that, in heaven, there’re three thrones: one for the Father, one for the Son, Jesus, and then another for the Holy Spirit; but that’s not true. The Father joyfully appointed Jesus as the heir of all things, including His throne.

Thus in heaven, there’s only one throne, and Jesus is the one sitting on that throne. Where then is the Father? He’s in Jesus! The Bible says it pleased the Father, that in Him (Jesus) should all fullness dwell (Colossians 1:19\). Then Colossians 2:9 lets us know that in Him (Jesus) dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily. If you’ve seen Jesus, you’ve seen the Father.

No wonder when He said in John 10:30, *“I and my Father are one,”* the Jews picked up stones and wanted to kill Him; why? They said He made Himself equal with God: *“…for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God”* (John 10:33\).

The Jews understood what Jesus meant when He said, *“I and my Father are one.”* But they considered His words blasphemous because they didn’t know who He was. Jesus is the perfect image and icon of the Godhead. He’s the expression of God’s glory, and by inheritance, He obtained a more excellent Name in all of heaven and earth. Philippians 2:9\-11 declares, *“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth. And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”* He’s the King of kings, and Lord of lords. Hallelujah!

## KNOW HIM AS LORD October 21st, 2020

>***Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (Philippians 2:9\-11\).***

When we say, “Jesus is Lord,” it’s much more than a religious expression; it means He’s One with supreme authority. He’s Master and Ruler; He’s the One to be reverenced and adored! That’s what “Lord” means.

Some have only been acquainted with Him as Saviour, but He’s more than a Saviour. He’s the One that has the pre\-eminence, and to whom service and obedience are due. You must know Jesus in this light and walk in this consciousness every day. In your family, business, academics, job, finances and everything that has to do with your life, relate to Him as Lord! In other words, let Him have supremacy and ascendancy. Let Him have the final say in all that concerns you.

Remember, He’s the only wise God; therefore, submit to the supremacy of His will, counsel and wisdom. And if you’ve never been born again, if you haven’t yet made Jesus the Lord of your life, say this prayer and mean it with all your heart: “O Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ, Son of the living God. I believe He died for me and God raised Him from the dead. I confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of my life. Through Him and in His Name, I have eternal life; I’m born again. Thank you Lord, for saving my soul! I’m now a child of God. Hallelujah!”

## YOU’RE IN THE LIGHT October 22nd, 2020

>***But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: (1 Peter 2:9\).***

The underlined portion of the verse above lets you know your present location; you’ve been brought out of darkness into God’s marvellous light. That light is the light of life that shows you the path of righteousness, life and dominion. It’s like what the Lord did for the children of Israel in the Old Testament; He brought them out of Egypt, which represented darkness, into the Promised Land, which symbolizes light!

Darkness represents sin, death, evil and all the negatives of life. You’ve been brought out of sin, sickness, disease, depression, poverty and frustrations, into God’s Kingdom of light. This isn’t something the Lord will do for you as you grow in Christ; He’s already done it. Colossians 1:12\-13 says, *“Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.”*

When you made Jesus Lord of your life, you were translated into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son; it’s a spiritual kingdom of light, where you reign in life by grace through righteousness. You’re not subject to the darkness and failing systems and structures of this world. You’ve been brought into the supernatural life of glory where you shine evermore. No wonder He said in Isaiah 60:1, *“Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.”*

## THREE IMPORTANT REASONS TO WIN SOULS October 23rd, 2020
![October 23rd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-23-three-important-reasons-to-win-souls.jpg)

 ---

>***And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15\).***

Some have asked if Christians who never won souls to Christ would go to heaven. Their question is based on what the Lord said in Ezekiel 33:2\-6 (read entire text). There’re three important reasons you must preach the Gospel and win souls as a Christian. First is your faith in the Lord Jesus and His glorious Gospel. The second reason is your love for Him and hope of His soon return. The third reason is His instruction for us to win souls. These three reasons should compel you to win souls.

If you don’t win souls, then your love for the Lord is questionable. Also, your hope of heaven is called to question, as well as your obedience to the Master’s instruction. So if you’re not a soul winner, it means you really don’t believe, and heaven isn’t a place for the “unbelieving,” as it isn’t for murderers, idolaters, etc. Revelation 21:8 says*, “But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”* 

God has determined that souls be won to His Kingdom, and He’s given us the responsibility to locate the lost in our world and share the Gospel with them. Therefore, you MUST reach the unreached and bring them to Christ; it’s your primary and solemn responsibility as a child of God.

The Apostle Paul, recognizing this, writes, *“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ...”* (2 Corinthians 5:19\-20\). Be fully committed to the Gospel and its furtherance around the world.

## HAVE THE RAPTURE IN FOCUS October 24th, 2020
![October 24th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-24-have-the-rapture-in-focus.jpg)

>***And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming (1 John 2:28\).***

The rapture of the Church is closer than ever. We’re in the closing moments or final “times of the signs” before the Lord’s appearing. It’s important that you’re ready for Him. 1 Thessalonians 4:16\-17 says the dead “in Christ” shall rise first, and those who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air.

The question is: are you in Christ? If you are, then you’re one of the many the Lord is coming to receive unto Himself. If, however, you’re not, you have to give your heart to Christ right away, by confessing His Lordship over your life. The Bible says, *“...Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation”* (Hebrews 9:28\).

Acts 1:9\-11 tells us about His ascension into heaven. While the disciples stood, gazing in awe as He levitated, two angels appeared to them and said, “This same Jesus, who has been received from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven” (Acts 1:11\). This is the reason we’re preaching the Gospel around the world. The whole world needs to know that the rapture of the Church is imminent; the Master is coming soon.

He said in John 14:3, *“…I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.”* The Apostle Peter, referring to the day of the Lord and the events that’ll herald His coming, said, *“But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness”* (2 Peter 3:10\-11\).

Have the rapture in focus. Live every day as one expecting the Master; carry that consciousness in your heart at all times. Walk in love. Walk in righteousness. And while you’re getting yourself ready, help those around you to get ready as well by preaching and teaching them God’s Word.



---  
<details>
  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
I’m awake and alert in the spirit, fervent in good works, being propelled by the Master’s love, His Word, and my expectation of His soon return. I’m fully convinced that the Gospel is God’s saving power to everyone who believes; I’m resolute in my pursuit for the souls of men. Today, as this glorious Gospel is preached around the world, many are snatched out of the kingdom of darkness into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## UNVEILING THE CHRIST-LIFE IN YOU October 25th, 2020

>***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27\).***

Christianity is the outworking of the Word of God in a human person. As a Christian, you’re essentially the image of Christ; every step you take should be the expression of the divine life in you. That’s how Jesus lived when He walked the earth. He was the manifestation of God: the expression of the divine life.

You’re Christ alive to your world, your family, workplace, neighbourhood, city, and country; in that place where you are—you’re the Christ that they see. Therefore, your words and actions, the life you live, the way you do the things you do, should express the Christ\-nature in you.

When people look at you, they should see the glory of the new creation. You’re a God\-carrying vessel; carry this consciousness with you today; this is God’s dream for your life. True success is God manifesting and expressing Himself in, and through you; it’s how much His personality and character are revealed through you. Your goal, therefore, should be to always reveal Him.

Everything you do should be about one thing only: the manifestation of the Christ\-life in you; His perfection and righteousness expressed through you. Hallelujah!

## HE SPONSORS THE SOUL WINNER October 26th, 2020
![October 26th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-26-he-sponsors-the-soul-winner.jpg)

>***Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants…Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me (Philippians 2:25\-30\).***

We have a divine commission to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth. Jesus said: *“...Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature”* (Mark 16:15\). Then in Luke 22:35, He asked His disciples something rather remarkable: *“...When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.”* It shows that when God sends you on an assignment, He sees to it that everything you require to accomplish it is available to you. All God needs from you is your commitment to the task. The soul winner is sponsored by God. Therefore, be determined that there’ll be no limit to how far you’re willing to go in spreading the Gospel around the world.

As far as God is with you and has made your body His living tabernacle, the Gospel won’t be limited. That’s the kind of commitment we see in the Apostle Paul, and it’s worth emulating. He said, “Woe unto me, if I don’t preach the Gospel” (1 Corinthians 9:16\).

Some people have committed their time and resources to ensuring the Gospel reaches every nation of the world. They do great exploits in advancing God’s agenda, making up for the lack or short\-comings of others. They give so much money to the furtherance of the Gospel; and the more they give, the more the Lord channels resources their way so they can accomplish greater things for Him. He’ll supply all you ever require to fulfil His purpose of soul winning.

Decide that through you, the Gospel will continue to prosper, and you’ll keep at it, until the rapture of the Church.

## CUSTODIANS OF THE MESSAGE THAT WORKS October 27th, 2020
![October 27th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-27-custodians-of-the-message-that-works.jpg)

>***How then shall they call on him in whom they have not…heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? (Romans 10:14\).***

Imagine having custody of a message—the only message that guarantees the salvation of men and can change the world! This glorious Gospel of the blessed Lord Jesus Christ has been committed to your trust (1 Timothy 1:11\). You’re the steward of the mysteries of Christ, and it’s required that you’re faithful (1 Corinthians 4:2\).

Don’t be unfaithful in fulfilling your ministry in the Gospel; don’t treat it with levity. You can win a soul today. These are the last days; don’t hope that, somehow, people will just hear and believe in Jesus; do something about it. Take the message out by yourself. Become more passionate about the Gospel!

The Gospel of Christ makes sinners righteous. It catapults the poor from obscurity, penury and misery to a life of prosperity, glory and excellence. It’s the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes (Romans 1:16\). But they can’t hear and believe without a preacher.

The sick need to know that there’s a saviour and a healer who gives them a new life, a life that’s divine and superior to sickness. Such glorious news! But you’re the one He trusts to preach and tell it everywhere.

To live without Christ is to live without God; in damnation. That’s why you must be fervent in spirit, preaching the Gospel (Romans 12:11\). You’ve been sent to take the light of the Gospel to those living in darkness (Acts 13:47\). Therefore, don’t hold back; don’t be apologetic. Be bold and recognize that you’re the custodian of the message that works.



---  
<details>
  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Blessed Father, I pray for all who will hear the Gospel today, that the message profits them, resulting in salvation. I celebrate your righteousness and glorious power that’s unveiled around the world today, through the preaching of the Gospel, as many are brought out of darkness into your glorious light, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## LIVING IN HIS AUTHORITY October 28th, 2020
![October 28th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-28-living-in-his-authority.jpg)

 ---

>***For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring (Acts 17:28\).***

True Christianity is living in the Name of Jesus. The very thought of this is so awe\-inspiring. Colossians 3:17 says, *“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, **do all in the name of the Lord Jesus**….*”

Doing all things in His Name means living in His Name. That’s the key to a supernatural life. That means you’re living for Him, in His authority. Therefore, defeat, failure and darkness can’t be a part of your life. Life for you is glory only; upward and forward, because the Name of Jesus is named upon you. His Name represents His authority and His character.

The Father gave Jesus a Name that’s above every name and set Him far above all things for the benefit of the Church. Ephesians 1:22\-23 says *God “…hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.”*

The Church is His body, and since all things have been placed beneath His feet, Satan is under your feet! Failure, sickness, poverty and death are all under your feet. Everything in life is subject to you because you’re seated with Christ in heavenly places.

If you find yourself in a distressing situation, declare, “In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I decree a change!” Reign and subdue circumstances in His Name. You have the authority in His Name to reject anything that’s not of God and endorse only that which is consistent with His perfect will for you.

## TALK RIGHT AND HAVE A GREAT LIFE October 29th, 2020

>***…for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me (Hebrews 13:5\-6\).***

Proverbs 6:2 says, *“Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.”* This scripture underscores the precarious situations many have found themselves in today. They’ve been bound by their words. It’s so important that you talk right as a child of God.

When you talk right, you’ll live right; your life will turn out right. Proverbs 18:20 says, *“A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.”* This is referring to the words of wisdom pouring out of your mouth. If you don’t want to be broke, for example, then don’t talk poverty. Consciously speak in agreement with the Word always about your life, finances, business, health, etc.

Proverbs 18:21 says, *“Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.”* You’ll reap a harvest of good things through your words. Words are things; they are a creative force. Your life today is the result of your words. Proverbs 15:4 says, *“A wholesome tongue is a tree of life….”* If your words are wholesome, your life will be perfect, excellent and inspiring.

Proverbs 12:18 says, *“…the tongue of the wise is health.”* Keep yourself in health with your words. Talk faith, success and increase. 1 Peter 3:10 says, *“For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.”* This is a law of the Spirit and it works, whether or not you believe it. So, talk right and have a great life.

My words are potent, bringing forth victories, increase, promotions and abundance for me.

## PARTAKERS AND DISPENSERS OF DIVINE LIFE October 30th, 2020
![October 30th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-30-partakers-and-dispensers-of-divine-life.jpg)

>***For the scripture says, “The first man, Adam, was created a living being”; but the last Adam is the life\-giving Spirit (1 Corinthians 15:45 GNB).***

2 Peter 1:4 says*, “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.”* Being partakers of the divine nature means we’re associates of the God\-kind; we’re in comradeship with divinity. But that’s not all!

Not only did He graciously grant us to be sharers of His life, He also made us the dispensers or distributors of that life. In John 10:10, the Lord Jesus declared, *“…I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”* He came to give eternal life to those who would believe in Him. No wonder He’s described in our opening verse as the life\-giving Spirit.

Now, having been born again, you’re one with Him; He made you a life\-giving spirit. Like Him, your life’s purpose is to bring the lost into the life of righteousness through the Gospel. Jesus said in John 20:21, *“…as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.”* You’re His representative in the earth, to manifest the God\-life in your world.

You’re the bearer of eternal verities. When you show up, life is manifested. When you touch the sick and the afflicted, the life in you is transferred and transfused into them, bringing them wholeness and perfection. No wonder Jesus charged us in Matthew 10:8, *“Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils....”*

As you show up with the consciousness that you’re the carrier of His divine essence and people listen to you share the Word, eternal life is unveiled to them. And everything of darkness bows. The Bible says He brought life and immortality to light, through the Gospel (2 Timothy 1:10\). Hallelujah!

## WISDOM FOR A GREAT LIFE October 31st, 2020

>***How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver! (Proverbs 16:16\).***

1 Corinthians 1:30 says, *“But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom….”* Christ Jesus is your wisdom; and who is Jesus? The Word; and the Word of God is the wisdom of God. To ignore God’s Word would be to ignore wisdom.

The Bible says, *“Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed…”* (Proverbs 13:13\). God’s wisdom is the key to a great life. In Ephesians 1, the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, prayed for the church at Ephesus that God would grant them *“…wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him”* (Ephesians 1:17\).

It doesn’t matter the books you’ve read or who your advisers are; for you to be a true success in life, you must walk in divine wisdom. The best part is that Christ, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, lives in you. Therefore, you have insight into mysteries and secrets of life and of the Kingdom. Acknowledge this about yourself always.

Even now, declare that you make wise choices and decisions, because the Spirit of wisdom is at work in you. Affirm that divine wisdom is heard and seen in you today. Affirm that your actions and words are in sync with God’s plan, purpose and will, for you function by divine insight. Glory to God!
