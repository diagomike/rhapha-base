>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues (Mark 16:17\).

  


Until Jesus came, people didn’t have the accurate information about demons and evil spirits. A lot of things that many had thought were ordinary were shown by Jesus to be spiritual. For example, He made us aware that most sicknesses and diseases had devils behind them. When they brought someone who was deaf and dumb to Him, the Bible says He cast the spirit out. And right away, the deaf ears were unstopped and the person began to hear, and the dumb tongue was loosened. Luke 11:14 says, “And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.”

  


Mark 1:32\-34 reveals the same truth: “And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. And all the city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.” There’re many today that are ignorant of demonic activities. But the reality is, there’re evil spirits that are running people’s lives. Sometimes, you find someone who has a fierce and violent temper. They said his father was like that, and he thinks it’s normal, but it’s not. It’s evil spirits that make those things happen.

  


The Bible talks of unclean spirits, which also make people unclean, and do evil things in the lives of human beings. Some of them are responsible for the frustrations some people experience in their lives. You find very successful people in various fields who suddenly fall back to emptiness. They lose everything, not knowing they’re being invaded by demonic forces.

  


But thanks be unto God! In Christ, you have authority over demons to cast them out from your affairs. You don’t need a minister to help you cast out demons. Jesus said every one of us who believes in Him would cast out devils in His Name (Mark 16:17\); it’s a sign of our divinity. So, if there’ve been events and actions around you that you’re uncomfortable with, and you perceive Satan to be behind them, cast him out!

Thank you, blessed Lord, for my authority in Christ over demons and the powers of darkness. Even now, I walk in the light of this authority by forbidding Satan and his demons from exerting upon or influencing anything that has to do with me. I hold off demonic activities in my family and workplace today, in the Name of Jesus. Amen.

## YOU CAN FREE YOURSELF April 3rd, 2020

>***Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you (John 15:3\).***

There’s a strong connection between bad habits and demonic influence; and frankly, they flow into each other. The human person is a spirit, and so, if he has a habit, it’s a spiritual habit. Habits are formed from repetition of actions. There’re good habits and there’re bad habits. If you practise good actions, they result in good habits; if you practise bad actions, they result in bad habits.

Satan often takes the opportunity of bad habits to manipulate people. However, he can’t force his will upon anyone ordinarily; rather, it’s about man yielding himself to the devil or refusing to do so. If he yields himself to the devil, then the devil takes advantage of him. Most people yield themselves without realizing they’re doing it. Hence, walking in the spirit and the knowledge of the Word is vital to a victorious Christian life.

In our opening scripture, Jesus said, *“Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.”* This means the Word of God is a cleanser; it purifies you. If you take the Word of God and meditate on it, it’ll rid you of anything that’s unwholesome or unclean. It’ll eradicate the darkness from your life.

Once, I was ministering to a lady, and rebuking the devil from her, and there was a young man standing behind me among those who were watching. When I was done, he got my attention and said, “Pastor, I used to have the same problem that you just dealt with in that lady. I had those same evil spirits in me.” I said, “So what happened?” He said, “Through meditation on God’s Word, they all left me.” That’s the power of God’s Word!

You don’t need to have deliverance services to cast out devils from Christians; teach them the Word. The Christian is superior to Satan; he’s seated with Christ, far above principality and power. So, if you’ve been under some demonic attacks or influence, if you’d consciously meditate on God’s Word, you’ll free yourself. You can say, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, I break the influence of Satan and evil spirits over my life and my actions and refuse to yield to their sway henceforth!”

## STIR YOUR SPIRIT FOR ANSWERS April 4th, 2020

>***For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries (1 Corinthians 14:2\).***

Sometimes, people experience certain things in their lives that they shouldn’t and are completely at a loss for answers. For example, you could find that as a Christian, you seem to be experiencing a certain kind of pain or discomfort that wouldn’t go away. You might have prayed, rebuked the pain, and even rebuked the devil, but to no avail. Now, you’re wondering what the problem could be. Look to your spirit for the answer.

As God’s children, we’re never in the dark about anything. You can know anything, if you’d do what the Scripture says. Speak in tongues and receive answers from your spirit; your inner man. Before long, the mystery about that situation will come to your understanding. Jesus said, *“...he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life”* (John 8:12\). You’re not supposed to walk in darkness about your finances, your health, your career, business, ministry or any area of your life.

The light of God is in your spirit. The Bible says, *“The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly”* (Proverbs 20:27\). If you have concerns about your health or about anything, speak in tongues. Don’t just run to the doctors or places you think you might find help. Consult with the Holy Spirit first; you’ll be amazed how quickly His light and wisdom will well up within you, showing you precisely what to do. He’s in you to help you understand certain things about yourself and about life. He’ll show you the future and guide you to take specific steps in line with His plans for your life. Hallelujah!

Dear Father, thank you for the guidance of your Spirit. As I speak in tongues, the eyes of my understanding are flooded with light.

## MAKE THE RIGHT CONFESSIONS April 5th, 2020

>***Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips (Hosea 14:2\).***

Words are so important. As a matter of fact, words are everything. Every time you speak, you shape your life and future; you chart your course. You’re the product of your words. Therefore, it’s up to you to chart your course for a greater and brighter future, with your words. Don’t talk to promote the problems and difficulties you’re facing; declare your victories. Have the right words in your mouth.

You may have read the inspiring story of the Shunammite woman in 2 Kings 4:8\-36\. Even though her son had died, she hurried off to the Prophet Elisha with only one declaration on her lips, “It is well.” She wasn’t screaming for help or complaining; rather, she went to the prophet of God with the right confession, and she got a miracle. She didn’t speak on the basis of her situation; rather, she spoke in agreement with God. The Bible says in Isaiah 3:10 DRB, *“Say to the just man (the righteous) that it is well….”*

Jesus said in Mark 11:23 that you shall have what you say; the woman said it was well, and her confession produced results. Choose always to make the right confessions. Meditate on the Word to help you form the right mind\-set, because before you can talk right, you must first think right. God’s Word renews your mind and produces faith in your heart.

This is why you must constantly fellowship with the Word. Colossians 3:16 says to let the Word dwell in you richly; let it gain the mastery in you, and out of that abundance, you’ll speak (Matthew 12:34\). The Word on your lips will prevail and catapult you to higher levels of success, victory and prosperity.

God already ordained your triumphant and victorious life; your role is to respond by affirming the same things in consent (Hebrews 13:5\-6\). Even now, affirm that you have a great life. Acknowledge and declare that you’re excellent and full of glory, living the life of righteousness, dominion and glory in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!

## ACCEPT REBUKE AND CORRECTION April 6th, 2020

>***All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16\).***

Some people grew up in homes where no one could reprimand them for wrong doing; not even their parents. It explains why, even after giving their hearts to Christ, they still find it difficult to accept correction in the house of God. But that isn’t right for a Christian. Read our theme verse again; it says God’s Word is profitable for doctrine, rebuke, correction and instruction in righteousness.

You have to learn to accept correction in the house of God, because that’s one of the ways by which the Holy Spirit, through the Word, helps you develop godly character. Be humble and pay attention to your leaders as they instruct you in the Word. There’re certain things people learnt in their natural lives before coming to Christ; things that aren’t consistent with the Christ\-nature. Those things aren’t suddenly put away by salvation. That’s the reason for the renewing of the mind, through meditation on God’s Word. For example, Ephesians 4:31 says, *“Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice.”* This was written to people who were already Christians.

 

It’s important that you yield to the Word to mould your character and give you a new mind\-set. Refuse to accept and allow your senses to dominate or control you. Don’t be inflated with pride when someone is talking to you, trying to correct you with the Word of God. Accepting rebuke and correction is humility; it reveals your greatness, because truly great people are very humble.

## YOUR LIFE IS THE REAL MESSAGE April 7th, 2020

>***And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18\).***

Being born again, you’ve been commissioned to preach the Gospel; to take the message of Christ’s salvation to your world and beyond. But did you know that much more than the things you say as you witness for Christ, your life is the real message? When people see you, what would be their testimony of you as it pertains to Christ? Your life is the real message. In other words, what you preach and teach must first be evident in your own life.

It’s often said, “Practise what you preach”; but the reverse, “Preach what you practise” is also right. It’s a hard sell to try to impact someone else with a message or Gospel that hasn’t yet impacted your own life. So, as one ordained to bear the message of the divine life, the impact of that message must first reflect in the quality of your personality.

People should look at you and see the results of your preaching. It begins with you digesting the Word for yourself; understanding it and doing the Word in every situation. Become fully yielded to the Word of God to mould your life and character and help you lead a life of righteousness. That way, you’ll certainly bear fruits of righteousness.

2 Corinthians 3:6 AMPC says that God *“…has qualified us \[making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient] as ministers and dispensers of a new covenant \[of salvation through Christ], not \[ministers] of the letter (of legally written code) but of the Spirit….”* Nevertheless, the real message that you have is a revelation of what’s inside you.

Don’t be a “professional preacher.” No matter what you preach or teach, at the end of the day, the most important thing is the true life that you have inside; that’s your real message. Therefore, invest in God’s Word for personal development. Build your life with the Word by taking your times of study and meditation seriously.

## CONSISTENT PROGRESS April 8th, 2020

>***But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day (Proverbs 4:18\).***

One of the things you want to see in your life is consistent success. When I say, “I’m always moving upward and forward,” it’s not an exaggeration or a confession of something that I want to happen; no! It’s the reality of my life, made possible by the power of God’s Word. I’m always making progress; that’s our life in Christ.

You can be very consistent, making progress in your work, in ministry, and in every area of your life. For the Christian, being circumstantially prosperous isn’t prosperity. Some people can be prosperous because of the conditions of the time. When the economic conditions are favourable, they do well, but when there’s a change, their prosperity takes a nosedive. That’s not good enough.

Study Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; they prospered, walking with God, irrespective of the economic conditions of the times. Genesis 26:12\-14 talks about Isaac, and how he prospered so much at a time of famine, that the entire country envied him: *“Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.”*

This is how it ought to be for every one of us, because we’re the seed of Abraham. Everything about God and the life He’s given us depicts consistency. Therefore, refuse to settle for undulating success. Declare, “My life is upward and forward only,” and then stick to the Word. Practise the Word; that’s the secret to a life of unending success.

1 Timothy 4:15 (GNB) lets us know that meditating on the Word of God is the guarantee for sustainable progress. Paul wrote to Timothy:  *“Practice these things and devote yourself to them, in order that your progress may be seen by all.”* Hallelujah!

## WE’RE CHRIST’S EPISTLES April 9th, 2020

>***You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody (2 Corinthians 3:2 NIV).***

When you study the verse above in the Amplified Classic Version, you’d notice a bit of difference. It says, *“\[No] you yourselves are our letter of recommendation (our credentials), written in your hearts, to be known (perceived, recognized) and read by everybody.”* Notice the underlined phrase; in the NIV and the KJV, it says “our hearts” while the Amplified says, “your hearts.” Why is there such a difference?

When the translators work, they don’t always focus on all the points that are required. Sometimes, they focus on principle, context, message or pure language. It depends on what their vision was and their readiness to review complexities in the text. When you find some complex areas, what you need is the ministry of the Spirit to really give you guidance. The verse above is a complex area; not the verse itself, but the truth packaged therein; it’s such a powerful reality, but a bit complex. It says, *“…you yourselves are our letter of recommendation (our credentials), written in your hearts…”* (AMPC).

Now, when you read the epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, for example, you probably got excited at the truths. But that was a written epistle; and here the Bible says you’re a living epistle, known and read by everybody; a letter from Christ! This is amazing. Who is Jesus? He’s the living Word; the Word who became flesh. To be Christ’s epistle, therefore, means you’re Christ’s Word in flesh, and Christ’s Word is God’s Word.

So, you’re the Word of God in flesh. Some people can’t handle this with their religious mind, but it’s simple to understand when you realize that in life, everything gives birth after its kind: dogs give birth to dogs; humans give birth to humans; the Word gives birth to the Word. 1 Peter 1:23 says, *“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”* As offsprings of the Word, we’re the epistles (word) of Christ. Hallelujah!

## YOU’VE GOT TO “WRITE…” April 10th, 2020

>***\[No] you yourselves are our letter of recommendation (our credentials), written in your hearts, to be known (perceived, recognized) and read by everybody. You show and make obvious that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, not written with ink but with \[the] Spirit of \[the] living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts (2 Corinthians 3:2\-3 AMPC).***

Some Bible translators felt that Paul couldn’t have written on the hearts of others, and therefore, they assumed he meant, “We carry the thoughts of you in our hearts.” But the next verse contradicts this. It says, “You’re the epistle of Christ ministered by us.” What does this mean, and how does this work? Now, it’s not enough for it to be written in your heart. As you study this devotional, for example, the Word is being ministered to you, but not all that’s contained in the Gospel is coming to you right now. 

Moreover, think about the fact that Peter too ministered the Gospel and wrote letters to the churches, but he didn’t come with all of the truth of the Gospel. Paul was given a dispensation of it to bring to the Church, but it’s the same Gospel. Peter brings the generality of the Gospel, and Paul brings the specific, intricate, analytical details of the Gospel; how the Church should run. He wrote about the structure of the Church, and the new creation in Christ; he wrote those revelations in “letters”—epistles to the churches. 

Now, there’s the Word of God ministered to you (the letter), which you’ve received to become the “epistle of Christ,” but that may not be sufficient for the life that God wants you to live. So, what are you going to do? You’ve got to “write” your own truth as inspired by the Word. Read the concluding part of our theme verse again; it shows the result of the ministry of the Word that came to you. The Word of faith has been ministered to you; you’ve become a bearer or messenger of that same word; you believe it, you’re talking it, but that’s not enough, because what you have is what has been ministered to you. There’re some others that you have to “write” or draft for yourself.

The one you heard preached or taught was written to you, or written into you—into the tablet of your heart. But when you’re done with that, like when you’re done studying today’s devotional, what are you going to write? That’s what really transforms your life and sustains you on the glory highway. We’ll learn more and review how this works in our next study.

## WRITING THE WORD IN YOUR HEART April 11th, 2020

>***...My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer (Psalm 45:1\).***

As a student in school, when you were being taught, the teachers gave you notes or you took notes as they were lecturing. When you got out of class, you went back to study more on the subject, and made more notes, and as a result, you had better knowledge than what was taught in class. That way, you did better during exams than the guy who didn’t go the extra mile to research, study some more, and make his own notes.

The foregoing illustration was to further help you understand our study today, picking up from our previous study. We learnt that the Word is written in your heart, but it’s what you write that’s more important. So, how are you going to write it? Our opening verse gives us the answer. It says, “My heart is composing something; it’s framing something, and my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.” So, how do you write something on your heart? It’s with your tongue; you write in your heart with your tongue.

This is the reason for meditating on the Word. There’re three levels of meditation: you ponder, you mutter, and you roar. You think through the Word, mutter or speak it under your breath, and then you voice it. When it gets to coming out of your mouth boldly, you’re writing it on your heart—on the tables of your heart. If you don’t write it in your heart, you’re not going to have it when you need it. So, write the Word in your heart with your tongue, by affirmations.

Your tongue is the pen of a skillful writer; as you study or listen to the Word, you find your heart overflowing with this composition. As you speak forth the Word, it gets framed on your heart.

Writing it in your notes is with ink; but He wants it written on the fleshy tables of your heart. Read it; it says, *“...written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart”* (2 Corinthians 3:3\). Hallelujah! When you have it inside, out of that abundance, you’ll bring forth good things. Blessed be God!

## OUR SUBSTITUTE IN DEATH AND RESURRECTION April 12th, 2020

>***But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him… (Isaiah 53:5\).***

The Lord Jesus suffered and endured the pain and shame of the Cross, not because of His sins or for Himself, but for us. He took our place and bore the punishment for sin on our behalf. While on the Cross, bearing the burden of our sins, He cried out in anguish, *“…My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”* (Mark 15:34\).

God turned His back on Jesus because our sins were laid on Him. Habakkuk 1:13 tells us that God is holy and doesn’t behold iniquity. The separation from the Father, on account of our sins, was what Jesus never wanted, for which He prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, “Father, if you be willing, take this cup away from me, nevertheless not my will, but your will be done” (Matthew 26:39\).

The Father’s will prevailed. Jesus died on the Cross, and descended into hell. He was put to grief. Upon taking all the punishment that was necessary, the Bible says He was justified in the Spirit (1 Timothy 3:16\) and was raised back to life. He was raised to life for our justification: *“Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification”* (Romans 4:25\).

To be justified means to be acquitted of guilt; to be declared righteous. He was our substitute in death as well as our substitute in resurrection. When He died, you died with Him; when He was buried, you were buried with Him. When God raised Him from the dead, you were also raised together with Him in newness of life! Now, you’re sin\-free; at complete liberty to serve the Lord and live for Him in glory and righteousness. You’ve become not just righteous, but also the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. Such a blessed reality!

## FILL YOUR HEART WITH THE RIGHT WORDS April 13th, 2020

>***If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain (James 1:26\).***

To deceive your heart is to make your spirit believe a lie. It’s like what Paul referenced in 2 Timothy 2:25, talking about those that oppose themselves. For example, a Christian that consistently speaks lack, sickness, weakness and defeat is opposing himself; he’s deceiving his own heart, because he’s speaking contrary to the will and provisions of Christ in His Gospel. Such words will go into his spirit as seed, and if not overturned, will grow and produce result.

Remember the words of Jesus in Mark 4:26\-27: *“…So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.”* All the sower needed was to sow the seed; and the seed is the Word, and the heart of man is the ground that receives it (Mark 4:14\-15\). So, don’t sow the wrong seed in your heart by speaking carnal words. Speak the things that have been freely given to you by God: *“Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual”* (1 Corinthians 2:13\).

God has prepared great things for you. He’s given you everything you require for a glorious and excellent life in righteousness. These things are revealed in the Word and unveiled to your spirit by the Holy Spirit, who searches or scans the deep things of God. Your spirit functions like the Holy Spirit, scanning through your innermost being, for the words you’ve sown therein, so as to produce for you a harvest.

Therefore, keep sowing the right words into your heart. The Bible says out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.

## THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD April 14th, 2020

>***To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:19\).***

Many in the Church really don’t understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ. You couldn’t understand the Gospel and not be enthused and compelled by its truth. It’s not an assumption; it’s not some fairytale; the Gospel is real and sublime.

Think about it: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; God, in human flesh, came into this world to take the place of sinful man. He was crucified on the Cross, buried, and rose from the dead and He’s alive today. Everything He accomplished on the Cross was for the whole world.

When He died on the Cross, we died in Him. When He was buried, we were buried in Him. When God raised Him up, we were raised together with Him. Today, because He lives, we live also. What a story! The One who knew no sin was made to be sin for us that we might become the righteousness of God in Him!

Our opening verse says, *“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.”* I’m compelled by this truth of the Gospel that, whereas we were all dead, cut off from the life of God, now in Christ we live. What a hope! What a message! There’s nothing like it in the world; it’s the greatest story ever told. It’s as fresh as tomorrow!

To think that this is the Gospel that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs looked forward to! This is the same Gospel that Moses, David and all of the prophets that spoke about Christ, prophesied about. This is the Gospel that we’ve embraced; that has become so real to our spirits. How amazing! It’s an unending song, an ever\-flowing stream of bliss. How could I ever see and think but through His eyes and love only!

When I think about Jesus and what the Gospel means, and all that He’s done for us, I’m compelled to make it known to the world. What about you? Would you join to take this saving message to the ends of the earth?

## THE LOVE OF THE FATHER April 15th, 2020

>***For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16\).***

You most likely memorized the verse above as a kid, like I did. We were made to recite it as kids, but as I grew and began to understand the importance of language, the importance of words, I couldn’t but review the thoughts in that verse to understand what it really means. It says, *“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish.…”*

That’s the sovereign declaration of the Almighty God; it’s a legal message to the world, a legal instruction. As a matter of fact, it’s a law. God so loved everybody, He so loved us that He gave His only begotten Son. And in that verse alone, I found the profuse effusion and demonstration of the Father’s love. There’re so many messages embedded therein. Think about it: that He gave Jesus in your place means He loves you as much as He loves Jesus. That means you’re valuable to God.

If God so loved you, you must be something to Him; otherwise, He wouldn’t pay a price so dear in your place. Moreso, that He loves you means He’s watching over you every day; He’s with you every moment and every step of the way. He cares about everything that concerns you. This should give you an extraordinary confidence in life; a new way of thinking. The extent to which He went in demonstrating His love for you is proof that nothing is too good for you.

Paul understood this and submitted, *“What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?”* (Romans 8:31\-32\). Become confident in the Father’s love for you, and be compelled by that love to reach and win others for Him.

2 Corinthians 5:14\-15 declares, *“For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.”* This means we can’t be quiet; we must tell of His love, of His grace, mercy and compassion. Hallelujah!

## SOUND IS A LIVING THING April 16th, 2020
![April 16th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-16-sound-is-a-living-thing.jpg)

>***And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven (Genesis 1:20\).***

It’s absolutely amazing what we read in our opening verse and the entire Genesis 1, as God spoke creation into being. It reveals that not only does sound contain energy, it carries life; it’s a living thing. When God spoke to water, earth and darkness in Genesis, He transferred life into them.

Hence, all creation, including those described as non\-living, have life in them. The only reason man calls some things non\-living is that he doesn’t understand life beyond biological definitions, and so he’s unable to find substantial, “measurable” life in those things. But they have life all the same, by virtue of God’s Word.

In Numbers 20:8, for example, God told Moses to speak to the rock: *“…speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.”* Why would God tell Moses to talk to the rock? It’s because the rock has life, with intelligence and memory. Like everything else in life, it’s programmed to respond to words, for they were all created by words. 

Jesus spoke to a fig tree, and it shrivelled up from its roots (Mark 11:14, 20\-21\). If creation came about by reason of words spoken by God, it means that there are sound codes in every particle, matter or object; and so, they can all respond to the sound codes we release through our words. This also suggests that the basic constituent of matter is sound.

We see Ezekiel, by the valley of dry bones: the Lord said to Him, “Prophesy to the bones.” The Bible specifically states that the bones were very dry; “lifeless”; but at the words of Ezekiel, the bones moved, and the Spirit entered them (Ezekiel 37:1\- 10\). Likewise, you can use the right sound codes to create the kind of life you desire. It doesn’t matter what your present circumstances are; you can change the course of your life with words and make it conform to God’s plan for you. Glory to God!

## LIVE ABOVE NEEDS April 17th, 2020

>***But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:19\).***

Many are at the infantile level in their walk with God; their prayers are laden with incessant requests for material things: they want a new house, a car, designer watches or clothes, money, etc. The truth is that God’s best isn’t to give you these things; what He seeks to give you is His Word in your spirit. That’s the most important thing in your life.

You might ask, “But didn’t God say we should ask for whatever we want?” That portion of scripture says, *“Ask, and it shall be given you…For every one that asketh receiveth…”* (Matthew 7:7\-8\). Truly, these are the words of Jesus, but first, as you study the Scriptures, you have to realize this was particularly addressed to the Jewish congregation before the redemption. This wasn’t Christ’s message to the Church. You have to understand this asking message blesses the baby Christian, and not the spiritually mature.

Paul said, “When I was a child, I spoke, reasoned and acted like a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things” (1 Corinthians 13:11\). “Ask and it shall be given to you” is for children. When you come of age, you understand that all things are yours (1 Corinthians 3:21\). As you grow in your knowledge of God, you’ll discover that everything you require for life and godliness is yours already (2 Peter 1:3\). There’s nothing for you to ask God for, because your needs have been entered into His supply system!

Read about Jesus; He had no consciousness of need or lack. He never needed to ask the Father for anything. What a place to be, where you have no consciousness of need! In the first chapter of 1 Corinthians, Paul didn’t mince words in the ninth verse, when he said, *“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.”* That means you’ve been brought into oneness, a partnership, a family union with the monarch of the universe. If this is true, what in the world could you ever be in need of? Everything that belongs to Him belongs to you because you’re His heir. Praise God!

## CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST April 18th, 2020

>***Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God (Colossians 3:2\-3\).***

While growing up as a young Christian, I had studied different materials from several Bible scholars who emphasized the concept of “dying to self” as the true essence of the Christian life. They thought that to do anything that pleases God, or to develop a liking for the things of God, you must go through this process of “dying to self.”

However, as I studied the Scriptures, I came across Paul’s inspired writing in Colossians 3 that we are dead and our lives are hid with Christ in God. That changed everything for me; there was no need to “die to self”; we were already dead. Therefore, we didn’t have to “die” again to be able to serve God and set our minds or affections on spiritual things. We can do this naturally, as new creations of righteousness, by directing our desires.

Some people find it a drag to engage in spiritual activities, but not you. You love to pray; you love to go to Church, study and meditate on the Word, because your affection is set on Him. You’re dead to the world and the world is dead to you (Galatians 6:14\). This is your new life in Christ. Live it now.

Notice that Colossians 3:3 doesn’t say you should try to die to the world or to self; rather, it says, *“For ye are dead….”* This means you’re a brand\-new person—a new species of being that never existed before (2 Corinthians 5:17\)—dead with Christ to the rudiments of the world (Colossians 2:20\).

You’re dead to sin and its effects. So, it’ll be wrong to take days off, fasting “to die to the flesh,” or spending long hours in prayers, griping about how you seek to die to self in order to please God. What you should do is to set your affection on Him; on His heavenly Kingdom. Love Him with all your heart and let the things of the Spirit be more important to you than anything in the world.

## “CUT OFF THE SUPPLY” April 19th, 2020

>***Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry (Colossians 3:5\).***

The Spirit’s construction through the Apostle Paul of the verse above is rather interesting. First, it shows that you’re not an earthly being. The only ‘‘members” or part of your personality that’s earthly is your physical body; that’s your instrument for functioning in the earth. You’re essentially a spirit being. Therefore, you can control your body.

Observe the word, ‘‘Mortify’’ in our opening verse; it’s the Greek, “nekroo”, where the English derived ‘‘necrosis". Necrosis is the death of body tissue resulting from an interruption of blood flow to that tissue. For example, if there’s a problem with the supply of blood to the limb, that tissue dies. What then is the Spirit telling us here?

It means you’re to “cut off” the supply, the very thing that feeds the evil and unwholesome desires lurking in your members—sexual vices, impurity, sensual appetites, greed, covetousness, etc.! Mortify or subject them to death by the interruption of its supply; “deaden” and deprive them of their power to control your life. It’s your responsibility to do this.

If there’re inappropriate habits you’ll like to stop, or some of the instructions the Scriptures expressly condemn for a Christian that you’ll like to completely obliterate from your life, simply do what the Bible says: cut the supply from your thought system; don’t feed them with your thoughts! It might be a video, a book, a website, or some TV programs; refuse to allow them influence you any further.

If you stop feeding your flesh, the wrong desires won’t have a place in your life; you’d find that your behaviour will change. Christianity must be practised. The Bible does tell us what to feed our minds with in Philippians 4:8\. It says, *“Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.”* So, consciously take your mind off unwholesome thoughts and set your affection on Christ, His Word, His love, His goodness, mercies and grace. Hallelujah!

>***For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure (Philippians 2:13\).***

Many people have great ideas, be it about their jobs, finances, business, ministry or career; but sadly, not many are able to fulfil or bring those ideas to fruition. Yes, they have this very inspiring idea of what they’d do or could do, but they procrastinate; before long, discouraging thoughts and seeming “valid reasons” not to act will come up, until the inspiration wanes and the dream dies.

Success comes from “doing”; that is, acting; not from seeing only. That’s why we have lots of people with great ideas—in business, politics or ministry— whose ideas never amounted to a hill of beans; they never took action. In fact, if you’d listen to them speak, you’d be awed at their lofty ideas, but they lack the drive and motivation to act.

If the foregoing describes you, the solution is simple: you need to meditate on the Word. God’s Word is a propelling force. That’s why beyond “sophia” and “sunesis” which are two different kinds of wisdom (remember, the Word of God is the wisdom of God), you must walk in “phronesis”; (these are three kinds of wisdom in the Greek New Testament).

“Sophia” is theoretical wisdom and insight into reality; it’s the collective understanding of things. “Sunesis” is critical wisdom; that is, mental or analytical knowledge; the ability to understand concepts and see relationships between them. But “Phronesis” is practical wisdom; it’s a force that makes you do and say the right things before you even think.

Therefore, if you’re in this situation of “conceptualizing” and not “acting,” begin to have daily sessions of meditating on the Word. Begin with Philippians 2:13; several times every day, you say out loud, “For it is God who works in me, both to will and to do of His good pleasure. He’s effectively at work in me, strengthening and energizing me, not just to think or know what to do, but to actually do them.” Practise this long enough and you’ll never have dreams or goals that didn’t materialize.

“Doing” people are successful people, because many people see but they don’t act! But when you see and act, it sets you apart for greatness. So, by the Spirit, go all out to pursue your dream and achieve your goals this year.

## WHEN FAITH IS BROKE April 21st, 2020
![April 21st, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-21-when-faith-is-broke.jpg)

>***…Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth (Luke 18:8\).***

Nowadays, it’s not uncommon to hear Christians talk about their doctor as though he’s the Holy Spirit. You’ll hear them make statements like: “I was having tummy ache; so I went to the doctor and he told me what to do.” They receive the doctor’s recommendations as though such recommendations came from the Holy Spirit.

Imagine a Christian who’s been feeling a headache for two weeks. You’d think the next thing he’d say is how he took a stand against it in the Name of Jesus, and it disappeared. Instead, his testimony is that he called his doctor who gave him a powerful drug that took care of it.

The question to ask such people is, “Where is your faith? Where is the place of the Word of God in your life?” They’re doing things because the doctor— not the Word or the Spirit—said to do them. How sad! Christians who have found themselves in this predicament have one major problem: their faith has gone broke or bankrupt.

The message of faith teaches that when you feel symptoms in your body, you rebuke it in the Name of Jesus. You command Satan to get out! Many have become so enslaved to their feelings that the slightest ache or pain have them heading to the drug store. How about the divine life in you? You’re born of God and His life in you makes you impregnable to sickness; absolutely unconquerable. Hallelujah!

You may say, “But I confessed, prayed and tried everything, but nothing was working, and I didn’t know what else to do.” Well, that’s what happens when faith is broke. How did you know things weren’t working? They only stopped working when you thought and said they weren’t working. Faith always works. Use it to frame your world and create the glorious realities you want to experience in life.

It makes no difference what the situation is; my faith, fueled by the Word, always works!

I’m fully convinced of my eternal victory over sickness, poverty, Satan and the world. Therefore, I rejoice, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## DON’T VOID YOUR FAITH April 22nd, 2020
![April 22nd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-22-dont-void-your-faith-min.jpg)

>***For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect (Romans 4:14\).***

Can faith be made void? Absolutely! There’re people who have made their faith void and the Word of God of non\-effect in their lives. For example, in Mark 7:13, Jesus rebuked the Jews for making God’s Word of non\-effect by their tradition. “Tradition” here refers to your way of life, your personal culture, and the things you believe. If these things are inconsistent with the Word of God, you make the Word of non\-effect in your life, and your faith is made void.

Some people are putting their faith to work all right, but it’s not working, because they’ve made it void by their “traditions.” What they ought to do is change their “traditions”; adopt a new mind\-set; the mindset of God’s wisdom.

Trusting in your own works also voids your faith. If you think you’re healthy and successful and blessed just because you’re doing some things right, and now you trust so much in those things and do them religiously because you think that ritual is the sustenance of your blessing, then your faith has been made void. Remember the words of Paul the apostle: *“Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us...”* (Titus 3:5\).

Galatians 2:16 say, *“Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.”* Your trust must always be in the finished works of Christ; live by His faith (Galatians 2:20\). Hallelujah!

## USE YOUR FAITH April 23rd, 2020

>***Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God… (Hebrews 11:3\).***

Some people think it’s nice and humble to always cry to God for help. They think that God loves their “dependency syndrome,” but He doesn’t. Rather, He wants you to effect changes in your life and circumstances with the word of faith on your lips. It reminds of a situation with Jesus and His disciples as they sailed in a boat. The Master had fallen asleep in the rear of the boat, and the Bible says, *“…there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy”* (Luke 8:23\).

The disciples ran to him in utter desperation and said, “Master, master, we perish.” The Master, after rebuking the raging tempest, turned to them and said, “Where is your faith?” (Read Luke 8:23\-25\). He made them realize they could have done something about the situation without necessarily coming to Him. He said in Matthew 17:20, *“…If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed…nothing shall be impossible unto you.”*

With your faith, you can achieve and have anything; you can chart the course of your life to align with God’s will and purpose for you. It makes no difference what has happened or is happening with your finances, job and health or in any area of your life; don’t fret or cry for help! Repair, arrange and reconstruct things in line with God’s perfect will with your confessions of faith.

With your faith, you can frame your life in the path of glory and excellence. The Bible says our faith is the victory that overcomes the world: *“...this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith”* (1 John 5:4\). There’s no situation that your faith can’t handle. That’s why Jesus asked His disciples when they panicked during crisis, “Where is your faith?”

Whatever confronts you today is no match for your faith. Change the narrative with your faith\-filled confessions. Speak, and keep speaking, and you’ll surely see the change that you desire, because Jesus said, “You shall have what you say” (Mark 11:23\).

## THE FULL EXPRESSION OF HIM April 24th, 2020
![April 24th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-24-the-full-expression-of-him-min.jpg)

>***Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? (1 Corinthians 3:16\).***

Some Christians misunderstand what we mean when we say God lives in us. They sort of picture Him occupying somewhere inside them, in a bodily form. Don’t try to imagine something physical; God is a Spirit. When you received Christ into you, you were born into Him; your spirit was recreated in His image. He united Himself with your spirit and you became inseparably one with Him. Jesus said: “I am in the Father, and the Father is in me” (John 14:10\).

The fullness of the Godhead tabernacles in Jesus; He’s the full expression of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit! In Him, the totality of deity is united, and that’s what happened with us in Christ. 1 Corinthians 6:17 says he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit. 1 John 4:17 says, *“…as he is, so are we in this world.”* As Jesus is filled (replete) with God, so are you.

The Bible says in John 1:16, *“…of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.”* We have received in all fullness everything that is of deity in Christ Jesus. Imagine the glory of your life if you lived every day, conscious that you’re full of God; and that you’re the physical body of the living God! That’s what we read in our opening verse.

Then, 2 Corinthians 6:16 says, *“…for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them….”* When you move, it’s God moving in you. Your hands are His hands, and your fingers His fingers; you’re immersed in Him, and He in you. Through you, He expresses Himself—His life, nature and character. Hallelujah!

## FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE April 25th, 2020
![April 25th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-25-financial-discipline.jpg)

>***Take a lesson from the ants, you lazy fellow. Learn from their ways and be wise! For though they have no king to make them work, yet they labor hard all summer, gathering food for the winter (Proverbs 6:6\-8 TLB).***

Financial discipline is very important, and it’s something the Spirit of God can train you in. Some don’t realise they’re not supposed to spend everything they get. Simple wisdom is that you spend less than you earn or receive; otherwise, you could end up in debt. The response of some to this might be, “What I earn isn’t even enough; after paying my tithe, giving my offering and doing other things I need to do, nothing is left.” No; don’t think or talk like that!

First, understand that you’re the seed of Abraham; therefore, your financial prosperity is independent of how much you earn or the economic situation around you. You’re an heir of God and joint\-heir with Christ; you’re plugged to an unending supply. Thus, the idea of cultivating the habit to save isn’t about keeping your money in the bank to accumulate interest; it’s about discipline. Proverbs 21:20 TLB says, *“The wise man saves for the future, but the foolish man spends whatever he gets.”*

You may say, “What’s the essence of saving a small amount; it’s not going anywhere.” Don’t destroy it with your mouth. Never declare that what you have is small or not enough. Money is spiritual; it’s not that coin or note in your pocket, wallet or bank account. Money has ears and can hear you. So you must learn to bless your finances.

The issue isn’t the size of your income, but the size of your mind—your thinking, and what your faith can produce. Think about how much you might have received in the last one year; but then, how much of it did you reproduce? If your answer isn’t satisfactory, it’s time for a change. As long as the things you put money into aren’t such that can reproduce what you put in and more, then there’s a problem, and it’s expedient that you change things.

God’s Word imparts wisdom to you for financial intelligence and discipline. So, study and meditate on the Word more, and you’ll always deal wisely in handling your finances.

## PERFECT AND EXCELLENT BY NATURE April 26th, 2020

>***Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever (1 Peter 1:23\).***

When we talk about excellence, it simply means to excel, to go above and beyond; to be exceptional. But then, it’s a relative concept, meaning it can be measured at different levels of your life. Excellence, therefore, gives us the idea of growth, because of its relativeness. Thus, God wants you to be awakened to who you really are: a perfect and excellent person by nature.

This is why, as you study the Scriptures, you find that He always guides our minds into the idea and reality that He’s made us perfect beings after Him. That’s the nature that He’s given us. Once you’re taught and awakened to this reality, you’ll walk in the light of it. This is the reason we don’t strive for excellence; we exude it; it’s in the fabric of our very existence; the core of our nature. Hallelujah!

When people say they’re striving for excellence, they’ll never attain it, because they’re trying to be who they already are. A dog never strives to be a dog, neither does a cat strive to be a cat. You have an excellent spirit and mind because you were born that way. You’re the perfect and excellent being of a perfect God. Therefore, let your nature, which is the nature of God, produce works of righteousness, for excellence is walking in righteousness.

## FAITH FOR SOUL WINNING April 27th, 2020
![April 27th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-27-faith-for-soul-winning.jpg)

>***To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:19\).***

There’s no better way to express your love for Jesus Christ than to win souls for Him; the souls for whom He died. He gave His life for all men, and if you were the only one that needed salvation, He would still have come to die for you. He didn’t do it because we were many; He did it because we were valuable to God. Therefore, soul winning is worth everything. Practise it. It’s the most important thing on earth. It’s something for which you must express your faith.

You can say, “In the Name of Jesus, I claim ten souls for Jesus Christ today, by the power of the Holy Spirit!” And after making that declaration of faith, you go out for evangelism. Faith isn’t all about getting something for yourself. Let your faith work in reaching people for Christ; the growth you’d experience, both in your personal life and in the harvest of souls, will be astounding.

In John 5:19, Jesus said, “I do what I see my Father do.” Copy the Master. He was the greatest soul winner; the master soul winner. As you win souls, you’re carrying out His passion, and the glory of His Kingdom is manifested in your life in an extraordinary way. This is how you shine in the Kingdom. Recall what Jesus said about John the Baptist: *“He was a burning and a shining light…”* (John 5:35\). What a testimony!

You have to be a burning and a shining light, and there’s no other way than soul winning, impacting lives with the Gospel: *“And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever”* (Daniel 12:3\). This is what you’ve got to do, because it’s your life, your calling and responsibility. 2 Corinthians 5:19 says,  *“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.”*

## YOU HAVE FAITH TO RULE YOUR WORLD April 28th, 2020

>***For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith (Romans 12:3\).***

In Matthew 17:20, Jesus said, *“…for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.”* Some people read this and say, “That’s my problem; I really don’t have faith.” But that’s not true. God has given to every one of us, the measure of faith. We all have faith. It came with the Gospel and was imparted to your spirit at the New Birth.

However, the difference between you and me is what we’ve done with our faith, because God gave to each one of us the same measure of faith. If I seem to have advanced beyond you or recorded greater successes, it’s because of how well I’ve grown and exercised my faith; what I’ve done with it. When you do more with your faith, you’ll achieve much and glorify the Father. It’s about your practise of the Word. That’s what faith is: the response of the human spirit to the Word of God.

When you face challenges, respond with the Word; that’s using your faith. And faith, the Bible says, abides (1Corinthians 13:13\); it prevails whenever you put it to work. It’s the victory that overcomes the world (1 John 5:4\). Once you understand this, you’ll have no fear or worries about anything, because with your faith, you can destroy sicknesses and diseases! You can paralyse and neutralise Satan’s works. You can destroy the lump, the diabetes or blood condition. You can alter circumstances and chart your course in the direction of God’s will and purpose for your life. Amen.

## IMPACTING LIVES WITH THE GOSPEL April 29th, 2020

>***Here’s another way to put it: You’re here to be light, bringing out the God\-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. We’re going public with this, as public as a city on a hill (Matthew 5:14 MSG).***

We read in the Book of Acts that God wrought many unusual miracles through the hands of Paul. Handkerchiefs and aprons were taken from his body, and when those materials were brought in contact with sick people, they were healed and those who were oppressed of demons were set free.

But something interesting to note is that the handkerchiefs and aprons didn’t do anything; they had no intelligence or mind of their own. However, they had become impacted with the Spirit to become a conduit for God’s power. Nonetheless, even though the power of God was in them, they couldn’t do anything until someone transported them from Paul to where there was a need—to the sick and the oppressed.

This is what happens with you that are born again and filled with the Spirit. Until and unless you take or channel the power in you to where there’s a need, there’ll be no manifestation of the power in you. A Christian can be as “lifeless” as the handkerchiefs and aprons from Paul, until he or she comes in contact with the need in men’s lives. That’s why you must be about God’s business of soul winning.

Out in the world is where the need is; that’s where you find the rendezvous of broken humanity. You may never make impact with the power in you until you leave your comfort zone, and make contact with those in need. You were born as an agent of change; an influence and an answer to the cry of the needy in your world. Therefore, put the glory in you to work; manifest the virtues and perfections of Christ which are in your spirit.

It’ll be a great waste to have the Holy Spirit and live an ordinary life. If you were the only one that’s filled with the Holy Spirit in your town, city or country, there should still be a remarkable impact with the Gospel. Make the choice to rule your world; impact lives with the Gospel, for that’s the desire of the Spirit and His will for your life.

You may never make impact with the power in you until you leave your comfort zone, and make contact with those in need. Make the choice to impact lives with the Gospel.

>***And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18\).***

Why did Peter, a disciple of Jesus Christ, deny Jesus three times? It was because of fear. He was afraid that he could be arrested and killed if he affirmed openly that he knew Jesus. And guess who confronted him? A maid, not even the soldiers. Yet, Peter, out of fear, denied the Master.

Such still happens today. Many live under the shadow of what others, most of whom they don’t even know, would say about them or do to them for openly identifying with Jesus. But not when you’re full of the Holy Spirit! Don’t worry if you’re ostracised, criticised or mocked because of Jesus Christ. It’s actually a blessing—a great one at that—to be “humiliated” or persecuted for His sake.

God gave you His Spirit to live in you and embolden you, so you’ll never be timid or intimidated to proclaim Jesus Christ openly and affirm your faith at every given opportunity. When the same Peter who was initially full of fear received the Holy Spirit, his life was completely altered; he became fearless! In spite of the large and intimidating crowd present on the day of Pentecost, he proclaimed the Gospel with such boldness and power that resulted in a mighty harvest of souls into the Kingdom. Hallelujah!

It’s an honour to know Jesus and to serve Him. Be bold about your association and union with Him. Don’t care what others would say or do to you because of your love for Him. Serve Him with all your heart and live for Him in truth.
