>***For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it (Luke 9:24\).***

A certain man advised his son who was a Christian against being too active for Jesus Christ. He was concerned that the son could lose his life for serving Jesus Christ and preaching the Gospel. But the son replied, “Dad, I’m only doing what Jesus said I should do; I’m serving Him with my life.”

The man was offended and said with acerbity, “You’re doing what Jesus said you should do? That’s why He died young; at thirty\-three! They killed Him!” Like that man, there’re many who neither understand Christ’s purpose, nor the meaning of life. It’s not how long you live; it’s about the life you live.

The truth is, for such people, the issue really isn’t that they want to live long or want their loved ones to live long. If that were the case, God promised them eternity; their real problem is the fear of death.

As long as the fear of death dominates a man, he can’t live to his best potentials; he can’t fulfil his calling in life. He’ll say and do things he really doesn’t believe, all in a bid to save his life. But we read in our opening verse, *“…whosoever will save his life shall lose it….”*Live your life for Christ unreservedly! You’ve got to be able to say, “Come what may, I stand for Jesus Christ and His Kingdom! I’ll preach the Gospel, no matter what!”

Remember what He said in Luke 10:19, *“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”* As you go about preaching the Gospel, especially in these last days, be fearless, for the Lord Himself is your defence. Even now, He’s saying to you the very same words He said to the Apostle Paul in Acts 18:10, “*For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city*.”

## EXAMINE YOUR OWN FAITH August 2nd, 2020
![August 2nd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-2-examine-your-own-faith.jpg)

 ---

>***Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves… (2 Corinthians 13:5\).***

There’re those who think the Lord permits calamities or is responsible for misfortunes that people suffer. It’s like the fellow who lamented, “I’m out serving God, working for Him every day; yet, He allowed the devil to kill my baby.” But that can’t be true! The Lord isn’t responsible for evil or the mishaps that people experience; it’s not consistent with His nature. He is love personified; there’s no darkness in Him.

Whatever you may have suffered that’s inconsistent with the provisions of Christ in His Gospel, didn’t come from God. Life is spiritual and you’re responsible for your life—the things that happen with you. It’s about your faith and how you use it. Jesus said in Matthew 17:20, *“…If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.”* This is a sovereign declaration; the question is, what are you doing with your faith? How are you putting your faith to work?

The Bible says, *“Now the just shall live by faith…”* (Hebrews 10:38\). Using your faith to deal with the crises of life every day is your responsibility. James 1:22 says, *“But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.”* That’s the key; doing the Word. You act your faith by “doing” the Word; we’re Word practitioners.

If things aren’t working out as you expect them to, the fault isn’t with God, for He is perfect. Since He’s perfect, then you have to check elsewhere for what might have gone wrong. It could be that you didn’t understand Him or His Word well enough. Perhaps you didn’t do exactly what He said; or maybe your timing was wrong. Therefore, the right thing to do will be to examine your own faith as read in our theme verse.

The life of faith given to us isn’t a deception. The Lord isn’t hiding behind faith so He wouldn’t do what He said He’d do. Faith always works. If it didn’t work, then it wasn’t faith. Keep growing your faith by increasing your knowledge of the Word.

## GIVING THANKS ALWAYS August 3rd, 2020
![August 3rd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-3-giving-thanks-always-in-all-things.jpg)

>***Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (Ephesians 5:20\).***

The human brain is divided into two major parts: the right side and the left side. The left side is what you use to analyze, calculate and plan. It also makes excuses. If, for example, there’re tasks for you to accomplish, but you say, “I’m not sure I’ll be able to do this for such\-and\-such a reason,” that’s the left side of your brain working. It produces reasons for success or failure.

The right side of your brain, on the other hand, is the one that spontaneously catches pictures, creates imaginations, and gives answers. It produces creativity, beauty, colours. But sadly, because the world around us is mostly sense\-ruled, we’re taught to reason more. Therefore, most people depend on the analytical side of their brain (the left side), and as a result, they’re not creative; they don’t produce clear\-cut answers.

However, it’s important to note that the right side of your brain can be activated, and one of the best ways of achieving this is what God shows us in our theme verse: *“Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father….”* God knows this works, because He created you. He knows if you’re always thankful, you’ll have an attitude of joy in spite of your situation and be able to create answers and solutions. Here, you’ll see colours, beauty and the brighter side of life.

Therefore, learn to give thanks always for all things. It makes no difference that you’re in debt or many who are owing you money are unable to pay; give thanks! Your landlord may have given you a notice to quit; give thanks nonetheless! Perhaps you heard that the company or organisation where you work is retrenching workers and your name is on the list, give thanks! Irrespective of such challenges, give thanks!

The Bible lets us know that giving thanks in all things is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you (1 Thessalonians 5:18\). Hebrews 13:15 says, *“By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.”* When you have this attitude—the thanksgiving attitude—your life will be one of victory, glory, joy and unending testimonies. Hallelujah!

## LIVING ON GOD’S WORD August 4th, 2020
![August 4th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-4-living-on-gods-word.jpg)

>***And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him (Luke 8:25\).***

A certain young man was deathly ill, and thought he’d die. On a certain Friday evening, he was brought to me. After explaining to me what the problems were, I said to him, “See me on Sunday.” 

Later on, as he shared his testimony, he said, “When Pastor Chris said to me, ‘See me on Sunday,’ I knew I wasn’t going to die before Sunday, because I’ll have to see him.” He held on to the word to see me on Sunday. We ministered to him eventually and he was miraculously restored.

That’s how to live your life on the Word of God; you take the Word that’s come to you from God and anchor your life on it; you live by it. It also brings to mind an experience between Jesus and His disciples on a certain occasion. He had said to them*, “...Let us go over unto the other side of the lake...”* (Luke 8:22\). During the sail, it became so stormy that the disciples were terrified and cried to the Master saying, *“...Master, master, we perish...”* (Luke 8:24\).

The Master’s response to them is what we read in our theme verse. He asked them, “Where is your faith?” His question wasn’t about the wind and the storm. Rather, He was saying, “I told you we’re going to the other side, and if I said that, then we must arrive at the other side, irrespective of the boisterous and tempestuous wind; we don’t perish on the way!” He was saying, “You should have relied on my words.”

It makes no difference what’s going on around you, refuse to be agitated. Don’t be flustered by the economic or political wind around you; live your life on God’s Word. Stay your life on His word and know that until you’ve fulfilled it, nothing can stop you; nothing can destroy you. Go about God’s business, preaching the Gospel unafraid and unintimidated. The greater One lives in you. Hallelujah!

## HE SUBSTITUTED HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS FOR YOUR SIN-NATURE August 5th, 2020
![August 5th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-5-he-substitututed-his-righteouness-for-your-sin-nature.jpg)

 ---

>***For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him (2 Corinthians 5:21\).***

The idea of the new creation having a sin\-nature is mostly common amongst Christians who look at it from the standpoint of “I was once a sinner, but now I’m saved.” But the new creation isn’t the man that was in sin and in the darkness; that man actually died with Christ.

The old nature of sin was crucified with Christ and supplanted by God’s nature of righteousness: *“Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin”* (Romans 6:6\). When Jesus arose from the dead, you arose with Him with a new life and a new nature. The life in you isn’t a continuation of the old life or a combination of the old and the new; it’s a new life altogether—a new life of righteousness. Blessed be God!

Romans 6:4 says, “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” No wonder the Bible says in Colossians 3:10, *“…put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.”*

You were born righteous in Christ Jesus. He substituted His righteousness for your sin\-nature. His substitutionary work took care of the sin\-problem and brought forth a new creation—a new species—recreated in righteousness and true holiness. Glory to God!

## YOUR KEY TO ENDLESS VICTORIES August 6th, 2020

>***Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts (Zechariah 4:6\).***

In Ephesians 5:18\-19, the Apostle Paul tells us, *“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.”* Then, as you study the book of Acts, you’ll observe that the apostles ministered in the Name of Jesus, with the Word of God, and by the power of the Holy Spirit. That’s why they had such extraordinary results. It’s the same today. There’re people who try so hard to succeed through their own might and natural wisdom, yet true success eludes them. This is because they function from the mind—the sense\-realm—which is grossly limited.

True success is by the Spirit. If you’ve been trying to succeed by your own power or ability, it’s time to quit the struggle and rely on the strategies of the Spirit and His wisdom to guide you. 2 Corinthians 3:5 says, *“Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.”*

Our competence; the ability, wisdom and grace by which we function are of the Spirit. Trust in Him. How do you intend to grow your Church, cell group, or fellowship? How do you intend to multiply your finances or grow your business? It’s got to be by the Spirit! He’ll make you a wonder as you walk with Him and allow Him to guide you in your affairs. He’ll unveil the realities of the Kingdom and the reality of the glory of God to you. He’s the key to a life of endless victories and extraordinary success.

## SPEAKING WISDOM August 7th, 2020
![August 7th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-7-speaking-wisdom.jpg)

 ---

>***But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory (1 Corinthians 2:7\).***

Our opening verse says we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery; what is it to speak wisdom? Reading 1 Corinthians 2:12\-13 gives us an idea. It says, *“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit, which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.”*

Notice the underlined portion; it didn’t say, “Which things also we speak of”; rather, it says we speak them. We read something similar in verse 6; it says, *“Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect….”* We don’t talk about wisdom; we speak wisdom, and wisdom is the Word of God. Speaking wisdom is speaking the Word.

For example, Colossians 1:27 says, *“...Christ in you, the hope of glory.”* When you, on the basis of that scripture affirm, “I’ll forever be a victor; my life is the expression of the glory and dominion of Christ,” you’re speaking wisdom. When you declare, “I have no lack or want because I’m an heir of God and joint\-heir with Christ; the whole world is mine”; you’re speaking the wisdom of God. You’re speaking wisdom, when, irrespective of the symptom you may be feeling, you say, “The life of God is activated in every fibre of my being; I’m full of life.”

There’re those who may consider you to be out of wits for speaking the wisdom of God; that’s because the wisdom of God is foolishness to the natural man. 1 Corinthians 2:14 declares, *“But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.”*

Speak the wisdom of God always, and your life will glorify God. Declare your oneness with the Lord. Declare your righteousness, health, dominion, and glory in Christ Jesus. Glory to God!

## CAST OUT DEVILS IN YOUR NATION August 8th, 2020

>***But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them (2 Corinthians 4:3\-4\).***

In our day, activities of demons are rampant in many cities, with a bid to stopping people from receiving the Gospel. Part of our theme verse says, *“…the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not….”* That’s Satan at work; he’s the god of this world and has his agents in different nations, with a mission to stop people from receiving the Gospel.

When you notice a slowness in people heeding the call to salvation in certain places in spite of the vigorous preaching of the Gospel, do what Jesus said to do: cast out devils (Mark 16:17\). Cast them out of the cities, towns, villages, localities and nations, as you pray fervently in the Spirit. Until and unless you act and put a stop to the works of these demons, they’ll keep running rampage, making the inhabitants of such regions less and less receptive to the Gospel. But thanks be unto God! We have the authority in the Name of Jesus to dislodge and dispossess them of their hold over these regions and reassign the desolate heritages. We have the right to reassign these regions, formerly destitute of the Spirit of God, to angels.

It makes no difference what obtains in the city or nation where you live or the demons in that particular region that hold sway over men’s lives; cast them out! Once you do, the hearts of many in those regions will become open to receive the Gospel gladly and heed the call to salvation.

Make it your life’s work that the Gospel of Jesus Christ would grow mightily and prevail where you are. Let the desire for His righteousness to be established in your city, locality and country cause you to intercede and break the cords of bondage over men’s lives; let it mean everything to you.

## HE’S YOUR TICKET August 9th, 2020
![August 9th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-9-hes-your-ticket.jpg)

 ---

>***Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light (Colossians 1:12 NIV).***

Imagine you were on your way to a ticketed event but you’re without the ticket. At the gate, you’ll most likely be refused, and disappointed. But with your ticket, you’ll be confident and simply display it and go in. That’s like what the Name of Jesus represents to you: it’s your ticket to every blessing; it represents more than you could ever imagine or desire. Hallelujah! He said in John 16:23, *“And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.”*

Everything you could ever ask or desire is fulfilled in Christ; all you need do is declare they’re yours in His Name. Every so often, declare, “I’m an heir of God and a joint\-heir with Christ, a partaker of the inheritance of the saints; all things are mine, in the Name of Jesus!” When you make such declarations, nature responds to you. Glory to God!

Due to ignorance of the finished works of Christ, many still beg God to bless them, to heal them, to deliver them, etc. It gives them some sort of satisfaction to approach Him with a beggarly attitude. But He doesn’t want that; not after all that Jesus accomplished in your behalf through His vicarious sacrifice! He brought you into oneness with divinity. By Him, you have boldness and access by the Spirit to the Father and the blessings of heaven. Blessed be God!

## A NEW LIFE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS August 10th, 2020

>***For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him (2 Corinthians 5:21\).***

When a man receives Christ, he receives a new life; he’s as one who never existed before: a new creation in Christ. This new life is the life of righteousness; superior to sin, the devil, death and hell. This new life is the reason you can live a righteous life. The reason men sin is that they have the nature of sin. That nature is supplanted by God’s nature of righteousness when a man is born again.

It wasn’t just a mere change that took place in you when you were born again; it was an actual replacement or supplanting of the life and nature of sin by the life of righteousness. Real Christianity isn’t the inclusion or impartation of another nature, but an actual recreation of the human spirit by God. You’ve come alive to God through the new birth. Thus, it’s natural for you to live right and fulfil the will of the Father.

Religion teaches that if a man would live right, then God would qualify him to be a righteous person, but that’s a contradiction. No one can live righteously, until He’s first made righteous by God. God’s righteousness in your spirit is what gives you the ability to live right.

Hence, in Christianity, what God does is to first make you righteous, before He’d be justified to expect you to live right. The Bible says Jesus Christ died on account of our offences, and was raised back to life for our justification (Romans 4:25\). Justification means to be declared righteous. Blessed Be God!

## FAITHFULNESS IN SERVICE August 11th, 2020
![August 11th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-11-faithfulness-in-service.jpg)

>***And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men (Colossians 3:23\).***

Each one of us is called to fulfil a unique role in Christ; we all have varied assignments given to us by God. It was the same in Bible days. Some assignments could be greater or more far\-reaching than others, but how you perform in your assignment is judged by your faithfulness. The Lord will judge and reward you on the basis of your faithfulness in service, in the assignment given to you, not the one given to someone else.

Remember, He’s the One who gives you the ability to do whatever He assigns to you. If He gave you more to do than someone else, He doesn’t think that makes you greater as a person; it’s about His placement and choice. So, it matters that you’re diligent in carrying out what He’s assigned to you.

Proverbs 22:29 says, *“Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.”* Take God’s admonition in our theme verse to heart; whatsoever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.

If you serve the Lord as though you’re serving man, whatever reward you get won’t go beyond this world. Therefore, whatever assignment God gives you in His Kingdom, do it with joy, passion, and with faith, as unto the Lord. Practise it, and you’d be amazed at the demonstration of His grace in your life. Amen.

## EMBRACE HIS LOVE August 12th, 2020
![August 12th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-12-embrace-his-love.jpg)

 ---

>***For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16\).***

Our God is gracious and kind. His love for man is beyond human comprehension; it’s love without limits. John 15:13 says, *“Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.”*

The Lord Jesus laid down His life for us, like no one ever did. He was divine and without sin; yet, He became the sin\-sacrifice, offered up for the sin of the world. He was crucified of His own will in the place of others. Think about it: He took our place of sin on the Cross, so that we might take His place of righteousness: “*For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him”* (2 Corinthians 5:21\).

How do you describe such love that made Him die for sinners—the criminals, murderers, robbers, etc? He came, lived, worked wonders, died and resurrected, all for the love of man. Everything He did was for the love of man. He declared His purpose for coming in John 10:10; it was so that man may have life, and have it to the full. The life He’s given us is one of blessings, joy and pleasures forevermore.

Now, as a result of what Jesus did, we’re holy and without blame before the Father in love. We can boldly stand in the presence of God without guilt, inferiority or condemnation. You don’t have to feel insecure or uncertain about your stand with God. Be bold, confident, assured and glad that you belong to Him; that He brought you into oneness with Himself. Hallelujah.

No matter where you’ve been, what you’ve done, how deep in sin you think you’ve been, you don’t have to run from God. He said in Isaiah 1:18, *“… though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.”* Embrace His love. Trust Him with your life. Perhaps you’ve never been born again, this is your moment. Turn to the prayer of salvation on page 76; pray that prayer and mean it with all your heart.

## CUT OFF SATAN’S INFLUENCE August 13th, 2020
![August 13th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-13-cut-off-satans-influence.jpg)

>***All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them (Psalm 118:10\).***

The underlined word “will” in the verse above doesn’t exist in the original Hebrew text; rather, it’s in the affirmative. The NIV, like several other translations, puts it correctly; it says, *“All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of the LORD I cut them off.”* He didn’t say, “…I will cut them off.”

David was making a proclamation in the Spirit ever before he would destroy his enemies with the sword. He had to first destroy them with words. This is so important because it shows us how we should deal with the adversary. You’re to cut off the influence of Satan over the nations, leaders, and governments of the world. That’s what you do in praying for nations and leaders.

David was emphatic with the phrase, “cut off” because sometimes, you’ve got to say it several times. When we hear of wars, pandemics, insecurity, economic downturns, etc., and we notice that Satan is taking advantage of them to keep people in fear and mislead nations, then we step in. Like David, we cut off Satan’s influence.

When you see the adversary on rampage, holding nations hostage in whatever form, don’t keep quiet; cut off his influence with your prayer and faith\-filled words. The Bible says, *“Where the word of a king is, there is power…”* (Ecclesiastes 8:4\), and we’re king\-priests unto God (Revelation 1:6\).

Even now, with the authority given to us in the Name of Jesus, take your place and cut off principalities, powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high places. Expel them from your home, the schools, your government and from public places. Praise God!

## DON’T HOPE; ACT YOUR FAITH August 14th, 2020
![August 14th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-14-dont-hope-act-your-faith.jpg)

>***Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Hebrews 11:1\).***

Hope is a good virtue, but it doesn’t change your condition. There’s a difference between faith and hope. Hope is future; but faith is NOW. Understand it from this perspective: Jesus was prophesied as the hope of the nations; He was the hope of Israel; He was called the hope of salvation.

In other words, if man would ever be saved, the Son of God would have to come; there would have to be the sacrifice for the sins of the world, and Jesus was that sacrifice. When John the Baptist saw Him, he exclaimed, *“...Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”* (John 1:29\).

Now, Jesus came and fulfilled the plan of God. He was crucified in our place. He paid the full price for man’s sin and then God raised Him up to give us the inheritance. Colossians 1:12 says, *“Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.”* Now that God has given us the inheritance through Jesus Christ, there’s no reason to hope for it.

“Hope” (Jesus) came and completely fulfilled everything that God sent Him to give us and to do for us. Hallelujah! Everything you could ever desire of God has been consummated, accomplished, and granted you in Jesus Christ. You now must act your faith.

Don’t say, “I hope someday this sickness will leave my body”; stop hoping; act your faith. If the condition must change, it’s got to be by faith. Faith takes possession NOW! Hallelujah!

## TRUST IN HIS FINISHED WORKS August 15th, 2020
![August 15th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-15-trust-in-his-finished-works.jpg)

 ---

>***For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast (Ephesians 2:8\-9\).***

There’re those who think they ought to be accepted by God or blessed of Him for their good works; they trust in their self\-righteousness. But what God rewards is your faith in the finished works of Christ; His substitutionary work in your behalf.

The Apostle Paul revealed the fruitlessness of trusting in your good works or observance of the Law to answer for you before God. He writes, *“...I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith”* (Philippians 3:8\-9\).

Notice the underlined portion; it reveals the summary of the Gospel, which is, to be found in Christ, not having your own righteousness, but accepting God’s righteousness through the faith of Christ Jesus. 

Never try to impress God with your “religiosity”; He has already blessed you with ALL spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3\). There’s really nothing you could ever want that isn’t already yours in Christ. Everything He owns belongs to you.

Remember, He gave you His life. Therefore, your faith should be anchored on what Christ came to do; what He’s accomplished for you and in you. The reason for your divine health, divine prosperity, and life of endless victories and blessings is that Christ already made them yours. Your focus and trust should be on Him, what He’s done and who He is, not on your works.

## NEITHER HELPLESS NOR FORSAKEN August 16th, 2020
![August 16th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-16-neither-helpless-nor-forsaken.jpg)

>***Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee (Hebrews 13:5\).***

This is absolutely remarkable! The Lord says He’ll never, in any degree, leave you helpless nor forsake you. The Amplified Classic translation lets us know He repeated the clause “I will not” three times (for emphasis): *“…I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support. \[I will] not, \[I will] not, \[I will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let \[you] down (relax my hold on you)! \[Assuredly not!].”*

This very scripture brings to mind the words of Jesus in John 14:18: *“I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”* Yes, Jesus is in heaven, but He didn’t leave us without support. He didn’t leave us desolate, bereaved, forlorn or stranded. He sent us the Holy Spirit, not only to be with us, but to live in us. That same Spirit has become your courage, your help, your sufficiency and your all.

Trust Him with your life. Fellowship with Him, and He’ll make you successful in all things. He says He won’t relax His hold on you; meaning He’s with you all the way in your journey of life, seeing to it that you win always. He knows how to take care of you.

His help is something you shouldn’t doubt at all; it’s guaranteed. The Bible says He’s your “very present help in time of trouble” (Psalm 46:1\). If you ever find yourself in trouble or a difficult situation, be assured you’re not alone; He’ll get you out or show you what to do to come out victoriously.

The Holy Spirit is your supreme advantage, refuge and strength. Acknowledge and appreciate His work in your life and love Him with all your heart.

## YOUR WORDS REVEAL YOU August 17th, 2020
![August 17th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-17-your-words-reveal-you.jpg)

>***For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned (Matthew 12:37\).***

What kind of words come out of you and where do you get them from? Why do you say the things you say? These are critical questions for your heart. As a Christian, you ought to always examine your life, especially with respect to your words, because your words locate you; they reveal your character. If a man’s words are hurtful and biting, then that’s who he is inside. But if your words are gracious, kind, uplifting and heart\-lifting, that’s the character of your personality. You’re the character of your words.

Jesus said in Matthew 12:35, *“A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.”* As a Christian, you’ve got good treasures within you by reason of your divine nature in Christ. There’s excellence in your spirit. So when you speak, it should be out of that abundance.

Jesus also said, *“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water”* (John 7:38\). He was speaking of the Holy Spirit, which those who believe in Him would receive (John 7:39\). Thus, the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life means you’re enabled to let out rivers of living water which come forth in words; divine words!

This means if a Christian speaks foul, brash or bitter words, he’s exuding an attribute that isn’t consistent with his true nature. James 3:11 tells us that fresh water and bitter water don’t issue from the same fountain. Yours is the fresh water from God’s fountain inside you. You don’t have a mix. You have only goodness and blessings within you, which are revealed each time you speak.

Your speech is the true measure of your maturity as a Christian: *“…And if anyone does not offend in speech \[never says the wrong things], he is a fully developed character and a perfect man…”* (James 3:2 AMPC). Through your words, bring healing and life to others; bring them hope, strength and courage. Chart your course in victory, from glory to glory with your wholesome, faith\-filled words.

## LIFE DOESN’T HAVE TO BE A STRUGGLE August 18th, 2020

>***And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made (Genesis 2:2\).***

Read the creation story in the book of Genesis: After God saw that all He had created was very good, pleasant, and excellent in every way, He ceased from His work and rested on the seventh day. That seventh day would be man’s first day. When he awakened, he found that everything was ready. There was nothing left for man to do except to enjoy what had been created, take care of them, and appreciate his Creator. This was a shadow of the sabbath and rest for God’s people. You were born into His rest (Hebrews 4:9\-10\).

There’re people who perpetually live a life of struggle. They hardly ever accomplish a goal without a brawl with the devil. They’ve always had to fight their way through life, praying and fasting for days on end, and casting out all kinds of devils. This has been their experience from childhood to adulthood. They had to fight intense “spiritual battles” before they could gain admission into a university. When it was time to graduate, the conditions were just as difficult and they had to fight the same kind of battles. Getting a job after school was the same story. Finding a spouse and raising kids weren’t any different. Their lives have been an endless string of hardships and difficulties. Something is wrong.

If you’re born again and filled with the Holy Spirit, you ought to live a life of endless joy and rest, where you heap success upon success through the power of the Holy Spirit. But if you don’t understand how to appropriate and enjoy your divine inheritance in Christ, you’ll likely live “a life of ceaseless battles,” like the one we just described. Refuse that kind of life.

Embrace the stress\-free life in Christ. He said in Matthew 11:28, *“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”* You already came to Him at salvation and He’s already given you rest: *“For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his”* (Hebrews 4:10\). This is the reality of your life.

The Lord Jesus didn’t whip the devil to leave us still “fighting” and struggling our way through life. His vicarious sacrifice in our behalf, and His work to give us the victory were complete. So, change your way of thinking where necessary and accept His Word today. Accept the life of joy, peace and glory that He’s given you.

## GIVE CARE AND ATTENTION TO OTHERS August 19th, 2020

>***And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me (Matthew 25:40\).***

God’s desire is for you to be highly successful and happy, so you can reach out to help others who are despondent, for He said: *“…I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing”* (Genesis 12:2\). Instead of seeking attention and expecting someone to make you happy, He wants you to be the one offering care to others.

There’re those who get frustrated because they think others don’t care about them. The more they crave attention, the more it seems they’re ignored, and this upsets them. Philippians 2:4 TLB says, *“Don’t just think about your own affairs, but be interested in others too….”* Even in prayer, don’t be self\-centred, conscious of your needs only; be conscious of the needs of others.

I remember a dear brother who was brought in for one of our meetings, sick and so weak. While he was still trying to keep his broken body stable on the chair, another sick person in a more terrible state was brought in and laid beside him. His debilitating condition moved this brother to tears, and he later said when he saw this sick man and how dire his state was, he forgot about himself and began praying for him to be healed. The man received his healing and he also was healed!

When you get concerned about others, God will take care of your own desires. Maybe you’ve been praying and asking God for a new job for a while now, why don’t you pray for others who are out of jobs too? Rather than being overwhelmed by the issues in your family, begin to pray for other families around you. When you live with this consciousness, miracles will happen in your life without your having to ask. Hallelujah!

Always be gracious enough to help others, and loving enough to care about them. You’re God’s outstretched arm of blessings, love and care to your world. Think this of yourself today, because it’s God’s perception of you.

## IT’S A MATTER OF CHOICE August 20th, 2020

>***For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost (Romans 14:17\).***

In life, there’ll be circumstances or even people that’ll try to frustrate your aspirations for a happy and joyful life. Nevertheless, everything still boils down to your choice. Yes, it’s a matter of choice!

If a man chooses to allow the disappointments of others or the damning effects of life’s unfavourable conditions stop him, then he’d most likely live a frustrated life, unable to fulfil God’s purpose for him. Such a person would often vent his anger and frustration on others. He’d want to see everyone else unhappy because he finds no reason why they should be happy. This is the case with many people today.

However, based on the knowledge of God’s Word concerning you, your choice can, and should be different. Choose to live your life in the light of His truth and make up your mind that your joy and fulfilment in life would be independent of circumstances. Choose to take pleasure in every day and enjoy the moments of your life. It’s His will for you!

In Deuteronomy 30:19 TLB, the Lord said to the children of Israel, *“…I have set before you life or death, blessing or curse. Oh, that you would choose life; that you and your children might live!”* This is as touching as it is instructive. He gave you the power to choose the life of blessings because that’s His desire for you—to live in blessings evermore.

Life to the full, divine health, supernatural insight and great amplitude of mind, prosperity and wealth, a life of glory and ever\-increasing joy; these and more are your divine provisions in Christ. But you must make the choice to apprehend and appropriate these realities in your personal life. Choose to walk in God’s Word and glorify God in your life today.

## THE “LITTLE CLOUD” MEANS SOMETHING August 21st, 2020
![August 21st, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-21-the-little-cloud-means-something.jpg)

>***And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not (1 Kings 18:44\).***

Oftentimes, many are too worried and overwhelmed by their problems and the circumstances of their lives to notice the blessings of God around them. The answer or miracle they need may already be in the little signs or details around them which they’re not discerning enough to observe. 

But notice something different about the Prophet Elijah in our opening verse: After three and a half years of drought, he began praying to God for the heavens to open and bring forth rain. As he prayed, he sent out his servant several times to check if the rains were coming. Each time, the young man returned with a negative report, saying, “No, master, there’s no sign of rain outside.”

At the seventh time, however, he came back saying, “I’m not sure if it counts for anything, but I see a ‘little cloud’ in the sky, the size of a man’s hand.” At this point, Elijah sprang to his feet and said, “Yes, that’s it!” and immediately sent a message to King Ahab: “Quick, get into your carriage and head for the city before the rain stops you!”

Elijah’s servant only reported that he saw a little cloud, but that was all Elijah needed; he knew he had made progress. He was able to observe something different in the present state of affairs. Can you observe something different in your life today? Like Elijah, choose to see that “sign” of change as an indication that you already have the victory.

Don’t wait; immediately affirm, and keep affirming that you’re victorious in Christ. Keep declaring your victory, confident that God’s Word and His life in you has made you whole and brought perfection to your physical body, your life and circumstances.

Recognize the work of God in and around you and give Him glory. Refuse to allow your mind to be clogged with worries so you can hear God’s voice and discern His presence, beauty and signs. Like Elijah, see that you’ve made, and are making progress and impact through the subtle signs in your everyday life.

## MAKING PROGRESS FROM GLORY TO GLORY August 22nd, 2020
![August 22nd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-22-making-progress-from-glory-to-glory.jpg)

>***Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before (Philippians 3:13\).***

Many people think of progress or success as having an increase in income, getting a promotion at work, buying a new house, etc. But true progress is more than these; it’s the development of your spirit through the Word and the ministry of the Holy Spirit. It’s that excellence which is obvious, first in your inner\-man, and which inevitably radiates outwardly. It comes forth from the “you” in you.

When you have this awareness, you won’t be intimidated by the crises or challenges of life. That others are making progress doesn’t mean you’re failing. So, don’t measure your progress or lack of it by the success of others.

True success means living the victorious life through God’s Word, and achieving His desired goals for your life. It’s therefore unwise to measure your success by comparing yourself with someone else, because you may not know God’s plan for that person’s life.

Between you and the Lord, you can know whether you’re successful or not. You can look at your life today and tell whether you’re a success at the current phase of your life, for success is relative and measured at different phases in line with your divine purpose.

The life God has given you is one of ever\-increasing glory where you heap success upon success. If you’re successful now, He can count on you for more. Therefore, measure and celebrate your success at each point by comparing your performance or accomplishments with the set goals.

You can be a success at a certain level and then the goal broadens, the challenges are increased, but you must win at every level. When you overcome the challenges and attain those new goals, you become a success again at a new and higher level. It goes on that way from glory to glory. That’s God’s plan and idea for your success.

Dear Father, thank you for showing me how to make progress at different levels of life. My gaze is on you only, and my drive and pursuit are on fulfilling your plan and purpose for my life.

## FOLLOW GOD’S PLAN FOR YOUR LIFE August 23rd, 2020
![August 23rd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-23-follow-gods-plan-for-your-life.jpg)

>***For we are God’s \[own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, \[born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us \[taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them \[living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).***

It’s important that you reflect on your life and be sure you’re walking in sync with the Spirit and following God’s plan for your life. If you give Him your attention, He’ll guide you aright always. Jesus said of the Holy Spirit, “...He’ll guide you into all truth” (John 16:13\). Trust Him with your life, and He’ll lead and guide you in God’s perfect will for you.

When you’re walking in God’s plan, everything you require—within the ambits of His will for you—will be supplied at the right time. At every milestone in your journey, whatever you need will be in place, because you’re on the path that God planned for you. Struggling would become unnecessary, because you’re on course and piloted by the Spirit.

Some people pursue ambitions that have no connection with the purpose of God for their lives. They’re not yielded to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. God doesn’t want you doing something simply because others are doing it; seek and follow His guidance. Yield yourself to the Word. His Word is the true light.

The Psalmist said in Psalm 16:11, *“Thou wilt shew me the path of life…”*; how? Through the Word! His Word is a lamp unto your feet and a light unto your path (Psalm 119:105\). Through His Word, He leads you in the paths of success, victory, and boundless joy—those paths He already pre\-arranged for you. Your life shouldn’t be a labyrinth of circumstantial events; you’re not a child of chance. God prepared for you before you came, which means predestination is at work in you.

Never allow the fleeting pleasures of self\-centred ambitions sway you. Don’t be perturbed by any unfavourable condition in which you may find yourself. Choose rather to follow and remain in God’s plan for your life, by serving Him wholeheartedly and living in His Word, and He’ll guide you to fulfil your destiny in Him.

## CHRIST-INSPIRED RESPONSE August 24th, 2020
![August 24th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-24-christ-inspired-response.jpg)

>***But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil (Luke 6:35\).***

Have you ever been ill\-treated? I believe many of us, at one time or the other have suffered some sort of ill\-treatment or injustice. But how God expects us to respond in such a situation is clear in His Word. He said in James 5:13 AMPC, *“Is anyone among you afflicted (ill\-treated, suffering evil)? He should pray….”* How remarkable!

It parallels what Jesus also said in Luke 6:28; He said, *“…pray for them that despitefully use you.”* God is aware of such situations in our lives where we face persecutions or put up with mistreatments from other people. However, He doesn’t ask us to pity ourselves, complain, or get bitter at those who mistreat us; rather, He tells us to pray!

It’s very tempting to react in the exact opposite when maltreated. Some may even try to retaliate or get back at those mistreating them, and in the process, behave in a way different from who they truly are. Never allow someone else’s bad behaviour change your good conduct, or character.

Perhaps you were nice and loving to someone who in return treated you unfairly. Don’t decide never to show love to anyone else because of the betrayal; that won’t be Christ\-like. If you succumb to that, you’ll be allowing someone else’s flawed attitude or poor judgement control your character.

The question you should ask yourself is this: “Was it right for me to have helped and shown love?” If it was right, then keep doing what’s right. That way, you protect your spirit from unhealthy infiltrations and deny the devil the opportunity of a traction in your life.

No matter how you’re treated, maintain the Christ\-attitude. He said, *“Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you. And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not to take thy coat also. Give to every man that asketh of thee…love ye your enemies, and do good…and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil”* (Luke 6:28\-35\).

## ENJOY YOUR LIFE August 25th, 2020

>***Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy (1 Timothy 6:17\).***

You can have and enjoy your best life now. You don’t have to wait for the government of your country to set things right and make society conducive before you enjoy your life. Enjoying your life is a choice you have to make for yourself, if you really want to have God’s best today and for all time.

Life is a gift, and a calling from God. Everything in life, including the world around you, was created for your benefit. All you need to enjoy life to the full is to be yourself and stay in God’s Word. Jesus said, *“…I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows)”* (John 10:10 AMPC). Think about that!

God has richly given you all things to enjoy. 2 Peter 1:3 says, *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”* Enjoy your life to the full; everything you require to that effect has been given to you.

Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:21, *“…all things are yours.”* We also read that God has given you richly (not sparsely) ALL things to ENJOY. What you need is to spend time in the Word, to know what’s yours in Christ Jesus, so you can live by His Word and enjoy your life to the full, for His glory.

## A HAPPY HEART AND A CHEERFUL MIND August 26th, 2020
![August 26th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-26-a-happy-heart-and-a-cheerful-mind.jpg)

>***A happy heart is good medicine and a cheerful mind works healing, but a broken spirit dries up the bones (Proverbs 17:22 AMPC).***

A disease such as cancer draws its life from depression, bitterness, anger, resentment, malice and sadness. But laughter, which is one of the easiest, quickest and instantly recognizable expressions of joy and cheerfulness, has curative powers. If people who are sick or faced with dire circumstances in their lives would act simply on God’s Word by learning to laugh often, they’ll be amazed at the sudden change.

There’re those who haven’t laughed in a long time. They’ve almost forgotten how to laugh. They look at their lives and conclude there’s nothing to be happy about. In fact, they’d feel guilty if they caught themselves laughing. They believe laughing is for those who aren’t serious about life. Yet, their stiffness hasn’t made life any easier for them.

God wants you to know from His Word that laughter is a healer. Your expression of joy is a good starting point for healing and restoration. Sometimes, when life seems to get tough, learn to pull back and laugh. Have a merry heart and a cheerful mind.

Interestingly, you don’t have to pray to God to give you happiness or cheerfulness; it’s a function of your recreated human spirit. You make yourself joyful with the Word of God. Remember, one of the fruits of your recreated human spirit is joy (Galatians 5:22\); you’ve got joy in your spirit; and laughter and cheerfulness are expressions of joy.

## GODLINESS WITH CONTENTMENT August 27th, 2020
![August 27th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-27-godliness-with-contentment.jpg)

 ---

>***\[And it is indeed, a source of immense profit, for] godliness accompanied with contentment (that contentment which is a sense of inward sufficiency) is great and abundant gain (1 Timothy 6:6 AMPC).***

The Bible defines contentment for us in our opening verse as “a sense of inward sufficiency”; then it says that “godliness accompanied with contentment is great and abundant gain.” Paul, by the Spirit, further writes, *“For we brought nothing into the world, and obviously we cannot take anything out of the world; But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content (satisfied). But those who crave to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish (useless, godless) and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction and miserable perishing”* (1 Timothy 6:7\-9 AMPC).

This is the ordeal of those who struggle to be rich. But you shouldn’t get into that dilemma as a child of God, because being born again, you’ve entered into a life of contentment. You’ve ceased from your struggles and the glory of God now works within you.

The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 8:9, *“For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.”* And in Proverbs 10:22, it says, *“The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.”* This is your life as a child of God! God’s inherent blessing in your life is the basis for your riches.

Your prosperity is inherited through the Spirit, because you’re the seed of Abraham. In Christ, you have entered into God’s rest. You no longer worry over your rent and other bills. As Abraham’s seed, you’re ever aglow, full of praise and giving glory to God.

Function from a place of inward sufficiency, and operate from a vantage position of rest and satisfaction, irrespective of circumstances. No matter the situation, be full of joy; continue to praise, serve the Lord, and delight yourself in Him. He’ll create the opportunities for you to keep making progress from glory to glory.

## HE BEARS YOU UP August 28th, 2020

>***Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit Himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (Romans 8:26\).***

There’re times you may be confronted with so many predicaments that you wonder, “How am I supposed to pray about all of these problems?” The truth is, if you decide to pray about every problem or issues around you one after the other, you may spend eternity on your knees. Moreover, you may not even remember all of them.

But the good news is, God doesn’t expect you to carry your own burden. The Bible says, *“Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you”* (1 Peter 5:7\). In fact, He doesn’t expect you to pray about your problems, because you don’t even know about all of them. So how do you handle them? It’s part of the reasons He gave you the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit bears you up in the time of weakness or limitation.

When you don’t know what to do, what to pray for or how to go about a certain situation, He steps in. God gave us the Holy Spirit to guide us in all situations of life. When it comes to dealing with everyday problems, the same Holy Spirit stands in the gap (intercedes) for us as read in our theme verse. He takes charge in our behalf.

Be ever conscious and yielded to the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your personal life. He prays through you with groanings and deep sighs which can’t be uttered in articulate speech, making intercession for you according to the will of God.

This is why it’s important that you pray often in other tongues; it helps you to activate your spirit and give vent to the divine utterances of the Holy Spirit. When you pray through your spirit, you inevitably address every necessary issue in your life that needs attention.

The psalmist remarked, *“The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me…”* (Psalm 138:8\). As you pray in the Spirit, the Lord would indeed put everything that concerns you into shape, even those things that you’re unaware of. You only need to trust Him with your life, realising that He’s big enough and willing to take care of you. Blessed be His Name forever!

## STAY FOCUSSED ON THE WORD August 29th, 2020
![August 29th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-29-stay-focused-on-the-word.jpg)

 ---

>***Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith… (Hebrews 12:2\).***

The Amplified Classic translation of our opening verse says, *“Looking away \[from all that will distract] to Jesus….”* What God is telling you here is simple: stay focussed on the Word! Jesus is the incarnate Word; fix your gaze on Him; don’t get distracted.

Recall the case with Peter and the Master when they walked on the sea; Peter began to sink when he took his focus off Jesus. If he had kept his gaze on the Master, he wouldn’t have been overwhelmed by the billowing waves and tempest (read Matthew 14:25\-31\). The same thing happens to many today; when they allow themselves to be overwhelmed by problems and circumstances instead of focussing on the Word of God, they sink even further.

There’s no situation you can’t handle successfully with the Word of God. Make the Word of God your stay; live in the Word! Learn from Jesus; He lived the Word, even though He is the Word! He was focussed, and was never distracted from the Word. He looked at the result of His faith; for the joy that was set before Him He endured the Cross, despising the shame. He didn’t care what people thought about Him; His focus was to carry out the will of the Father.

It should be the same with you. They may call you names because of your devotion and dedication to the Lord, but don’t let that affect you. If anything, be inspired to love Him more; be challenged to serve Him even more passionately. Don’t be moved by hard times and turbulent circumstances; hold on tight, with your focus on Jesus.

1Timothy 6:12 says, *“Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life….”* Don’t turn away from the Word. Isaiah 26:3 reveals part of the result of keeping your focus on God’s Word; the Lord will keep you in the peace of prosperity: *“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.”*

>***He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God (Daniel 3:25\).***

In Daniel chapter three, we find the story of King Nebuchadnezzar; his image of gold, and the decree that everyone worship it. When Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego wouldn’t bow to this golden image, he threatened to throw them into a burning furnace. But the three Hebrew boys were unmoved. They believed only in the God of Israel and wouldn’t give up their faith.

“We won’t bow to your god,” they told the king. “You may set up your fire; do what you have to do!” Their courage and doggedness made the King furious; so he commanded that the fire be made seven times hotter. “Our God is able to rescue us from the fire. But even if He doesn’t, we still won’t bow,” they added.

“All right then,” fumed the angry king, “We shall see!” When the Hebrew boys were eventually cast into the furnace, the fire was so hot that even the men who threw them in died in the process. Inside the fire, the bonds on their hands and feet burnt up, but they were unharmed by the fire.

They got up and began pacing in the midst of the fire, most likely worshiping the Lord. To the king’s amazement, there was a fourth man in the fire, walking with the three lads. The Lord had joined them in the fire and rescued them. Thus, neither King Nebuchadnezzar’s threat nor his brutal actions could stifle the faith of the lads. God ensured they came out victoriously.

Similarly, you must refuse to be intimidated or swayed by obnoxious laws or decrees enacted against the faith and Gospel of Jesus Christ. Take a stand for Christ; stick to His Word and watch Him do great wonders in, and through your life. Focus on pleasing Him, doing what He wants. Don’t be bothered by what people think about you or what they do to you. What matters is what God thinks. Therefore, love and serve Him with all your heart.

>***Do not conform yourselves to the standards of this world, but let God transform you inwardly by a complete change of your mind. Then you will be able to know the will of God—what is good and is pleasing to him and is perfect (Romans 12:2 GNB).***

As a Christian, every person who comes into your world has a role to play, whether good or bad. You’ll surely come across different kinds of people in your journey of life. No matter how they relate with you, recognise that God has placed them along your path for your benefit.

It doesn’t make any difference whether they’re helpful or hostile; their relationship with you is part of God’s plan to promote you. Once you understand this, you’ll be happy and grateful to God for anyone who comes into your world. A playwright once said, “All the world is a stage, and all the men and women merely players; they have their entrances and their exits, and one man in his time plays many parts.”

Your only concern should be to please your heavenly Father. Don’t get concerned about the wrongs done to you; ignore the negative actions, comments or ill\-treatments from others. Only respond in love to those who hurt or despitefully use you.

The highest and topmost quality of God’s character is living out His love in you, for the Bible says *“…the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us”* (Romans 5:5\). You’re a testimony of the Father’s love, and your life is an outshining of that great love—unconditional and self\-giving. Hallelujah!
