## GROWING IN CHRIST July 2nd, 2020

>***And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts (Galatians 5:24\).***

Our opening verse leaves no grey area: if you belong to Christ, you’ve crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. Why then are some Christians still struggling, trying to crucify the flesh? It’s because Satan has lied to them and they believe it, due to their own ignorance of God’s Word.

Satan may taunt you by saying, “If you were a real Christian, you wouldn’t have told a lie yesterday!” That shouldn’t immediately wane your confidence and dissipate your faith and enthusiasm to serve the Lord. Remember who Satan is—a liar and the father of lies. He’s a deceiver and the accuser of God’s people (Revelation 12:10\).

If your hands were lifted in worship to the Lord, and Satan suddenly reminded you of something you did wrong, don’t suddenly drop them and start crying, feeling sorry for yourself. Rather, worship even more and say, “Father, thank you for your love and the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses me from all unrighteousness.”

Never allow Satan deceive you into thinking you’re not a real Christian because of something you did wrong. If you’re born again, you’re a real Christian. What the Word of God says is that you live out the nature of God that’s inside you. Walk in the Spirit and in righteousness. Live according to God’s Word, because that’s your life.

Every so often, say to yourself, “I’m of the Spirit and I’m ruled and guided by the Word.” Study and stay in God’s Word and you’ll live above the deceptions, manoeuvres and manipulations of Satan. The more you study, listen to, and meditate on the Word, the more you walk as the Word admonishes. This is because the Word has the power to produce in you what it talks about.

Through the ministry of the Word, you’re strengthened, encouraged, your faith is stirred and you grow steadily in Christ. The more you grow in the Lord, in grace and knowledge of His Word, the less of sin you’ll find in your life; for sin shall not have dominion over you (Romans 6:14\).

## HIS LIGHT IN YOUR HEART July 3rd, 2020
![July 3rd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-3-his-light-in-your-hearts.jpg)

 ---

>***For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 4:6\).***

In Habakkuk 2:14, the Bible says, *“For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea”*; and our opening scripture says, “*For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts….”* His light is in your heart. Then it continues further to state why that light is in your heart: *“…to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.”*

The foregoing clearly shows how the knowledge of the glory of God will cover the earth. This knowledge comes through knowing Jesus Christ, and is given through us who have received His light. Jesus, in His prayer to the Father, said, *“…thy word is truth”* (John 17:17\). In John 1:9, He said, *“That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”* His Word is the true light. So, when it says, *“God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts,”* it’s telling us that we now carry that light of God’s Word in us.

This means that the more of the knowledge of God you have, the brighter your light shines. The less of Him you know, the less of His light you exude. This is why it’s imperative that you take the ministry of the Word very seriously in your personal life. Through studying and meditating on the Word, more glory is added to your life and you keep glowing with His righteousness.

God’s plan wasn’t for man to grow, get old and die; that was the result of the curse. But Jesus brought the blessing. He brought immortality (2 Timothy 1:10\), which is unveiled through the knowledge of God in Christ. Moreover, through that knowledge, you’re rejuvenated, refreshed and renewed.

## VICTORY OVER DEVILS July 4th, 2020
![July 4th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-4-victory-over-devils.jpg)

 ---

>***For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places (Ephesians 6:12\).***

There’re people who’d like to convince themselves that demons aren’t real, they are mere figments of our imagination. But they’re wrong! Demons are real and oftentimes, Satan, who thrives on the ignorance of many, proliferates the deception that he doesn’t exist. But our theme verse tells us that we wrestle against *“…principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”* These are evil spirits.

Until their appointed time of judgment, Satan and his demons are going to do everything they can to get at you, to destroy your work and try to frustrate you. But have no fear; they’re not a factor. In Christ, you have the victory over Satan and the cohorts of darkness. They are mere rebels, running rampage and trying to wreak havoc and bring frustrations to those who let them. This is why you must know and stay in the Word and maintain your victory in Christ. The Bible says to resist the devil, and he will flee from you (James 4:7\). How do you resist the devil? With the Word!

 It makes no difference if it’s a health condition that can’t be medically explained, or issues with your job, business or family; affirm the Word! Ephesians 6:13 says, *“Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.”* The evil day is when Satan throws his darts at you. It’s the day of crisis; the day when you’re the target of the adversary. That evil day will come, and it doesn’t come only once. But as long as you’re in the Word—fully dressed with the whole armour of God—you’ll always be victorious!

You live and function in the Kingdom of light where Satan has no chance. You live in the victory and authority of Jesus Christ. You have something that the devils can’t withstand—the Name of Jesus. Use it, and triumph gloriously, always!

I live triumphantly in Christ, every day. Hallelujah!

## REJOICE TODAY July 5th, 2020
![July 5th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-5-rejoice-today.jpg)

 ---

>***Be joyful always (1 Thessalonians 5:16 NIV).***

Yesterday is gone, and tomorrow is yet to come, but today is yours to use. Therefore, make the best of today and be joyful. Don’t live in the regrets of yesterday or be apprehensive of the uncertainties of tomorrow. The regrets of yesterday and fear of tomorrow are the enemies of today’s happiness. God wants you joyful, TODAY!

Our theme verse says, *“Be joyful always.”* This can neither be applied to yesterday nor postponed to tomorrow; it’s for the NOW. Whether anybody treats you well or not, be joyful all the same.

It makes no difference that those you thought could be of help to you turned their backs on you; remain joyful. After all, God never told you to put your trust in men (Psalm 118:8\-9\). Whether or not there’s money in your bank account, be joyful. If you allow circumstances, the happenings around you or the actions of others determine your joy, then, you’re not acting on the Word. Remember, the blessing is for those who do or act on God’s Word (James 1:22\-25\). The Word says rejoice evermore (1 Thessalonians 5:16\); so, practise it.

Make up your mind that nothing will ever take away your joy. This is a decision you must make. There’s a cooperation that’s required between you and the Holy Spirit. He tells you what to do, but you have to decide to do them. If you say, “I’m going to be ever joyful as the Word of God says, irrespective of circumstances,” He’ll help you make it so.

Yes, in Christianity, there’re challenges. But the Lord says in James 1:2, “Count it all joy, when you go through diverse tests”; in other words, “rejoice!” What’s important isn’t the challenges you face but your response to them. You were born a winner, a victor; nothing in this life is set against you to hurt you or make you a victim. The Bible says, “In all these things, we’re more than conquerors” (Romans 8:37\). Hallelujah!

My life is a bundle of joy and happiness, for the joy of the Lord is my strength! Irrespective of circumstances, I remain cheerful and boisterous with praise, knowing that I draw out prosperity, peace, success, health and other blessings from deep within me. Glory to God!

## CHRIST: THE STANDARD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS July 6th, 2020
![July 6th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-6-christ-the-standard-of-righteousness.jpg)

 ---

>***My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous (1 John 2:1\).***

1 John 3:9 says, *“Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin….”* Some have misunderstood this and ran off with the wrong idea that whatever they do is right, because as Christians, they can’t sin. Yes, for the Christian, sin isn’t compulsory, but we don’t judge righteousness by what a Christian does; we judge righteousness by the light of Christ and His Word.

The Bible talks about walking in the light as He is in the light (1 John 1:7\). How consistent are your actions with the rightness of God? That’s how you know what’s right from what’s wrong. If you declare that whatever you do is right, that makes you the standard of rightness and of righteousness. But you’re not the standard of righteousness.

For example, we read in 1 Corinthians 2:16 that *“…we have the mind of Christ”*; this doesn’t mean every thought of your heart, therefore, is always right. Yes, we have the rightness of God, but He tells us in Romans 12:2, “Be not conformed to this world, but be transfigured by the renewing of your mind.” Even though you’re born again, your mind still needs to be renewed.

Let’s look at our theme verse again; it says, *“My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not….”* If it weren’t possible for you to sin, He wouldn’t have said “I’m writing this to you so that you don’t sin.” But at the same time, He lets you know sin isn’t compulsory; you don’t have to sin. That’s the reason for the very next statement: “If any man sin”; instead of “When any man sins.” He creates a balance.

Don’t go from one extreme of “Sin is compulsory as long as we’re in this flesh” to the other extreme of “Whatever I do is right”; no! Your actions, thoughts, behaviour, responses and reactions must be consistent with the Word of God, with the righteousness of Christ, for He is the standard of righteousness. Hallelujah!

## GIVE NO PLACE TO SATAN July 7th, 2020
![July 7th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-7-give-no-place-to-satan.jpg)

>***Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me (John 14:30\).***

Demon spirits, if given a chance or a foothold, could harass, influence and even torment a Christian. Paul the Apostle enjoins us, *“Leave no \[such] room or foothold for the devil \[give no opportunity to him]”* (Ephesians 4:27 AMPC).

Take for example some Christians who experience what seems like a nightmare, but actually more real an experience than a dream. In some cases, it could be an experience with some beastly figures. The person may be praying about these things, yet the situation lingers.

Oftentimes, it’s because Satan tries to maintain a connection between him and such individuals by sowing something in their hearts, such as a thought—an unclean thought. As long as such folks harbour and nurture those thoughts from Satan, a connection is established. So, even when they scare him off with the Name of Jesus, as long as his thoughts remain in their hearts, he maintains his connection and keeps coming back.

Sometimes, it could be fear. He plants fear and with that connection he keeps coming back. When you pray and rebuke him, because of what he’s kept in you which you’re helping him preserve without realising it, he keeps coming back. This is why, like Jesus, you must have nothing of Satan in you. He (Jesus) said in our theme verse, *“…for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.”*

Keep your heart free from anything that’s of the devil. Refuse to harbour fear, anger, grudge, bitterness and unforgiveness. Let love rule in your heart. Never allow fear to take a hold of you, irrespective of the happenings around you. Jesus said, *“...I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven”* (Luke 10:18\). Never be afraid of him, for he’s a defeated foe, and has no authority over you.

## HE KNOWS WHERE YOU ARE July 8th, 2020

>***Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts (Zechariah 4:6\).***

A certain man had a shop in a rural area. At a point, he wanted to move to the city, like his friends had done. But one day, while he was praying, he heard the Lord say to him, “Stay here.” So, he stayed. Two years later, the government signed a contract to expand the road in the area.

The road was constructed and expanded and a new settlement with expatriates was established in the area. His shop became the strategic corner shop for everyone in the neighbourhood. Suddenly, his business boomed, being the only shop in the area. Soon enough, what used to be located in the torn\-up street and sidewalk became a major department store where everybody transacted business. Most of his friends who had relocated to the city started coming back, but he already had the major share of the market. A few years later, he had expanded to a chain of major stores.

It doesn’t matter where you are, God knows you’re there and will channel His grace towards you as long as you stay in His Word. Our theme verse says it’s *“...Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.”* Where He tells you to stay is where you should be. He told Isaac to remain in Gerar even though others were relocating due to famine. The Bible says, *“And Isaac dwelt in Gerar”* (Genesis 26:6\). He was in God’s place, in God’s time, for God’s purpose, in God’s way.

Read the result of Isaac’s obedience in the 12th verse: *“Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.”* The man heard from God and it changed the course of his life. It’s called the blessing of God! Don’t move jobs or change business just because you think the field or pasture is greener on the other side. Hear from God. Be directed by the Holy Spirit. That’s the way of true success and progress from glory to glory.

## SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT July 9th, 2020
![July 9th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-9-simple-instructions-of-the-spirit.jpg)

>***But God chose the foolish things of this world to put the wise to shame. He chose the weak things of this world to put the powerful to shame (1 Corinthians 1:27 CEV).***

God’s Word is so simple. His instructions may sound or seem trifling, but when carried out, they always produce the supernatural. Imagine that while in Church on a service day the Pastor says, “Tell three people, ‘I’m blessed and victorious.’” You might say to yourself, “I don’t have to do that.” Why? It sounds too simple to mean anything. But that’s where many have missed it. Our theme verse says God confounds the mighty with simple, little things.

Think about this: when God delivered the children of Israel from the hands of their oppressors, the Egyptians, He didn’t lead them on the road that made the most sense. The Bible says, *“Instead, he led them in a roundabout way through the desert toward the Red Sea…”* (Exodus 13:18 GNB). Then, trapped between the Red sea and an invading army, Moses began to “pray” to God for intervention. But God interrupted him and said, *“Lift up your rod and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it…”* (Exodus 14:16 AMPC).

Consider the simple instruction given to Moses for a problem of such magnitude! It didn’t make “common sense.” How could stretching forth your rod over the sea make any difference at such a critical time? But it did! Moses obeyed the instruction, the sea parted and the children of Israel walked through on dry ground. Hallelujah! God is still that way today. He gives simple instructions.

Also see the example of the Master: He said to a man with a withered arm, *“...Stretch forth thine hand…”* (Matthew 12:13\). How could the man stretch forth the same hand that was withered? He could have complained, “Sir, can’t you see it’s withered?” But he didn’t; rather, he acted on that simple instruction and the Bible says the hand “was restored whole, like as the other.”

An instruction from the Lord, however simple, is for your benefit. When you’re in church for example, a consciousness of the presence of the Holy Spirit is so important. When instructions are given, comply. God always seeks opportunities to bless and improve our lives from glory to glory and many of such blessings are packaged in simple instructions of the Spirit.

## LOOK BEYOND YOUR PAST July 10th, 2020
![July 10th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-10-look-beyond-your-past.jpg)

>***Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. Behold, I will do a new thing… (Isaiah 43:18\-19\).***

Many gripe and grumble about their past, weighed down by the mistakes of yesterday, instead of looking at the future with the hope and opportunities it presents for greater success. It makes no difference what was said, done or written against you yesterday; see your bright and glorious future ahead. Focus on the present and the future.

Those who live in yesterday are often frustrated and can’t experience true joy. In your relationships, refuse to focus on the mistakes and misgivings of yesterday. There’s no beauty or glory in yesterday; therefore, refuse to live your life on the basis of yesterday’s experiences.

Someone may say, “Now that I have this new job, I don’t want what happened to me in the past to happen again. I’m going to be very careful.” Then, as a result of being too careful to avoid whatever negative experience they might have had in the past, their productivity falls short of their actual capacity. Their best is unseen and unheard because they’ve allowed their past experiences to guide their lives.

Let the Word of God, not your past experiences, guide you. Be inspired by the joy and inspiration of a better and more glorious tomorrow. Our theme verse says, *“Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old....”* What’s that terrible experience that wouldn’t leave your mind? Let it go!

Neither the accomplishments nor failures of yesterday should make you a captive of your past. Rather, armed with the Word and with faith in your heart, apprehend the glorious future the Lord has ordained for you, and He’ll do new and greater things through you.

## ENJOYING LIFE’S JOURNEY July 11th, 2020

>***The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows) (John 10:10 AMPC).***

I’ve always loved the window sitting on a flight. A window seat offers great views; it affords one the unique opportunity to be inspired by the things you see from such a high altitude: the icy expanse of the Arctic, the glistening peaks of the Alps, the Andes, the clouds, etc. Every so often, as I look out and savour the beauty and wonder of God’s creation, I say, “Blessed Father, you’re amazing! There’s so much beauty!”

Thus, before arriving at my destination, I enjoy the journey. Life is that way too; a journey to be enjoyed. Between now and when the Master comes back, there’s a lot to enjoy; therefore, no one should live a frustrated life. If you’d learn to pay attention to all the beautiful things and people around you, to enjoy them, you’d live happy every day.

It’s a wise choice when you make up your mind to enjoy your life and yourself even in simple things. Some don’t even enjoy their meals; they always rush it angrily. Others wake up angry; even while driving or commuting to their place of work, business or school, they’re angry, unhappy and frustrated. They ignore all the love and beauty around them.

Read our theme verse again: Jesus came that we may have and also enjoy life! Enjoying your life isn’t only about going for a game show, or watching a comedy, or engaging in some adventure. Rather, it means enjoying every moment of life’s journey; enjoying everything you do, as long as it’s consistent with a godly life, because you’re a child of God and you know God is fulfilling His dream through you.

God has given you a life of joy, but you have the responsibility to express it. Let the joy of the Lord be evident in your life with such radiance that fully expresses the peace of God in you. Make a conscious choice to enjoy the moments of your life.

## LIVE AS A CHRISTIAN July 12th, 2020

>***Whoever has been born of God does not sin, for His seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God (1 John 3:9 NKJV).***

To properly understand the verse of scripture above, you’ll have to study it in the right context. The purpose of that verse is actually in the 6th verse of the preceding chapter and it says, *“...He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked”* (1 John 2:6 NKJV). Notice it doesn’t say, “He who says he abides in Him walks just as He walked.” Rather, it says if you’re a Christian, you ought to walk (live) as a Christian; walk as He (Jesus) walked. 

Now, Romans 8:6 tells us, *“For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.”* He’s teaching us here to walk in the Spirit. He says, *“This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh”* (Galatians 5:16\). These are all instructions and guidance given to us in the Word of God.

Romans 6:1\-2 says, *“What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”* No Christian is at liberty to do wrong. You were called to display righteousness; to walk in His rightness. The life that we have in Christ is sin\-free. However, in your walk of faith, it’s possible to make mistakes; so, the Bible says, *“…the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin”* (1 John 1:7\). He prepared for us automatic cleansing.

What He expects is that you yield yourself to the Word, to be taught, to be guided in righteousness. Through the Word, you’d discover that you’re cleansed from all unrighteousness (John 15:3\), and have the capacity to live sin\-free. Praise God!

## OVERCOMING ANXIETY July 13th, 2020
![July 13th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-13-overcoming-anxiety.jpg)

 ---

>***Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance and in everything, by prayer and petition (definite requests), with thanksgiving, continue to make your wants known to God (Philippians 4:6 AMPC).***

Around the world today, many are terrified, not just about the future, but even about the present. There’s fear and terror, but the word “terror” isn’t new. If you study the Bible, you’d be amazed at how many times it talks about terror. Nevertheless, Jesus assured us of victory over all crises. He said in John 16:33, *“…In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”* 

There’s no need for you to have anxiety or panic\-bouts over anything; you’ve already overcome Satan, the world and every crisis: *“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”* (1 John 4:4\). Therefore, stop the fear. Stop the anxiety. Anxiety refers to worry; it’s a state of nervousness. But our theme verse says, *“Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything….”*

If you say, “But I can’t help being worried,” then you’re accusing God of lying to you. You’re accusing Him of asking you to do something you couldn’t do. The fact that He says, “Don’t be anxious,” means you can live without anxiety. Your response, therefore, should be, “Blessed be God! I live in the peace and provisions of Christ; I do not fret! He has perfected all that concerns me. Hallelujah!” That’s how you respond to God.

Refuse to have anxiety about your son, your daughter, your husband, your wife, your brother, your sister, your house rent, your health, your job, business, education, or about anything! When you do, the Bible says the peace of God that’s beyond human comprehension will garrison your heart and mind in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:7\). Hallelujah!

## INVIGORATED BY THE HOLY GHOST July 14th, 2020

>***For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man (Ephesians 3:14\-16\).***

In our theme Scripture, the Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, prayed for the Christians in Ephesus to be strengthened with might in their inner man. If Paul prayed thus for them, it must mean that he knew what it meant to be strengthened and must have been strengthened himself. Therefore, he wasn’t trying to get God to fulfil a promise or do something that we don’t already have as Christians.

Why then did Paul pray for the saints in Ephesus that way? It was because the people hadn’t come to the full knowledge of the divine might at work in them by reason of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. It was more of getting them to be conscious of the divine energy, the supernatural might of the Spirit inherent in them. This “strengthening” wasn’t coming from Heaven; it’s by the Spirit of God that’s already inside them. He wanted them to understand the ministry of the Holy Spirit inside them and walk in His might.

There’s a Spirit inside you that invigorates you. That Spirit gives you supernatural power, the ability to perform. Hallelujah! This is why you must never confess or accept that you’re weak. There’s no weakness in your life, for the Holy Spirit, the embodiment of all glory, dominion and strength, lives in you in His fullness. No part of your body is available for sickness, disease, infirmity, or to the devil. The Holy Spirit in you keeps your spirit, soul and body invigorated and ever alive.

Romans 8:11 declares, *“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”* This is no longer a promise but a present\-hour reality. Glory to God!

## PROSPERING THROUGH THE WORD July 15th, 2020
![July 15th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-15-prospering-through-the-word.jpg)

>***And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia (Ezra 6:14\).***

The New International Version renders the verse above thus, *“So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo….”* Notice the underlined words in the verse. Those two prophets—Haggai and Zechariah—brought them the Word of God. And the result was the encouragement of the people, and they grew and multiplied.

That’s amazing. It tells us the place of the Word— the importance and transforming power of God’s Word. It makes no difference if you’re into business or you’re a student; irrespective of your vocation, you need the Word for your life. There’s no substitute for that. You have to keep learning and meditating on the Word of God for guidance, encouragement and strength. Through the ministry of the Word, the wisdom and skill you require for your next level are imparted to you. The Word helps to build your spirit strong, so you can face anything and win in any situation.

God surely does have a plan for your success; He’s made adequate provision for your prosperity, but He doesn’t do anything outside of His Word. In 3 John 1:2, He said, *“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”* Your soul prospers through conscious meditation on the Word.

## RECKON YOURSELF ALIVE IN HIM July 16th, 2020
![July 16th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-16-reckon-yourself-as-alive-in-him.jpg)

>***For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 6:10\-11\).***

The word “reckon” in the scripture above is “logizomai” in Greek. It’s an accounting term. It means to count or record something to be so; to record or number with the sum. For instance, Mark 15:28 says Jesus was “numbered” (reckoned) with the transgressors. Jesus wasn’t a transgressor, yet He died between two thieves. He was numbered with the transgressors.

Now, the Bible says*, “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life”* (Romans 6:4\). When Jesus died, we died in and with Him, because He died in our place. He was on the Cross on behalf of everybody that ever came to this world and that’ll ever come to this world.

That’s what our theme verse is talking about when it says*, “...Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.”* Therefore, you can now declare, “I’m dead to sin, and I’m alive to God!” This should be your constant confession of the Word. You may not feel like you’re close to God, but the question is, are you born again? If yes, then take it to account, reckon that all that Jesus did was for you.

Instead of saying, “I’m so weak; I’m not able to resist temptation like some other Christians,” reckon or consider yourself to be dead to sin! Don’t think, talk or act like someone who’s struggling with sin. Change your way of thinking and accept what Jesus did in your behalf. This consciousness will empower you to live right!

Use your mind! Reckon yourself to be dead to sin. Let it be your present\-hour mentality. That’s the practical way to be in sync with how God sees you and how He thinks about you. You were in Christ when He died, you were in Him when He was buried, and you were in Him when He was raised from the dead. He sees you alive in Him now. Praise God.

## THE WORD IS FOOD INDEED July 17th, 2020
![July 17th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-17-the-word-is-food-indeed.jpg)

>***For My flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink indeed (John 6:55 NKJV).***

There are some who still cry to God to fill them afresh, to satisfy their spiritual thirst or hunger.It’s a baseless cry and may yield no results. He knew we were hungry and He sent the Bread from heaven. Today, any Christian who’s begging and crying to God to be filled is wasting his or her time.

When Jesus said, *“Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled”* (Matthew 5:6\), He was only introducing the message that He brought to the Jews; the New Testament hadn’t begun yet. He wasn’t talking to the Christian, the new creation.

In John 6:35, He said, *“...I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.”* That bread is available to anyone who comes to Him. The question then is: have you come to Him? If you’re born again, yes! You’re in Him through the New Birth; so why are you still hungry? The Bread has come; Jesus is the Bread from heaven (John 6:41\).

Also, from our theme verse, we read that His Word is the Bread, because Jesus and His Word are one. John 1:14 says, *“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us….”* So, if you’re experiencing spiritual hunger, what should you do? How do you get filled? “Eat” the Word; get under the ministry of the Word of God. Even now, as the Word of God is coming to you through this devotional, you’re being fed; you’re being nourished spiritually.

The Bible says, *“...Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God”* (Matthew 4:4\). Rather than sing and cry, “Lord, I’m hungry for you,” study the Scriptures, for only the Word of God satisfies your hunger. Now you can understand why the prophet said, *“Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts”* (Jeremiah 15:16\).

## CONQUER YOURSELF July 18th, 2020
![July 18th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-18-conquer-yourself.jpg)

 ---

>***For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? (Mark 8:36\-37\).***

Throughout history, there have been hundreds of well\-known leaders who subdued other men. The whole world was subject to them; they had everything under their tyranny. Some were even so revered and placed by others in the class of God. But Jesus said, *“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?”* (Mark 8:36\-37\).

Never pride yourself in your ability to subdue or dominate others; rather, learn to use your authority over yourself. Conquer yourself! That’s when you really win: when you say to yourself, “I’m going to do the right thing and say the right thing only,” and keep at it.

When your words and actions are under your charge, consciously subjected to God’s Word, then you’re ready for true success. When you tell yourself, “Nothing filthy will come out of me” and consciously ensure such a lifestyle through the Word, that’s the way of victory.

Refuse to give vent or expression to satanic manifestations such as anger, hatred, bitterness, jealousy and envy. Be sure that only the blessings, grace and compassion of Jesus are seen and experienced by everyone around you. Make the choice that only His love and works of righteousness will effuse from you to your world.

## BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PAINS OF OTHERS July 19th, 2020

>***Stoop down and reach out to those who are oppressed. Share their burdens, and so complete Christ’s law (Galatians 6:2 MSG).***

Years ago, as a teenager, I’d cry so hard in prayer, because of many in the world who didn’t know the Lord; the suffering humanity of sinners, the sick and the needy. I felt the burden and thought the responsibility to do something about the pain of broken people around the world rested on me. I’d wake up at night, praying with tears, because of the needy, the poor and the afflicted.

That motivated me to go from house to house, to hospitals, schools, and villages, preaching the Gospel, and I’m still at it today. Don’t shut your heart to the plight of suffering humanity. Too many people are going through so much. The suffering isn’t just the man who has lost his job; how about his children who probably can’t further their education as a result? Think about little children who may have lost both parents; how terrible life must be for them. Their future has turned bleak.

Many families are going through tough times because of a loved one who’s sick or has died; all these should get your attention to pray and increase your passion and speed for spreading the Gospel. If we can save more, there’d be less pain. Don’t be overly concerned about your situation that you forget what others are going through.

Your blessing is in blessing others. You’re lifted when you lift others. Therefore, explore every available and innovative means to reach out to those who are suffering and in pain. Don’t ignore their cries.

## WISDOM AND DIRECTION FROM THE WORD July 20th, 2020

>***I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever… (Ecclesiastes 3:14\).***

The Word of God can be applied to everything in life. The wisdom therein is all\-encompassing. 2 Timothy 3:15 says the Scriptures are able to make you wise; wise unto salvation, causing the glory of God to be revealed in you. The more you study the Scriptures, the more refined and accurate your ideas will be: ideas for creativity, innovation, perfection, strategy, health and prosperity.

This is something many Jews in Israel understand and take advantage of; they take their ideas for arts, science, technology and even their military from the Holy Scriptures. They understand that God\-inspired ideas are unfailing; hence their amazing victories and prosperity.

Your God\-inspired ideas will survive and beat every obstacle and system of this world. When there’s a crash in the economy, for example, you’ll keep making progress, because you play from a higher realm; your ideas and strategies come from the wisdom of the Spirit, through the Word. Blessed be God!

Think about it: who would have thought that David, with a stone and a sling, would take out Goliath, the giant of Gath, the champion of the Philistines? (1 Samuel 17:50\). How could anyone explain how Isaac dug and found water in the same arid place everyone else had abandoned? He acted on divine insight that came to him from the Lord.

He was about to relocate as a result of the drought, but God said, “Stay in this land and I’ll prosper you”; the same land where there was famine. He simply did what God asked him to do, and the Bible says he *“...waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great”* (Genesis 26:13\). Don’t follow the world’s principles and ideas for success. Open your heart to the Holy Spirit and His Word for wisdom and the right ideas you need for a life of ever\-increasing glory, success and prosperity.

>***To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27\).***

Some people lament how they’ve done everything they know to do, yet their lives are still at variance with the realities of God’s Word. They ask such questions as, “What more should I do to prosper?” “What more should I do to be healed?” They’re faced with these and other questions in their lives for which they seek answers.

Now, I’ve got something to tell you about this and it’s very important: One day, I was having this wonderful fellowship with the Lord about the amazing things that the prophets did in the Old Testament and the amazing abilities that He gave to His children. As I cogitated on these things, looking through the Scriptures, I pondered, “What does God want? What’s His plan? If we were to ask Him for anything, what should we ask for?”

Then, the Lord said to me, “Whatever good thing you could ever desire is nothing compared to the ‘one thing needful,’ which you already have: Christ in you!” Christ in you covers everything; it’s the biggest thing we got from God. Your recognition and acknowledgement of this truth will stop your hunger and desire for anything else; you’ll virtually find it foolish asking God for anything else.

If you can only accept that Christ has taken up His residence in the quarters of your heart, it’ll change your life. Everything that He gives, is in Him. Everything that He is, is in Him. Remember, the fullness of the Godhead—the totality of divinity—bodily dwells in Christ Jesus; and we’re complete in Him. If this is true, then what else do you want?

That’s why Paul said, “All things are yours”; the world is yours (1 Corinthians 3:21\-22\). Once you have this consciousness, the world becomes so small to you. Your boldness becomes so strong; you’ll have no fear of the future, no fear of darkness, failure or lack; because in Him, you have, and you’ve overcome all things; you’re more than a conqueror. Blessed be His Name forever!

## PRAYER STRENGTHENS YOU TO DO HIS WILL July 22nd, 2020
![July 22nd, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-22-prayer-strengthens-you-to-do-gods-will.jpg)

>***And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him (Luke 22:43\).***

One of the many benefits of prayer is that it strengthens you against unbelief, to do God’s will. Unbelief isn’t only about not demonstrating faith for what you want from God. Unbelief is also a refusal to act as God said we should act. Imagine that you’re unhappy about something and you want to take a certain action, and the Spirit says, “No need; let the matter go.” Yet, you go ahead with your decision; that’s unbelief.

Think about Moses in Numbers 20; God instructed him to speak to the rock and water would come out of the rock for the children of Israel to drink. But being angry at the people, Moses “struck” the rock twice, instead of “speaking” to the rock. The Lord was displeased and said to Moses and Aaron, *“…Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them”* (Numbers 20:12\). Moses’ disobedience was a result of unbelief; God said so.

Perhaps, if he had done as God instructed, he’d have been healed of the anger and frustration with the people. This is part of the reasons for prayer. In the place of prayer, you’re supposed to give up the consciousness of everything else and everybody else. When you’re in prayer, you give up offences, and humbly fellowship in God’s presence. Your spirit is calm from every disturbance or distraction. At that moment, you can yield to His love and direction.

Even if you had a lot of things you wanted to tell Him, sometimes He interrupts you; He starts talking before you talk. Suddenly, all the doubt, anger and frustration will disappear, and you’re strengthened. This happened with Jesus as He prayed during that moment of anguish; the Bible says, *“…there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him”* (Luke 22:43\). In the place of prayer, He received strength to do the will of the Father.

So, pray more, especially in these last days. The more frequently you pray, the more you’re pulled by the Spirit’s mind, to His ways, strategy and direction. Hallelujah!

## SUBJECT YOUR PLANS AND DESIRES TO HIM July 23rd, 2020

>***I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service (Romans 12:1\).***

Oftentimes, people have desires that aren’t in sync with God’s plan. They don’t care about God’s will, as a result, they do whatever they choose, hoping somehow God would accept their actions. They try to force their will on Him, but it doesn’t work that way. Ask, “Why are you taking these actions?” and they’d tell you, “I prayed about it.” As far as they’re concerned, God ought to accept their actions and choices since they “prayed” about it. That’s absurd!

There’s a difference between doing something because you “prayed” about it and doing something because God said so and that’s His will for you. The latter is the best and safest place to be; fulfilling God’s purpose for your life. Never find yourself doing things for which you think you don’t need God’s approval. That a plan, an idea or desire has been in your heart all your life doesn’t mean it came from God.

There’re people who are born with demons right from birth. Some others receive demons while growing in an environment that’s littered with evil, wickedness and demonic manifestations. It’s one of the reasons some people grow up with morbid desires that stay with them for many years and finally, they act on them.

But now that you’re born again, God expects you to present your body to Him, as a living sacrifice. Also, your mind must be yielded to His Word; your heart must be regulated by the Word. This is the reason for meditation. Meditating on the Word guards your thoughts in the things of God, in the direction of His plans and purpose for your life. Don’t act on carnal desires of the mind that are inspired by the world and its systems. Stay focused on the Word.

## LOVE LIKE HE DID July 24th, 2020
![July 24th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-24-love-like-he-did.jpg)

>***And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise (Luke 10:37\).***

The words in our opening verse are a part of the Lord’s dialogue with a certain lawyer who asked Him in Luke 10:25, *“…Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”*

In His response, Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan: a traveller had been stripped of his clothing, beaten and left half\-dead by the roadside. First, a priest, and then a Pharisee, came by, but both avoided the man. Finally, a Samaritan helped the injured man.

Then as read in our theme verse, Jesus said to the inquisitive lawyer, *“...Go, and do thou likewise”* (Luke 10:37\); in other words, do what the Samaritan did. How does this apply to you today? Ephesians 5:1 tells us to be emulators of God in love.

Everything about God and His eternal Kingdom centres on His love. He wants everyone in the world to know how much He loves them. The Bible says, “*For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life”* (John 3:16\). His love is the basis for everything and He gave us the honour to demonstrate that love and preach it everywhere, because it’s been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5\).

Commit yourself to helping others know Christ and experience His love. Let your life portray Him at all times. That’s what the Samaritan did; he epitomised the love of God, and we’re to do likewise.

## KEEPING YOURSELF IN HEALTH July 25th, 2020

>***My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh (Proverbs 4:20\-22\).***

The Word of God is medicine; it has curative powers. If you’d meditate on the Word, it’ll destroy every, and any form of disease and infirmity in your body. The Bible says, *“He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions”* (Psalm 107:20\).

God’s Word is the solution to every challenge. Its potency and efficacy are undeniable. As you meditate on the Word, a metamorphosis takes place in your life. If you’re facing challenges in your health, don’t despair. Get a hold of God’s Word and there’ll be a change.

The Word of God does much more for your spirit than physical food does for your body. Stay in the Word, and you’ll always be healthy and sound. Meditating on the Word will cure the blood condition, get rid of the HIV and any infectious virus; it’ll heal your bones, heart and skin and produce life in you! It’ll cure that nerotic wound that has defied treatment. Speak the Word to that infirmity; talk to the cancer; talk to the diabetes. Command that they be healed, and it shall be so. Keep yourself in health with the Word.

## DEAD TO SIN, ALIVE TO GOD July 26th, 2020
![July 26th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-26-dead-wit-h-christand-ali-ve-with-him.jpg)

>***Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 6:11\).***

The verse above reveals a profound present\-hour truth about the new creation: he’s dead to sin and alive to God! This is the perspective you should have of the Christian life; you’re to reckon (count) yourself to be dead to sin and alive to God. To be “alive to God” means to be awakened to His reality and realm of life, to be in conscious fellowship with Him.

Ephesians 2:1 AMPC says*, “AND YOU \[He made alive], when you were dead (slain) by \[your] trespasses and sins.”* When Jesus died, you died in Him; when He was raised back to life, you came alive with Him. Colossians 2:13\-14 (ESV) says, *“And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.”*

This is simply amazing! Before you were made alive with Christ, your sins and the ordinances that were against you were nailed to the Cross. In other words, both your sins and what caused them to be sin in the first place were all nailed to the Cross.

1 Corinthians 15:56 lets us know that the strength of sin is the Law; however, the very thing that gave life to sin, which is the Law, has been abolished by Jesus (Ephesians 2:15\). He gave you victory over sin, death, and the grave. See yourself in this light.

The Word of God is Light, and it’s also a mirror that shows who you really are. 2 Corinthians 3:18 says *“But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”* Now, the Word says you’re dead to sin and alive to God; as you contemplate that reality in the Word, you’re metamorphosed into that truth—into the same image that is revealed in the mirror.

The image in the mirror is of one who’s dead to sin but alive to God and His righteousness. Your response should be, “Blessed be God! I’m dead to sin, and alive to God. I’m alive to His realm of life.” Walk in this reality. Hallelujah!

## DOMINION OVER DEATH July 27th, 2020
![July 27th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-27-dominion-over-death.jpg)

 ---

>***Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him (Romans 6:9\).***

The scripture above is one of the most amazing verses in all of Romans 6 because of its implications. It doesn’t say, “Knowing that Jesus being raised from the dead dieth no more…”; rather, it says, *“…Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more….”* The Question is, who is Christ?

Christ is Jesus and His body—the Church! Jesus is the head, and the Church is His body. The head and the body form Christ. When it’s personalized, it’s “Jesus.” In certain cases, a title is added to it to call Him “Jesus Christ” or “Christ Jesus.” But every time you’re studying the New Testament and you see “Christ”, except the context dictates otherwise, it means Jesus and the Church, His body.

If death has no more dominion over the head, it doesn’t have dominion over the hand, over the legs or any other part of the body. Verse 10 says, “*For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.”* What a verse! You ought to read this and declare, “I’m alive from the dead!” Have that consciousness!

Death has no dominion over you because through Jesus Christ, you have eternal life; you’ve been brought into life and immortality (2 Timothy 1:10\). Therefore, be fearless, for death has been paralysed; defeated by Jesus. Hebrews 2:14\-15 says, *“Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.”*

When Jesus defeated death, we were in Him. Together with Him, we’ve triumphed over death and the grave. No wonder it says in 1 Corinthians 15:54\-55,  *“…Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”*

## BORN SIN-FREE July 28th, 2020
![July 28th, 2020](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-28-you-were-born-sin-free.jpg)

>***Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness (Romans 6:18\).***

Paul had difficulty communicating the truth in the verse above due to the limitation of language. He said in the next verse, *“I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh...”* (Romans 6:19\). The Message translation says, *“I’m using this freedom language because it’s easy to picture...”* (Romans 6:19 MSG). He had to bring the discussion to a seeming mundane level that they could relate with.

The reality is that the new creation wasn’t “set free” from sin; rather, he was born sin\-free; there’s a difference between the two. Born sin\-free means you were born without sin. This is easy to understand when you realise that the new creation is the result of the resurrection (not the death) of Jesus Christ. Your new life started with the resurrection of Jesus Christ: *“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life”* (Romans 6:4\).

2 Corinthians 5:17 says, *“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature…”*; a new species or kind of man, born in righteousness with no past of sin to be set free from. In Christianity, we don’t get set free; we’re free\-born! That’s the reality for the one who’s born again. You’re sin\-free. No wonder Romans 6:14 says, *“For sin shall not have dominion over you....”*

The concept of sin can’t be properly understood until you have a good understanding of the doctrine of righteousness. So, when the Bible says, *“For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness”* (Romans 6:20\), the expression “free from righteousness” actually means righteousness\-free or you were “righteousness\-exempt.” In other words, you were a slave of sin, and couldn’t practise righteousness.

However, now that you’re born again, it’s the reverse; you can practise righteousness and produce fruits and works of righteousness because that’s your nature in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!

## HE’S ABLE TO KEEP YOU FROM FALLING July 29th, 2020

>***Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen (Jude 1:24\-25\).***

The scripture above is just so comforting; the Lord is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy. This is part of His ministry in your life. Glory to His Name forever! If we had read that “He picks you up each time you fall,” that would have been wonderful. But His job isn’t to pick you up each time you fall, but to keep you from falling.

Some believe that as Christians, we fall and then we get up, but that’s not what the Word says. Don’t believe in falling. Accept what the Word of God says rather than your experiences or that of others. Accepting and living out God’s Word is where the power and glory is. Every time you affirm the Word, it produces in you what it says. Therefore, rather than have a rising and falling mentality, every so often, declare, “The Lord is able to keep me from falling; therefore, none of my steps shall slide. I’m up all the time, steadfast, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. Glory to God!”

Irrespective of the happenings around you, be bold to declare, “My life is upward and forward only; I’m standing strong in faith; nothing shakes me; I’m deeply rooted in Christ, the Solid Rock, and He never lets me fall!” Make this your contemplation and understanding of Christ, and His ministry in your life will be fulfilled.

## KEEP INFLUENCING YOUR WORLD WITH THE GOSPEL July 30th, 2020

>***And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned (Mark 16:15\-16\).***

Preaching the Gospel isn’t something you choose to do or not to do; it’s your calling; it’s your primary responsibility on earth to win souls. 

2 Corinthians 5:18 says God has reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation. Your commitment to the Lord must reflect in your dedication to soul\-winning. Be absolute about this. Paul said, “I’m compelled to preach the Gospel, and doomed if I don’t” (1 Corinthians 9:16\). This isn’t about convenience; it’s required of you; it’s a responsibility for which you’ll give account and be rewarded of the Lord when He judges His saints.

1 Corinthians 4:1\-2 says, *“Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.”* Be faithful in reaching others with the Gospel. The Apostles lived for this cause. Many have suffered severe persecutions and some were killed for preaching the Gospel. 

Therefore, even if you were reviled or disdained for preaching Christ, keep at it. Keep influencing and impacting your world positively with the power of God in His Gospel. Be exceedingly passionate about this because the time is short.

>***O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is; To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary (Psalm 63:1\-2\).***

Even though the glory of God and the power of God are interchangeably used in Scripture sometimes, they’re not exactly the same. For example, when Moses was asked of the Lord to talk to the rock, what God wanted was for His glory to be manifested. But Moses rather struck the rock, and God’s power was manifested.

However, from God’s response to Moses, we know He wasn’t pleased because He reprimanded Moses by saying, “You didn’t glorify me before the people” (Numbers 20:11\-12\). So, here’s the point: the glory is greater than the power because the glory includes not only the power of God but also the grace and righteousness of God. The glory of God, actually, is the term that encapsulates all of His splendour and His righteousness. He manifests His righteousness in His glory.

His power is manifested through us to accomplish His purpose. Nonetheless, that power could be abused as Paul indicates in 1 Corinthians 9:18: *“What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.”* Thus, it’s possible for someone to misuse the power of God but you can never misuse the glory of God.

Always, what God wants is for us to manifest His glory, and to do that, you have to walk in His grace and in His righteousness as well; they all go together.
