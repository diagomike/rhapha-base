##  THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRIST July 1st, 2024

 >***And many other signs truly did Jesus  in the presence of his disciples, which  are not written in this book: But these  are written, that ye might believe that  Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God…”  (John 20:30-31).***

***And many other signs truly did Jesus  in the presence of his disciples, which  are not written in this book: But these  are written, that ye might believe that  Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God…”  (***[***John 20:30\-31***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020:30-31&version=kjv)***).***

What we just read points out something absolutely remarkable; it says the specific miracles of Jesus that are recorded in the Bible have a singular purpose: to engender belief in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God. What exactly does the expression “Jesus is the Christ” mean?

The word “Christ” was translated from the Greek language into English, and it doesn’t properly capture what the Jews understood as "The Messiah." This is understandable, because the Greeks didn't have the message of the Kingdom. So, the Jews knew that the word Christ meant far more than the Anointed One; it actually means God in the flesh.

This claim, which many take so lightly, was what they killed Jesus for. Jesus claimed to be the Son of God, meaning that He was God's manifestation in the flesh. And He was right. That's the meaning of Christ. In [Mark 14:60\-64](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014:60-64&version=kjv), during Jesus' trial before the high priest Caiaphas, many false witnesses came forward with accusations against Him, but their testimonies didn’t align.

Finally, the high priest asked Jesus directly, *"...Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"* ([Mark 14:61](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014:61&version=kjv)). Jesus responded, *"...I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven"* ([Mark 14:62](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014:62&version=kjv)). The Chief Priest became furious, tore his clothes, and accused Jesus of blasphemy.

Consequently, Jesus was condemned to death. They accused Him of robbery; that is, robbing God of His place. They said, *“...For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God”* ([John 10:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:33&version=kjv)). But the Bible says, *“Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God”* ([Philippians 2:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:6&version=kjv)), because He is Himself God.

[John 1:14 NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&version=NKJV) says, *"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."* [1 Timothy 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%203:16&version=kjv) says, *“...God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.”* That’s Jesus, the Christ. Hallelujah!

## WISDOM TO DISCERN RIGHT FROM WRONG July 2nd, 2024
![July 2nd, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-2-wisdom-to-discern-right-from-wrong-july-2024.jpg)

>***Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin (***[***James 4:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:17&version=kjv)***).***

Our opening scripture reveals something quite striking. It says if you know the right thing to do and don’t do it, to you, it’s a sin. That thing may not be a sin to someone else but it is a sin to you because you knew it was the right thing to do but you didn’t do it. This is one major reason God’s people need to understand the workings and guidance of divine wisdom in their lives.

Wisdom gives you the ability to decide and discern right from wrong. Wisdom helps you distinguish righteousness from evil. There’re three major kinds of wisdom the Word of God talks about, and the Greek words for them are “Sophia,” “Sunesis” and “Phronesis.”

“Sophia” is theoretical wisdom, the insight that God gives you into reality. “Sunesis” is comprehension, perception, understanding, the ability to understand concepts and see relationships between them. It suggests quickness of apprehension, the penetrating consideration which precedes action.

But when we say wisdom is the ability to decide and discern right from wrong, we’re referring to “Phronesis,” which is practical wisdom. “Phronesis” is a mindset, the mindset of the righteous; it’s a force. When we say wisdom is a force, we’re referring to “Phronesis.”

“Phronesis” is that disposition of being in the will of God beyond your reasoning. It’s a special spiritual elixir that locates you within the framework or ambits of God’s will beyond your understanding. It locates you in the places where you ought to be; it causes you to do the things you ought to do without having to reason them out first, because it has created a mindset within your system. It’s your default setting to only talk right, think right, live right, and do right. It’s a programming.

If therefore you know what is right by “Sophia” and you don’t do it, then it means you lack “Phronesis.” “Phronesis” is a propeller. It helps you see what you should see that others may not see. The beautiful thing is, you can develop yourself to function always in “Phronesis” through conscious and constant meditation on the Word of God.

Dear Father, as I yield myself to the guidance of your Spirit, I function with an increased manifestation of  practical wisdom—the mindset of the righteous. I’m  programmed to think, talk, live and act right, and walk consistently in the light of your Word, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

## GOD SAW IT July 3rd, 2024
![July 3rd, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-3-god-saw-it-new-july-2024.jpg)

***And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ (***[***Colossians 3:23\-24***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:23-24&version=kjv)***).***

How do you live your life every day? Are you aware that all your actions, including the thoughts of your heart, are seen by God? So, you may have done something that you thought no one noticed, but God saw it. He sees everything.

That’s why the Bible says when we serve, we should serve as unto the Lord and not unto men. Those around you may not notice your hard work and diligence, but God sees it. He knows.

Imagine that you worked as an attendant in a restaurant, and every day, you took some food home without the knowledge of your employer. But in your mind, you thought, “It’s leftovers anyway; moreover, nobody saw me take it.” God saw you!

What does God think about such actions? They’re wrong. It’s like when you work in an organization and then you muddle things up and hide them from your boss; but you can’t hide them from God. Everything you do must be unto the Lord.

If you know that something isn’t right and you present it as though it’s right, the Bible says, to you, it is sin ([James 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:17&version=kjv)). Make up your mind that you’d be forthright, and walk uprightly at all times, irrespective of who’s watching. The most important thing is that God is watching. The Bible says, *“Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do”* ([Hebrews 4:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:13&version=kjv)).

## WEALTH, RICHES & RIGHTEOUSNESS July 4th, 2024
![July 4th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-4-wealth-riches-and-righteousness-july-2024.jpg)

 >***Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. His  seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be  blessed. Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever (Psalm 112:1-3).***

***Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments. His  seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be  blessed. Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever (***[***Psalm 112:1\-3***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20112:1-3&version=kjv)***).***

Notice what the Bible says: the one who reveres the Lord and delights greatly in His Word is blessed. And not only that, wealth and riches shall be in his house, and his righteousness endures forever. Wealth, riches and righteousness are the heritage of the one who belongs to Christ.

This completely debunks the erroneous belief that if you’re rich you can’t be righteous. God has made His children rich through Christ. The lives of many Christians may somewhat be in antithesis with this, but it doesn’t negate God’s truth.

Those of us who have accepted His Word as it is have a different reality. In Christ we have wealth, riches and righteousness. It’s the life God has given us in Him.

The bane of many around the world today is ignorance; many have never been accurately taught the Word of God. Therefore, they don’t know how to apply it in order to walk in the reality of their glorious inheritance in Christ.

Make up your mind that you’re going to walk in the light of God’s Word as it relates to your prosperity in Christ. Even if you really didn’t care about being rich, He ordained that you should be able to make others rich. Well said the Apostle Paul, *“As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things”* ([2 Corinthians 6:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%206:10&version=kjv)).

Locate yourself in the plans and purposes of God so you can have His will fulfilled in your life. He said, *“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth”* ([3 John 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=3%20John%201:2&version=kjv)).

## “FEELING GOOD” DOESN’T MEAN BEING BLESSED July 5th, 2024
![July 5th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-5-feeling-good-doesnt-mean-being-blessed-july-2024.jpg)

 >***For we are the circumcision, which  worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in  Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in  the flesh (Philippians 3:3).***
---
***For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh (***[***Philippians 3:3***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203:3&version=kjv)***).***

I love the Word of God! It’s always so clear as to how we’re to live our lives, how to serve and worship the Lord. Ponder for a moment what we just read in our theme scripture. It says we’re the circumcision that worship God in the spirit and have no confidence in the flesh. In other words, our worship has nothing to do with “feelings” or the manifestations of the flesh.

Some people sing certain songs that only make them “feel good,” and they think they’re being blessed. Any unscriptural song, no matter how good it makes you feel, doesn’t bring any improvement to your life.

For example, the song “The power, the power, the Pentecostal power is still here today….” If you like, sing it and “shake” and think you’re being blessed; you’re not. The Bible doesn’t say anything about “Pentecostal power”; there’s no such thing as Pentecostal power.

But a good number of Christians sing such songs because it makes them “feel good.” Feeling good and being blessed aren’t the same. When you’re blessed, your life is improved. You can feel good without your life being improved.

Some go to church looking forward to music that makes them dance. So, they dance and dance until they’re drenched in sweat, thinking they’re praising God. Such dancing in the flesh may make you feel good; it doesn’t mean you’re blessed and that God accepts it.

True worship is of the spirit and in the spirit, not in the flesh. Recall what we read in our theme verse. It parallels the words of the Lord Jesus in [John 4:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%204:23&version=kjv), *“But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.”* Notice the Master didn’t say, “The Father seeks those who will dance with all their might and sweat on the dance floor.” True worship is done according to the Word of God and by the Holy Spirit.

So when you praise God, let your heart be attuned to Him. Offer to Him words that glorify His Name—words that are consistent with His person, His character and love, His grace, tender\-mercies, holiness, righteousness and greatness. That’s what blesses you and brings transformation to your life.

## IT MATTERS WHAT YOU LISTEN TO July 6th, 2024

 >***My son, give attention to my words;  Incline your ear to my sayings. Do not let  them depart from your eyes; Keep them  in the midst of your heart; For they are  life to those who find them, And health to  all their flesh (Proverbs 4:20-22 NKJV).***

***My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart; For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh (***[***Proverbs 4:20\-22 NKJV***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:20-22&version=NKJV)***).***

What you listen to matters. If you listen to the Word of God that lifts your spirit, you’ll be lifted; your life will be improved. The Word of God is life and will keep you healthy if you give it attention as the scripture says.

You have to learn to reject negative words and information that demean or condemn. Many naturally feel more comfortable with words that condemn them because they recognize their frailties.

Such people live in fear continually because of their ignorance of the Word of God. As a child of God, you must be different; and learn and know the Word of God for yourself. The Lord Jesus said, *“And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free”* ([John 8:32 NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:32&version=NKJV)).

The Word of God is truth. Truth liberates you and brings you into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. Listen to the Word every day. Study the Bible. Study Rhapsody of Realities diligently and follow the Bible study guide that it provides. Fill your heart with the Word of God, and you’ll most certainly live an exciting and prosperous life.

[Joshua 1:8 NKJV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:8&version=NKJV) says, *“This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.”* Be a master of the Word. Live in it twenty\-four hours every day, and you’ll live a great life of success, glory and victory.

## KNOW THE TRUTH AND LIVE IN GLORY July 7th, 2024

>***And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free (***[***John 8:32***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:32&version=kjv)***).***

It’s sad to know that the victorious, prosperous and joyous life in Christ is still elusive to many. Yet, the vicarious sacrifice of the Lord Jesus in our behalf ushered us into the transcendent life. His sufferings brought us into a life of glory ([1 Peter 1:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:11&version=kjv)). Some aren’t even aware that there’s such an inheritance in Christ; they think everybody else is suffering the way they are; no! There’re those of us who have found out the truth and therefore are living the higher life in Christ.

God said in [Hosea 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%204:6&version=kjv), *“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge….”* The Bible says, *“…through knowledge shall the just be delivered”* ([Proverbs 11:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2011:9&version=kjv)). No wonder the Spirit, through Paul, prays *“...that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God”* ([Colossians 1:9\-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:9-10&version=kjv)).

I admonish you to make the Word of God your stay; live in the Word. [Isaiah 26:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2026:3&version=kjv) says, *“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.”* Make the choice, the deliberate choice, to believe God’s Word, meditate on it, and live accordingly.

The result is that the Lord will keep you in perfect peace; you’ll live in prosperity, with dominion over crises and adversities. [2 Peter 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:2&version=kjv) talks about grace and peace being multiplied in your life through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. Get to know the Lord through His eternal Word and live in glory as His grace and peace with prosperity are multiplied in your life.

## HE’S THE MASTERMIND OF  EVERY GOOD THING July 8th, 2024

 >***For I know the thoughts that I think  toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts  of peace, and not of evil, to give you an  expected end (Jeremiah 29:11).***

***For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end (***[***Jeremiah 29:11***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2029:11&version=kjv)***).***

It’s amazing how much God loves us. Think about the fact that He gave us everything! He gave us His Kingdom, He gave us His righteousness, He gave us His wisdom, He gave us His glory, He gave us His Name, and even gave us His life. It shows how much He loves us.

So, when people are suffering and in pain, it’s not from God. The Bible says in [Psalm 33:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2033:5&version=kjv), *“...the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.”* His goodness—that’s all He wants every man, woman, boy and girl on the face of the earth to experience every day.

[Psalm 16:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2016:11&version=kjv) says in His presence is fullness of joy, and at His right hand are pleasures for evermore. That lets you know the kind of God He is. He’s not the mastermind behind your suffering. He’s not the mastermind behind your sorrows.

Perhaps you’re reading this today and life has been hard for you; things haven’t been going the way you want them to go; you’re not living a fulfilled life; there can be a change even now. Embrace this loving Christ; believe truly that He loves you and wants the best for you.

He said in [3 John 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=3%20John%201:2&version=kjv), *“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”* What a blessed desire from our ever\-loving and gracious heavenly Father! He’s the Father of light and of all good things, and He doesn’t discriminate ([James 1:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:17&version=kjv)). [Matthew 5:45](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:45&version=kjv) says, *“…for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.”* He’s that gracious and kind.

Also think about what He says in [Isaiah 1:19 (TLB)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%201:19&version=TLB): *“If you will only let me help you, if you will only obey, then I will make you rich!”* Imagine the invitation; that means it’s up to you to let Him help you live in prosperity and superabundance. But how does He help you? It’s through His Word. His Word is His truth and the light that guides you in the path of absolute victory and dominion in life. As you walk in the light of His Word, you discover all the blessings that belong to you in Christ and enjoy the fullness of your inheritance in Him. Hallelujah!

It’s amazing how much God loves us. Think about the fact that He gave us everything! He gave us His Kingdom, He gave us His righteousness, He gave us His wisdom, He gave us His glory, He gave us His Name, and even gave us His life. It shows how much He loves us. So, when people are suffering and in pain, it’s not from God.

## NOT REDEEMED OR DELIVERED July 9th, 2024
![July 9th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-9-not-redeemed-or-delivered-july-2024.jpg)

 >***Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).***
---
***Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (***[***2 Corinthians 5:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=kjv)***).***

When we say the new creation isn’t the “redeemed” or wasn’t “delivered” from sin or Satan, many don’t understand it. When the Bible talks about redemption, like you find in [Luke 1:68](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201:68&version=kjv), which says, *“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people”*; it’s a reference to the Jews.

The Jews were the ones that needed to be redeemed because they were under the curse of the law. So when Paul says, *“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law…”* ([Galatians 3:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203:13&version=kjv)), it’s important not to be misled by his generic use of the word “us.” Paul was speaking as a Jew.

The Gentiles weren’t redeemed from the curse of the Law because they were never under the Law. That’s why in [Ephesians 4:17\-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:17-18&version=kjv), the Gentiles are described as being alienated from God and strangers to the covenant of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.

But thanks be unto God; in Christ Jesus, both the Jews and the Gentiles have been brought together to make one new man that’s neither a Jew nor a Gentile; that’s the new creature ([Ephesians 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:14&version=kjv)). This new creature is a brand new man that never existed before as read in our theme scripture. The new creature is a new species, and this is where you belong in Christ.

So, being born again, you were born into a newness of life. You have the life of Christ now. You don’t have a past to be redeemed or delivered from, for your old nature, the life you had before you were born again, was supplanted by Christ’s divine nature. Now you walk in newness of life ([Romans 6:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:4&version=kjv)). Glory to God!

## EXCELLENCE CAN’T BE IGNORED July 10th, 2024

>***…a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit (***[***Proverbs 17:27***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2017:27&version=kjv)***).***

Walking in excellence is for those who make the choice. Therefore, develop your spirit for excellence, to always produce outstanding results. Remember the words of Jesus: *"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid"* ([Matthew 5:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14&version=kjv)).

Then in the 16th verse, He said, *“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven”* ([Matthew 5:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:16&version=kjv)). Yes, you’re shining, but are you shining enough to give light? It doesn’t matter what anybody thinks; make up your mind to do what you do so well that you’ll be a reference for excellence and thus make yourself so relevant and indispensable by building stability, discipline and reliability into your character.

There’re people who have so many responsibilities because of their excellent spirit and excellent performance. They’re so dependable that every time something new is about to be done in their place of work, their names come up. Yes; it’s because excellence can’t be ignored.

## PROTECT YOUR LOVE FOR HIM July 11th, 2024
![July 11th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-11-protect-your-love-for-him-july-2024.jpg)

 >***And hope maketh not ashamed; because  the love of God is shed abroad in our  hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given  unto us (Romans 5:5).***
---
***And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us (***[***Romans 5:5***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:5&version=kjv)***).***

In [Revelation 2:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%202:25&version=kjv), the Lord tells us something quite thought\-provoking. He says, *“But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.”* We just read in our opening scripture that His love has been shed abroad in our heart. That means you have to protect your love for Him, because you could lose it.

It helps to understand why He tells us to guard our hearts with all diligence, because His love is in your heart. The Lord won’t ask you to protect what you’ve received from Him if there isn’t the possibility of losing it. For example, people receive healing and after some time, maybe due to carelessness, sin or unbelief, they lose the healing.

As a Christian, it’s important you stay in the Word. Remember the words of the Master, *“If ye love me, keep my commandments”* ([John 14:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:15&version=kjv)). By keeping His Word, you demonstrate your love for the Lord. Every day presents opportunities for you to live out the Word, keep the faith, and maintain your confession of who Jesus is and all He means to you. 

Nothing should ever make you take your gaze off the Master. He’s all that truly matters. Protect your love for Him and your passion for the Gospel. Keep preaching His love to those around you who haven’t yet known Him. Keep interceding for them until they receive salvation.

Let nothing stand in the way of your service in the house of God. Give no room for offence, malice or bitterness. [Hebrews 12:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:15&version=kjv) says, *“Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.”*

There have been some Christians who were doing so well, loving the Lord and leading others to Christ, but suddenly they became cold and even stopped going to church because someone offended them. No! Let nothing quench your fire. [Colossians 3:23\-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:23-24&version=kjv) says, *“And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.”*

The end of all things is near. Maintain your passion for the Lord and keep producing fruits of righteousness; there’s a crown of glory waiting for you at the end.

## OUR LIGHT—A BLAZING INFERNO July 12th, 2024
![July 12th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-12-our-light-a-blazing-inferno-july-2024.jpg)

 >***Whose fan is in his hand, and he will  thoroughly purge his floor, and gather  his wheat into the garner; but he will  burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire (Matthew 3:12).***

***Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire (***[***Matthew 3:12***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203:12&version=kjv)***).***

In [Isaiah 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2010&version=kjv), the prophet prophesied saying, *"And the Light of Israel shall become a fire and His Holy One a flame, and it will burn and devour \[the Assyrian's] thorns and briers in one day"* ([Isaiah 10:17 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2010:17&version=AMPC)). In understanding this prophetic passage, it's crucial to grasp its spiritual connotations.

While it may initially seem to address the Assyrian king or empire of the time, there's a deeper layer of prophetic significance pointing to the future. First, the Assyrian is the spiritual description of the antichrist in the Old Testament. With that in mind, let’s read the words of Jesus in [Matthew 5:14 (NIV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14&version=NIV): *"You are the light of the world...."*

As Christians, we are the light of the world, and in this prophetic vision, our light transcends mere illumination; it’s a raging fire—a blazing inferno! Furthermore, the Bible says, *“...it will burn and devour \[the Assyrian's] thorns and briers in one day"* ([Isaiah 10:17 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2010:17&version=AMPC)).

These thorns and briers represent the evil schemes, deception, and devious agenda being orchestrated by the enemy in today’s world. The imagery projected and painted by the prophet is that we’re the fire that burns and devours the Assyrian's thorns and briers. Through our words, we obliterate the deceptive works of the antichrist in these last days.

We’ve been empowered by the Spirit to be a ferocious fiery force against the works of darkness. In essence, we are the fire and they are the chaff. Hallelujah! Have this consciousness. You’re the light of the world, the beacon of hope and transformation to those around you.

Therefore, ignite a blazing fire to consume the works of darkness. Everywhere you are, speak God’s Word. Proclaim His truth and establish His righteousness in your world. It’s your calling. Hallelujah!

## THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH HAS BEEN POURED OUT July 13th, 2024
![July 13th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-13-the-spirit-of-truth-has-been-poured-out-july-2024.jpg)

 >***And I will pray the Father, and he shall  give you another Comforter, that he  may abide with you for ever; Even the  Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot  receive, because it seeth him not, neither  knoweth him: but ye know him; for he  dwelleth with you, and shall be in you  (John 14:16-17).***

***And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you (***[***John 14:16\-17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:16-17&version=kjv)***).***

When Jesus spoke of the Holy Spirit, He called Him the Spirit of truth ([John 14:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:17&version=kjv), [John 15:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:26&version=kjv), [John 16:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13&version=kjv)). So when the Bible says in [Joel 2:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joel%202:28&version=kjv), *“And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh...”* it meant the Spirit of truth would be poured out upon all flesh, upon the nations. This happened in [Acts 2:1\-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:1-11&version=kjv).

So, today, in this Church age, the Spirit of truth is at work. We live and function by the Spirit of truth. The Bible says the lying tongue is only for a short time; it can never be successful. In this day of the Church where the Spirit of truth has been released and poured out, He’s at work throughout the whole world.

Through our preaching of the Gospel and intercession for the nations, we release truth into all nations and deception can’t stand against the power of truth. The day of deception will come, when the whole world will be deceived, but that’s after the rapture of the Church.

But this is our day, and the Gospel shall have free course in every nation. The spirit of truth must prevail in every land and in every heart until all whom God has appointed unto salvation have come into the Kingdom. This is the day of God’s grace, where Truth must gain the ascendancy. Remember, His Word is truth ([John 17:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:17&version=kjv)). Therefore, keep proclaiming God’s truths with boldness always and in every place.

Dear Father, thank you for the Spirit of truth by whose  ministry in every nation deception is being decimated.

## PLAN YOUR OFFERINGS July 14th, 2024

***Let each one \[give] as he has made up his own mind and purposed in his heart, not reluctantly or sorrowfully or under compulsion... (***[***2 Corinthians 9:7 AMPC***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7&version=AMPC)***).***

Giving to God should always be a joy, and we’re blessed for doing it. Nonetheless, we can have greater results by doing it according to His Word.

There's a great significance to planning the offerings that you give to the Lord. Remember, He is God; He’s not a man. Your offering to Him is holy; it’s a sanctified thing and it deserves careful consideration; it’s something you have to be intentional about.

Your offering to God is not a “casual” giving; it’s something you do as an act of worship. When you give your offerings to God, you’re saying to Him, “I recognize that you are God, and I worship you as my Lord.”

Some have the misconception that giving offerings to God involves giving away your “excess” or what you don't really need. Such an approach can lead to financial instability and challenges down the line. Plan your giving and recognise the holiness and sanctity of your offerings.

The Apostle Paul tells us, *"I want each of you to take plenty of time to think it over, and make up your own mind what you will give…"* ([2 Corinthians 9:7 MSG](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7&version=MSG)). Recognize the spiritual significance of your offerings so you can experience the fullness of God's blessings associated with it.

Don’t be swayed by arguments against giving or influenced by those who downplay its significance. Instead, pay attention to the Word. Jesus said in [Luke 6:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:38&version=kjv), *"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom…."*

Prayerfully plan what you will be giving as your offerings, which, by the way, are different from your tithes and firstfruits or special seeds. This is an integral part of your financial stewardship. Plan your offerings and give them joyfully, knowing that *“...God loves (He takes pleasure in, prizes above other things, and is unwilling to abandon or to do without) a cheerful (joyous, \`\`prompt to do it") giver \[whose heart is in his giving]”* ([2 Corinthians 9:7 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7&version=AMPC)).

This is the way to position yourself to walk in God's superabundant blessings in every aspect of your life. Praise God!

  <summary>Prayer</summary>
  
Dear Father, I thank you for the privilege and blessings of giving my offerings; I’m taking actions to do it  consistently, reverently and joyfully with the wisdom of  God. Therefore, I walk in abundant blessings, bearing  increased fruits of righteousness, in Jesus' Name. Amen.

>***For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation (***[***Psalm 149:4***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20149:4&version=kjv)***).***

The psalmist in the opening verse uncovers a profound truth that transcends mere religious rhetoric. It's a revelation that speaks at the very heart of our relationship with God. Observe that it doesn’t say "For the LORD taketh pleasure in the beauties of heaven or His holy angels," no! It says, *"For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people..."* ([Psalm 149:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20149:4&version=kjv)).

It means God delights in you. He likes you! Pause for a moment and ponder those words. This isn’t merely about God loving us, even though that truth is monumental in itself. This is something more personal, more intimate— God delights in YOU.

Someone might think, "Pastor Chris, how can He take pleasure in me? I smoked last night; I told a lie last week.” Irrespective of what you’ve done, the Bible tells us that the Lord takes pleasure in His people, and that includes you!

Now that you know how much He loves and delights in you, live right and do the things that please Him. That’s why He gave you His nature of righteousness so that without struggle you can live a righteous life.

Every so often, contemplate the depth of God's favourable disposition towards you; think deeply on it. It’ll change your outlook on life. You’ll see yourself differently. Every aspect of your life—your work, relationships, aspirations—will take on a new meaning.

Now, if God likes you, it must mean He cares about where you are, what you do, where you live and work, who your friends are—everything about you! Can you see why He tells you in [Matthew 6:25 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:25&version=NIV), *“…do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear....”*

He doesn’t want you agitated about anything because you’re His beloved and He knows how to take care of His own. Instead of having anxiety about anything, He says, “Cast them on me because I care for you” ([1 Peter 5:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:7&version=kjv)). See how much He takes pleasure in you—His favourite.

This is something more personal, more intimate— God delights in YOU. Now that you know how much He loves and delights in you, live right and do the things that please Him.

## CONVICTION IS IMPORTANT July 16th, 2024
![July 16th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-16-conviction-is-important-july-2024.jpg)

 >***For our [preaching of the] glad tidings  (the Gospel) came to you not only in  word, but also in [its own inherent]  power and in the Holy Spirit and with  great conviction and absolute certainty  [on our part]. You know what kind of men  we proved [ourselves] to be among you  for your good  (1 Thessalonians 1:5 AMPC).***

***For our \[preaching of the] glad tidings (the Gospel) came to you not only in word, but also in \[its own inherent] power and in the Holy Spirit and with great conviction and absolute certainty \[on our part]. You know what kind of men we proved \[ourselves] to be among you for your good (***[***1 Thessalonians 1:5 AMPC***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%201:5&version=AMPC)***).***

In 1989, a young lady who had attended our services for only a few months was asked, "What’s the message of Pastor Chris?" Her response was profound and insightful. She said, "The divine life." And she was right.

She gave the response having severally witnessed my conviction of the Gospel. It’s been decades, yet the message has remained the same. It’s a message I’ve lived and taught, a reality that has permeated every aspect of my life.

How did I come about this? Well, it’s because I believe in Jesus Christ. When you believe in Jesus Christ, you should believe with all your heart. There has to be oneness with Him. His truth is not given to us to debate; His truth is given to us to accept as the only truth.

In [John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:6&version=kjv), the Lord Jesus Himself declared, *"...I am the way, the truth, and the life...."* He left no room for doubt, debate or speculation. He unequivocally stated, "No man comes to the Father but by me," affirming His exclusivity as man’s Kinsman\-redeemer, Mediator and Saviour.

Paul reiterated the same truth in [1 Timothy 2:5\-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:5-6&version=kjv): *“For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.”* Jesus is the truth. Everything you’ll ever know about God and from God is in Jesus. He’s the embodiment of all wisdom and knowledge.

[Colossians 2:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:3&version=kjv) says, *“In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”* He’s the embodiment, the totality of divinity. [Colossians 1:19 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:19&version=AMPC) says, *“For it has pleased \[the Father] that all the divine fullness (the sum total of the divine perfection, powers, and attributes) should dwell in Him permanently.”*

This has to become real to you. It has to become your truth; it has to become your gospel, your personal message. It has to become your absolute conviction, something for which you’d rather die than deny or turn away from.

## HIS TRUTH PREVAILS July 17th, 2024
![July 17th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-17-his-truth-prevails-july-2024.jpg)

 >***Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is  come, he will guide you into all truth:  for he shall not speak of himself; but  whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he  speak: and he will shew you things to  come (John 16:13).***

***Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come (***[***John 16:13***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13&version=kjv)***).***

In [John 16:7\-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:7-8&version=kjv), the Lord Jesus spoke to His disciples, telling them that it was to their advantage that He had to go away, for if He did not go away, the Helper (the Holy Spirit) would not come to them. But soon after His ascension, the Holy Spirit came as foretold and has been here ever since, to guide men into the truth.

The Holy Spirit is carrying out His work in these last days as we preach, teach and disseminate the Word of God to help bring the nations of men into the knowledge of the truth for their salvation. The Bible says in [Acts 19:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:20&version=kjv), *“So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.”* This is happening all over the world.

In a world of darkness, deception and falsehood, God’s truth is prevailing. And as we pray for all nations, the light of truth further gains dominance, blazing with unquenchable intensity.

In your prayer times, declare that the Spirit of truth fills your nation, your cities, states, towns and villages. Declare that the evil works in every nation are paralyzed and God's purpose for the nations is fulfilled.

When you pray this way, you’re establishing the truth of the Word in your nation and in the nations of the world. Consequently, the Gospel will spread unhindered and the Word of the Lord will have free course and be glorified ([2 Thessalonians 3:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Thessalonians%203:1&version=kjv)). Hallelujah!

## PROJECT YOURSELF TO YOUR NEXT LEVEL July 18th, 2024
![July 18th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-18-project-yourself-to-your-next-levell-july-2024.jpg)

 >***Eat thou not the bread of him that hath  an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty  meats: For as he thinketh in his heart, so  is he... (Proverbs 23:6-7).***

***Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats: For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he... (***[***Proverbs 23:6\-7***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2023:6-7&version=kjv)***).***

Did you know that with your mind, you can project yourself to your next and higher level in life? Your mind is an instrument given to you by God to improve your life from glory to glory. You have to see first in your mind the things you desire for your life, and create them.

God had to teach this to Abraham when He brought him out at night and instructed him to look at the stars and number them ([Genesis 15:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2015:5&version=kjv)). He was getting Abraham acquainted with the power of vision; how to use mind\-power to create realities.

Recall what we read in our theme scripture: as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. The quickest way to affect your thoughts is through mental pictures. You can project yourself out of poverty into abundance through your thoughts. Every man is the character of his thoughts. Your mind can put you in a place of glory or of limitation.

It’s about your mindset; each one of us has a destiny of greatness because we’re the seed of Abraham. God told Abraham that He would make him great, and in his seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ([Genesis 22:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2022:18&version=kjv)). This is our heritage; we’ve been set apart to be a blessing to this world. But do you see yourself as such?

Think about the man Lazarus for example; the Bible tells us that he was a righteous man, but he died a beggar ([Luke 16:20\-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016:20-22&version=kjv)). He didn’t die a beggar because that was his destiny, but because that was his mind\-set. If he had projected himself in faith, envisioning his rich heritage as the seed of Abraham, his story would have been different.

How do you think? [Romans 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:2&version=kjv) says, *“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind….”* Use your mind correctly, to picture your glorious and victorious life in Christ. Hallelujah!
