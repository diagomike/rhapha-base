## HIS WORD IS ALL THE  PROOF YOU NEED March 1st, 2024
![March 1st, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-1-his-word-is-all-the-proof-you-need-march-2024.jpg)

 >***According as his divine power hath  given unto us all things that pertain  unto life and godliness, through the  knowledge of him that hath called us to  glory and virtue (2 Peter 1:3).***

***According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (***[***2 Peter 1:3***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&version=kjv)***).***

In [1 Corinthians 3:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:21&version=kjv), the Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, corroborates what Peter pens for us in the verse above. He says, *“…all things are yours.”* You have all things in Christ, and Christ is in you.

God’s divine power, not your own ability or human wisdom, has given unto you ALL things that pertain to life and godliness. This means you’re not supposed to ever be in lack or want. You’ve got to believe this because it’s God’s Word about you.

When God says He’s done something, you don’t have to try to claim it; you simply endorse it and act accordingly. His Word is all the proof you need. The Lord Jesus said, *“Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away”* ([Matthew 24:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:35&version=kjv)).

Then in [Isaiah 55:10\-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2055:10-11&version=kjv), He says, *“For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”*

God’s Word is dependable. It never fails and will always produce what it talks about if you’d act on it. Don’t place a limit on your life. You’re a child of God, and He’s brought you a life of endless resources: limitless blessings and opportunities. Consciously and consistently walk in the light of His Word.

There’s nothing you could ever need or desire for a godly life that’s not already yours in Christ. Recall what we read in our opening verse; it’s also in line with what the Bible says in [Ephesians 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&version=kjv): *“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.”* Hallelujah!

God’s Word is all the proof you need that you’re one with the Lord, you’re the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus, you have divine health, you’re a success, you’re superior to Satan and can do all things through Christ. The Word says whatsoever you do shall prosper ([Psalm 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%201:3&version=kjv)); live on the basis of the Word.

## HE GAVE US EVERYTHING March 2nd, 2024
![March 2nd, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-2-he-gave-us-everything-march-2024.jpg)

 >***When Christ, who is our life, shall  appear, then shall ye also appear with  him in glory (Colossians 3:4).***

***When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory (***[***Colossians 3:4\)***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:4&version=kjv)***.***

In [John 5:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:26&version=kjv), Jesus said, *“For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself,”* meaning that Jesus had the inherent life: the very divine nature. He said, “I want you to know and believe that the Father is in me and I in Him” ([John 10:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:38&version=kjv)). This is simply extraordinary. 

This is the very thing that God wants for us; this was His purpose for creating man, so that He’d be in man and man would be in Him, so you’d become a super being—the facsimile or reflection of God. Hallelujah!

When you receive Christ and are joined to Him, you become one with Him. The Bible says, *“But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit”* ([1 Corinthians 6:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:17&version=kjv)). This oneness with Christ makes you supernatural because His divine life supplanted the human life with which you were born of your biological parents.

Now that you’re born again, what you have is the Christ\-life. Hence our theme verse says Christ is your life. Then 1 John 5:11\-12 (NIV) says, *“And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life”* Blessed be God!

What the Apostle John is referring to in the verses above is eternal life. Anyone who has Jesus, the Son of God, has eternal life. But then, in giving you eternal life, He actually gave you Himself because He is Himself eternal life: *“And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life”* ([1 John 5:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:20&version=kjv)). Hallelujah!

This is the Gospel! Jesus gave us EVERYTHING that He is! He gave us His Name, He gave us His righteousness, and He gave us His life. The Bible says we’re joint\-heirs with Him ([Romans 8:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:17&version=kjv)); as He is so are we in this world ([1 John 4:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&version=kjv)).

## BORN INTO THE KINGDOM OF HIS LOVE-SON March 3rd, 2024
![March 3rd, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-3-born-into-the-kingdom-of-his-love-son-march-2024.jpg)

 >***Giving thanks unto the Father…Who  hath delivered us from the power of  darkness, and hath translated us into  the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12-13).***

***Giving thanks unto the Father…Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (***[***Colossians 1:12\-13\)***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:12-13&version=kjv)***.***

Did you know that you have power over the forces of darkness and can rule over them? That’s because you’re a new creation, and the new creation should never be in bondage or servitude to Satan and the powers of darkness. You were born into the Kingdom of God’s Love\-Son.

The new creation is one with the Lord; you’re seated together with Christ, *“Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come”* ([Ephesians 1:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:21&version=kjv)). Christians who find themselves at the mercy of demons and demonic activities aren’t exercising their authority and dominion in Christ.

When you were born again, you were given the authority in the Name of Jesus to cast out devils and Satan knows it. It’s the first sign Jesus said would follow those who believe in Him: *“And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils...”* ([Mark 16:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17&version=kjv)).

Then in [Luke 10:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:19&version=kjv), He said, *“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”* You’ve got to put the Word of God to work.

If you ever notice or perceive that Satan is stirring up things around you—maybe in your health, your job, family or in the lives of your loved ones—cast him out. Maybe it’s in your city or nation, cast him out in the Name of Jesus and subdue the situation.

Learn to walk in the light of God’s Word and insist that what God has said is truth. Being born again, you’re superior to Satan; you’re not under the authority or jurisdiction of demons. You don’t belong in their domain because you were born into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son. That’s where you are now. Hallelujah!

## THE SUPREMACY OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS March 4th, 2024
![March 4th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-4-the-supremacy-of-his-righteousness-march-2024.jpg)

 >***For if by one man's offence death  reigned by one; much more they which  receive abundance of grace and of the  gift of righteousness shall reign in life by  one, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17).***

***For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (***[***Romans 5:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:17&version=kjv)***).***

I love what Paul said in [Philippians 3:8\-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%203:8-9&version=kjv), referring to the supremacy of the righteousness which is by faith in Jesus Christ. He said, *“…that I may win Christ, And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.”*

When you confessed the Lordship of Jesus over your life, instantly, His righteousness was imparted to you. The righteousness of Christ is flawless; that’s the righteousness you have. It’s perfect and therefore can’t be improved upon. Nothing you do today will make you more righteous or less righteous before God.

When God looks at you, He sees the righteousness of Christ. That’s why Paul said in [Galatians 2:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:20&version=kjv), *“I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”* Just as you’re now living by the faith of the Son of God, you’re no longer living by your own righteousness; you're living by the righteousness of Jesus Christ.

The Lord Jesus was righteous before God, and He was the only one who qualified to be our substitute, being the only one who was born sinless, because He was born of a virgin.

[Romans 4:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:25&version=kjv) tells us that He *“…was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.”* This is followed by [Romans 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1&version=kjv) which says, *“Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.”* To be “justified” means to be declared righteous as though you never sinned, because no charges were found against you. Hallelujah!

Today, if you’ve been struggling to be righteous, you’re on a journey to nowhere. We couldn’t attain righteousness by ourselves; that’s why God gave us His own righteousness. You’re as righteous as Jesus is righteous because He substituted His righteousness for your sin\-nature and gave you eternal life in the new birth. Hallelujah!

## HE BECAME US ON THE CROSS March 5th, 2024
![March 5th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-5-he-became-us-on-the-cross-march-2024.jpg)

 >***For Christ also hath once suffered for  sins, the just for the unjust, that he might  bring us to God, being put to death in the  flesh, but quickened by the Spirit (1 Peter 3:18).***

***For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit (***[***1 Peter 3:18***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:18&version=kjv)***).***

Has it really dawned on you that Jesus Christ was crucified for us? He actually became us on the Cross. Not only did He bear our sins, He also bore our very nature of sin. That’s why the Bible says, *“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him”* ([2 Corinthians 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21&version=kjv)).

Jesus was our sin\-bearer and thus was made sin, meaning that we were literally on that Cross when Jesus was crucified. He wasn’t only our representative, He was our substitute; our sins were laid on His spirit. He took our nature and took our place.

There’s the legal aspect and there’s the vital aspect. He was legally your representative and vitally you on the Cross. What’s the implication of all these? If He took your place and nature, it means you now have His place and nature as well. He took your place so that you might take His place.

Therefore, since He was sinless, that means you have His sinless nature now that you’re born again. Now you can understand why the Bible says in [1 Peter 2:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&version=kjv), *“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation….”* Did you notice that it says you’re holy?

It’s the result of the sacrifice and substitutionary work of Jesus Christ in your behalf. He took your sin\-nature and made you holy. Now you can live a holy life. Hallelujah!

The most beautiful part isn’t that He took our place and our nature but His purpose for doing it. It was to give us His place and His nature. [Ephesians 2:4\-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:4-6&version=kjv) is so beautiful; it says, *“But God, who is rich in mercy…hath quickened us together with Christ…And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.”*

He gave us His place of glory, dominion, power, honour and majesty, and made us partakers of His divine nature. Today, you’re as righteous as Jesus is righteous. You have the same life with Him: *“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life”* ([1 John 5:11\-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:11-12&version=kjv)). Blessed be God!

## SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU March 6th, 2024

 >***But ye are a chosen generation, a royal  priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar  people; that ye should shew forth the  praises of him who hath called you out  of darkness into his marvellous light (1 Peter 2:9).***

***But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light (***[***1 Peter 2:9***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&version=kjv)***).***

Did you notice the phrase “a peculiar people” in our opening verse? That's you; you’re a peculiar being. There’s something different about you; you’re unique; you’re not like everybody else. Never talk down on yourself or allow anyone talk you down.

You’re a partaker of the divine nature, a God\-carrying vessel. You represent divinity. You’re a heavenly being. You’re the extension and expression of Christ in your world. It brings to mind a lovely testimony by one of our pastors of a certain family that came to see him in his office.

The family had a three\-year\-old girl with them. After they had exchanged pleasantries with the pastor and shared nice thoughts from God’s Word, they turned to leave. As they walked away, the little girl noticed a picture on the wall, stopped, turned to her parents and the pastor and said, “This is Jesus Christ on TV,” pointing to my picture that the pastor had on the wall in his office.

But that’s exactly what Jesus said about us; we’re bearers of His divine presence. Jesus minced no words in [John 14:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:9&version=kjv) when He said, “If you’ve seen me, you’ve seen the Father.” Jesus is the image or icon of the invisible God ([2 Corinthians 4:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:4&version=kjv), [Colossians 1:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:15&version=kjv)).

That means He’s the visual representation of God, the profile of God. [Hebrews 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201:3&version=kjv) says He’s the brightness of God’s glory and the “express image” of His person. The Greek term for the expression “express image” is “charakter” and it means facsimile or print copy. Jesus is the facsimile or print copy of God. Then, the Bible says, “As He is, so are we in this world!”

Can you see why you must never see yourself as an ordinary person? Christ in you makes you different. You’re the effulgence of His glory, the express image of His person. Hallelujah!

## WE’RE IN HIS MARVELLOUS LIGHT March 7th, 2024

 >***But ye are a chosen generation, a royal  priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar  people; that ye should shew forth the  praises of him who hath called you out  of darkness into his marvellous light (1 Peter 2:9).***

***But ye are a chosen generation, a royal  priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar  people; that ye should shew forth the  praises of him who hath called you out  of darkness into his marvellous light (***[***1 Peter 2:9***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&version=kjv)***).***

Everything God does has an end—an excellent end. He never leaves us hanging or in limbo. Think about what we just read in our theme verse: the latter part says He called us out of darkness into His marvellous light. 

It reminds of the scripture in [Deuteronomy 6:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206:23&version=kjv), *“And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.”* He brought us out of darkness, to bring us into His marvellous light. We’re now in His marvellous light; we’re not journeying into His marvellous light.

In [Colossians 1:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:13&version=kjv), we read something similar; it says, *“Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.”* He lets us know that we’re not in the arena, the realm or the jurisdiction of darkness; we’ve been transferred into the Kingdom of God’s Love\-Son. That’s your place of domicile. Hallelujah!

In [Deuteronomy 6:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206:23&version=kjv) where it says, *“...he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in….”* By “thence” He was referring to Egypt. Egypt was symbolic of the world; it symbolized darkness. His purpose for bringing us out of darkness (the world) was to bring us into His Kingdom. His focus wasn’t our coming out of darkness, so the celebration isn’t that we’re out of darkness but that we’re in His marvellous light.

Another thought along the same line is in what the Lord said to Paul in [Acts 26:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:18&version=kjv), *“To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God….”* Again, we see God’s purpose: it’s to turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God and He’s fulfilled it! You’re in His marvellous light now and that light dispels darkness.

## NEVER OUT OF SOURCE March 8th, 2024
![March 8th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-8-never-out-of-source-march-2024.jpg)

 >***We are troubled on every side, yet  not distressed; we are perplexed, but  not in despair; Persecuted, but not  forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed  (2 Corinthians 4:8-9).***
---
***We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed (***[***2 Corinthians 4:8\-9***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:8-9&version=kjv)***).***

What the Apostle Paul tells us in our theme scripture above is truly remarkable. He says no matter what situation we find ourselves, we’re never down and out. We’re never out of source. That’s because our sufficiency, our strength or divine energy is of God ([2 Corinthians 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:5&version=kjv)).

Think about that second line: We’re perplexed, but not in despair. That means we may be in a “strait betwixt two”; we may be in a situation of embarrassment, where we don’t know exactly where to turn at that moment; he says in spite of that seeming predicament, we’re never in despair. In other words, we’re not out of supply; we’re not in a hopeless situation.

There’s no disadvantage for the child of God. We’re never short of answers. We may be persecuted but not cast down; we’re indestructible. We’re always in victory regardless of the situation because we live in the Name of Jesus! That Name is the key to every door, the answer to every question, and the solution to every problem. Hallelujah!

In His Name, we always win. So it makes no difference the situation in which you may have found yourself today; count it all joy! Greater is He that is in you than all the adversaries and adversities you could ever face. The Bible says in [1 John 4:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&version=kjv), *“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”*

The greater One lives in you; that’s your confidence and assurance of victory in every situation. [2 Corinthians 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%202:14&version=kjv) says, *“Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.”* Hallelujah! Have this consciousness. Never think defeat, failure or weakness.

It doesn’t matter what experiences you’ve been through; one thing is certain: all will turn out for your good! Trust the Lord and hold on to His Word. He knew there’d be challenges. Nevertheless, He gave us the assurance that in the midst of the challenges, we’d always be triumphant: *“Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us”* ([Romans 8:37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:37&version=kjv)). Hallelujah!

## BUILDING HIS CHARACTER INTO YOUR SPIRIT March 9th, 2024
![March 9th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-9-building-his-character-into-your-spirit-march-2024.jpg)

 >***For verily I say unto you, That whosoever  shall say unto this mountain, Be thou  removed, and be thou cast into the sea;  and shall not doubt in his heart, but  shall believe that those things which he  saith shall come to pass; he shall have  whatsoever he saith (Mark 11:23).***

***For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith (***[***Mark 11:23***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:23&version=kjv)***).***

Some people misunderstand our purpose for affirming God’s Word. When you tell them, for example, to say, “I’m the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus”; they think we’re trying to make sinners talk as though they are saints. No! We’re not making such declarations because we’re “trying” to be what we’re saying; rather, we’re stating spiritual truth.

Our confessions are based on what God already said about us in His Word. He said whatever He said so that we may boldly say the same thing in agreement with Him. It’s a spiritual law: [Hebrews 13:5\-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:5-6&version=kjv), *“… for he hath said… So that we may boldly say….”*

Understand how this works: The Word of God is God’s material for building Himself and His character into your spirit. First, we receive His nature at the New Birth, but you still have your character, and because of that some people are at a loss as to how to reconcile the realities of the new creation life with their own character. 

But that’s why the Bible tells us to renew our minds with the Word of God; you meditate on the Word. But first, you have to hear the Word, accept and endorse it, and then confess it. When you confess the Word of God, you create the character of God in your spirit so that you think like Him.

God gave us the written Word for us to think upon. He knows that if you think the Word, you’ll talk the Word, and if you talk the Word, you’ll walk the Word! That’s the principle of the Kingdom. You’re what you say. Therefore, keep confessing the Word of God and thus build His character into your spirit.

## IT’S ALL IN YOUR SPIRIT March 10th, 2024

 >***A good man out of the good treasure  of his heart bringeth forth that which  is good; and an evil man out of the evil  treasure of his heart bringeth forth that  which is evil: for of the abundance of the  heart his mouth speaketh (Luke 6:45).***

***A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh (***[***Luke 6:45***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:45&version=kjv)***).***

Your heart, which is the recreated human spirit is God's temple: His dwelling place. That’s where the Kingdom of God is ([Luke 17:20\-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017:20-21&version=kjv)). And it’s through your spirit that you make contact with God, for God is a Spirit. It’s the reason you must educate your spirit and guard it with all diligence: *“Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life”* ([Proverbs 4:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:23&version=kjv)). 

Everything you require for your life is in your heart; therefore, learn to live from your heart. When you live from your heart, you won't be bothered about the happenings outside; your experiences won't determine your response to situations. You’ll live above inflation and economic crisis because you’ve learnt how to enjoy your prosperity and turn it on from within you.

[Ecclesiastes 3:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%203:11&version=kjv) says, *“He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart….”* God has set everything, including the world in your heart. This shouldn’t be difficult for you to relate with because God is bigger than the world, and yet, He lives in your heart. Glory to God!

Therefore, as a child of God, see and live from your heart. What you see with your heart is more real than what you see with your physical eyes. [2 Corinthians 4:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:18&version=KJV) says, *"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."*

Seeing with your heart means envisioning and apprehending the realities of the Gospel and of the Kingdom with your spirit. Hallelujah! It reminds of what Isaiah prophesied in [Isaiah 12:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2012:3&version=kjv), *“Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.”* Where are these wells? They’re in the deep recesses of your heart! The finest and most important things of life—the eternal things—are all in your heart; therefore, live from within.

## YOUR DIVINE ASSIGNMENT March 11th, 2024
![March 11th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-11-your-divine-assignment-march-2024.jpg)

 >***But ye are a chosen generation, a royal  priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar  people; that ye should shew forth the  praises of him who hath called you out  of darkness into his marvellous light  (1 Peter 2:9).***
---
***But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light (***[***1 Peter 2:9***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&version=kjv)***).***

What we just read is one of those verses of Scripture that emphasizes the purpose of Christ in you. It’s to make you a partaker of the divine nature, to make you what you just read: “...a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.”

It’s your responsibility to set forth—make His wonderful deeds known—by displaying the virtues and perfections of divinity. It’s your calling. It’s your divine assignment.

Being born again, you’ve received the Spirit of excellence; now He’s sent you to manifest excellence. What God expects is that you say, “Yes” to your calling, to who you are, and to what He’s made you. You say, “Yes, that’s me; I’m called to set forth God’s wonderful deeds. When I show up, God shows up.”

You’re the full expression and manifestation of His love; you fully represent Him. Also, think about the fact that the Bible says you’re the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus ([2 Corinthians 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21&version=kjv)). This means you’ve become the very expression of His righteousness. You’re the expression of His goodness, the expression of His kindness, and the expression of His grace. You’re the expression of His personality; everything the Father is and represents is expressed in and through you.

Therefore, part of your divine assignment is to express the will, character and nature of God. That’s righteousness. You’ve been endowed with the ability and charged with the responsibility to manifest and express the will and nature of the Father in every situation, in every event, and in every matter. Blessed be God!

## JUST SAY “YES” March 12th, 2024

>***And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men (***[***Matthew 4:19***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:19&version=kjv)***).***

Oftentimes, many are plagued with the question of how to make the wonderful blessings of the Gospel they’ve read about in the Scriptures a reality in their lives. There seems to be a gulf between all that the Bible says is theirs in Christ and their experience of Him.

But the words of Jesus in our opening verse unveil a simple principle that can help us understand how to bring these blessings to light, and how to have them manifested in your life. He said, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” He didn’t say, “Follow me and try to become fishers of men.”

Don’t try to be who you already are; don’t struggle to get what you already have; just say, “Yes” to Him. Say yes to His Word. Every so often you declare, “I’m what God says I am; I have what He says I have, and I can do what He says I can do.” So, if you were a cell leader, for example, don’t say, “I’ve been pursuing my members; I can’t understand why only 4 out of my 20 members come for meetings. I just keep trying and I have done everything.”

Jesus said, “Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.” But, here you are, “trying” to be a fisher of men and it’s not working. Stop struggling. Stop trying to convert souls; become what you really are by saying, “Yes!” It sounds too simple, but that’s how it works.

What could be harder than the salvation of the human spirit? Even so, we received salvation by simply saying “Yes” to God! All the blessings we now enjoy came because of the salvation we received by saying, “Yes, I believe in Jesus Christ that He died for me and that God raised Him from the dead; and I declare that He is Lord of my life.” And that was it.

You believed and said, “Yes!” You talked "your believing" and it was settled; it worked. If it worked for salvation (and salvation includes everything that the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ consummated for us), then the same principle will work for your ministry, your family life, your finances, your job and everything in this world! Just say, “Yes!” Believe and talk your believing.

## KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE INSIDE YOU March 13th, 2024

 >***But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,  longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,  faith, Meekness, temperance: against  such there is no law (Galatians 5:22-23).***
---
***But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law (***[***Galatians 5:22\-23***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:22-23&version=kjv)***).***

Somebody said, “I don’t know why I’m always getting angry every day, shouting at people. I detest it but I don’t know what to do.” If that has been your experience, say to yourself, “From today, I’m a different person because I have the nature and character of my heavenly Father. I’m patient, I’m temperate, I’m meek, and I’m gracious and kind."

Grow the character of God that is in your spirit through your recognition of His divine attributes and nature in your spirit. [Philemon 1:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philemon%201:6&version=kjv) says, *“That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.”*

Acknowledge and declare that you have all the fruits of the spirit in you: love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. The Word of God says they’re in your spirit. Therefore, don’t say, “I have a problem with love; I don’t know how to love people.” Rather, declare, “I’m full of love; the love of God is shed abroad in my heart by the Holy Spirit. I am a manifestation of the love of God; love radiates through me.”

You must know what you have inside. How do you know? It’s from the Word of God. For example, the Word says, “You’re the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus”; therefore, don’t say you’re trying to be righteous. Say that you’re righteous because the Word says so.

Also, declare that your faith is growing and effective, because faith is one of the attributes of your recreated human spirit. You already have faith according to the Scriptures ([Romans 12:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:3&version=kjv)), and with your faith, you can do anything, have anything, go anywhere and be all that God has destined you to be. The Lord Jesus said in [Matthew 17:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2017:20&version=kjv), *“…If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.”*

## JOYFUL EVERY DAY March 14th, 2024

***Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full (***[***John 16:24***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:24&version=kjv)***).***

Our opening scripture reveals the heart of the Father and His desire for us: He wants your joy to be full always. That’s because being joyful is very important in the Kingdom of God. The Bible says *“A joyful, cheerful heart brings healing to both body and soul…”* ([Proverbs 17:22 TPT)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2017:22&version=TPT).

It makes no difference what situations you face; exude joy; rejoice evermore. The beautiful part is that our joy is of the Holy Ghost, and therefore, it’s independent of circumstances: *“For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost”* ([Romans 14:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:17&version=kjv)).

We’re full of joy even in the face of adversities and persecution: *“My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations”* ([James 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:2&version=kjv)). That means no room for frustration in your life. When others come in contact with you, they experience joy unspeakable and full of glory.

The Bible tells us about the children of Israel; how their joy was heard afar off as they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced after rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem: *“Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off”* ([Nehemiah 12:43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah%2012:43&version=kjv)). That lets you know that joy has expressions. Laughter and singing songs of praise in thanksgiving are expressions of joy.

So, despite the terrible things happening in the world today, be full of joy every day. Give no place to gloom in your life. Generate and release joy and excitement from inside you today.

## RIGHTEOUSNESS: A GIFT TO THE UNGODLY March 15th, 2024
![March 15th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-15-righteousness-a-gift-to-the-ungodly-march-2024.jpg)

 >***For if by one man's offence death reigned  by one; much more they which receive  abundance of grace and of the gift of  righteousness shall reign in life by one,  Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17).***

***For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (***[***Romans 5:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:17&version=kjv)***).***

Righteousness is one of the cardinal gifts of God; but did you know that it was a gift to the world and not to Christians? It’s a gift to the ungodly. The Bible refers to God in [Romans 4:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:5&version=kjv) as One who justifies the ungodly: *“But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.”*

Notice it didn’t say He justifies the Christians. The Christian didn’t “receive” the gift of righteousness; the Christian was born righteous. You were born as the righteousness of God when you were born again.

Paul’s submission about righteousness in the Book of Romans, particularly as you’d find in chapter 5 verse 17, is a generic argument on the legality of righteousness as it was accounted to Abraham and therefore to all who believe in Jesus Christ. We may believe it’s given to “us” as a gift, but that’s not all that God gave us as a gift.

For instance, [Romans 6:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:23&version=kjv) says, *“For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”* Eternal life is given to sinners, not Christians; that’s what a sinner receives to become a Christian. A Christian is one who has eternal life, not one who’s “receiving” the gift of eternal life.

The Bible says anyone who believes has eternal life. Once a man believes, right away, eternal life starts up in his spirit. So, eternal life is no longer being “gifted” to him; he was born with it and into it. He came alive with it when he received Christ. It’s the same with righteousness.

It’s like when you were born of your mother; you didn’t have to first receive the gift of life to become human; you came into existence with life—the human life! Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been said to be alive.

So, in essence, legally, the whole world has been given the gift of righteousness; it’s this gift that, when received, enables one to stand in the presence of God without guilt, fear, inferiority, or condemnation. Anyone who receives this gift is saved. Hallelujah!

Righteousness is one of the cardinal gifts of God; but did you know that it was a gift to the world and not to Christians? It’s a gift to the ungodly. The Christian didn’t “receive” the gift of righteousness; the Christian was born righteous. You were born as the righteousness of God when you were born again.

## WALKING IN HIM March 16th, 2024
![March 16th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-16-walking-in-him-march-2024.jpg)

>***As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him (***[***Colossians 2:6***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:6&version=kjv)***).***

Our theme verse admonishes us to walk in Christ Jesus. How do you walk in Him? Who is He? The Bible says He’s the Word—the living or incarnate Word. And the Word of God is light ([Psalm 119:105](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119:105&version=kjv)). Therefore, walking in Him is walking in the Word, walking in the light of God’s Word.

Think about it; how did you receive Christ Jesus? It was by faith, and faith is walking in the Word. Remember, the Word of God is your life; you were born of the Word: *“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”* ([1 Peter 1:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:23&version=kjv)). So it’s natural for you to live in the Word, by the Word, and through the Word.

[Isaiah 2:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%202:5&version=kjv) says, *“O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.”* Walking in the light of the Lord is walking in His Word. The Word of God is God and the Bible says in [1 John 1:5\-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:5-6&version=kjv) that God is light: *“This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth.”*

You can’t walk in Christ and walk in darkness at the same time. Darkness represents all that limits and hinders; all that’s evil. But what did Jesus say? *“…I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life”* ([John 8:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:12&version=kjv)). Hallelujah!

When you walk in Him, you experience His life, His glory everyday; you’re forever victorious, prosperous, and in health! The Bible says we should walk in the light as He is in the light ([1 John 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:7&version=kjv)); walk in the light of who you are in Him. Glory to God!

## HIS SANCTIFIED TABERNACLE March 17th, 2024

 >***Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world  cannot receive, because it seeth him not,  neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in  you (John 14:17).***

***Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you (***[***John 14:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:17&version=kjv)***).***

Just before His glorious levitation into heaven, the Lord Jesus talked extensively to His disciples about the person of the Holy Spirit. He told them the Holy Spirit would be in them ([John 14:16\-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:16-17&version=kjv)). [Acts 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:8&version=kjv) says, *“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you….”* On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit came upon them, to live in them. In the Old Testament, Solomon built God a temple and at the dedication of the temple, the presence of God came upon it and into it ([2 Chronicles 5:13\-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%205:13-14&version=kjv)).

But He wasn’t satisfied. [Acts 7:48](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207:48&version=kjv) says, *“Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands….”* When you were born again, God made you His own; you became His offspring and His living temple. From that moment, you were sanctified unto Him and became one with Him.

You’re His sanctified tabernacle today. He sanctified your vessel, your body to become His house. You’re God’s dwelling place; He literally lives inside you. And because He lives in you, He speaks through you and walks in you ([2 Corinthians 6:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%206:16&version=kjv)). He manifests Himself in and through you. 

When Jesus walked the earth, He said, *“…the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works”* ([John 14:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:10&version=kjv)); He was referring to the Holy Spirit. The same Holy Spirit dwells in you today. His power is at work in you just as it was at work in Jesus.

This is the essence of Christianity; it’s what Jesus brought and made possible: you becoming God’s sanctified and living tabernacle. The great God of glory lives in you today through the Holy Spirit. What a blessing! Always honour the Spirit; fellowship with Him often. He’s all you need for a life of the miraculous and the supernatural every day.

## WE LIVE ABOVE THE RUDIMENTS OF THIS WORLD March 18th, 2024

 >***Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ  from the rudiments of the world, why, as  though living in the world, are ye subject  to ordinances (Colossians 2:20).***
---
***Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances (***[***Colossians 2:20***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:20&version=kjv)***).***

Being born again, you’re not of this world; you’re from above. [Colossians 3:1\-2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:1-2&version=kjv) puts it very clearly; it says, *“If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.”*

Why does God want you to set your affection on things above and not things in the earth? It’s because your life is from above and therefore the things of the earth shouldn’t affect you. Notice again what the theme scripture says: *“…if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances.”*

You live in and from heaven. Therefore, set your focus on things that are pertinent to the heavenly realm to which you belong. Exercise dominion over the rudiments of this world. The Bible says you’ve been made alive together with Christ, raised together, and made to sit together with Him in heavenly places ([Ephesians 2:5\-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:5-6&version=kjv)). That’s your place, your realm of life and from where you operate.

You live in the Christ\-environment where life is totally different; everything is glorious. You have absolute mastery over circumstances, over the elements of this world. There’s no failure, weakness, defeat, sickness, disease, poverty or any of the negativities of life! This is the understanding that the Spirit wants you to have as communicated in our opening verse. Hallelujah!

## TREASURES OF INESTIMABLE VALUE March 19th, 2024

 >***Who gave himself for us, that he might  redeem us from all iniquity, and purify  unto himself a peculiar people, zealous  of good works (Titus 2:14).***

***Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works (***[***Titus 2:14***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%202:14&version=kjv)***).***

Every human person is important to God; every man, woman, boy and girl! He uniquely cares for each and every one of us. That’s why numbers bear significance to God.

While God desires the salvation of a multitude, His love for each individual is deep and personal. Your value to Him is beyond what you could ever imagine. If you study the Bible, you'll realize that even if you were the sole inhabitant of planet earth, Jesus would still have come to save you.

Christ’s purpose wasn't dictated by our numbers but by our worth to God. It was our importance and value to Him that compelled Him to pay the ultimate price for our salvation. No wonder the Bible says in [Luke 15:7 (NKJV)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2015:7&version=NKJV), *“I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety\-nine just persons who need no repentance.”*

[Jeremiah 31:3 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2031:3&version=NIV) is also very beautiful; it says, *"…I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with unfailing kindness."* [Psalm 139:13\-14 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20139:13-14&version=NIV) says, *"For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well."*

In both scriptures, the reference is quite direct and personal. God loves you. You’re His treasure of inestimable value. He calls us a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, called to display the virtues, perfections, graces and excellence of divinity ([1 Peter 2:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&version=kjv)).

[Ephesians 2:10 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&version=AMPC), brings it to a climax. It says, *"For we are God’s \[own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, \[born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us \[taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them \[living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live]."*

## HE REACHES THE WORLD OF MEN THROUGH MEN March 20th, 2024

>***So he, trembling and astonished, said,  ''Lord, what do You want me to do?"  Then the Lord said to him, "Arise and go  into the city, and you will be told what  you must do" (***[***Acts 9:6 NKJV***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:6&version=NKJV)***).***

The Bible tells us the story of Peter and Cornelius in [Acts 10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010&version=kjv). Cornelius, a Roman centurion, was a devout and God\-fearing man who regularly gave alms to the poor, yet he wasn’t saved. In a vision, an angel appeared to him, instructing him to send for Peter who shall tell him words, whereby he and all his household shall be saved.

Someone might ask, “Why didn't the angel directly instruct Cornelius on what he needed to do for salvation? Why the elaborate process of summoning and persuading Peter?” It’s because God sent men to bear His message of salvation, not angels. His policy is to use men to save men.

This principle is exemplified in the fact that God Himself became a man to bring salvation to us. That’s why He still needed to use the Apostle Peter to lead Cornelius and his household to salvation. His Gospel is committed to men and to be preached by men. And by men, we mean men and women alike.

In [1 Timothy 1:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%201:11&version=kjv), Paul said, *“According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.”* The Gospel has been committed to your trust, not to the trust of angels. So, take advantage of His mandate and be the light in your world and to the nations. Enlighten and illuminate the hearts of men and women with the saving truth and transforming realities of the Gospel.

It’s a noble responsibility for us to carry the message of salvation to the farthest corners of the earth. So rejoice in this privilege and let it become the focal point of your life's purpose. You’ve been granted the opportunity to serve in the Gospel, to proclaim His righteousness and to establish His Kingdom on earth and in the hearts of people. Nothing could be more gratifying!

## JESUS IS THE CHRIST March 21st, 2024

***But what about you? he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ" (***[***Mark 8:29 NIV***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208:29&version=NIV)***).***

In [Acts 17:1\-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:1-3&version=kjv), Luke explained how Paul and his companions journeyed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, eventually reaching Thessalonica. There, they entered a synagogue, and for three consecutive Sabbaths, Paul engaged in discussions with the Jews.

With copious scriptural inferences, he presented a compelling case, setting forth and proving that it was necessary for Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead. But here’s the most beautiful assertion Paul made. He told them that Jesus, whom he proclaimed and preached unto them, was indeed the Christ.

That was His message—that Jesus is the Christ! This is too important; never underestimate the power of this truth. Jesus is Christ, the Son of God. If you would believe that, all the blessings in Christ will be yours because that is what He said.

However, to believe that Jesus is the Christ, you must first believe that Jesus came in a physical body. In [1 John 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204&version=kjv), the Apostle John in his writings warned against false teachers, having encountered some who came up with a strange doctrine, denying the reality that Jesus came in the flesh.

Therefore, He emphasized that Christians should test the spirits to determine whether they are from God. But here’s a key criterion: *"Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God"* ([1 John 4:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:2&version=kjv)).

In the verses above, the translators erroneously assumed “Jesus Christ” should be used instead of the actual original rendering, which is “Jesus as the Christ.” The New English Translation got it right; it says, *"By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses **Jesus as the Christ** who has come in the flesh is from God."*

Every spirit that confesses Jesus as the Christ who has come in flesh is from God. So, Jesus as the Christ came in the flesh, in the physical body. And we know that His body died—He was crucified, buried but gloriously resurrected. This is important for salvation. Praise God.

## FROM JERUSALEM TO THE  ENDS OF THE EARTH March 22nd, 2024

 >***And said unto them, Thus it is written,  and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and  to rise from the dead the third day: And  that repentance and remission of sins  should be preached in his name among  all nations, beginning at Jerusalem  (Luke 24:46-47).***

***And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem (***[***Luke 24:46\-47***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024:46-47&version=kjv)***).***

There are proponents of a false teaching that Christianity is a Jewish religion, but the words of the Lord Jesus in the opening text dispel that notion. He said the Gospel *“…should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.”* The Gospel is for all. Christianity is for all; it only started in Jerusalem. So, don’t limit the Gospel; preach it to everyone, everywhere, and in all nations! The Bible says in [Mark 13:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2013:10&version=kjv), *"And the gospel must first be published among all nations."*

In [Matthew 24:14 NIV](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:14&version=NIV), Jesus said, *“...this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”* Then in [Matthew 28:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:19&version=kjv), He instructed, *"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."*

In fact, before His glorious ascension to heaven, He told His disciples, *“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth”* ([Acts 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:8&version=kjv)). So, the disciples began from Jerusalem, spread the Gospel to Judea and Samaria, and then moved to the ends of the earth.

Thus, it was from Jerusalem to the very bounds of the earth. This shows that the Gospel is for everybody; it’ll produce results in the life of anyone who hears and believes it everywhere and anywhere in this world. Don’t limit the Gospel to your locality; tell everyone about Jesus.

Yes, talk to your spouse, parents, teachers, students, neighbours, colleagues or co\-workers about Jesus. Preach the Gospel to them. For those in the hinterlands and seemingly forgotten places of the earth who may not even understand your language, send them Rhapsody of Realities.

Thanks be unto God; Rhapsody of Realities is available in every known language on earth. So, it’s a tool for global evangelization. It’s a love note from God with which you can preach the Gospel everywhere and to everyone. Hallelujah!

## REMISSION OF SINS March 23rd, 2024
![March 23rd, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-23-remission-of-sins-march-2024.jpg)

 >***And said unto them, Thus it is written,  and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and  to rise from the dead the third day: And  that repentance and remission of sins  should be preached in his name among  all nations, beginning at Jerusalem  (Luke 24:46-47).***

***And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem (***[***Luke 24:46\-47***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024:46-47&version=kjv)***).***

In Christ, we have remission of our sins. His substitutionary work in our behalf made us new creations. Our past and our sins were completely blotted out, entirely erased from God's memory, not just your own.

So literally, what Jesus did was to take away the power of sin to prevent its destructive consequences. For that reason the Bible says, *“For sin shall not have dominion over you...”* ([Romans 6:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:14&version=kjv)). Jesus accomplished this for us. 

[Acts 13:38\-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:38-39&version=kjv) says, *“Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses."* The term "forgiveness" is derived from the Greek word 'aphesis,' which specifically means remission of sins.

Furthermore, those who believe in Him are not only granted remission but are also justified from all things, a status unattainable through the Law of Moses. Justification implies being acquitted, to be declared not guilty.

Many Christians haven’t fully grasped the depth of this truth. While Jesus indeed paid for the sins of the whole world, when you believe in Him, you receive a new life, you become “a new creature” ([2 Corinthians 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&version=kjv)), a new person in the presence of God.

In God's presence, you’re brand new! This is what justification truly means; you stand acquitted, not merely paid for. Through your belief in the payment, He gave you eternal life, and you were born anew, with a new life without a past. You’re now a new creature; this serves as the basis for your acquittal.

The Bible says, *“Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ”* ([Romans 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1&version=kjv)). In the presence of God, He sees you in Jesus Christ. He doesn’t see the multitude of sins you’ve committed; instead, He sees you as pure as Jesus.

## THE UNVEILER OF DIVINE MYSTERIES March 24th, 2024
![March 24th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-24-the-unveiler-of-divine-mysteries-march-2024.jpg)

 >***That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,  the Father of glory, may give unto you  the spirit of wisdom and revelation in  the knowledge of him (Ephesians 1:17).***

***That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him (***[***Ephesians 1:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:17&version=kjv)***).***

Our theme verse is a profound prayer of the Spirit that highlights the indispensable role of the Holy Spirit in unveiling the mysteries of God to us. He’s the unveiler of divine mysteries and secrets. Only through Him can we truly know God and know things pertaining to the Kingdom.

[1 Corinthians 2:11\-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:11-12&version=kjv) provides some more clarity into this. There, the Bible says, *“…the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.”*

How does the Holy Spirit enable you to know the things of the Kingdom of God? It is by introducing them to your spirit. Your brain or mind can’t comprehend them. But the Holy Spirit, in fellowship and contact with your spirit, grants you wisdom for revelation to know God and the secrets of the Kingdom. 

Moreover, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth who guides you into all truth: *“Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come”* ([John 16:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13&version=kjv)).

Earlier in [John 14:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:26&version=kjv), the Lord Jesus, speaking of the same Holy Spirit said, *“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”*

The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of knowledge; He’s the embodiment of all wisdom and knowledge. With Him, you can never walk in darkness or be confused about anything in life. Remember, He made all things. If you’d recognise and take advantage of His ministry in your life, you’ll be an oasis of knowledge and a fountain of solutions in a dark, needy, and ignorant world.

## A DIVINE RELATIONSHIP March 25th, 2024
![March 25th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-25-a-divine-relationship-march-2024.jpg)

>***But he that is joined unto the Lord is one  spirit (***[***1 Corinthians 6:17***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:17&version=kjv)***).***

While there may be some religious activities or practices in Christianity, Christianity fundamentally distinguishes itself as a relationship rather than a religion. To grasp the distinction, consider the relationship between a child and his or her parents. This familial connection is not defined by religious adherence but is deeply rooted in a personal, intimate relationship.

In Christianity that is what Jesus came to do; He came to bring us into a relationship with God beyond religion. Before Jesus came, various religions existed but Jesus brought something different: a relationship with God!

No wonder when Jesus referred to God as "Father," it left the Jews astonished. They wondered, "How could anyone call God Father?" Well, Jesus called God His Father because He had a relationship with Him. It was a Father\-and\-Son relationship.

Addressing God as a Father was unfamiliar and perplexing to the Jews. In [John 10:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:30&version=kjv), Jesus said, *"I and my Father are one,"* stressing the essence of this divine relationship. He had the same life with God. [John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&version=kjv) tells us He was God in the flesh.

The Jews couldn’t take it. In fact, when He dared to go further and explain that relationship, they sought to kill Him. But thanks be unto God; through His death, burial and resurrection, we’ve been brought into the same oneness with God. We’ve been brought into a divine relationship with the Father!

Now we can call God our heavenly Father; you don’t find that in any religion. [1 John 3:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:1&version=kjv) says, *“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God….”* Then in [Galatians 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%204:6&version=kjv), the Bible says, *“…because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.”* Hallelujah!

## THE CORE OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH March 26th, 2024
![March 26th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-26-the-core-of-the-christian-faith-march-2024.jpg)

 >***Even the mystery which hath been hid  from ages and from generations, but now  is made manifest to his saints: To whom  God would make known what is the  riches of the glory of this mystery among  the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the  hope of glory (Colossians 1:26-27).***

***Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of glory (***[***Colossians 1:26\-27***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:26-27&version=kjv)***).***

Christianity, in its essence, can be encapsulated in our underlined words in the opening scripture: Christ in you. The revelation that Christ resides within you forms the core of the Christian Faith.

This divine union and interconnectedness between us and God is described by the Lord Jesus in His prayer to the Father in [John 17:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:23&version=KJV). He said, *"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me."*

It also brings to mind what Paul said in [2 Corinthians 5:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:19&version=kjv): *“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.”* Think about that; God was in Christ, and now Christ is in you; that means God is in you. This is amazing.

Furthermore, the Bible says, *“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God”* ([Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:23&version=kjv)). The glory of God being referred to here is the presence of God. Man lived in God, in His presence; God's presence was his light. That connection, that relationship was the glory. Then because of sin, man was cut off from that glory.

But today, in Christ Jesus, that glory that was lost in [Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:23&version=kjv) has been regained according to [Colossians 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv). The beautiful thing is, that presence is not just around you; it’s in you now. It's not just a voice walking in the Garden as in the Book of Genesis; that voice is now in you.

Now we can rejoice because it’s not Christ around you, amongst you, or with you, but Christ in you! When you received Christ, the glory came into your life. Your life is severed from shame, reproach, sickness, disease, failure and poverty because Christ is in you. Hallelujah!

## NO BLESSINGS LEFT TO ASK FOR March 27th, 2024
![March 27th, 2024](https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/day-27-no-blessings-left-to-ask-for-march-2024.jpg)

 >***Blessed be the God and Father of our  Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3).***
---
***Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (***[***Ephesians 1:3***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&version=kjv)***).***

Did you know that there’re no more blessings in heaven that aren’t already yours in Christ? Notice the past tense in what we just read; it says, "God has blessed us with ALL spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ." Also notice that it says He’s blessed you with spiritual blessings, which means you don't have to ask for more blessings, as He’s already blessed you with ALL the blessings that exist in Christ Jesus.

This is remarkable because it means He’s blessed you with untold prosperity, divine health, unending joy, victories, supernatural strength, success, and any other blessing you can imagine. You may say, “But He only mentioned spiritual blessings; how about the physical blessings?” 

The physical blessings are all included in the spiritual blessings. The lesser is included in the greater. Think about it like this: The Bible says God is a Spirit. Then in [Genesis 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:1&version=kjv), it says, *“In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.”*

Now, if God, who is a Spirit, created the heavens and the earth in the beginning, it means He pre\-existed the beginning and that He must dwell in the realms of the spirit. Therefore, all the blessings He has must be spiritual.

The realm of the spirit pre\-existed the heavens and the earth. So, the physical or the material world came out of that realm. All other blessings—material or physical—are inside spiritual blessings. Whatever you would have asked of God is included in what He's already blessed you with.

So, today, there’s no need to ask Him for more blessings. Now you can understand why He said in [1 Corinthians 3:21\-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:21-22&version=kjv), *“...For all things are yours; Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours.”* Peter echoes the same truth in [2 Peter 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&version=kjv), saying, *“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness….”*

## YOUR PERSONAL STUDY OF THE WORD March 28th, 2024

 >***This book of the law shall not depart out  of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate  therein day and night, that thou mayest  observe to do according to all that is  written therein: for then thou shalt make  thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt  have good success (Joshua 1:8).***

***This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success (***[***Joshua 1:8***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:8&version=kjv)***).***

The Word of God takes you from one level of glory to another as you open up to its divine revelations. It works in you when the truth therein dawns on your spirit—when you know it and agree with God about what He said. But how can you agree with Him if you don't know what He said?

That’s why you need to have a voracious appetite for study; get to know the Word, especially in this Year of Redemption, where you’re “cashing out your vouchers” for their actual value. Remember, those vouchers are God’s truths, His Word concerning you, which you have to proclaim by faith.

The Bible says, *“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby: If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious”* ([1 Peter 2:2\-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:2-3&version=kjv)). Read what the Lord Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in Him, *“…If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free”* ([John 8:31\-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:31-32&version=kjv)).

Notice that the Master’s admonition was for them to continue in His Word. That means having an insatiable appetite for the knowledge of God’s Word. Through the Word, we renew our minds and build faith and character.

The Apostle Paul said, *“Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analyzing and accurately dividing \[rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth”* ([2 Timothy 2:15 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:15&version=AMPC)). 

The Lord Jesus said in [John 5:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:39&version=kjv), *“Search the scriptures….”* The Word of God is the mind of God expressed—His will written and expressed for us. Study the Word of God for yourself; understand it, speak it, and live accordingly.

## PREACH THE TRIUMPHANT LIFE March 29th, 2024

***Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place (***[***2 Corinthians 2:14***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%202:14&version=kjv)***).***

When we teach about the triumphant life—the prosperity, health, wellness and wholeness that salvation in Christ brought to us—some people think it’s too good to be true. They say, "Well, Pastor Chris just promises them a good life, trying to tell them there’s no hardship, no persecution, and no problem." 

Why should I proclaim the gloom life when the Lord already gave us the victorious life? Even when we go through severe persecutions, He tells us to, *“...count it all joy...”* ([James 1:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:2&version=kjv)). Why? It’s because nothing and no one, whether in heaven, on earth or under the earth, can work to our disadvantage.

This keeps us joyful and consistent in our praise and appreciation of God’s grace and glory in our lives. Think about Job, for example, during a distressing period of agony and affliction in his life, he said, *“Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him…”* ([Job 13:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2013:15&version=kjv)).

[Isaiah 43:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2043:2&version=kjv) says, *“When thou passest through the waters…they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.”* The Lord never promised that we wouldn't face challenges, but He assured us that our victories would be inevitable.

[1 Corinthians 15:57](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:57&version=kjv) says, *“But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”* It parallels what we read in our opening verse. We’re victorious ALWAYS, in every place and in all things.

Study about our Lord Jesus when He walked the earth; He was victorious in all things. He lived in absolute glory and dominion and passed the same mentality to His disciples. Once, He said to them, *“…in the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world”* ([John 16:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:33&version=kjv)).

In [Luke 10:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:19&version=kjv), He said, *“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”* Hallelujah! What we have in Christ is the transcendent life. That’s what we believe; that’s what we live, and that’s what He sent us to preach and teach.

***For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith (***[***1 John 5:4***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:4&version=kjv)***).***

Observe that the Apostle John didn’t say we should try or attempt to use our faith to conquer the world, no! The Church is born of God. You are born of God. The Scriptures are born of God. And our theme verse says: *"For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world..."* ([1 John 5:4 AMPC](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:4&version=AMPC)).

In [John 16:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:33&version=kjv), the Lord Jesus said, *"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.*" If He overcame the world for us, we don't have to “try” to overcome the world again.

Our faith in His victory is not an attempt to conquer the world but a recognition of His finished work in our behalf. He already conquered the world. We don't need to strive to "re\-conquer"! An understanding of this truth will put springs in your steps.

Keep walking in the reality of the truth that you’ve conquered the world in Christ Jesus. Every so often, affirm that Satan, the prince of this world, has nothing in you. You’ve conquered the systems, economics and economies of this world. Hallelujah!

## WE HAIL FROM DEITY March 31st, 2024

***Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world (***[***1 John 4:4***](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&version=kjv)***).***

There’s a misconception of the meaning of the phrase, "Ye are of God" in the verse above. To some, it means “to be on God’s side,” but that’s not correct. The Apostle John’s construction isn’t in any way ambiguous, so it isn’t about being on anyone's side. It simply means you hail from Deity. In other words, your origin is in God; you’re His offspring.

It’s akin to what the Bible says in [James 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:18&version=kjv): *“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.”* To hail from God, therefore, Christ must be in you; you must receive Him to live in you.

Recall the words of the Lord Jesus in [John 3:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:3&version=kjv), *“… Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” The concluding phrase of our opening verse gives credence to this; it says,* “…greater is He that is in you...;” so, He has to be in you. Think about it: He gave birth to you to live in you!

The Bible says, *“...Christ in you, the hope of glory”* ([Colossians 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&version=kjv)). You have absolute victory over all forces of darkness and the wicked spirits that orchestrate evil because of the greater One that lives in you.

Read how beautifully the AMPC renders our opening verse: *“Little children, you are of God \[you belong to Him] and have \[already] defeated and overcome them \[the agents of the antichrist], because He Who lives in you is greater (mightier) than he who is in the world.”* Praise God!

You have overcome the adversary and his nefarious and sinister plans to cause untold hardship, troubles, sorrows, distresses and corrupting influences in the world because you hail from Deity! Hallelujah!
