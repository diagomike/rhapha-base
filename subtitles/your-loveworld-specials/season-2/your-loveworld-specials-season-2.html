<!-- -->Praise God.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you very much.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;ll look good.<br>
<!-- -->Great.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m confident of this very thing.<br>
<!-- -->That he who has begun a good work He and you<br>
<!-- -->He shall perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->He shall perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->And come feed enough this very thing.</p>
<p>Come to the day of Jesus Christ, we shall perform it.<br>
<!-- -->Come to the day of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m confident of this very thing.<br>
<!-- -->God bless the Lord, who has started a good work in you.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;ll perform it.<br>
<!-- -->Till the day of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->And you know what I just told you in that song is scripture.</p>
<p>Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.<br>
<!-- -->Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you something about that song.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;re gonna change that first part of it because the first part of it is not a Christian song.<br>
<!-- -->Surprise.<br>
<!-- -->Hosanna is come save us.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what the Hebrew means.<br>
<!-- -->You didn&#x27;t know that, that&#x27;s what it means.<br>
<!-- -->Come save us, come save us.<br>
<!-- -->So the calling on the Savior, so He&#x27;s actually, that part of it is actually for the Jews to sing in the last week of Daniel&#x27;s prophecy.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s the song they&#x27;re going to sing.<br>
<!-- -->So about to see the rest part of it is beautiful.<br>
<!-- -->Lord will lift up your name.<br>
<!-- -->So we&#x27;ll get rid of the Hosanna and put something.<br>
<!-- -->All of you around the world have been singing, Hosanna, now you&#x27;re just knowing what you&#x27;ve been singing.<br>
<!-- -->So Hosanna is not a Christian cry.<br>
<!-- -->All right.<br>
<!-- -->Peter Alago&#x27;s cojella mangrid Igesas.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you, Lord.<br>
<!-- -->Being confident, Philippians 1, 6, I was singing that song verbatim.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s here.<br>
<!-- -->Being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you very much.<br>
<!-- -->Okay.<br>
<!-- -->So, welcome to today&#x27;s program.<br>
<!-- -->A lot is loaded into today.</p>
<p>My God&#x27;s grace will go far enough if we don&#x27;t finish.</p>
<p>No matter what the world is looking like to you today, be excited about<br>
<!-- -->the work of the Holy Spirit in your life and in His church around the world.<br>
<!-- -->Be excited about God&#x27;s work.<br>
<!-- -->Just know that He is programming us and positioning us for absolute success in victory.<br>
<!-- -->Nothing shot of that.<br>
<!-- -->Remember the words of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->Chair up, I have overcome the word.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus said so.<br>
<!-- -->So don&#x27;t be downcast.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t carry a long face.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t be sad, but rejoice.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s a chair up.<br>
<!-- -->I have overcome the word.<br>
<!-- -->So we are living in his victory.<br>
<!-- -->We are walking in his steps.<br>
<!-- -->We are not trying to defeat the devil.<br>
<!-- -->He already defeated the devil for us and gave us the victory over the devil.<br>
<!-- -->So be excited.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;re a winner.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->And what I&#x27;ve been sharing with you in the Word of God is to help you live the life that has given you, to help you walk in the victory that he accomplished for you and to exercise the authority that has given you.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;ve got to use it.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;ve got to use it.<br>
<!-- -->All right.<br>
<!-- -->So, yesterday I began to explain some things.<br>
<!-- -->Actually, we continued because we&#x27;d been on it, but I mentioned a word that I wanted to talk about, not the word itself,<br>
<!-- -->what it implied in the scriptures that we were looking at.<br>
<!-- -->And each time we got to it, I said, make a note of that.<br>
<!-- -->The word was indignation.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s referring to the wrath of God.<br>
<!-- -->The, the sins of the word were paid for by Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus Christ was sacrificed for us.<br>
<!-- -->He paid the full penalty for sin.<br>
<!-- -->Or sin.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus paid the full penalty.<br>
<!-- -->But not everyone has accepted his sacrifice.<br>
<!-- -->Not everyone has accepted his offering.<br>
<!-- -->Not everyone.<br>
<!-- -->The Bible says, why were we yet without strength?<br>
<!-- -->In due time, Christ died for the ungodly.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, the power of that verse.<br>
<!-- -->The glory that&#x27;s within<br>
<!-- -->That simple word.<br>
<!-- -->Why were we yet sinus?<br>
<!-- -->All of us.<br>
<!-- -->He says, why were we yet sinus?<br>
<!-- -->Christ died for us.<br>
<!-- -->Christ died for us.<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t do it.<br>
<!-- -->As I explained to you,<br>
<!-- -->Last time I was sharing it with you.<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t do it because we were good.<br>
<!-- -->No, he didn&#x27;t do it because we did something nice.<br>
<!-- -->Our actions never deserved that.<br>
<!-- -->But he loved us while we were yet sinners.<br>
<!-- -->He says, Christ died for the young godly.<br>
<!-- -->It tells us how God loves the world, the world of men.<br>
<!-- -->Christ died for the young godly.<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t die for Christians.<br>
<!-- -->He died for the young godly.<br>
<!-- -->For those who hated him, he died for them.<br>
<!-- -->When you understand that,<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;ll give you a different way of thinking, a different mindset about your world, about those who mistreat you, about your persecutors, about those who hate you.<br>
<!-- -->In fact, he told us, pray for those who hate you, those who despitefully use you and persecute you.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus said so.<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t say, call heaven to put fire and burn them.<br>
<!-- -->No.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s not what he meant.<br>
<!-- -->He says, bless them.<br>
<!-- -->Bless them.<br>
<!-- -->He said, be like your heavenly father.<br>
<!-- -->Who lets his reign fall?<br>
<!-- -->on the wicked and on the righteous.</p>
<p>He wants us to be like our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>But then, if after everything men reject the salvation that Jesus brought, if after everything<br>
<!-- -->They will not accept the sacrifice of His blood.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s no other way.<br>
<!-- -->God knew the gravity of the offense.<br>
<!-- -->And the judgment he deserved.<br>
<!-- -->And he sent Jesus to save us from the judgment that Jesus should be judged in our place.<br>
<!-- -->So the Bible says, how shall we escape?<br>
<!-- -->If we neglect so great salvation, think about the salvation brought to us by Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->How shall you escape?<br>
<!-- -->And I&#x27;m asking you, if you neglect the salvation of Jesus Christ, the salvation that Jesus has brought to you, how are you going to escape?<br>
<!-- -->How?</p>
<p>The Bible says there&#x27;s no other name under heaven, given among men, whereby we must be saved.<br>
<!-- -->No other name under heaven.<br>
<!-- -->Outside the name of Jesus, the Bible says there is no salvation anywhere else.<br>
<!-- -->He says, neither is there salvation in any other.<br>
<!-- -->I want you to look at those words.<br>
<!-- -->This is neither is their salvation in any other.<br>
<!-- -->Be not deceived.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t think that somehow you may be saved in any other way.</p>
<p>Look at it.<br>
<!-- -->Acts chapter 4, verse 12.<br>
<!-- -->Neither is their salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.</p>
<p>Outside of Jesus, do you know any promise of salvation that God has authenticated<br>
<!-- -->that God has approved?<br>
<!-- -->The Bible says that Jesus was approved by God by the resurrection from the dead.<br>
<!-- -->He proved Jesus to be his son by the resurrection from the dead.<br>
<!-- -->Do you know any other one who was raised from the dead?<br>
<!-- -->Do you know someone else who resurrected?</p>
<p>Jesus himself said in St.<br>
<!-- -->John&#x27;s Gospel, chapter 14 and verse six.<br>
<!-- -->Look at those words.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus said unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life.<br>
<!-- -->And I want you to notice the definite article.<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t say I am a way.<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m one of the ways.<br>
<!-- -->Hear his words clearly.<br>
<!-- -->I am the way.<br>
<!-- -->Not one of them.<br>
<!-- -->I am the way, the truth, and the life.<br>
<!-- -->Look at the next words.<br>
<!-- -->No man comments on to the Father, but by me.<br>
<!-- -->These are the words of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Do you have an option?<br>
<!-- -->Do you know better?</p>
<p>Keep this in your mind and understand why we&#x27;re sharing the word like this.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s no other way.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s no other way.</p>
<p>I want to read the words of Jesus that are very similar to what we&#x27;ve been reading in St.<br>
<!-- -->Mattie&#x27;s Gospel chapter 24, but this time from St.<br>
<!-- -->Luke&#x27;s Gospel, you would notice some similarity, like I&#x27;ve mentioned, but there are some key areas<br>
<!-- -->that are included here, that you don&#x27;t have in Matthew or in Mark.<br>
<!-- -->You got basically same account in Mark chapter 13, as you have in Matthew 24.<br>
<!-- -->But let&#x27;s read Drums and Luke&#x27;s Gospel chapter 21 from verse number five, and follow carefully.<br>
<!-- -->And as some speck of the temple, that&#x27;s the same temple, all right?<br>
<!-- -->Remember, he walked out of the temple, okay?<br>
<!-- -->Now, but I&#x27;m gonna take you into a beautiful story shortly.<br>
<!-- -->Well, we&#x27;re gonna have, we&#x27;re just joining with Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, and as some speck of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,<br>
<!-- -->As for these things which he behold, the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.<br>
<!-- -->And they asked him saying, Master, but when shall these things be?<br>
<!-- -->And what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?<br>
<!-- -->All right.</p>
<p>Look at the next verse.<br>
<!-- -->He starts answering them.<br>
<!-- -->And he said, take heed that he be not deceived.<br>
<!-- -->For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ.<br>
<!-- -->Now he&#x27;s giving them the signs, all right?<br>
<!-- -->So give this name.<br>
<!-- -->For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ.<br>
<!-- -->And the time draw it near.<br>
<!-- -->Go ye not therefore after them.<br>
<!-- -->Why did he say many are going to come and say, I&#x27;m the Christ?<br>
<!-- -->Because he&#x27;s going away.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s leaving.<br>
<!-- -->They heard him say that.<br>
<!-- -->After you wept over Jerusalem, he said, you&#x27;re not going to see me again until you say, blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.<br>
<!-- -->So they know he&#x27;ll return.<br>
<!-- -->They want to know what signs will there be for all of these things that he&#x27;s telling them.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, so, it&#x27;s a stake heed that he be not deceived for many shall come in my name, saying I am Christ, and the time draw it near.<br>
<!-- -->Be going not there for after them.<br>
<!-- -->But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified, for these things must first come to pass, but the end is not by and by.<br>
<!-- -->It says, even though you hear of wars and commotions,<br>
<!-- -->In Matthew, he tells you about rumors of wars.<br>
<!-- -->For the same thing, he says, the end is not yet.<br>
<!-- -->The end is not close.<br>
<!-- -->And you know, we&#x27;ve been, I mean, the build war since Jesus left, lots and lots of them.<br>
<!-- -->So he says, that doesn&#x27;t tell you it&#x27;s close.<br>
<!-- -->Good.<br>
<!-- -->Next.<br>
<!-- -->Then, steady onto them, nations shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.<br>
<!-- -->And great equates shall be in diverse places and famines and pestilences and fearful sites.<br>
<!-- -->And great signs shall there be from heaven.<br>
<!-- -->But before all these, they shall lay hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and interpresence, being brought before kings and rulers of my namesake.<br>
<!-- -->And it shall turn to you for a testimony raised God, sadly therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what he shall answer.<br>
<!-- -->I like this one.<br>
<!-- -->For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gain say no resist, hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->Glory to God.<br>
<!-- -->Next verse.<br>
<!-- -->And it shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kings, folks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.<br>
<!-- -->And it shall be hated of all men for my name&#x27;s sake.<br>
<!-- -->but there shall not an air of your hair perish.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->Says, don&#x27;t worry.<br>
<!-- -->They can&#x27;t destroy you.<br>
<!-- -->In your patience possess your souls.<br>
<!-- -->And when you show, now here is where you gotta slow down.<br>
<!-- -->I don&#x27;t want you to miss this.<br>
<!-- -->Listen carefully.<br>
<!-- -->Listen to what he says.<br>
<!-- -->And when he shall see Jerusalem come past with armies, they know that the desolation thereof is nigh.<br>
<!-- -->They had heard the prophets talk about the desolations of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In Daniel talked about it.</p>
<p>Isaiah talked about it.<br>
<!-- -->The new was coming.<br>
<!-- -->Joel, the prophets talked about it.<br>
<!-- -->And so Jesus says, when you shall see Jerusalem, come past with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh.<br>
<!-- -->Now,<br>
<!-- -->follow carefully what he says in the next verse.<br>
<!-- -->Then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains.<br>
<!-- -->He picks up, you don&#x27;t find that verse 20 in Mark or in Matthew.<br>
<!-- -->But he goes<br>
<!-- -->into verse 21 here, which the others have.<br>
<!-- -->Because one part refers to something that was about to happen not in much distant future.<br>
<!-- -->But the others were focusing on the end of the world.<br>
<!-- -->You would notice that even in the questions, the third question is not included here and of the end of the world.</p>
<p>But basically, they have the same account.<br>
<!-- -->Then it goes into this, then let them which are in Judea, flee to the mountains.<br>
<!-- -->And I mentioned to you yesterday, they&#x27;re supposed to flee<br>
<!-- -->to the mountains of Moa.<br>
<!-- -->The weirdness of Moa.</p>
<p>And let them which are in the midst of it depart out.<br>
<!-- -->And let not them that are in the countries enter their into.<br>
<!-- -->Says if you&#x27;re inside Jerusalem flee.<br>
<!-- -->Look at the next verse.<br>
<!-- -->For these be the days of vengeance, vengeance.<br>
<!-- -->Now, we know he&#x27;s referring to something in the future because that&#x27;s what the other writers said.<br>
<!-- -->None of them focused on the immediate future, but the distant future.<br>
<!-- -->For these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled.<br>
<!-- -->Did you see that?<br>
<!-- -->All things which are written.<br>
<!-- -->Meaning everything like Daniel put it in another way.<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s read how Daniel put it in chapter 9 from verse 24.<br>
<!-- -->Daniel chapter 9 from verse 24, 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity.<br>
<!-- -->See, all of this is inside and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to sell up the vision and prophecy.<br>
<!-- -->So vision and prophecy, everything will come to an end.<br>
<!-- -->back to St.<br>
<!-- -->Luke&#x27;s Gospel, where we were.<br>
<!-- -->For these be the days of the engines, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.<br>
<!-- -->Next.<br>
<!-- -->But walk onto them that are with child, and to them that gives up in those days, for there shall be great distress in the land.<br>
<!-- -->And rot!<br>
<!-- -->That word is indignation.<br>
<!-- -->Once in the New Testament, it&#x27;s translated indignation.<br>
<!-- -->But he&#x27;s referring to the same thing in the Old Testament, same prophecy, for there shall be great distress in the land and indignation against these people.<br>
<!-- -->Now, notice he didn&#x27;t say here against all people, but it says against these people.<br>
<!-- -->When we read the Bible, it is very important that we are careful to observe what it says and what it doesn&#x27;t say.<br>
<!-- -->And what I&#x27;ve endeavored to share with you in all these weeks and months, to give you what is in the Bible and not speculations, because there&#x27;s been a lot of speculations.<br>
<!-- -->Lots and lots of assumptions.<br>
<!-- -->And that just means lots of opinions.<br>
<!-- -->And that may not take you very far.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s good for you to know the Word of God, know exactly what it says, know exactly what it says, not assumptions.<br>
<!-- -->Does it say so, if it does.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, but you see, when you read prophecy, prophecy comes with prophetic language.<br>
<!-- -->Prophecy a lot of times has mysteries.<br>
<!-- -->So it takes the same spirit of prophecy to interpret the mysteries.<br>
<!-- -->So you can&#x27;t just look at it on the letters and say, oh, it should be like this A, B, and C. Not quite.<br>
<!-- -->You have to understand prophecy through the same spirit of prophecy.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Very, very important.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re in verse 23, let&#x27;s read again.<br>
<!-- -->But walk onto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days, for they shall be distressed in the land and rot upon these people.<br>
<!-- -->Wow, look at the next verse.<br>
<!-- -->and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into our nations.&quot;<br>
<!-- -->Did you hear that?<br>
<!-- -->And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</p>
<p>And it&#x27;s still on.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re still in the times of the Gentiles.<br>
<!-- -->And the times of the Gentiles will continue until the end of Daniel 70 a week.<br>
<!-- -->Now look at that prophecy one more time.<br>
<!-- -->Look at it again.<br>
<!-- -->Look at it again.<br>
<!-- -->Daniel chapter 9 verse 24, we just read it.<br>
<!-- -->70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy.<br>
<!-- -->So it&#x27;s 70 weeks that must be accomplished until the end of the 70 weeks</p>
<p>Jerusalem will not be reclaimed by God.<br>
<!-- -->Man&#x27;s going to reclaim, but until Jesus comes, it&#x27;s not done because he calls it his city.<br>
<!-- -->This is my city.<br>
<!-- -->So that is one place, it&#x27;s like in the garden, all manner of fruit trees.<br>
<!-- -->And God said to Adam, you can eat of every tree in the garden, except the one in the midst of the garden.<br>
<!-- -->He says, don&#x27;t eat that one.<br>
<!-- -->So God also gave man all the cities, but he chose Jerusalem to be his city.<br>
<!-- -->The Bible says so.<br>
<!-- -->And he&#x27;s going to prove it.<br>
<!-- -->when he comes.<br>
<!-- -->In fact, he&#x27;s going to take actions against those who decided to divide it.<br>
<!-- -->He better be careful.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s in the book.<br>
<!-- -->If we can get there today, I&#x27;ll show it to you because we&#x27;ll go in step by step today.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s amazing.<br>
<!-- -->So for those who say it doesn&#x27;t matter, divide it.<br>
<!-- -->Okay.<br>
<!-- -->For us to start understanding where we&#x27;re going with all of this today, let me take you through an interesting journey, what I call the last temple discuss.<br>
<!-- -->Now we have what we call the, or live it discuss.<br>
<!-- -->The live it discuss is,<br>
<!-- -->the discussion that Jesus had with his disciples on the mount of beliefs.<br>
<!-- -->And the temple discuss as the one Jesus had in the temple.<br>
<!-- -->All right.<br>
<!-- -->So let&#x27;s enter<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s follow the journey.<br>
<!-- -->So I&#x27;ve written, I&#x27;ve made it simple here.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus enters the temple in Jerusalem and opens up what will be his final outreach to Israel and its leaders.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s been reaching out to them.<br>
<!-- -->We talked about the, the factory and how he said, a man,<br>
<!-- -->acts the dresser.<br>
<!-- -->It says that three years now, I&#x27;ve been coming to get fruit on history.<br>
<!-- -->You wouldn&#x27;t produce nothing.<br>
<!-- -->So it&#x27;s just got it down.<br>
<!-- -->All right?<br>
<!-- -->OK.<br>
<!-- -->This time.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s been reaching out, you see.<br>
<!-- -->So I said, Jesus ate as the temple in Jerusalem and opens up what would be his final outreach to Israel and his leaders.<br>
<!-- -->It goes on until he&#x27;s rejected and he whips in lamentation over Jerusalem in the closing verses of chapter 23.<br>
<!-- -->So that&#x27;s Matthew chapter 21 from verse 23, all the way.<br>
<!-- -->to chapter 23, verse 39.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s where you have that discussion, okay?<br>
<!-- -->So let&#x27;s follow this journey into Matthew&#x27;s Gospel, step by step.<br>
<!-- -->So Matthew chapter 11, chapter 19 from verse one.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus arrives.<br>
<!-- -->He arrives.<br>
<!-- -->and teaches in Judea, beyond Jordan.<br>
<!-- -->So let&#x27;s read the scripture.<br>
<!-- -->And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these things, they sayings, he departed from Galilee.<br>
<!-- -->So we know where he&#x27;s coming from.<br>
<!-- -->He departed from Galilee and came into the course of Judea beyond Jordan.<br>
<!-- -->Next verse.<br>
<!-- -->And great martyrs followed him and he healed them there.<br>
<!-- -->Number two, from this place he heads for Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->So we know where he&#x27;s going.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s joining from Galilee towards Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->This is the final journey.<br>
<!-- -->Matthew chapter 20 from verse 17.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the 12 disciples apart in the way and said unto them, they&#x27;re on the way now, behold, we go up to Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->And the Son of Man shall be betrayed onto the chief priests and onto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death.<br>
<!-- -->and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and to scarge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again.<br>
<!-- -->They are on the way.<br>
<!-- -->Going to Jerusalem and Jesus is talking to them and telling them these things.<br>
<!-- -->Number three, they go through Jericho.<br>
<!-- -->So in Matthew chapter 20 verse 29.</p>
<p>And as they departed from Jericho, so we know they got to Jericho.<br>
<!-- -->Now they&#x27;re leaving Jericho.<br>
<!-- -->As they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him, next verse.<br>
<!-- -->And the whole two blind men sitting by the wayside, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out saying, have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.<br>
<!-- -->So we know on the way he performed the miracle.<br>
<!-- -->You read the whole story.<br>
<!-- -->He arrives at Beth Fudge.<br>
<!-- -->near Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->So he stops close to Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->And there&#x27;s where he sent for the donkey.<br>
<!-- -->So he&#x27;s near Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s read Matthew chapter 21 from verse 1.<br>
<!-- -->And when did you lie on to Jerusalem and will come to Beth<br>
<!-- -->onto the Mount of Olives, then sent Jesus to the cycle saying onto them, going to the village over against you.<br>
<!-- -->And straight away, you shall find an arse tied on a cart with heart.<br>
<!-- -->Loose them and bring them unto me.</p>
<p>All right.<br>
<!-- -->So we know what happened there, one more verse, one more verse, verse three.<br>
<!-- -->And if any men say unto you, you shall say the Lord had need of them and straight away he will send them.<br>
<!-- -->So Jesus is waiting.<br>
<!-- -->So they&#x27;re sending the donkey.<br>
<!-- -->I would have liked to read more of the verses, but we got a long way to go.<br>
<!-- -->and all the nice things, because what happened here was in fulfillment of Scripture, okay?<br>
<!-- -->But let&#x27;s go.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus enters Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s on the donkey.<br>
<!-- -->And what happens from verse 10, chapter 21, and when he was coming to Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, who is this?<br>
<!-- -->And the multitude said, this is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.<br>
<!-- -->Wow.<br>
<!-- -->The whole city was moved.<br>
<!-- -->Wow.</p>
<p>Go back to verse three, I think we should read.<br>
<!-- -->I want you to see<br>
<!-- -->What the Bible tells us?<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re going to read it to verse 10.<br>
<!-- -->So he says, uh, go get me that donkey.<br>
<!-- -->And if any man said anything to you, you shall say the Lord had need of them.<br>
<!-- -->Okay.<br>
<!-- -->So verse four, all this was done that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophet saying,<br>
<!-- -->tell he the daughter of Zion, behold, I King, commit unto thee, make, and set upon an us, and account the fall of an us.&quot;<br>
<!-- -->And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them.<br>
<!-- -->Did you notice?<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s prophecy.<br>
<!-- -->And many of them missed it.<br>
<!-- -->This was the time, this was his final outreach to Israel as their king.<br>
<!-- -->He wants them to know he&#x27;s the Messiah.<br>
<!-- -->He comes as the scripture, already spoke about him.</p>
<p>But no, what is sign?<br>
<!-- -->What is sign?<br>
<!-- -->What is sign from heaven?<br>
<!-- -->What is sign?<br>
<!-- -->What is sign?<br>
<!-- -->Of course, even the disciples didn&#x27;t catch it at the time.<br>
<!-- -->They didn&#x27;t know.<br>
<!-- -->It was later on.<br>
<!-- -->It was later on.<br>
<!-- -->It dawned on them that the Scripture was being fulfilled because the Prophet said, it&#x27;s your king that&#x27;s coming.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s your king.<br>
<!-- -->Verse 6.<br>
<!-- -->And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded, or seven, and brought the arse and the cult, and put on them their clothes, and they set him there on.<br>
<!-- -->And a very great multitude spread their garments, to put their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strut them in the way.<br>
<!-- -->You see, the common people knew.<br>
<!-- -->The common people, the poor.<br>
<!-- -->The beggars.<br>
<!-- -->The outcasts.<br>
<!-- -->They knew.<br>
<!-- -->They knew.<br>
<!-- -->Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, thou has ordained praise.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->Look at the next.<br>
<!-- -->And the mortgages that went before.<br>
<!-- -->Those ahead of him and that followed those behind him saying, Hosanna to the son of David.<br>
<!-- -->They were saying, Hosanna, they were saying it to the son of David.<br>
<!-- -->Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.<br>
<!-- -->Hosanna in the highest.<br>
<!-- -->Look at the next day.<br>
<!-- -->And when he was coming to Jerusalem, all the city was moved saying, who is this?<br>
<!-- -->So you see, if we jumped those verses we just read, you probably wouldn&#x27;t have got the picture of what was going on.<br>
<!-- -->Why are they saying, who is this?<br>
<!-- -->This is a large crowd coming.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus is in the middle.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s a large crowd in front of another crowd at the back and they&#x27;ll shout in.<br>
<!-- -->So the calling is, this is the Savior.<br>
<!-- -->So they&#x27;re expecting him to do something.<br>
<!-- -->They&#x27;re expecting him to save them from the Romans.<br>
<!-- -->They don&#x27;t think about their sins.<br>
<!-- -->No, they think, ah-ha, our king is here.<br>
<!-- -->Now he&#x27;s gonna deliver us from the Romans.<br>
<!-- -->Well, why did the leaders hate that?<br>
<!-- -->Because they had nice political positions.<br>
<!-- -->And they were so mad.<br>
<!-- -->because they wanted to keep their place.<br>
<!-- -->And they thought the Romans may fire them from their office.<br>
<!-- -->So they hated both Jesus and the people together.<br>
<!-- -->Look at this.<br>
<!-- -->Who is this?<br>
<!-- -->Verse 11.<br>
<!-- -->And the multitude said, this is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus went into the temple of God.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus, so he arrived, okay?<br>
<!-- -->He arrived.<br>
<!-- -->Look at that.<br>
<!-- -->Verse six, Jesus entice the temple from verse 12 we&#x27;re reading.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple.<br>
<!-- -->And overthrew the tables of the money changes and the seeds of them that sold offs.<br>
<!-- -->And said unto them, it is written, my house shall be called the house of prayer.<br>
<!-- -->But he have made it a den of thieves.<br>
<!-- -->And the blind, I like this part.<br>
<!-- -->And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them.<br>
<!-- -->They never got healed with the Pharisees and Sadducees and scribes.<br>
<!-- -->They never got healed with the high priest and the priestesses.<br>
<!-- -->They never got healed with all of those people.<br>
<!-- -->But when Jesus came to the temple, they got healed.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->Praise God.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, that&#x27;s nice.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s nice.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, number seven.<br>
<!-- -->He goes out of the city to lodging Bethany.<br>
<!-- -->He refused to sleep in the city that night.<br>
<!-- -->He went to Bethany.<br>
<!-- -->Look at verse 17.<br>
<!-- -->Look at it right there.<br>
<!-- -->Verse 17.<br>
<!-- -->and he left them and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there.<br>
<!-- -->So we know he&#x27;s arrived in Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->He has visited the temple, he&#x27;s done some things in the temple, rebuked some people, corrected some people, and healed some people, and then he went out of the city, and lodged in Bethany.<br>
<!-- -->So the next thing we know in the morning, he returns to the city.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re following Jesus last moment, okay?<br>
<!-- -->So in the morning, look at it in verse 18, now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hongered.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s coming in the morning time.<br>
<!-- -->So he&#x27;s hungry, okay?<br>
<!-- -->All right, let&#x27;s read a little more.<br>
<!-- -->And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to read and found nothing there on, but leaves only.<br>
<!-- -->And said unto it, he said unto it, Jesus talked to a tree.<br>
<!-- -->He said unto it.<br>
<!-- -->Did you see that?<br>
<!-- -->Not unto them, not the people, not unto God.<br>
<!-- -->He talked to the tree.<br>
<!-- -->Think what else we can talk to.<br>
<!-- -->So he said unto it, let no fruit grow on thee henceforward forever.<br>
<!-- -->And presently the fig tree withered away.<br>
<!-- -->It withered away.<br>
<!-- -->I like what Luke says, because Luke was a doctor.<br>
<!-- -->And not Luke, Matthew, I wanted to say something about Luke versus Matthew.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, Luke was a doctor, Matthew wasn&#x27;t.<br>
<!-- -->And every time that Luke said something, he related it more with health and healing.<br>
<!-- -->You get it?<br>
<!-- -->Luke was a doctor.<br>
<!-- -->Every time he said something to us, he gave us details.<br>
<!-- -->But when you come to Matthew, he doesn&#x27;t see those details.<br>
<!-- -->He says presently, it&#x27;s with that.<br>
<!-- -->Away.<br>
<!-- -->Only when you go to Mark, you discover that that&#x27;s not exactly how it happened.<br>
<!-- -->But the word is truth.<br>
<!-- -->Matthew says it with that way.<br>
<!-- -->Maybe I&#x27;m out.<br>
<!-- -->Well, it&#x27;s simple.<br>
<!-- -->You can look at it later.<br>
<!-- -->Why is this important?<br>
<!-- -->Because he doesn&#x27;t give you the detail.<br>
<!-- -->but it gives you the truth.<br>
<!-- -->Now, what&#x27;s the detail?<br>
<!-- -->When you go to Mark, Mark tells us that when Jesus talked to the tree, the disciples heard it.<br>
<!-- -->They noted what Jesus said.<br>
<!-- -->And nothing happened outwardly.<br>
<!-- -->It was the next day.<br>
<!-- -->As they passed by, they saw the tree dried up from the roots.<br>
<!-- -->And the barber says Peter calling to the remember and said to the master, look at the victory which you cast.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s widowed.<br>
<!-- -->So it was the next that they discovered it widowed.<br>
<!-- -->But Matthew is telling us et chutes.<br>
<!-- -->He says presently.<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t have to say presently.<br>
<!-- -->He would have said the victory widowed away and to leave it for us to decide when it happened.<br>
<!-- -->But he says presently without the details.<br>
<!-- -->But it was not seen.<br>
<!-- -->In other words, don&#x27;t be carried away by the outward appearance of things.<br>
<!-- -->Sometimes when you speak, it happens in the area where you&#x27;re not seeing it.<br>
<!-- -->So you speak like Matthew.<br>
<!-- -->He says presently.<br>
<!-- -->Like when you tell that cancer to die.<br>
<!-- -->The cancer dies.<br>
<!-- -->It dies presently.<br>
<!-- -->Yes, sir.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->And just because you have the feeling that it&#x27;s still there, the pain, or you look at the swelling, the growth, it&#x27;s like that fig tree.<br>
<!-- -->When Jesus said, nobody&#x27;s gonna eat from you anymore, he was cursed.<br>
<!-- -->And Matthew says, presently, the fig tree, we&#x27;ve had the way.<br>
<!-- -->Glory to God.</p>
<p>All right, so I was showing you this, but I&#x27;m taking you somewhere.<br>
<!-- -->So in the morning, we said, he returns to the city, OK?<br>
<!-- -->He encounters this tree.<br>
<!-- -->And we don&#x27;t want to go into the details of why did he even talk to the tree at all?<br>
<!-- -->What attracted him to the tree?<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s another message, which we already have.<br>
<!-- -->And maybe another time we can share that.<br>
<!-- -->but we&#x27;re going somewhere.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s come back this is morning time.<br>
<!-- -->Remember, last night he went to Bethany and lodged in Bethany, okay?<br>
<!-- -->And this is morning time, he&#x27;s coming back to Jerusalem, okay?<br>
<!-- -->So, he returns and Matthew chapter 21, we&#x27;re in verse 23.<br>
<!-- -->And when he was coming to the temple, not only does he return to the city,<br>
<!-- -->Jerusalem, he comes to the temple.<br>
<!-- -->When he was coming to the temple, the chief priests and the heirs of the people came unto him as he was teaching.<br>
<!-- -->So he was teaching in the temple.<br>
<!-- -->And they said to him, by what authority doest thou these things?<br>
<!-- -->And who gave these authority?<br>
<!-- -->Because he cast out the money changes yesterday.<br>
<!-- -->So they went to tell the chief priests, they went to report him.<br>
<!-- -->to those people that can&#x27;t imagine what that prophet from Galilee did.<br>
<!-- -->So they now came to intimidate Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->I will give you this authority to say.<br>
<!-- -->Well, I love Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Watch.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which, if you tell me,<br>
<!-- -->I, likewise, will tell you by what authority I do these things.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus was extraordinary.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, boy.<br>
<!-- -->Wow.<br>
<!-- -->So they&#x27;re listening.<br>
<!-- -->Look at it.<br>
<!-- -->The baptism of John.<br>
<!-- -->Where was it?<br>
<!-- -->Where did it come from?<br>
<!-- -->From heaven or of men?<br>
<!-- -->And the risen<br>
<!-- -->with themselves saying, if we shall say, I want to picture this.<br>
<!-- -->They all come around Jesus and they&#x27;re talking to him.<br>
<!-- -->Tell us, by what authority did you do these things?<br>
<!-- -->And shouting at him.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus says, hold on, I have a question for you.<br>
<!-- -->If you can answer me, I&#x27;ll answer you.<br>
<!-- -->Then he says, tell me the baptism, the baptism of John.<br>
<!-- -->Where is it from?<br>
<!-- -->Heaven or of men?<br>
<!-- -->Just imagine this.<br>
<!-- -->They all gather among themselves.<br>
<!-- -->Hold on.<br>
<!-- -->So they&#x27;re whispering and they&#x27;re arguing among them, you can&#x27;t say that.<br>
<!-- -->No, no, no, no, no, we can&#x27;t say that.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus is waiting.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus disciples are watching them.<br>
<!-- -->So they come back.<br>
<!-- -->They have an answer for him.<br>
<!-- -->Watch.<br>
<!-- -->And the reason with themselves saying, if we shall save from heaven, he will say unto us, why did he not then believe him?<br>
<!-- -->Because they remember John bore witness of Jesus and told them who Jesus was.<br>
<!-- -->But they didn&#x27;t want to believe John to protect their political position.</p>
<p>So they said, if we say from heaven, he will say, why did you not believe him?<br>
<!-- -->Why didn&#x27;t you believe John?<br>
<!-- -->But if we shall say of men, they looked around, there&#x27;s a large crowd around him.<br>
<!-- -->They said, we fear the people for all hold John as a prophet.<br>
<!-- -->We can&#x27;t say John was of men.<br>
<!-- -->Is the prophet?<br>
<!-- -->No, no, they said, we have an answer.<br>
<!-- -->So they came, look at the next verse.<br>
<!-- -->And they answered Jesus and said, we cannot tell.<br>
<!-- -->And he said unto them, neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.<br>
<!-- -->I too will not answer you.</p>
<p>So, I&#x27;ve just taken you through an interesting journey that goes into something more serious<br>
<!-- -->And you see why we&#x27;re coming all the way.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m helping you understand the journey.<br>
<!-- -->Now, Jesus is talking to these men.<br>
<!-- -->You, not such a good encounter.<br>
<!-- -->They don&#x27;t believe him.<br>
<!-- -->This is the temple.<br>
<!-- -->The leaders are here.<br>
<!-- -->The religious leaders who have been honored by political leaders.<br>
<!-- -->They reject Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->The question in his authority, who are you?<br>
<!-- -->Who authorized you to do this?<br>
<!-- -->They didn&#x27;t believe John and now they don&#x27;t believe him.<br>
<!-- -->So we go to verse 28. 28.</p>
<p>But what thing he, Jesus starts speaking to everybody, all right?<br>
<!-- -->Because he says to them, I don&#x27;t have an answer for you since you can answer my question.<br>
<!-- -->So he speaks to everybody now, what?<br>
<!-- -->But what thing he, a certain man, I want you to understand the setting.<br>
<!-- -->Who&#x27;s there?<br>
<!-- -->Where is he talking from?<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s in the temple.</p>
<p>But what think he?<br>
<!-- -->A second man had two sons.<br>
<!-- -->And he came to the first and said, son, go work today in my vignette.<br>
<!-- -->He answered and said, I will not.<br>
<!-- -->But afterward, he repented and went.<br>
<!-- -->And he came to the second and said, likewise.<br>
<!-- -->And he answered and said, I go, sir, and went not.<br>
<!-- -->Whether of them, which of them, whether of them twin, which of the two did the will of his father.<br>
<!-- -->They say unto him, the first, Jesus said unto them, very I say unto you.<br>
<!-- -->Look at, they really just lead us as standing there.<br>
<!-- -->And hear what Jesus says to them.<br>
<!-- -->They answer rightly and they say, the first, the one who said he will not go and then he went.<br>
<!-- -->That one did the will of the father.<br>
<!-- -->But the other guy who said he would go but never went, didn&#x27;t do it.<br>
<!-- -->So Jesus is a great, you answered well.<br>
<!-- -->Verily I say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.<br>
<!-- -->You can imagine how this would make them mad.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m wanting to share with you not two significant parables in this temple discuss.<br>
<!-- -->this last temple discuss to very significant parables.<br>
<!-- -->So, we&#x27;re in verse 31.<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s read the game.<br>
<!-- -->No, no, no.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s right.<br>
<!-- -->Look at a lot of parts.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus said unto them, verily I say unto you, that the public ends and the harlards go into the kingdom of God before you.<br>
<!-- -->For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and he believed him not.<br>
<!-- -->But the public ends and the hollows believed him.<br>
<!-- -->And he, when he had seen it, repented not afterwards, that he might believe him.<br>
<!-- -->Wow.</p>
<p>Remember, I told you from,<br>
<!-- -->Chapter 19, we followed the journey.<br>
<!-- -->Okay?<br>
<!-- -->We followed the journey.<br>
<!-- -->And we come to His last attempt to reach the leaders and the nation.<br>
<!-- -->We find Him now in the temple, He&#x27;s rejected.<br>
<!-- -->Now He&#x27;s preaching fire to them.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;ll never forget what a crusade many, many years ago.<br>
<!-- -->And I had a friend of mine to speak.<br>
<!-- -->And after he preached such a powerful message on the love of God, oh, how he preached the love of God that night.<br>
<!-- -->And now Jesus came to die.<br>
<!-- -->How God loved sinners.<br>
<!-- -->And this place was thick with idolatry.<br>
<!-- -->After preaching that night, he gave an order call.<br>
<!-- -->Nobody, not even a child, lived at a hand for salvation.<br>
<!-- -->Nobody, no hand, will come up.<br>
<!-- -->I was stunned.<br>
<!-- -->I was watching.</p>
<p>Oh, he pleaded and spoke and explained, and no one raised their hand.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, he tried to come forward.<br>
<!-- -->Nobody.<br>
<!-- -->The space was neat.<br>
<!-- -->No one&#x27;s coming forward.<br>
<!-- -->They&#x27;re looking like this.<br>
<!-- -->Would you give your heart to Christ today for your salvation?<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s dressed it.<br>
<!-- -->No one, not a single person.<br>
<!-- -->I couldn&#x27;t believe what was happening.<br>
<!-- -->I was speaking in tongues, I&#x27;m pissing the ground there, just somewhere around the stage.<br>
<!-- -->We had a large stage constructed there.<br>
<!-- -->So I couldn&#x27;t believe what was going on.<br>
<!-- -->I was waiting, speaking in tongues.<br>
<!-- -->Then some I said, Lord Jesus, I think I need to let them have it.<br>
<!-- -->So I came up the platform and I took the microphone.</p>
<p>And I began to preach on Sodom and Gomorrah, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the flood of Noah.<br>
<!-- -->Boy, I preach judgment that day from one judgment to the other.<br>
<!-- -->Judgment only, I only discuss judgment.<br>
<!-- -->all the judgments of God.<br>
<!-- -->And I said, and now, all of you, you are ready for judgment.<br>
<!-- -->If you want salvation today, before I could finish the words, the whole crowd sawed to the front.<br>
<!-- -->Everybody rushed to the front.<br>
<!-- -->And I said, no, no, no, no.<br>
<!-- -->I was trying to stop because I&#x27;d never seen where everybody came forward either.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;d never seen where nobody came out and I&#x27;d never seen where everybody came.<br>
<!-- -->They all rushed to the front.</p>
<p>So I think that&#x27;s what Jesus is doing here.<br>
<!-- -->He had healed them.<br>
<!-- -->He had blessed them.<br>
<!-- -->He had taught their children.<br>
<!-- -->He had blessed their children.<br>
<!-- -->He had done everything.<br>
<!-- -->And they would not listen.<br>
<!-- -->So now he starts explaining to them the judgments of God.<br>
<!-- -->Because they had to know what the love of God was saving them from.</p>
<p>So God is love, but he&#x27;s demonstrating his love toward us for a reason.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s saving us from something.</p>
<p>So he wants us to look toward him.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, so imagine that, what he just told him now, so powerful, he goes to the next one, next verse.<br>
<!-- -->Here another parable, Jesus said, after the first one, if that didn&#x27;t get the attention, it says he had the next one.<br>
<!-- -->And it&#x27;s from now, you really have to listen to this next one, because it&#x27;s short, but I&#x27;m gonna be going into something, errors, that&#x27;ll help you understand why we&#x27;re here in the first place.<br>
<!-- -->Here another parable, there was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard and headed it round about and dig the winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husband men and went into a far country.<br>
<!-- -->And when the time of the fruit year, he sent his servants to the husband mane that they might receive the fruits of it.<br>
<!-- -->And the husband man took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.<br>
<!-- -->Again, he sent other servants more than the first, and they did unto them likewise.<br>
<!-- -->But last of all, he sent unto them his son, saying, there will reverence my son.<br>
<!-- -->But when the husband men saw the son, they said among themselves, this is the heir.<br>
<!-- -->Come, let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance.<br>
<!-- -->And they cut him the son of the owner of the vignette.<br>
<!-- -->They cut him and cast him out of the vignette and slew him.<br>
<!-- -->When the Lord therefore of the vignette comets, what will he do unto those husband men?<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s asking them.<br>
<!-- -->They said unto him, he will miserably.<br>
<!-- -->Even they were offended by the whole thing.<br>
<!-- -->They said he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard onto other husband men, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.<br>
<!-- -->Watch what Jesus says.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus said unto them, did he never read in the Scriptures the stone which the builders rejected?<br>
<!-- -->The same has become the head of the corner.<br>
<!-- -->This is the Lord&#x27;s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.<br>
<!-- -->He is leading them to one of the Masonic Psalms.<br>
<!-- -->This is amazing.<br>
<!-- -->He says, didn&#x27;t you read in the scriptures?<br>
<!-- -->Didn&#x27;t you read in the scriptures?<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re gonna read where he was courting from.<br>
<!-- -->But let&#x27;s finish.<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s finish.<br>
<!-- -->Look at the next verse.<br>
<!-- -->Therefore I say unto you, the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation, bringing forth the fruits thereof.<br>
<!-- -->This is huge.<br>
<!-- -->I want to remind you that this was no mere preacher.<br>
<!-- -->This is Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->This is God in flesh telling them what&#x27;s going to happen.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s pronouncing judgment.<br>
<!-- -->He brings finality to it.<br>
<!-- -->Says the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruit thereof.<br>
<!-- -->These are huge, huge issues.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, now let&#x27;s see.<br>
<!-- -->We go to what he was quoting when he says, didn&#x27;t you ever read the scriptures?<br>
<!-- -->So Jesus is authenticating these writings that we&#x27;re going to look at now, Psalm 118.<br>
<!-- -->We begin from verse 19, all the way to verse 23.<br>
<!-- -->Open to meet the gates of righteousness, I will go into them and I will praise the Lord.<br>
<!-- -->This gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter.<br>
<!-- -->I will praise thee, for thou hast heard me, and that become my salvation.<br>
<!-- -->The stone which the build has refused, has become the headstone of the corner.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s the place Jesus quoted.<br>
<!-- -->This is the Lord&#x27;s doing.<br>
<!-- -->It is marvelous in our eyes.<br>
<!-- -->Ha, next.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus quoted all that to them.<br>
<!-- -->This is the day which the Lord had made.<br>
<!-- -->We will rejoice and be glad in it.<br>
<!-- -->This is very significant and I want to begin to explain to you what this means because he brings the church into focus right here when he says to them, the kingdom of God shall be taken away from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruit thereof.<br>
<!-- -->Remember what the Bible tells us, he are a chosen generation.<br>
<!-- -->a royal priesthood, a holy nation, the Church of Jesus Christ is known as a nation, a holy nation that brings forth the fruits of the kingdom of God.<br>
<!-- -->And while you&#x27;re thinking about that, I want to explain this to you.<br>
<!-- -->We go back again to read that 19th verse, and I went to the market of Psalm 118.<br>
<!-- -->Look at that 19th verse.</p>
<p>Psalm 118 verse 19, open to me the gates of righteousness.<br>
<!-- -->Notice, open to me the gates of righteousness.<br>
<!-- -->I will go into them and I will praise the Lord.<br>
<!-- -->This gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter.<br>
<!-- -->What, these are prophetic words.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus just let us know from quoting the next verse and the next verse,<br>
<!-- -->It was prophetic, all right?<br>
<!-- -->Okay.<br>
<!-- -->Now, the righteous entered the gates in Christ after His resurrection.<br>
<!-- -->I want to show you this.<br>
<!-- -->Acts 13, verse 32.<br>
<!-- -->And we declare unto you the preaching, all right?<br>
<!-- -->preaching, preaching the gospel here.<br>
<!-- -->We declare unto you, glad titans, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers.<br>
<!-- -->God had fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he had raised up Jesus again, as it is also written in the second Psalm.<br>
<!-- -->You remember Psalm two, thou at my son this day have I begotten thee?<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what he was talking about.<br>
<!-- -->This is the day that the Lord had made, and we will rejoice and be glad in it.<br>
<!-- -->That was the 24th verse of that chapter 118 where we were reading.<br>
<!-- -->See, this is the day which the Lord had made.<br>
<!-- -->This is the day.<br>
<!-- -->This is the day.<br>
<!-- -->What day was it?<br>
<!-- -->The day that the gates were open to the righteous.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->This gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, now you go to St.<br>
<!-- -->John&#x27;s Gospel.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re gonna look at a little bit of a story here because something happened on that day.<br>
<!-- -->And in St.<br>
<!-- -->John&#x27;s Gospel chapter 20 verse 17, right after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, you remember the story.<br>
<!-- -->He had been buried, he had been crucified and buried.<br>
<!-- -->And the third day he comes out of the grave and look, we&#x27;re told how that Mary<br>
<!-- -->saw Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->She had thought it was the gardener when she was looking for the body of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->She was looking around.<br>
<!-- -->She comes back to the cave where he had been laid and suddenly she finds two men inside.<br>
<!-- -->But the Bible tells us the men were angels.<br>
<!-- -->She doesn&#x27;t particularly give them much attention.<br>
<!-- -->They say to her, woman, why are you crying?<br>
<!-- -->She said, because they&#x27;ve taken away my lord, and I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;ve taken in two.<br>
<!-- -->If you know where he is, tell me I&#x27;ll go get his body from there.<br>
<!-- -->Then she walks out.<br>
<!-- -->She&#x27;s not even moved by the strange thing that these two men were inside the cave, and they weren&#x27;t there the first time.<br>
<!-- -->So she looks out.<br>
<!-- -->She sees another man outside.<br>
<!-- -->She supposes it&#x27;s the gardener.<br>
<!-- -->She&#x27;s still crying.<br>
<!-- -->She&#x27;s still crying.<br>
<!-- -->Because they had wanted to come do something to the body to complete the embalming.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus is not there anymore.<br>
<!-- -->The body is not there.<br>
<!-- -->So why, what happened?<br>
<!-- -->So she&#x27;s crying.<br>
<!-- -->And she sees the one she supposes as a gardener.<br>
<!-- -->She turns away from him.<br>
<!-- -->And he says, Mary, she recognizes that voice.<br>
<!-- -->She&#x27;s heard it many times before.<br>
<!-- -->Rabbani, so she runs to a Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->And Jesus says, don&#x27;t touch me yet.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t touch me.<br>
<!-- -->Why?<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;ve not yet ascended to my father.<br>
<!-- -->I like this.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;ve not yet ascended to my Father.<br>
<!-- -->But look at that verse 17.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus said, touch me now for I am not yet ascended to my Father, but go to my brethren.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, not go to my disciples.<br>
<!-- -->Go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father,<br>
<!-- -->and your father.<br>
<!-- -->I ascend.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what I want you to see.<br>
<!-- -->Tell them I ascend to my father and your father, to my god and your god.<br>
<!-- -->Go tell them and oh boy, what joy.<br>
<!-- -->Oh boy, you gotta read, you gotta read those portions of the Bible for yourself.<br>
<!-- -->Nobody can give you the story like you will see when you read it yourself.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;ve read those portions so many times.</p>
<p>some of the most touching things in the Word of God.<br>
<!-- -->The picture&#x27;s there.<br>
<!-- -->And you can get the best picture when you read the synoptic gospels, all three of them, along with John.<br>
<!-- -->Then you get the best understanding.<br>
<!-- -->If you take just one of them, you don&#x27;t get it all.<br>
<!-- -->You need to read all of them.<br>
<!-- -->Then you can actually get all the points.<br>
<!-- -->What led to what?<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s amazing, amazing, very touching story.<br>
<!-- -->It says, I ascend onto my father.<br>
<!-- -->So Jesus is getting ready here as the Lord high priest.<br>
<!-- -->This is why he says to Mary, don&#x27;t touch me.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;ve not ascended to my father because when the high priest was going into the most holy place, you didn&#x27;t touch him.<br>
<!-- -->Hebrews chapter nine.<br>
<!-- -->From verse 11.<br>
<!-- -->But Christ being common high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say not of this building, neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood.<br>
<!-- -->He ate in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.<br>
<!-- -->Blessed be God.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->Amen.<br>
<!-- -->So there&#x27;s where he ascends.<br>
<!-- -->with his blood.</p>
<p>So, remember this now.<br>
<!-- -->We go to another Psalm, Psalm 24 from verse seven.<br>
<!-- -->Lift up your heads, all your gates, and be lifted up, or be lifted up.<br>
<!-- -->He everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in.<br>
<!-- -->Who is this King of glory?<br>
<!-- -->This is the Lord High Priest.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, I just noticed the time.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m gonna have to take some extra time today, all right?<br>
<!-- -->Because we&#x27;re finishing the day.<br>
<!-- -->So extra time, all right?<br>
<!-- -->Extra time.<br>
<!-- -->Because we&#x27;re so far from where I&#x27;m going.<br>
<!-- -->So I&#x27;ve not even made a point.<br>
<!-- -->Extra time.<br>
<!-- -->Who is this king of glory?<br>
<!-- -->I like this.<br>
<!-- -->The Lord strong and mighty.<br>
<!-- -->So he&#x27;s coming from the battle.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s just accomplished something in hell.<br>
<!-- -->Remember when Jesus died and he was buried, the Bible tells us his body was in the grave, but Jesus in spirit went to hell.<br>
<!-- -->He descended to hell.</p>
<p>Do you know that Catholic creed?<br>
<!-- -->He used to be a Catholic.<br>
<!-- -->No, you are still a Catholic, but not a Roman one.<br>
<!-- -->Because I always tell people, I&#x27;m a Catholic, but not a Roman Catholic.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m a Catholic, but not a Roman one.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m just not a Roman one, but quite a Catholic.</p>
<p>He descended to heaven.<br>
<!-- -->The third day he rose again from the dead.<br>
<!-- -->He ascended to heaven.<br>
<!-- -->See, so that&#x27;s the part that&#x27;s happening right now.<br>
<!-- -->So we&#x27;re reading, we&#x27;re reading Matthew 24.<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s take it again.<br>
<!-- -->Verse seven.</p>
<p>Lift up your heads, oh, he gates.<br>
<!-- -->What gates are this?<br>
<!-- -->Some have said in the past, there was the gates of hell that&#x27;s coming out of hell.<br>
<!-- -->I said, no, no, no, read it well.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;d see.<br>
<!-- -->Lift up your heads, oh, he gates, and be a lift up, he everlasting doors.<br>
<!-- -->The gates of hell cannot be called everlasting doors.<br>
<!-- -->And the king of glory shall come in.<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t say shall, go out.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;s coming in, glory to God.<br>
<!-- -->Who is the king of glory is the voice that&#x27;s coming out?<br>
<!-- -->The Lord&#x27;s strong and mighty.<br>
<!-- -->The Lord mighty in battle.<br>
<!-- -->Lift up your heads, oh, he gates.<br>
<!-- -->Even lift them up, he everlasting doors, and the king of glory shall come in.<br>
<!-- -->Who is the king of glory?<br>
<!-- -->The Lord of hosts, He is the king of glory.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->This is wonderful.<br>
<!-- -->Now, now that you&#x27;re catching this picture, I want to take you to Isaiah chapter 26 verse two.<br>
<!-- -->Open either gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.<br>
<!-- -->Remember what Jesus said?<br>
<!-- -->A nation that&#x27;s bringing forth.<br>
<!-- -->the fruits of the kingdom.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s the nation that keeps the truth.<br>
<!-- -->So Isaiah is speaking about the church.<br>
<!-- -->He doesn&#x27;t even know what he&#x27;s talking about.<br>
<!-- -->Look at it.<br>
<!-- -->Opening the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in these gates of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter.<br>
<!-- -->Remember?<br>
<!-- -->Good.<br>
<!-- -->Why is this so important?<br>
<!-- -->Because of some of the things.<br>
<!-- -->So, let&#x27;s move to verse 20.<br>
<!-- -->Now, to understand verse 20, I&#x27;m gonna have to take you, well, you get it, you&#x27;re already getting it.<br>
<!-- -->Come, my people!<br>
<!-- -->Enter thou, lei cros govra, act algace.<br>
<!-- -->Look at this!<br>
<!-- -->Come, my people!<br>
<!-- -->Enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee.<br>
<!-- -->Hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpassed.<br>
<!-- -->That means there&#x27;s a transition, there&#x27;s a period of transition.<br>
<!-- -->So he says, come, my people.<br>
<!-- -->Intervow into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee, hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpassed.<br>
<!-- -->Until the indignation be passed.<br>
<!-- -->Really?<br>
<!-- -->So who are these people?<br>
<!-- -->Number one.<br>
<!-- -->Some have thought it was Israel, and I say, no, it&#x27;s not Israel.<br>
<!-- -->Why?<br>
<!-- -->Because when that indignation comes, they don&#x27;t hide in their chambers.<br>
<!-- -->They run to the wilderness of mob, the mountains of mob.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s Jordan today.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s where they go.<br>
<!-- -->So they go to a foreign land.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s not their chambers.</p>
<p>Wow.<br>
<!-- -->So put it, let the scripture there, look at that.<br>
<!-- -->Shut thy doors about thee, hide thyself as it were, for a little moment until the indignation you have a past.<br>
<!-- -->In Revelation chapter six,<br>
<!-- -->Chapter 12, verse six.<br>
<!-- -->I want you to follow the scriptures now.<br>
<!-- -->Revelation chapter 12, verse six.<br>
<!-- -->And the woman fled, I told you who the woman was, that&#x27;s Israel.<br>
<!-- -->All right, fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared of God, but they should feed her there, 1,203 score days.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s 1,260 days.<br>
<!-- -->All right, go to verse 14.</p>
<p>And to the woman, we&#x27;re given two wings of a great eagle, but she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she&#x27;s nourished for a time and times and half a time.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s the same period just given to us as 1,260 days from the face of the Supperance that was out to destroy her.<br>
<!-- -->Now, we know we&#x27;re going to come back to this place, but let&#x27;s read Matthew 24.<br>
<!-- -->All right, so that&#x27;s the scripture there.<br>
<!-- -->When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, who&#x27;s so read it, let him understand, then let them which be into the flee into the mountains.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s the same place called the wilderness of Moab, so then the mountains of Moab.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, so<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s the same thing that&#x27;s in Mark 1314.<br>
<!-- -->You don&#x27;t have to do this same thing.<br>
<!-- -->Now, go back to Revelation chapter 12 and we will read Father.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re gonna read from that 14th verse all the way to verse 17.<br>
<!-- -->And to the woman who had given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, which is equal to 1,260 days, which is equal to what?<br>
<!-- -->Three and a half years, which is equal to 42 months.<br>
<!-- -->We talked about that yesterday.<br>
<!-- -->All right, verse 15.<br>
<!-- -->And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.<br>
<!-- -->And the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.<br>
<!-- -->And the dragon was rust with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seat.<br>
<!-- -->So there are some who are still<br>
<!-- -->elsewhere the remnant of a seed that didn&#x27;t flee to the mountains so there&#x27;s persecution now for every Jew and along with the Jews anybody who identifies what we&#x27;re going to read now watch<br>
<!-- -->And the dragon was wrought now, the dragon is the devil, Satan.<br>
<!-- -->The dragon was wrought with the women and went to make war with the remnant of a seed, which keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what I want you to see.<br>
<!-- -->He gets mad and declares war on God&#x27;s people, anyone who keeps the testimony of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->Okay.<br>
<!-- -->Now,<br>
<!-- -->With all of this, where is the church?<br>
<!-- -->I just, I just showed you, I just showed you.<br>
<!-- -->Now let&#x27;s read again Isaiah chapter 26 and verse number 20.<br>
<!-- -->And I&#x27;ll take you to Revelation.<br>
<!-- -->Come my people, enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee.<br>
<!-- -->Hype thyself.<br>
<!-- -->Now, when you see doors or door, they mean the same thing.<br>
<!-- -->Except when you&#x27;re told that there are other doors.<br>
<!-- -->For example, if you have a two-lift door, there are doors.<br>
<!-- -->And it&#x27;s all a door.<br>
<!-- -->Like we saw gates, the gates of righteousness.<br>
<!-- -->And the next verse we call it gate.<br>
<!-- -->So it&#x27;s a gate and it could be called gates.<br>
<!-- -->All right?<br>
<!-- -->Now, reason for that, just in case you say, ah, there&#x27;s the door and then doors.<br>
<!-- -->Same thing, except when the context shows, it&#x27;s not.<br>
<!-- -->So he says, come my people, enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee.<br>
<!-- -->Hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpassed.<br>
<!-- -->The indignation.<br>
<!-- -->When you read the Bible, he tells us, you know, we&#x27;ve been focusing on these seven years.<br>
<!-- -->And I told you the seven years have a plan.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s a plan.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s a sign for us in describing the times.<br>
<!-- -->All right?<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s a sign for us.<br>
<!-- -->He gives us as a sign.<br>
<!-- -->than your prophecy.<br>
<!-- -->So we&#x27;re able to calculate when it starts, all the way to Christ, so that we can tell, even from the Scripture, from the prophets, do we have the right man?<br>
<!-- -->The timing is right.<br>
<!-- -->Everything is accurate.<br>
<!-- -->But then he shows us something really important, something really important.<br>
<!-- -->And I wanna take you to Revelation chapter four.<br>
<!-- -->Notice here, he says, come my people, enter into your chambers, shut the door, who prepared the chambers?<br>
<!-- -->He did, he prepared for them.<br>
<!-- -->And it brings them in.<br>
<!-- -->So in the book of Revelation, when you read chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3, you notice we dealt with those ones together after we dealt from chapter 4 to chapter 22.<br>
<!-- -->All right.<br>
<!-- -->So we&#x27;re in chapter 4 verse 1.<br>
<!-- -->It opens up in an interesting way.<br>
<!-- -->After these, after these, all those things with the churches.<br>
<!-- -->and Jesus rebuke of the churches in correction of the churches and excitation to the churches.<br>
<!-- -->The defining chapters one, chapters, particularly in two and three.<br>
<!-- -->After these, I looked and behold, a door was opened in heaven.<br>
<!-- -->It says, he looked in the vision, a door is opened in heaven.<br>
<!-- -->For what?</p>
<p>Oh, are you following this?<br>
<!-- -->The doors opened in heaven.<br>
<!-- -->The first voice which I heard was at the way of a trumpet talking with me and which said, come up, Hida, and I will show the things which must be hereafter, hereafter, hereafter, afterwards, after the churches, after their work on earth.<br>
<!-- -->So suddenly we find they are in heaven.<br>
<!-- -->The door is open.<br>
<!-- -->He asks them to come in by the Prophet, come.<br>
<!-- -->He says, so that you will not be in the indignation and protecting you from the indignation.<br>
<!-- -->He says, come, stay here for a while.<br>
<!-- -->Stay here for a little while until the indignation is passed, until the wrath upon this world is passed.<br>
<!-- -->This is the rapture of the church.<br>
<!-- -->She&#x27;s a very...<br>
<!-- -->The church has got away.<br>
<!-- -->Heaven has an open door at that moment.<br>
<!-- -->Now, he says, until the indignation is passed.<br>
<!-- -->Until the indignation is passed.<br>
<!-- -->Suddenly we find chapter one, chapter five, verse one.<br>
<!-- -->Watch what happens.<br>
<!-- -->Because in chapter four,<br>
<!-- -->He gives us a description.<br>
<!-- -->And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne, a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals, those chakarabas.<br>
<!-- -->Chapter five opens with the sealed book in the hands of the one on the man sitting on the throne.<br>
<!-- -->What happens next?<br>
<!-- -->They worship Him, and then we go to chapter six, and chapter six opens immediately, and terrible things begin.<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s see.<br>
<!-- -->To go to chapter six, let me first take you again to Daniel chapter nine, verse 26 and verse 27.<br>
<!-- -->And after three score in two weeks, shall Masai Abikarov, but not for himself and the people of the Prings that shall come.<br>
<!-- -->The people of the Prings that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.<br>
<!-- -->And the ends thereof shall be with a flood.<br>
<!-- -->And onto the end of the war, desolitions are determined.<br>
<!-- -->Now, he tells us what&#x27;s going to happen.<br>
<!-- -->And he says, and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s seven years.<br>
<!-- -->Remember that, seven years.<br>
<!-- -->So here&#x27;s the sign.<br>
<!-- -->It is the signing of this treaty that is determined to be seven years.<br>
<!-- -->And in the midst, in the middle of the week, he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.<br>
<!-- -->So he gives us again another date, something we&#x27;re going to know.<br>
<!-- -->And for the overspreading of the abominations, he shall make it desolate even until the consummation, that means the end.<br>
<!-- -->the close of it, and that determine shall be poured upon the desolate, or like some would say, the desolato.<br>
<!-- -->All right.<br>
<!-- -->Now, go to chapter 12, book of Daniel, chapter 12, and we read from verse number 11.<br>
<!-- -->From the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, remember, he says, in the midst of it, in the middle of it, he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.<br>
<!-- -->From the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that may get desolate set up, there shall be 1,290 days.<br>
<!-- -->What does that mean?<br>
<!-- -->Right from the proclamation, you have 30 days before the law, before the act on it.<br>
<!-- -->In 30 days before the time, he makes the announcements.<br>
<!-- -->He declares the place, he declares sacrifices, seized, the Levitical priesthood suspended.<br>
<!-- -->All of that, in fact, abrogated.<br>
<!-- -->And then, that is 30 days before, one month before.<br>
<!-- -->Now, I need to get one of those pages I showed you yesterday.</p>
<p>I began to tell you about the church age being 2000 years.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you can see it here.<br>
<!-- -->Daniel chapter 11, well, it&#x27;s chapter 12.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m reading to you Daniel chapter 12.<br>
<!-- -->I said, from the proclamation to end sacrifices and the abomination of desolation set up is 1,290 days.<br>
<!-- -->Daniel chapter 12 from verse 11 to 13.<br>
<!-- -->All right.<br>
<!-- -->Now that is important because you haven&#x27;t observed any 1,290 days since.<br>
<!-- -->Okay.<br>
<!-- -->So 30 days.</p>
<p>before the enactment, something happens.<br>
<!-- -->From those 30 days, you have 1,260 days.<br>
<!-- -->After that, you have another 45-day period.<br>
<!-- -->During the 45 days, the angels go gathering all the Jews from everywhere.<br>
<!-- -->They have 45 days within which they must be in Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->from all over the world, they gather.<br>
<!-- -->So it brings us to 1,335 days.<br>
<!-- -->So you have the first 30 days, then the 1,260 days, and then a 45-day period.<br>
<!-- -->At the end of that, the millennium starts.</p>
<p>The millennium starts right after that.<br>
<!-- -->Praise God.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, so, but I was reading something to you before we came here.<br>
<!-- -->What was that scripture?<br>
<!-- -->I was reading something to you in the book of Revelation chapter 6 from verse 1, because I want to show you, he has allowed us to see something very important.<br>
<!-- -->He let us see from the signing of the treaty.<br>
<!-- -->He says, he&#x27;s a treaty for seven years.<br>
<!-- -->Then in the middle, there&#x27;s a proclamation.<br>
<!-- -->Okay?<br>
<!-- -->So about 30 days before that middle is where you actually have the announcement.<br>
<!-- -->Then they take effect.<br>
<!-- -->Because the armies move in.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;ll show you some of this in the Bible now.<br>
<!-- -->Revelation chapter six, verse one.<br>
<!-- -->And I saw when the lamp opened one of the seers.<br>
<!-- -->And I heard as it were the first, the noise of thunder.<br>
<!-- -->One of the four beasts saying, come and see.<br>
<!-- -->And I saw and behold a white horse.<br>
<!-- -->Remember the horses?<br>
<!-- -->Remember the seers?<br>
<!-- -->I saw a white horse and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went for conquering and to conquer and I told you this is the end of Christ.<br>
<!-- -->When is he revealed at the beginning of the seven year period?<br>
<!-- -->So the first horse is a white horse pretending to be the Christ but it&#x27;s not the Christ.<br>
<!-- -->Then you have the next one.</p>
<p>And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, come and see.<br>
<!-- -->And they went out another horse that was red.<br>
<!-- -->And power was given to him that sat there on to take peace from the earth.<br>
<!-- -->And that they should kill one another, and that was given unto him a great sword.<br>
<!-- -->Listen, this is happening in the first three and a half years.<br>
<!-- -->The second three and a half years, why it is called a great tribulation, is because the focus is on Israel.<br>
<!-- -->The focus is on Israel.<br>
<!-- -->So that part of the tribulation is not global.<br>
<!-- -->The global trouble already began from the beginning of the seven-year period.<br>
<!-- -->It gets worse for Israel from the second half of the seven-year period.<br>
<!-- -->So for three and a half years from the middle, it&#x27;s focused on Israel because the Antichrist moves his headquarters to Israel.<br>
<!-- -->And there&#x27;s trouble, and all nations, there&#x27;s so much chaos, so much trouble.<br>
<!-- -->But the first thing and a half years will be a terrible time for the world.<br>
<!-- -->I want you to understand, at that time, the Antichrist is already known, but he&#x27;s not acting like he&#x27;s Antichrist, so they&#x27;re not seeing him as Antichrist, but he&#x27;s Antichrist, because his policies will be Antichrist, his message will be Antichrist.<br>
<!-- -->All the laws and regulations will be anti-Christ, but the people will be deceived.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s coming on a white horse.<br>
<!-- -->Go back, go back to verse one.<br>
<!-- -->I want you to see it again.<br>
<!-- -->Well, that was in verse two, right?<br>
<!-- -->Verse two.<br>
<!-- -->And I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and the crown was given unto him.<br>
<!-- -->It was given unto him.<br>
<!-- -->We read all of that before.<br>
<!-- -->And it went for conquering and to conquer.<br>
<!-- -->So the end of Christ is declared from the beginning of the 70th period.<br>
<!-- -->Then we&#x27;re in verse three.<br>
<!-- -->There went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat there and to take peace from the earth.<br>
<!-- -->No more peace in the earth.<br>
<!-- -->Meanwhile, the antichrist came as a man of peace.<br>
<!-- -->The Bible says, when they shall say peace, peace, sudden destruction comes upon them and they shall not escape.<br>
<!-- -->No peace.<br>
<!-- -->So peace is taken away from the earth.<br>
<!-- -->No peace.<br>
<!-- -->At home or abroad, no peace.<br>
<!-- -->And that they should kill one another.<br>
<!-- -->What a world would this be.<br>
<!-- -->This will be after the rapture of the church.<br>
<!-- -->So the raptures got to take place.<br>
<!-- -->And this follows immediately.<br>
<!-- -->No more peace in the world.<br>
<!-- -->Not death.<br>
<!-- -->and there was given unto him a great sword.<br>
<!-- -->And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, come and see, and I beheld Lykra Supra Calagres.<br>
<!-- -->And lower black horse.<br>
<!-- -->And he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.<br>
<!-- -->This is really terrible because with these scams, famine,<br>
<!-- -->Watch.<br>
<!-- -->He had a pair of balances in his hand.<br>
<!-- -->And I heard a voice in the midst of the phobies say, a measure of wheat for a penny.<br>
<!-- -->Inflation.<br>
<!-- -->Things become so expensive.<br>
<!-- -->And three measures of belly for a penny.<br>
<!-- -->And see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.<br>
<!-- -->Just a second to go to open this.</p>
<p>Yeah, verse four.<br>
<!-- -->No, verse six.<br>
<!-- -->It says, see that you don&#x27;t hurt the oil and the wine.<br>
<!-- -->Verse seven.<br>
<!-- -->And when he had opened the fourth seal.<br>
<!-- -->Look, already the other crisis out is having all this wicked and evil.<br>
<!-- -->Policies people are so expectant.<br>
<!-- -->They thought he would bring peace They thought he was a man of peace and now there&#x27;s no peace peace has been taken from the world and the next thing you know, there&#x27;s famine everywhere There&#x27;s death lots of killings if you thought you saw death Recently with all those murders in the streets<br>
<!-- -->You haven&#x27;t seen nothing yet.<br>
<!-- -->Watch.<br>
<!-- -->And when he had opened the fort seal, I heard the voice of the fort be say come and see.<br>
<!-- -->And I looked and behold a pale horse.</p>
<p>You know, the word translated pale here is chorus.<br>
<!-- -->Chorus is not really pink.<br>
<!-- -->Chorus means green.<br>
<!-- -->And I was doing a study on the Green New Deal.<br>
<!-- -->I wondered, how in the world did they get to name it so without knowing what the Bible said?<br>
<!-- -->The Green New Deal is going to produce exactly what this Bible says.<br>
<!-- -->And it calls it?<br>
<!-- -->And the reason, I think the reason they called it a pale horse.<br>
<!-- -->You know why?<br>
<!-- -->Because they couldn&#x27;t understand how can a horse be green.<br>
<!-- -->But the word is green.<br>
<!-- -->Every other place where you have that word is green.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s translated green.<br>
<!-- -->So to help your imagination is a pale horse.<br>
<!-- -->But it&#x27;s a green horse for the green new deal.<br>
<!-- -->So a lot of people are thinking just the same way they welcome the white horse.<br>
<!-- -->They&#x27;re going to welcome the green horse.<br>
<!-- -->Because, oh, a lot of people are going to have jobs.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, it&#x27;s going to open up this.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, it&#x27;s going to help this.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah.<br>
<!-- -->Most of those who are championing the course for the green new deal never read the document.<br>
<!-- -->Try and read.<br>
<!-- -->Try and read.<br>
<!-- -->Most of them never read it.<br>
<!-- -->Some are demonstrating they want it, they want it.<br>
<!-- -->It looks nice if you don&#x27;t know the Bible.<br>
<!-- -->But even those who understand the world as it is, and what the future should be, can easily tell you there&#x27;s a lot wrong with it.<br>
<!-- -->And it&#x27;s going to lead to hyperinflation,<br>
<!-- -->joblessness that they are thinking they&#x27;re going to create new jobs because you know their new systems and so on, no way.<br>
<!-- -->Things are going to go down, down, down.<br>
<!-- -->And so God already gave us a sign by telling us there&#x27;s a green horse, a green horse.<br>
<!-- -->That means the Green New Deal, it&#x27;s actually a transportation.<br>
<!-- -->You get it now.<br>
<!-- -->The bandwagon.<br>
<!-- -->The Green New Deal bandwagon.<br>
<!-- -->So they&#x27;re going on it.<br>
<!-- -->Yeah, yeah, yeah, it&#x27;s a green.<br>
<!-- -->Watch, let&#x27;s see what happens.<br>
<!-- -->And I looked and behold, a green horse.<br>
<!-- -->And his name that sat on him was Death.<br>
<!-- -->The name of the rider is called Death.<br>
<!-- -->And hell followed with him.</p>
<p>And power was given unto them over the fought path of the earth.<br>
<!-- -->One quarter of the earth followed this deal.</p>
<p>Go to Europe.<br>
<!-- -->They&#x27;re championing the course.<br>
<!-- -->They want it in Europe.<br>
<!-- -->In fact, let me tell you this.<br>
<!-- -->What they&#x27;re waiting for in most of the industrialized nations, what they&#x27;re waiting for is November 3rd.<br>
<!-- -->They&#x27;re waiting for the elections.<br>
<!-- -->They&#x27;re just waiting.<br>
<!-- -->If Trump doesn&#x27;t win, they&#x27;re going to be shouting loud in all those nations, who are the Green New Deal.<br>
<!-- -->is being prepared and endorsed because they want it.<br>
<!-- -->Why do they want it?<br>
<!-- -->They don&#x27;t even know what is inside.<br>
<!-- -->They don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s there.</p>
<p>All right.<br>
<!-- -->Watch, and hell followed with him.<br>
<!-- -->And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.<br>
<!-- -->That part of it is very interesting.<br>
<!-- -->The reason being because part of that deal stops<br>
<!-- -->a lot of eating of meat.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s a lot of killing that people are accused of.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;re not supposed to be doing that anymore.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re supposed to be allowing all the nice animals to have a great time.<br>
<!-- -->And God, who is wise, he knows what animals can do.</p>
<p>So if you ever had disease come out of animals like you never thought possible, the one from one cannot be compared.<br>
<!-- -->Now look at these, these seers.<br>
<!-- -->All of this would take place in the first three and a half years.<br>
<!-- -->You don&#x27;t want to be here.<br>
<!-- -->You don&#x27;t want to be here.<br>
<!-- -->I told you, from Adam to Christ, 3,999 years, from Adam to the crucifixion and ascension of Christ, that&#x27;s crucifixion, resurrection and ascension of Christ, 4,032.</p>
<p>years from Adam.<br>
<!-- -->We are 2,020 years.<br>
<!-- -->Right now, 2,020 years from</p>
<p>They&#x27;re counting their own AD is from one.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s how they count it.<br>
<!-- -->I want you to think.<br>
<!-- -->30 AD, which is what they&#x27;re calling 30 CE, meaning of the common error.<br>
<!-- -->30 AD.<br>
<!-- -->is where the church started from.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s the same thing as year 4,032 from Adam.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re given two days, 2,000 years.<br>
<!-- -->That takes you all the way</p>
<p>to 20, not a lot of people like to hear this part of it, but how true it is.<br>
<!-- -->2030, maximum time limit.<br>
<!-- -->I told you, if you look at 2030, the prophecies we saw we do seven years,<br>
<!-- -->If we were given up to 2030 as the 2000 from 30 CE or 30 AD, the seven years added to that will bring you to 2037.<br>
<!-- -->All of this falls within the fifth regeneration of 1948 to 2048.<br>
<!-- -->It falls within just like the Bible said.</p>
<p>It falls within.<br>
<!-- -->Now, here&#x27;s a little bit of interesting information.<br>
<!-- -->In 2018, 70 years, all right, from 1948, Jerusalem again became the official capital of the state of Israel.<br>
<!-- -->Do you remember that?<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s quite significant.<br>
<!-- -->Now, I said the significance of 70s.<br>
<!-- -->70 years,<br>
<!-- -->were to be accomplished in the desolitions of Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->They were carried to Babylon.<br>
<!-- -->You remember that?<br>
<!-- -->Until the Persians set them free.<br>
<!-- -->70 weeks of years in the desolitions of the house of God, Israel without a king, and we read that yesterday, Hosea chapter three, they&#x27;re gonna be without a king.<br>
<!-- -->70 years in the desolitions, and<br>
<!-- -->We come here right before our eyes.<br>
<!-- -->They weren&#x27;t allowed to have the capital in Jerusalem until the Trump Proclamation of 2018.<br>
<!-- -->They could not.<br>
<!-- -->Several presidents promised it, but they could not.<br>
<!-- -->Why couldn&#x27;t they?<br>
<!-- -->Because it was not time.<br>
<!-- -->At the appointed time, he brought in the men that would make it happen, and it happened.<br>
<!-- -->So here we are in the year 2020.<br>
<!-- -->Here&#x27;s where we are on the timeline.<br>
<!-- -->In another five years, the world will be in what 2025?<br>
<!-- -->After that, it&#x27;ll be what 2030?<br>
<!-- -->After that, it&#x27;ll be 2035.<br>
<!-- -->After that, 2040.<br>
<!-- -->And after that, 2045.<br>
<!-- -->Okay.<br>
<!-- -->But here is what we have.</p>
<p>2020 is where we are right now.<br>
<!-- -->We have this 2000 years supposed to be coming all the way, 2000 years.<br>
<!-- -->It ends here, 2030.<br>
<!-- -->The first three and a half years, there&#x27;s trouble in the world, first three and a half years.<br>
<!-- -->All right, this is three and a half.<br>
<!-- -->The second three and a half, it goes real red.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, for Israel.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s the whole seven-year period.<br>
<!-- -->Okay, but if you notice, this is not looking to scale, so be careful.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re just trying to emphasize something on the upper design.<br>
<!-- -->What we&#x27;re trying to say there is this point, this point ends here.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to say.<br>
<!-- -->This is not on top of this.<br>
<!-- -->This point is this point.<br>
<!-- -->All right?<br>
<!-- -->Now, suppose, suppose, and I don&#x27;t think so, suppose the first three and a half years started inside the 2000 years.<br>
<!-- -->I see no reason why, because in the scripture, he says, after two days, he will revive us.<br>
<!-- -->The revival<br>
<!-- -->You know the 144,000 will be preaching during this period.<br>
<!-- -->And they get out.<br>
<!-- -->They get out as we enter this second, three and a half.<br>
<!-- -->This is interesting what happens.<br>
<!-- -->If the first three and a half would be a part of the 2000, which I don&#x27;t think, the reason I don&#x27;t think is all those things I just told you, they&#x27;re supposed to happen after the rapture, because the indignation concerns not only Israel, but other nations.<br>
<!-- -->It concerns other nations, not just Israel, not just Israel.<br>
<!-- -->But in that kind of situation, those who believe that it&#x27;s the great tribulation that Jesus is saving us from, I think they&#x27;re wrong because the focus of the great tribulation is Israel.<br>
<!-- -->But again, when you look at the words of Jesus, when you look at the words of Jesus,</p>
<p>It helps us understand that, while there&#x27;s so much trouble for each other, it doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;ll be peace, elsewhere.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s not gonna be peace elsewhere.<br>
<!-- -->So you wouldn&#x27;t like to be here, even if the war was in Israel.<br>
<!-- -->So keep in your mind that you have just a short time left.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s a maximum of 10 years and no wonder this guy who are the perpetrators of the COVID-19 have a plan for 2030 because Satan can also read, but he doesn&#x27;t believe.<br>
<!-- -->So he always thinks he can find a way out.<br>
<!-- -->So planning with those who follow him on what they&#x27;re going to do by 2030, the pain that will inflict on the world, the horrors, the kind of things they want to do to this world, some of the things that you never thought possible.<br>
<!-- -->What&#x27;s blessed be God.<br>
<!-- -->before they&#x27;re able to do those things will be out of here.<br>
<!-- -->But we&#x27;re not living like we&#x27;re escaping from those things.<br>
<!-- -->What he has told us is to use his name.<br>
<!-- -->He told us that his name has power.<br>
<!-- -->He told us to cast out devils.<br>
<!-- -->He told us.<br>
<!-- -->He told us.<br>
<!-- -->Now, when you have<br>
<!-- -->situations that are concerning in your city, in your state, in your country.<br>
<!-- -->The first thing you do is not to join everybody else that&#x27;s talking and everyone that&#x27;s complaining.<br>
<!-- -->No.<br>
<!-- -->Pray in the spirit to know God&#x27;s will and God&#x27;s plan.<br>
<!-- -->Pray in the spirit first.<br>
<!-- -->Give time and attention to what the Holy Spirit is saying.<br>
<!-- -->Otherwise, you will join the wrong crowd and you will say the wrong things and you will do the wrong things.<br>
<!-- -->So the first thing you do as a child of God, pray in the Spirit.<br>
<!-- -->If the thing is so important to you, if it is so serious to you, you will definitely then need the mind of God, the knowledge of God.<br>
<!-- -->You need to know what God is saying.<br>
<!-- -->What does he want?<br>
<!-- -->David will ask the Lord, should I pursue?<br>
<!-- -->If I pursue, will I win?<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t just get on board.<br>
<!-- -->No, he asked, should I?<br>
<!-- -->You should have that wisdom of God.<br>
<!-- -->You ask yourself, what actions should I take?<br>
<!-- -->Or should I even take any action?<br>
<!-- -->Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t want you to take any action.<br>
<!-- -->So you pray in the Spirit.<br>
<!-- -->Pray in the Spirit for direction.<br>
<!-- -->And don&#x27;t pray with your best mind and your hatred or dislike of anyone.<br>
<!-- -->No, don&#x27;t do that.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t walk in the flesh.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t go in the direction of the flesh.<br>
<!-- -->Praying the spirits.<br>
<!-- -->As you pray in the spirits, the will of the Father will be made known to you.<br>
<!-- -->It will be made known to you.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;d know it.<br>
<!-- -->He will guide you into all truths.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what Jesus said.<br>
<!-- -->The Holy Spirit will guide you into all truths.<br>
<!-- -->The wisdom of God will be revealed to you.<br>
<!-- -->and you would know what to do.<br>
<!-- -->Right now, in this time, you need the guidance of God more than ever before in your life.<br>
<!-- -->Because the pressure, the pressure, is going to increase lots of pressure that accepts you have the peace of God in you.<br>
<!-- -->There will be no peace anywhere.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s no place to go where there&#x27;s peace.<br>
<!-- -->At home, there&#x27;s no peace.<br>
<!-- -->You turn your television on, there&#x27;s no peace.<br>
<!-- -->You take the newspapers, there&#x27;s no peace.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s no peace anywhere.<br>
<!-- -->The only place of peace is in Christ.<br>
<!-- -->The only place of peace is in the Word of God.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s the only place of peace.<br>
<!-- -->And that&#x27;s what you need today.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what you need.<br>
<!-- -->And even your country, maybe you have, I mentioned just now, they have elections in the United States.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s election for the whole world, you know?<br>
<!-- -->Can you imagine?<br>
<!-- -->But most of the world, I mean, they can&#x27;t vote.<br>
<!-- -->Only those in the United States can vote.<br>
<!-- -->I mean, if you have the right to vote, then you vote.<br>
<!-- -->Of course, some of them are outside the US, but they have the right to vote.<br>
<!-- -->So they vote.<br>
<!-- -->Vote, but remember, remember, you are being given an opportunity to add your voice, add your vote to what&#x27;s going to happen in the next few years.<br>
<!-- -->If it is left to you, what decision would you make?<br>
<!-- -->If it is left to you, would you want God&#x27;s choice?<br>
<!-- -->Or would you want to install your own choice?</p>
<p>I wonder whether you&#x27;ll be very happy with your decision.<br>
<!-- -->Now, you can be happy with your decision and you should only be happy with your decision if your decision is from God.<br>
<!-- -->As a child of God, your job is to carry out the Father&#x27;s will.<br>
<!-- -->So in whatever country, because not all the countries are able to vote.<br>
<!-- -->Some are voting, some have elections, some don&#x27;t have, some just have installations.<br>
<!-- -->But whichever the case is, I&#x27;m saying to you, true prayer, we can effect changes.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t underestimate.<br>
<!-- -->Our ability to effect changes in our world.<br>
<!-- -->Believe in Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->Believe in the power of His name.<br>
<!-- -->We can do all things to Christ.<br>
<!-- -->We really can.<br>
<!-- -->We really can.<br>
<!-- -->So pray about<br>
<!-- -->where you live, your nation, your city, and pray for the whole world.<br>
<!-- -->When he told us to pray for all men, that meant praying for all nations.<br>
<!-- -->See, all nations of men.<br>
<!-- -->So if you do that, he says, you will have peace.<br>
<!-- -->You will have peace, not just peace, but a godly life.<br>
<!-- -->And there&#x27;ll be honesty.<br>
<!-- -->You said, that can never happen in this world.<br>
<!-- -->Well, that because you never prayed as the access to pray.<br>
<!-- -->If you pray the way access to pray, your faith will rise.<br>
<!-- -->Your faith will rise to the office.<br>
<!-- -->You would know that what you&#x27;re praying about is possible.<br>
<!-- -->But if we pray wrongly, then we don&#x27;t get the right resource.<br>
<!-- -->The time is short.<br>
<!-- -->And now we should be planning how to win our word for Christ.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what we should be thinking.<br>
<!-- -->And listen, the doors of the nations will remain open for the gospel.<br>
<!-- -->Yes.<br>
<!-- -->Yes.<br>
<!-- -->And there will be no further delay.<br>
<!-- -->Let me put it clear like this, because the Lord brought us into this time by His choice, by His mighty hand.<br>
<!-- -->We are not in this place and time.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re not in this position, but as errors.<br>
<!-- -->No, no, no.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re led into this time.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;re led into this place by the orchestration and design of Almighty God.<br>
<!-- -->And He&#x27;s loaded us with His words at this time, causing us to speak as He will have us do.<br>
<!-- -->Because there will be no further delay.<br>
<!-- -->In other words, the enemy is not going to have the chance to do the kind of things that he would want to do and cost the delay.<br>
<!-- -->They have been delays in the past.<br>
<!-- -->But the words of the angel are so true for this time that there shall be no for that delay.<br>
<!-- -->So things are just going to be moving on the clock of the Spirit.<br>
<!-- -->And that&#x27;s why He told us 2020 is the year of perfection.<br>
<!-- -->Because the synchronization is taking place in 2020.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what&#x27;s been going on.<br>
<!-- -->The Lord&#x27;s been leading us to synchronize everything in the Spirit.<br>
<!-- -->And our praying, our praying, and our praying, our praying was all about bringing all these things to bear.<br>
<!-- -->The time is now.<br>
<!-- -->The time is now.<br>
<!-- -->There shall be no further delay.<br>
<!-- -->The Spirit of God is leading us and His Word is in our mouths, His thoughts are in our hearts.<br>
<!-- -->So a fool of the Holy Ghost in these days because it&#x27;s about a short time.<br>
<!-- -->Alleluia.<br>
<!-- -->Remember what I told you?<br>
<!-- -->December 1st and 2nd were going to be praying.<br>
<!-- -->In fact, we will fast on that first day, that December 1st.<br>
<!-- -->We will fast, we will fast and pray.<br>
<!-- -->And we&#x27;re going to have the prayer into the 2nd day.<br>
<!-- -->And we have many things to put in order.<br>
<!-- -->Because all the Satanic plans for end of year into January, we are issuing constellations.<br>
<!-- -->Issuing constellations.<br>
<!-- -->Issuing constellations.<br>
<!-- -->And we are not alone.<br>
<!-- -->The angels of God are with us abundantly.<br>
<!-- -->There are many.<br>
<!-- -->There are many.<br>
<!-- -->I can tell it&#x27;s like an invasion.<br>
<!-- -->an invasion.</p>
<p>So glorious things are happening, and the Church of Jesus Christ is moving forward, making progress, or getting stronger by the day, stronger by the day, by the power of the Holy Ghost, stronger by the day.<br>
<!-- -->And if you&#x27;ve been thinking like you were weak,<br>
<!-- -->be made strong in the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Be made strong.<br>
<!-- -->The Word of God is working in you now.<br>
<!-- -->The Spirit of God is ministering to you now.<br>
<!-- -->Let your desires, let your focus be on the Master, Jesus Christ, and serve Him with all of your heart.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you, Lord Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Glory to God.<br>
<!-- -->Glory to God.<br>
<!-- -->Right there where you are, I want you to pray.<br>
<!-- -->I want you to talk to the Lord by yourself and pray for the nations of the world.<br>
<!-- -->Pray for the nations right now.</p>
<p>All the nations of men,<br>
<!-- -->Pray for them everywhere.<br>
<!-- -->Pray.</p>
<p>Pray for their leaders.</p>
<p>Pray for the nations.<br>
<!-- -->We have every nation here.<br>
<!-- -->on this wall.<br>
<!-- -->Irination.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Can I just instruct you a little bit?<br>
<!-- -->Know when you remember that God loves every man, every woman, every boy, every girl, every child.<br>
<!-- -->And he sent Jesus to die for the salvation of men.<br>
<!-- -->And when you think of the fact<br>
<!-- -->The many nations that are having a difficult time right now, economically, some are devastated.<br>
<!-- -->Nations have been completely decimated.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s poverty.<br>
<!-- -->This hunger, worry.<br>
<!-- -->And I can tell you that those things are man-made.<br>
<!-- -->Because the Bible tells us that all the earth is full of the goodness of God.<br>
<!-- -->There is no nation that could not have abundance.<br>
<!-- -->None.<br>
<!-- -->most of the poverty experienced is man-made.<br>
<!-- -->Bad decisions, even in nations where they experience drought, famine, a lot of times<br>
<!-- -->People suffer not because of the famine itself, but because of bad government, bad governance, that will stop them from going to where they could get a better deal.<br>
<!-- -->For a straight help from coming in.<br>
<!-- -->So it all boils down to leadership.<br>
<!-- -->And that&#x27;s why God tells us to pray for leaders.<br>
<!-- -->Because leaders are human beings that make a lot of mistakes.<br>
<!-- -->And apart from the mistakes, there are those who are greedy and control others.<br>
<!-- -->And because of their greed, most of the world is placed in darkness and pain.<br>
<!-- -->and death.<br>
<!-- -->And they don&#x27;t give up.<br>
<!-- -->A lot of them have been doing these things for so long.<br>
<!-- -->They never thought they would ever stop.<br>
<!-- -->But I can tell you, they&#x27;re about to stop because in the Spirit we have stopped many of them.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;ve stopped them.<br>
<!-- -->And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking you to pray.<br>
<!-- -->Pray for these nations.<br>
<!-- -->And when you pray,<br>
<!-- -->pray to God that God loves them.<br>
<!-- -->You say that to the Lord because He does.<br>
<!-- -->And then pray that in the name of Jesus Christ, all those who are responsible for creating poverty for these nations.<br>
<!-- -->Some of those that create this poverty are outside those nations.<br>
<!-- -->Some of them are not necessarily in the nation where they&#x27;re creating the poverty for.<br>
<!-- -->Some of these things that don&#x27;t run outside.<br>
<!-- -->So you&#x27;ve got a few people who control what happens in many of these countries.<br>
<!-- -->And we are praying in the name of the Lord Jesus that they be cut off from these nations.<br>
<!-- -->So that these people all over the world can see the goodness of God in their nations.<br>
<!-- -->They can experience help.<br>
<!-- -->They can experience prosperity.<br>
<!-- -->They can because God has blessed them.<br>
<!-- -->And there are those stopping them.<br>
<!-- -->Pray also about those that control the financial systems of the world.<br>
<!-- -->They&#x27;ve hijacked the financial systems of the world.<br>
<!-- -->And the only people who can set the nations free.<br>
<!-- -->are God&#x27;s people that use the name of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->So use the name of Jesus Christ to free the financial systems of the world from these dubious men and women that have destroyed nations and decimated economies.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m showing you how to pray.<br>
<!-- -->what to say in your prayer as you pray.<br>
<!-- -->You decline the name of the Lord Jesus, use the name of Jesus, it&#x27;s the all-powerful name.<br>
<!-- -->And you cut off the influence of those that have been controlling the financial systems of the world.<br>
<!-- -->These are the dark horses that have been destroying the nations.<br>
<!-- -->They&#x27;re responsible for bad economic policies.<br>
<!-- -->They create unnecessary debts.<br>
<!-- -->For nations, nations that should not be owing are owing terribly.<br>
<!-- -->And all those things are passed to the individuals in their countries.<br>
<!-- -->And all men there become poor, broke, owing when they shouldn&#x27;t.<br>
<!-- -->So they are living hungry in the midst of abundance.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s not right.<br>
<!-- -->But I&#x27;ve told you, except we pray, except we pray, they&#x27;ll be miserable.<br>
<!-- -->So pray now, use those words as I&#x27;m telling you.<br>
<!-- -->Use them.<br>
<!-- -->Free these nations in the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Freedom.<br>
<!-- -->Freedom from those that have bound them.<br>
<!-- -->Free these nations from those that have bound them.<br>
<!-- -->Free these nations from the terrible economic policies that have crippled them.<br>
<!-- -->Free them in the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Free them from fear, decree in the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->I free this nation from fear.<br>
<!-- -->I free this nation, use that.<br>
<!-- -->Say in the name of Jesus Christ, I proclaim deliverance for this country, then call the name of the country.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s your country, call the name of your country.<br>
<!-- -->Use the name of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m telling you, you&#x27;re going to see changes so fast, you&#x27;ll be surprised.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m telling you how to use the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Use the name of Jesus in your country right now.<br>
<!-- -->Break the influence of those that have been controlling the country and giving the country all kinds of horrible regulations and laws that have crippled the nation.<br>
<!-- -->Use the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Every nation, every nation for the Spirit of God has been poured out upon our flesh.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s no one that the Spirit of God cannot touch.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s none.</p>
<p>Hallelujah!<br>
<!-- -->Hola!<br>
<!-- -->Hola!<br>
<!-- -->Hola!<br>
<!-- -->Hola!</p>
<p>Believe in Jesus Christ with all your hearts.<br>
<!-- -->Believe.<br>
<!-- -->Believe.</p>
<p>But no, there was a, they had some chaos in Nigeria and the whole world was informed that there was that much chaos.<br>
<!-- -->But they don&#x27;t know how everything just suddenly became count.<br>
<!-- -->How did things just suddenly become calm?<br>
<!-- -->They became calm because many of us called the demons who were responsible for the chaos.<br>
<!-- -->We asked them to pack their loot and go.<br>
<!-- -->And once we said, get out of Nigeria in the name of Jesus, they left.<br>
<!-- -->And the people saw that the spirit that moved them to be violent and to be angry just left.<br>
<!-- -->And they became calm.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what you do.<br>
<!-- -->You never be afraid of the devil.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s all.<br>
<!-- -->We have power, but the world doesn&#x27;t understand.<br>
<!-- -->We have power.</p>
<p>We have power, the world doesn&#x27;t understand.<br>
<!-- -->And we have to use it, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m telling you, the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->We don&#x27;t misuse it.<br>
<!-- -->We use it right.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->So for your country, pray like that.<br>
<!-- -->Pray.<br>
<!-- -->Pray.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t neglect to pray for your country.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t neglect to pray for the leaders of the nations.<br>
<!-- -->Because God loves the people.<br>
<!-- -->He doesn&#x27;t want wicked leaders destroying them.<br>
<!-- -->He doesn&#x27;t want the deep state regulating them because the members of the deep state are not accountable to anybody.<br>
<!-- -->And God didn&#x27;t give them the power to run the country.<br>
<!-- -->So when they are run in the country or they appoints their own... I always like calling the hand in the glove.<br>
<!-- -->You see, when they are behind the scene, programming everything, running the country with their own people, it becomes dangerous.<br>
<!-- -->They always make crime to become uncontrollable.<br>
<!-- -->Because how can you control crime when you that are controlling it are really the perpetrator?<br>
<!-- -->You see.<br>
<!-- -->So such nations become<br>
<!-- -->destabilized.<br>
<!-- -->But you can&#x27;t let that happen.<br>
<!-- -->You can&#x27;t let that happen.<br>
<!-- -->Start using the name of Jesus and let&#x27;s use that name to surprise the nations so that the things that they&#x27;re telling us, all their prognosis will not happen.<br>
<!-- -->They say, no, this is going to happen.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, that&#x27;s going to happen.<br>
<!-- -->Oh, that&#x27;s going to happen.<br>
<!-- -->They&#x27;re surprised.<br>
<!-- -->Those things are not happening like they said.<br>
<!-- -->Why?<br>
<!-- -->Because we declare all such things, canceled in the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->And it&#x27;s not hard.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s not hard to do it.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s as simple as I just told you.<br>
<!-- -->Use the name.<br>
<!-- -->When the traffic warden does like this, what happens?<br>
<!-- -->All of those trucks, no matter how heavy.<br>
<!-- -->All of those massive vehicles grind to a halt.<br>
<!-- -->This was all the men did at that junction.<br>
<!-- -->And then when he did like this, all those over there moved.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s all.<br>
<!-- -->He didn&#x27;t have to have power to stop those massive trucks.<br>
<!-- -->He did that.<br>
<!-- -->When we use the name of Jesus and we say, devil, you are not allowed.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;re not allowed.<br>
<!-- -->So that&#x27;s what we do.<br>
<!-- -->Use the name of Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->Use the name.<br>
<!-- -->Use the name.<br>
<!-- -->Use the name.<br>
<!-- -->Use the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->and let&#x27;s begin to see prosperity in these nations.<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s begin to see changes in their policies, changes in their policies.<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s see them rejecting those wicked laws and regulations that are handed over to them from out outside their country to destroy them.<br>
<!-- -->The outsiders cannot love your countrymen more than you.<br>
<!-- -->They can&#x27;t.<br>
<!-- -->So the so-called globalization cannot be good if the individual countries are not in good condition.<br>
<!-- -->Globalism becomes good when individual nations are doing well.<br>
<!-- -->If they are prosperous, otherwise no amount of globalism will be okay.<br>
<!-- -->It can only be good if each one is prosperous.<br>
<!-- -->So let&#x27;s get the nation&#x27;s prosperous.<br>
<!-- -->Then together we are all prosperous.<br>
<!-- -->But if you say, no, bring everything together and we share.<br>
<!-- -->That means there&#x27;s no prosperity.<br>
<!-- -->Right?<br>
<!-- -->That means there&#x27;s no prosperity.</p>
<p>Well, I&#x27;ve come to the hour where I must close this<br>
<!-- -->session tonight.<br>
<!-- -->I hope that you&#x27;ve learned something.<br>
<!-- -->I hope that you&#x27;ve been inspired to serve the Lord more.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;ll be looking forward to our Global Day of Prayer from December 1st into 2nd.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s going to be a huge one.<br>
<!-- -->tell everybody, because that one is so important, we must make sure that the evil plans that have been laid down for 2021 don&#x27;t happen.<br>
<!-- -->I told you, we are bringing in through the spirit a new world order.<br>
<!-- -->And those who are censoring shoots, they don&#x27;t want shoots?<br>
<!-- -->Well, let&#x27;s look at it like this.<br>
<!-- -->Whether it&#x27;s Google or Twitter or Facebook that are censoring people, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a big deal.<br>
<!-- -->Because those are private organizations.<br>
<!-- -->If you didn&#x27;t go to them in the first place, you wouldn&#x27;t have a problem.<br>
<!-- -->They don&#x27;t belong to the governments.<br>
<!-- -->So instead, we should expect new technology<br>
<!-- -->Better ones, better things, God can do bigger things than that.<br>
<!-- -->I mean, they&#x27;re not the smartest people in the world, by any standard, by the way, and that&#x27;s not an insult.<br>
<!-- -->So, new things can happen.<br>
<!-- -->And they&#x27;re gonna happen fast.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m telling you, they&#x27;re gonna happen fast, real fast.<br>
<!-- -->Real fast.<br>
<!-- -->Real fast.<br>
<!-- -->And I say to young people, chair up, let&#x27;s hope for you.<br>
<!-- -->Chair up.<br>
<!-- -->Chair up.<br>
<!-- -->Let&#x27;s hope for you.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t let anybody use you as vagabonds for the streets.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t believe in that.<br>
<!-- -->Most of those who will tell you to go to the streets, they have their children in other countries.<br>
<!-- -->They don&#x27;t mind to send you out.<br>
<!-- -->and make you play the fool, refuse to play the fool.<br>
<!-- -->God wants you to have a decent life and there&#x27;s a chance for you.<br>
<!-- -->Believe me, there&#x27;s a chance for you.<br>
<!-- -->There are opportunities for you.<br>
<!-- -->And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m praying for you.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m praying specially for you because God&#x27;s going to give you the wisdom, the guidance, to see this massive opportunity is that the world doesn&#x27;t even know are there.<br>
<!-- -->And God&#x27;s going to show these to you in such a short time.<br>
<!-- -->And you be amazed.<br>
<!-- -->So chap, don&#x27;t lose hope.<br>
<!-- -->Don&#x27;t lose hope at all.<br>
<!-- -->between now and when Jesus comes back.<br>
<!-- -->Now remember, when we talk about Jesus coming, we&#x27;re referring to two different things.<br>
<!-- -->There is the coming for the church.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s called the gathering unto him.<br>
<!-- -->He wouldn&#x27;t come to this earth.<br>
<!-- -->He&#x27;ll stay in the air and we all be caught up to meet him in the air and we go away with him to heaven there.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what the rapture is about.<br>
<!-- -->But Jesus will come out of heaven, wait in the air for us.<br>
<!-- -->So that&#x27;s one coming.<br>
<!-- -->But the real one that&#x27;s called the second coming, we come together with him.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s not a coming of joy for the people.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s a coming of war and judgment.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what Jesus is coming for.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s called a second coming of Christ, where he actually comes to this world.<br>
<!-- -->So it&#x27;s judgment first, before he enters into the millennium.<br>
<!-- -->or is God.<br>
<!-- -->So between now and the rapture of the church, oh boy, things are going to go in a direction the world never expected because the gospel must have free course and be glorified.</p>
<p>So be full of joy.<br>
<!-- -->Be full of joy.<br>
<!-- -->Be full of joy.<br>
<!-- -->Be full of joy.<br>
<!-- -->Be full of joy.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->The kind of innovations we&#x27;re gonna be having in this short period of time will be amazing.<br>
<!-- -->The successes.<br>
<!-- -->Do you realize during this period of the, with all the lockdowns and all the lockings and all those things that they did, do you realize that we accomplished so much?<br>
<!-- -->Oh, we&#x27;ll give you some reports soon.<br>
<!-- -->Amazing things happened.<br>
<!-- -->Lots of people are led to Christ.<br>
<!-- -->We want so many souls and achieve so much during the period.<br>
<!-- -->God is no fool.<br>
<!-- -->You can&#x27;t beat him.<br>
<!-- -->The Bible says there&#x27;s no wisdom against the Lord.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s no counsel against the Lord.<br>
<!-- -->You can&#x27;t manufacture a strategy against God.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s not enough wisdom to strategize against God.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s impossible.<br>
<!-- -->And that&#x27;s why we keep winning.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->praise the Lord.<br>
<!-- -->I want to thank all of you who have been helping with the Word Fest.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you for your administrations.<br>
<!-- -->Many of you shared your testimonies, amazing testimonies that we&#x27;ve been listening to during the Word Fest.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you very much.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you very much.</p>
<p>And you know,<br>
<!-- -->from 89 countries for this world fest.<br>
<!-- -->So far, we have had, think about it, who are participating, getting the materials, sharing the materials.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s amazing.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;ve had 429 million, 734,478 people participating from 89 countries.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s remarkable.</p>
<p>And some of the other countries, because we don&#x27;t have translations into some of those countries, which we will, for these messages.<br>
<!-- -->Amazing things have been happening.<br>
<!-- -->Can you imagine that?<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s almost half a billion people participating in the word fest.<br>
<!-- -->How can you, how do you explain such things?<br>
<!-- -->This is huge.<br>
<!-- -->I mean, that&#x27;s another program just going on.<br>
<!-- -->You didn&#x27;t hear me talk about this until now.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;ve not heard me mention what first.<br>
<!-- -->What has been going on?<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s been going on the last few days.<br>
<!-- -->So I want to thank all the pastors and ministers who&#x27;ve been<br>
<!-- -->Participating in that one.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you so much.<br>
<!-- -->Thanks for the testimonies.<br>
<!-- -->I heard some of the testimonies very touching.<br>
<!-- -->Testimonies are what the Word of God has done in your life.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you for sharing those.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you so much.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->And of course, our weekend programs, Love and Extra.<br>
<!-- -->And I&#x27;m always so blessed<br>
<!-- -->with all the administrations and the film too.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you all.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->And all these ladies and gentlemen who have been, you know, when you are sitting here like this and the spirit is staring in this face, can imagine what power is here.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you very much.<br>
<!-- -->Why don&#x27;t you say a word before we close this session?<br>
<!-- -->I always like studying with you.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s just faster crazy, always start with me.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you so much for... It&#x27;s indescribable really, what we&#x27;ve been experiencing.<br>
<!-- -->But yesterday, this morning, I was just thinking about the blessings we&#x27;ve been bringing to us.<br>
<!-- -->And like yesterday,<br>
<!-- -->when you shared some thoughts with us, I thought the consistency of the word.<br>
<!-- -->These are things that you&#x27;ve been sharing with us for many years.<br>
<!-- -->And now I&#x27;m so grateful to you, sir, and to the Lord that more people have been brought into these beautiful revelations and now the workforce that&#x27;s enlightened and that&#x27;s going to take<br>
<!-- -->the victory of the church into the rapture is increasing or multiplying.<br>
<!-- -->Because there&#x27;s nothing better than having a workforce that is enlightened and not as trained.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;ve told us about the purpose and the necessity for training.<br>
<!-- -->An untrained workforce is a mob.<br>
<!-- -->But a trained one is an army.<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;s a difference between an army and a mob.<br>
<!-- -->God wants an army, not a mob.<br>
<!-- -->So through this, you&#x27;re bringing us into this unity of purpose, clarity of vision, and we are unstoppable.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you so much.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you very much.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you, sir, for this opportunity.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you for so many privileges.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s just been a blessing.<br>
<!-- -->You told us at the beginning of the year that it was the year of perfection.<br>
<!-- -->And the spirit of God keeps on reminding me that he didn&#x27;t change his mind.<br>
<!-- -->The fact that the devil began to have all kinds of epileptic decisions and trying to bring about all kinds of distractions, God didn&#x27;t change his mind.<br>
<!-- -->And what he said would happen this year is still happening.<br>
<!-- -->You told us, Pastor, that the grace of God upon our lives this year will be a surprise to us.<br>
<!-- -->It is happening.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;ve won more souls.<br>
<!-- -->We&#x27;ve achieved so much this year.<br>
<!-- -->And I&#x27;m just encouraging all God&#x27;s people to remember that this year, everything that God said concerning us is coming to fruition.<br>
<!-- -->Just like we had from the man of God, everything he said, it&#x27;s been aligned.<br>
<!-- -->even if there was a distraction during the year, what&#x27;s a prophecy came for?<br>
<!-- -->from a man of God, bringing about alignment, recovery, restoration, and we are ending up where God said we are going to end up.<br>
<!-- -->In a better place, it is still the year of perfection, and no one of God is falling short, no matter what the devil planned.<br>
<!-- -->And I want to say very big thank you to you Pastor for guiding the body of Christ, for leading us in a perpetual victory parade, because that is the direction of the Spirit.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you, sir.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you very much.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you very much.<br>
<!-- -->Yeah.<br>
<!-- -->I want to personally thank you, Pastor, because the messages, the impact of the word, you know, yesterday, during this particular time, it told us about training ourselves in spirituality.<br>
<!-- -->And when we were ending the last phase, you said that the things we had learned, we should go and put them to work.<br>
<!-- -->In our country, we didn&#x27;t know, of course, we had told us, we had given us insight into the plan of the enemy and some of the things that would happen.<br>
<!-- -->But he told us at that last phase, he said, go and put to work the words that everything goes.<br>
<!-- -->Yes, but so there was, we&#x27;ve learned that everything, I use everything God has been teaching us.<br>
<!-- -->And then we were confronted with the situation.<br>
<!-- -->And so we won.<br>
<!-- -->We won, we won the victory.<br>
<!-- -->It was so easy because we had taught us, we had built us.<br>
<!-- -->We were not deceived.<br>
<!-- -->We knew what was going on.<br>
<!-- -->And we were able to mobilize others and let them see what was going on.<br>
<!-- -->Also thank you because that was just one more demonstration that indeed we&#x27;re living in the times of the signs.<br>
<!-- -->But the victory is already ours.<br>
<!-- -->The victory is already ours and there&#x27;s nothing the devil and all the demons can do about it.<br>
<!-- -->You know, and personally I want to thank you again because, you know, during this particular phase, one of the things that has been coming to my spirit is increased beauty, increased glory, the glory of God in this glorious church.<br>
<!-- -->You know, the glory of God in this victorious church, the fact that really we can do all things through Christ as Trentings us.<br>
<!-- -->Nothing is too small, nothing is too big, no circumstances.<br>
<!-- -->Nothing, nothing too difficult.<br>
<!-- -->We have a name.<br>
<!-- -->We have a name and that name works.<br>
<!-- -->The power and the authority we have in that name works.<br>
<!-- -->And because I&#x27;m looking excited, you know, excited towards the next few weeks, the month as we come to the end of, I mean, IPPC, then we&#x27;re coming again.<br>
<!-- -->Global day of prayer.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m like, what testimony are we going to have by the next time we&#x27;re coming?<br>
<!-- -->There&#x27;ll be great testimonies, great victories and triumphs.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus did you die for nothing?<br>
<!-- -->No, no, no, no.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you.<br>
<!-- -->Praise God.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you very much, Pastor, for the opportunity.<br>
<!-- -->Pastor, thank you so much for everything that you taught us.<br>
<!-- -->And just like Pastor Emsi said, everything that you told us to do, when we did them, they worked.<br>
<!-- -->And it has put us in the position where the Scripture says,<br>
<!-- -->that in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be exalted above all the other mountains and is healed over all the hills or the other hills.<br>
<!-- -->And then He said the people, the nations shall flow.<br>
<!-- -->And so the knowledge that we have received and the wisdom we have that has increased in us<br>
<!-- -->As you put it towards us, we have seen that our authority is above every other one.<br>
<!-- -->And just like the Lord told Jeremiah that you will do everything that have sent you to do and that you should not be afraid of their faces, the fear<br>
<!-- -->of the faces of all the other mountains have dissipated.<br>
<!-- -->Not afraid of anybody&#x27;s face, not afraid of any video that is brought out of what is being done somewhere, because they think, as they proliferate, they have fake news between tomatoes, both with no being intimidated, all the legislation and the documents that they&#x27;ve leaked out so that they can deny it, and then hit hard.<br>
<!-- -->When they leak it out, it just confirms what you already told us.<br>
<!-- -->So it is like a vindication of the prophetic words that have been coming.<br>
<!-- -->And what this does to us is just like the words of the prophet that help them to build the temple.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s helping us to build the church.<br>
<!-- -->To do what is necessary and pastor, you communicate it by telling us that we are to establish a new world order.<br>
<!-- -->Absolutely.<br>
<!-- -->So it&#x27;s so exciting.<br>
<!-- -->Through prayers, recreating the world, recreating the systems, recreating the structures, sending out the recalcitrant, naughty people, sending them out, that you should get out of there.<br>
<!-- -->So it&#x27;s so exciting so that these two diseases are...</p>
<p>That was the first book released, recreating your world.<br>
<!-- -->And when you just said what you said, it just dawned on me that even though that book was focused on the individual&#x27;s world, it&#x27;s the same thing because your authority increases.<br>
<!-- -->You know, from your world that&#x27;s around you to the regions beyond.<br>
<!-- -->And so your world just keeps expanding.<br>
<!-- -->And what we&#x27;re doing here has expanded to the whole world.<br>
<!-- -->So we actually have authority for recreating our world.<br>
<!-- -->So we prophesied it a long time ago with that book.<br>
<!-- -->So we&#x27;re living it.<br>
<!-- -->Wow.<br>
<!-- -->Yes.<br>
<!-- -->Praise the Lord.<br>
<!-- -->Pastor, thank you so much for all these weeks of hearing the word from you and for you standing as God&#x27;s prophet and leading us to talk to the nations and effect changes.<br>
<!-- -->And particularly in this season, there was something you brought home so strongly to us.<br>
<!-- -->That is the accuracy of God&#x27;s word.<br>
<!-- -->That God would say something and set his time and he will meet that time.<br>
<!-- -->that when he gives a word, everything that needs to move, must move, to meet up with the time.<br>
<!-- -->When he said they would come out of Egypt, he moved Pharaoh, he moved, I mean, nature was moved.<br>
<!-- -->Everything had to comply.<br>
<!-- -->When it was a time for the Jews to come back from Babylon, he stood up an unlikely person to give that edict that they should go back to Jerusalem.<br>
<!-- -->And we find ourselves now,<br>
<!-- -->God has set the time for His return.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s not going to move.<br>
<!-- -->When I was younger, I thought, if we don&#x27;t do what we should do, He won&#x27;t come on time.<br>
<!-- -->But I have come to understand that that time is set.<br>
<!-- -->And because the time is set, He has moved us.<br>
<!-- -->He has moved us to pray.<br>
<!-- -->He has moved us to effect changes.<br>
<!-- -->He had to get and train those who will not cause the delay.<br>
<!-- -->You see, he had to bring into office, into place, into the moment those who will achieve his purpose.<br>
<!-- -->He had to make us resolute.<br>
<!-- -->You see, I found out something about myself as I was growing in the things of God and the Spirit.<br>
<!-- -->I realized<br>
<!-- -->I couldn&#x27;t have gone any other way.<br>
<!-- -->You know, I was set on a course that I had to follow.<br>
<!-- -->There was no way I could have done it differently.<br>
<!-- -->I couldn&#x27;t have gone any other way.<br>
<!-- -->I was set in the direction to go.<br>
<!-- -->And that&#x27;s the way I look at this time and, you know, just what you&#x27;re sharing.<br>
<!-- -->He said to German, I said, I watch over my work to perform this.<br>
<!-- -->And so, looking forward to this time, he began to train us from you, Pastor, and train and bring all of us to you, like he brought help us to David.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m so thankful to be a part of the vision.<br>
<!-- -->And I know that because the time is fixed, what the Lord is doing is to increase our grace, to increase knowledge, to increase our ability, to increase our influence.<br>
<!-- -->And we are trained to take advantage of it.<br>
<!-- -->We won&#x27;t waste anything that God has given to us.<br>
<!-- -->We will not waste a single thing.<br>
<!-- -->Everyone is focused.<br>
<!-- -->Now we know, we know the direction and we know what to do.<br>
<!-- -->And our grace is increased.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m so sure that we are going to witness the glorious rapture of the church.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you so much Pastor.<br>
<!-- -->Glory to God, driven, tell me.<br>
<!-- -->Pastor, all I just want to say is thank you.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you.<br>
<!-- -->We cannot thank you enough because all through the years you&#x27;ve brought us up with the word and over the years I&#x27;ve learned how to<br>
<!-- -->take the words that you speak seriously because even in the preaching and exhortation, even behind the pulpit, away from the pulpit, the words you speak are prophetic and you&#x27;ve constantly showed us the value of prophecy and how to hold on to prophecy and make war with prophecy.<br>
<!-- -->I remember, sir, in 1986, you were preaching in a setting, I went with you in a setting campus, university campus.<br>
<!-- -->You began to talk about<br>
<!-- -->the stadium.<br>
<!-- -->You said you even have to tell them the meaning.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s a player of stadium.<br>
<!-- -->You see all the stadium.<br>
<!-- -->They are not meant for soccer.<br>
<!-- -->1986, it will take over a decade later and all the<br>
<!-- -->Stadia in the various countries, in various cities, you were packing them out, just as you said then.<br>
<!-- -->Then in that same meeting, you started saying the church is no longer a baby, that there was a time the church was a baby.<br>
<!-- -->Now the church is full-grown, it&#x27;s time for decoration.<br>
<!-- -->I was picturing you, you were talking about the church as a man.<br>
<!-- -->that the church is no longer where it used to be.<br>
<!-- -->And you&#x27;ve been consistent ever since, even up till now.<br>
<!-- -->So from the teachings from the word we see ourselves, we see where the church is supposed to be.<br>
<!-- -->And like I said, it gives us confidence and boldness.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;ve constantly, through your words, separated us from the world.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;ve taught us how to make war with prophecy, even according to the Word of God.<br>
<!-- -->You say them, and they come to pass.<br>
<!-- -->And then I want to thank you, sir, for bringing the world to all generations.<br>
<!-- -->You know, during this season of Reach Out, and we were having the rapporteur.<br>
<!-- -->I was listening, I had rap at home with kids, five-year-old, seven years, 11 years old, on seven-year-old boy.<br>
<!-- -->He said, the rap studio realities has made me bold, seven years.<br>
<!-- -->He said, the rap studio realities makes me to see visions.<br>
<!-- -->He said, the rap studio realities has even improved my tongues.<br>
<!-- -->Seven years.<br>
<!-- -->Then he said, from the rap studio realities, I have learnt that when the world shoots fear till you shoot fate at them.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what he taught us.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s what he taught us from the Word of God.<br>
<!-- -->There was fear everywhere and you brought so much faith and confidence.<br>
<!-- -->So I just want to thank you for showing us where the church should be.<br>
<!-- -->You know, as I started listening to the message, you&#x27;ve been consistent in all the messages, you&#x27;ve been saying these things.<br>
<!-- -->So I&#x27;m saying,<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m praying, O Lord, let the whole church know it&#x27;s not just hearing this, this is who we are, this is where we are, this is what we should be doing now, because you&#x27;ve showed up from the Word of God that this is what God has said concerning us.<br>
<!-- -->So my heart is filled with joy.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;ve constantly led us on a triumphant procession, you know, victory.<br>
<!-- -->You always talk the church up, you always talk us up, you know, and<br>
<!-- -->Every time you bring these revelations, we just are filled with so much joy.<br>
<!-- -->So I want to say thank you, thank you.<br>
<!-- -->I&#x27;m so overwhelmed.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you, sir.<br>
<!-- -->The Lord, thank you very much.<br>
<!-- -->The Lord has given us massive opportunities to serve Him and to honor Him.<br>
<!-- -->Always remember that you were born for this time.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s not a mistake.<br>
<!-- -->It&#x27;s not a mistake.<br>
<!-- -->You were born for this time.<br>
<!-- -->Not to be a loser, but a winner.<br>
<!-- -->You were born for this time.<br>
<!-- -->Now everyone who has not received salvation, I want to lead you into salvation the Bible way right now.<br>
<!-- -->This is so important, so important.<br>
<!-- -->Set His words after me and mean them from the bottom of your heart and God will hear you.<br>
<!-- -->Say, O Lord God, I believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<br>
<!-- -->I believe He died on the cross to save my soul.<br>
<!-- -->I believe God raised him from the dead.<br>
<!-- -->And he&#x27;s alive today.<br>
<!-- -->I confess with my mouth.<br>
<!-- -->Jesus Christ is Lord of my life.<br>
<!-- -->From this day.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul.<br>
<!-- -->I have eternal life now.</p>
<p>I am a child of God.<br>
<!-- -->from this name.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you, Lord.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you, Lord.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you, Lord.<br>
<!-- -->Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus, I pray for everyone who prayed that prayer.<br>
<!-- -->Let the name of Jesus be named upon them.<br>
<!-- -->You said, if we would confess without marriage, the Lord Jesus,<br>
<!-- -->And believe in our hearts, the God raised him from the dead.<br>
<!-- -->Salvation is ours.<br>
<!-- -->That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s required.<br>
<!-- -->And that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve just done.<br>
<!-- -->Salvation is theirs now.<br>
<!-- -->I bless them with your word, in the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->Satan has no claims over them anymore.<br>
<!-- -->They belong to Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you Lord.<br>
<!-- -->Hallelujah.<br>
<!-- -->Praise God.<br>
<!-- -->Congratulations.<br>
<!-- -->You have Christ in your heart now.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;re a Christian.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;re blessed of God.<br>
<!-- -->You&#x27;re blessed in the name of Jesus.<br>
<!-- -->We have a book titled, Now That You&#x27;re Born Again.<br>
<!-- -->We want you to have it and start learning about this life that you just received and start building your faith strong in Jesus Christ.<br>
<!-- -->You can use the code number at the bottom of the screen and download a copy for yourself today, right now.<br>
<!-- -->Thank you for joining us.<br>
