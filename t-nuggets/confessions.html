<p>My body is the temple of the Holy Ghost; God functions in it and I am its custodian. Therefore, my body conforms to my faith-filled affirmations. Body, you are not permitted to accommodate weakness, sickness, disease, or infirmity. You function for God. You are the tabernacle of the Holy Ghost. You are under obligation to respond to the Word of God. I command every fiber, every bone, and every cell of this body to comply with the Word of God. I live in Christ; therefore, I cannot be affected by the rules and corrupting influences of this earthly realm. I am from above and I live above all things in this world and its failing systems. I walk in righteousness and dominion, and I am conscious of the provisions of my divine life in Christ. This life is working in every fiber of my being, every cell of my blood, and in every bone of my body, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet! My entire being is vitalized by this life, invigorating me through and through in the mighty Name of Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p>God has lifted me in glory in Christ. I’m seated with Him in the heavenly realms of power, dominion, and majesty. Therefore, I have the consciousness of one who’s seated together with Christ in a place where there is no darkness, no sickness, no defeat, and no pain; a place of absolute authority, mastery, peace, joy, and bliss; a place where I have authority over sickness, death, and the grave. When Jesus died on the Cross, I died with Him. When God raised Him from the dead, I was raised together with Him and I became a new creation, alive to God. I am the fruit of Christ’s redemption. I have been brought out of death into life; from sickness into divine health; from sorrow into joy; from poverty into a wealthy and large place. I am alive with Christ’s resurrection life, and Christ is alive and fully expressed in me in the mighty Name of Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p>Christ proved His love for me through His vicarious sacrifice on my behalf. He took my place of judgment, condemnation, and sin, and gave me the God-life and nature of righteousness that is not subject to the darkness of sin, sickness, infirmity, or pain. Therefore, I refuse to be sick or broken in life. I have the life of God that is superior to negativity. I now function from a place of glory, power, authority, and dominion in Christ Jesus.

<p>My physical body has been divinely programmed to reject anything inconsistent with God’s Word for my health. Every part of my body – every cell, tissue, organ, and system – is fortified by God’s Spirit to function excellently and optimally. My body is divinely programmed to put out and annihilate every disease-causing bacterium, virus, or fungus that attempts to fasten itself to my body. My words trigger the release of divine energy that creates an impenetrable force-field around me, making me insusceptible to attacks in my spirit, soul, and body.

<p>The Word of God is light; it is the true light that lights up my world. It is the compass by which I navigate through life. I do not grope or wander in the dark, because the Word illuminates my path, gives me direction and guidance, and makes me an absolute success in life.

There’s no trace of sickness, disease, or infirmity connected to me. In the Name of Jesus, I declare that I’m healthy and whole. I am not subject to the afflictions and corruptions that are in the world. I am fully fortified with the whole armor of God. No evil can come near me.

Now that He’s risen, I’ve been raised together with Him, born anew with the resurrection life that is free of sin, sickness, disease, and death! My tongue is the rudder of my life. With it, I navigate my life aright, irrespective of contrary winds. I live continuously in health, success, and excellence. I refuse to talk fear, lack, or inability. My life is set on the paths preordained by God’s Word and I do not deviate from it. My life is graced with God’s glory and goodness. I live in the environment of His glory and divine essence, where there is no sickness, death, disease, infirmity, or failure. I manifest God’s glory, virtue, excellence, and greatness to my world, bringing glory to the Name of the Lord continually. I am an associate of the God-kind and a partaker of the divine nature, having been made free from the corrupting influences, decadence, and destruction in the world. Today and always, I’m conscious of the transcendent life of glory and victory that God has given me through Christ Jesus.</p>

Today and always, I’m conscious of the transcendent life of glory and victory that God has given me through Christ Jesus.

<p>My mind is not limited or defeated by the circumstances of life because it is inundated with the light of God’s Word. As I meditate on the Word, I think thoughts of peace, joy, victory, prosperity, and good health, thus, transcending the ordinary life and manifesting the supernatural in every situation. I walk in the consciousness that I’m in oneness with Jesus Christ. Through the spirit, I enjoy the glories of Christ’s resurrection life in my body. No sickness, disease, or infirmity can thrive in my body because I’m joined to the Lord and I’m one spirit with Him. I speak forth life, salvation, health, prosperity, and blessings only. I have victory over Satan and the world. My words have power and they are producing the fruits of righteousness in me; health, vitality, success, excellence, virtue, and perfection characterize my life every day. I refuse to accept sickness, poverty, or defeat. I will not give in to anything that’s contrary to my divine inheritance in Christ. The Holy Spirit lives in me and, as I daily walk in God&#x27;s prearranged path for my life, He causes me to excel with prosperity, health, and strength. I am born in the image and likeness of God. As He is, so am I in this world. I am not affected by sickness or the rudiments of this world. I am founded on Christ the solid rock. My life goes from glory to glory, from strength to strength, and from grace to grace in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen!</p>

The Lord guides me continually and satisfies my desires always, making my bones strong. I am like a well-watered garden and like a wellspring whose waters don’t go dry. I am born of the Word of truth. The Word of God is health and life to my body. I declare that the Holy Spirit is at work in me, and His presence daily renews and vitalizes my body. I fear no adversary, for Christ has already obtained the victory over every adversary, and my faith in the Word of God is the victory that overcomes the world. The plans of the adversary regarding my health will always come to nothing because I am born of God. I have the life of God in me. I have strength in me. I am confident that I dwell in perfect health today and always in the matchless name of Jesus Christ. Amen!</p>

<p>My consistent declarations of this &#x27;KeepSayingIt&#x27; creates a spiritual forcefield around me that is impenetrable by the devil. Therefore, I declare that no weapon formed against me shall prosper; the weapons of sickness, disease, failure, and death have no power over me. I dwell in health and strength. I refuse to observe or acknowledge lying vanities. I do not accept anything I see with my physical eyes that is not consistent with God’s eternal Word for my life, health, and well being. I believe only what the Word says about me and I keep talking it. I am conscious of the greatness and power of God within me. Consequently, I can never be broken by sickness or disease. I am fearless in the face of adversity. I am bold, courageous, and audacious; therefore, I boast in the Lord and in the power of His might through the vocalizing of my faith. Sickness, disease, and infirmity bow to my audacious faith confessions, and I live and enjoy the supernatural life naturally. I am full of divine might, strength, and energy. Nothing in this world is powerful or potent enough to destroy my spirit, soul, or body, for I dwell in the secret place of the Most High and abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I live in God&#x27;s perfect will for my life and I am in sync with His plans and purposes for my health. Therefore, the Spirit of God orders my steps in the path of life, health, and prosperity always, and I am protected from every wind of destruction. I consistently take my stand in faith against sickness, disease, poverty, death, and every manipulation of the enemy in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p>The good life is mine. Health is mine. Joy is aglow in my spirit. My life is a complete testimony that there’s a higher life in Christ. Jesus suffered the shame of dying on the cross so that I may live the life of glory, honor, dignity, and excellence.

I have the life of Christ. That life makes me indestructible and impervious to sickness. Divine life and unfailing health and strength are at work in every fiber of my being, in every cell of my blood, and in every bone of my body!

<p>I have entered into God’s rest. I refuse to be moved by any opposing situation in my body. I refuse to consider any contrary circumstance. I now rest from all struggles, because Jesus has done it all. I’m fortified daily by the Word. Death has no part in me and I refuse any condition that is not consistent with God’s Word in my spirit, soul and body. God loves me and His desire is for me to prosper and enjoy divine health in my spirit, soul, and body. He gave His Son, Jesus Christ, as proof of His love for me. I am conscious of all the works of Christ for me and I appropriate them to myself today. I&#x27;m alive to God and I live the resurrection life in Christ. Daily, I enjoy the manifestations of God’s love for me. I walk in the blessings of the salvation that Christ has wrought for me: blessings of divine health, success, abundance, and prosperity. I am born of God’s Spirit, I have the very life and nature of my heavenly Father. I am not ordinary, for I am of the uninfectible breed that doesn’t get sick. When men are cast down by sicknesses, diseases, and infirmities, there is lifting for me because I operate by the principles of God’s Kingdom. I have been authorized to reign and rule in life. I am a king-priest. When I address situations in the Name of Jesus, I have a guarantee that my demands are backed up with power. Therefore, in the Name of Jesus, I make a demand on my physical body: body, you are not allowed to respond to sickness, disease, and infirmities. You only respond to the Word of God and all that it says about you. The same power that was demonstrated in Christ when He was raised from the dead is at work in me. I am conscious of the exceeding greatness of this power. Therefore, by the power and authority in the Name of Jesus, I reign in this life over all forms of evil. I reject everything contrary to the provisions of my authority in Christ and I refuse to be subject to any form of sickness or infirmity in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

Jesus has paralyzed the works of the enemy and has brought them to nothing. Therefore, I reign over Satan and his cohorts of darkness by the power of the Holy Spirit and in the Name of Jesus. For His name has the ultimate and supreme authority. The plans of the adversary regarding my health will always come to nothing and be of none effect because I am born of God. I have overcome all the workings of the enemy. I have peace within my borders and the health in me flows out from me to everyone I come in contact with.

God wants me to prosper and dwell in health, even as my soul prospers. Therefore, my body, my soul, and everything about me conform to God’s will. I live in God’s deathless zone, walking in the light of His Word. I walk by faith and not by sensory perception, so I refuse anything that tries to contradict what the Word has said concerning me. I am a God-carrier! I carry blessings everywhere I go. I manifest the beauties, graces, excellencies, perfections, and auras of divinity.</p>
<p>The Word of God is my life. I am free from sickness, and I will not be overtaken by feelings of pain and discomfort because God’s Word is working mightily in my body. I speak the Word, and it works in my body, making it alive every day. The Word of God produces supernatural strength in me. Today, I experience its transforming power in every part of my body! I’m living an exceptionally great life here on earth, and I am in perpetual dominion over sickness and life’s circumstances. I live the perfect and transcendent life in Christ Jesus. I am fashioned after the Last Adam, a life-giving Spirit, and out of my belly flow rivers of living waters, bringing healing and divine health to everyone and everything I touch in the mighty and matchless name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

<p>I am God’s hands of love, mercy and compassion to the world. I’m strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. I keep His Word in my heart and in my mouth always and therefore discomfit all the stratagems, schemes, manoeuvres and manipulations of the devil. Today and always, my heart produces thoughts of life and divine health and harbors no thoughts of negativity or depravity. The devil is a fully defeated foe, and I’ve been vested with all power and authority in heaven and in earth to subdue, dominate and take charge of my world. I therefore declare, in the Name of Jesus Christ, that my progress is unstoppable.</p>
<p>I’m an associate of the God-kind, in vital, inseparable oneness and union with divinity. Christ lives in me! I’m the expression of His reality, His grace, glory, kingdom, power and personality! I’m the expression of His fullness; He is my completeness. It makes no difference what challenges I face in life; there’s a force – an empowerment – at work in me to blaze through the barriers. I live in health, prosperity, and excellence. I have no lack in this life because all my needs are met in Christ Jesus. Satan has nothing in me because I am full of the Spirit at all times. I fear no adversary, for Christ has already obtained the victory over every adversary, and my faith in the Word of God is the victory that overcomes the world.</p>
<p>The plans of the adversary regarding my health will always come to nothing because I am born of God. God has stamped and certified me as a world-overcomer; therefore, I reign over the world and its systems. I reign over demons of infirmity and death. The life in my body is a repellent, and a destroyer of diseases and germs. I have the life of God in me. I have strength in me. I am confident that I dwell in perfect health today. I am born in the image and likeness of God. As He is, so am I in this world in the mighty name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Speak in tongues.</p>

<p>Christ is my life. He’s in every fibre of my being, in every bone of my body, and in every cell of my blood. I reign and rule over circumstances in His Name, shielded from all evil and harm because I’m seated together with Christ in the heavenly realms. Far above all principality, power, might, dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come! I’m exalted with Him in glory; I know who I am: chosen, royal, and peculiar! I experience the supernatural in my body every day by the power of God’s Spirit. The Greater One lives in me. My body is the temple of the Holy Ghost. My life is filled with peace and prosperity. Eternal life is at work in me.</p>

Every day of my life is full of God’s glory, beauty, excellence, and grace. I have been conditioned to live a life of glory. I have all that I require to excel and live in perpetual health and dominion here on earth. God’s glory is evident in my physical body, coursing through my being, ridding me of every infirmity, feebleness, or weakness. It is seen in my family, job, business, and all areas of my life. I have eternal life and walk in the consciousness of it. I walk in dominion over sickness, disease, and death, over the discouragements and frustrations that affect humanity.</p>

I make full proof of God’s limitless power that has been deposited in my spirit; thus, I reign, rule, and dominate my world. I reject anything that represents darkness or inferiority. Anything that causes sorrow and depression is far from me. Jesus is Lord over my life; therefore, satan has no claim over me. I declare that I am full of life. I am full of faith. I am full of joy.

There is perfect soundness in my body. I live a life of faith. I’m not moved by what I feel, see, or hear. I am only moved by God’s Word. The presence of the Holy Ghost in my life gives strength to my spirit, soul, and body. I am replenished and built up by the Word. I walk in the full benefits of the salvation that Jesus Christ wrought for me, including health, peace, prosperity, and all-round success.</p>
<p>I belong in the Kingdom of God’s dear Son, where I reign and rule by the power of the Spirit. Thank You, Father, for bringing me into such a beautiful place of glory, beauty, honor, and the superior life. I live triumphantly over and above all circumstances of life. I testify of the goodness of the Lord and the victories He has wrought in my life through Christ Jesus! Every day of my life is full of God’s glory, beauty, excellence, and grace. Every day God loads me with great benefits. In His favour my horn is exalted. Eternity is alive in me. I live above infirmities and the harsh elements of this world because the One who lives in me is greater than he that’s in this world. Hallelujah! Speak in tongues.</p>

The Bible says that “Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4). The Bible also says “whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.” (1 John 5:4). I am born of God and so, I overcome the world! The greater one lives in me, in every fibre of my being, and in every cell of my blood! He&#x27;s in my head! He&#x27;s in my feet! He&#x27;s all over me! Hallelujah!</p>

<p>I declare that Christ lives in me! The anointed One and His anointing are resident in me! How could I fail? It&#x27;s impossible! I live by the faith of Jesus!

<p>Today, 6th APRIL 2024, I Confess and Declare that as I continue my fellowship with God&#x27;s Word in this Month of April, by studying my RHAPSODY OF REALITIES by Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, the Lord has granted me Authority to thread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power and abilities of the devil and his many agents.</p>
<p>The Lord has caused me to seat together with Christ in the place of Power; far above all principalities, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come in Jesus Mighty Name!Glorrrrrrrryyyyyyy</p>
<p>With God&#x27;s Word I consistently live in dominion over sin, sickness and infirmities, and every opposing force, accusation or hindrance by the Power of the Holy Ghost.
From today, I am living an exceptionally great life here on earth, dominating circumstances and living the Transcendent and Overcoming  life God had prepared for me as His Beloved Child. Hallelujah!!</p>
<p>The light of the Glorious Gospel is shining in my heart and in my path and I am stirred today with renewed Commitment, Vigour and Passion. I therefore Proclaim, that I function in the realities of the Kingdom of God, where I am a bonafide Citizen; walking in Divine Health, Absolute Prosperity, Unending Success, Abundant Joy and Indescribable Peace in the Mighty and Most Priceless Name of the Lord Jesus Christ!*</p>

<p>Today, 8 APRIL 2024, I Confess and Declare that this APRIL is indeed My Month of INTERCESSION As I pray in intercession, the Holy Spirit takes hold together with me against the forces of darkness, to obtain that which belongs to us, and to establish the righteousness of God in every place. I carry out this ministry through, and by the Spirit. When I take my place of intercession, the Lord says we’ll lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty (1 Timothy 2:2); our societies will be established in righteousness. Hallelujah!!</p>
<p>I’m fulfilling my priestly ministry of intercession. It’s my responsibility as a Christian in the regions and nations where I live to put a halt to evil works masterminded by satan and quell the terror he unleashes upon nations. As I pray for countries, there are increased activities of righteousness; the presence of God mantles men’s hearts and God’s Word prevails in their lives. Glooooooorrrrrry!!!</p>
<p>I am a custodian of my environment; I am called of God to preserve the earth and its inhabitants through prayers. There’s peace everywhere, I am responsible to God and to the country where I live to seek its peace and pray to the Lord for it. This is a call to me to intercede for the progress, peace, prosperity and preservation of the nations. Hallelujah!!!</p>
<p>I will always intercede passionately for those in my world and regions beyond who haven’t yet known the Lord. I Pray that every resistance is removed for them to receive the truth with understanding and embrace the Word of God for their salvation. Hallelujah!!!</p>
<p>I pray for leaders, that they’ll have the will, desire, and boldness to do what is right and refuse to yield to corruption and negative influences. Peace will prevails in the cities, towns and nations of the world, and the Gospel has free course every where I live. Hallelujah!!</p>
<p>Prayer
Dear heavenly Father, I thank you for making me an intercessor, one to stand in the gap for God’s children all over the world! I live up to this call today, as I pray that you’ll grant utterance, boldness and opportunity to Christians, especially in places where the light of the gospel of Christ’s salvation is dim, to preach your Word with mighty miracles, signs and wonders, in the Matchless and powerful Name of Our Lord Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p>I affirm that I am an offspring of the possessor of Heaven and earth. My prosperity is unlimited! The riches of the nations gravitate towards me. There is no shortage in my life — I do not lack or want  any wealth , business ideas or resources. Yes, I am rich in all things like Abraham. The divine life of God in me repels poverty. I am a success and I am making tremendous progress from one level of glory to higher levels of glory. I lay up gold as dust! Hallelujah! I have received the abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness. I reign as a king in life by the Lord Jesus Christ. I am kinging in life. I am reigning in life. I reign over sin, death, disease, and infirmity. I have dominion over all things. I affirm that the Word of God influences and dominates my thoughts. It produces in me the ability to do right at all times. The world and its negative forces can’t influence my thoughts, because my life is a reflection of the beauty and excellence of Christ! I think only those thoughts that bring Him glory, honour, and praise. Christ is alive in me; in Him, I live and move and have my being. Everything about my life is infused with divinity and speaks of God’s glory. I’ve been ordained to prosper and to live in glory. Therefore, I live the glorious life, fulfilling my purpose and destiny in Christ. Great things are happening for me and through me, by the power of the Word and the ability of the Holy Spirit. Grace and peace are multiplied in my life through the knowledge of the Word. Daily, I am making progress and heaping up success upon success. Everywhere I go, I carry the atmosphere of prosperity, joy, and increase. Hallelujah! Christ is exalted and glorified in me. I am a child of the King; I’ve been ushered into a place of rest, where everything is working for my good. I am well equipped and positioned by the Word. I am in Christ; I am seated together with Christ in the place of power; far above all principalities, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come. I live in dominion over sin, sickness and infirmities, and every opposing force, accusation, or hindrance. Greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world. Satan and the world are under my feet. I am made forever. Glory to God. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>I affirm that God liberally supplies all my needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. Everything that belongs to God belongs to me because I am His heir. I am always moving upward and forward and this is the reality of my life, made possible by the power of God &#x27;s word. I walk in absolute and continual victory, irrespective of the dwindling and erratic economic systems of the world. My life is a message; message of wealth, success, affluence and prosperity; these are expressed unreservedly to my world. Hallelujah! Thank You, Father, for Your love that envelopes me. Thank You for giving me a new life in Christ Jesus; a life full of glory and joy unspeakable. My life does not accommodate pain, sickness, infection, death, or anything that is of the devil. I look away from all distracting influences and focus my attention on God’s eternal and infallible Word. Irrespective of what I see, hear or feel, I’m convinced that I’m a victor and a success in Christ Jesus! I’m what God says I am; I have what He says I have, and I can do what He says I can do. Hallelujah. I affirm that I am an offspring of the Word. The blessings of the Lord is at work in my life, my family, and everything that concerns me. My life has been decorated with the glory of God.

<p>I affirm that I am always in sync with the Holy Spirit, God is at work in me both to will and to do according to his good pleasure. My eyes are opened to see financial opportunities and divine doors that are opened unto me to produce wealth. I am favoured by the right people in the right places at the right time. I have grace for wealth, riches and fortunes. My confidence to succeed and flourish in this life is in observing financial principles in the Word of God; that never fail but abides forever. That which I give comes back to me, a good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over. My bank accounts are overflowing with plenty of money, my investments and savings are growing exponentially, by the Spirit of God. Hallelujah! Sickness, disease, and infirmity have no part in my life. I can never be sick. I am born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but I am born of God. The transcendent life that makes it impossible for divinity to be corrupted or defeated is what I have in me. I affirm that I am a champion forever.

<p>I affirm that this is the day that the Lord has made for me to shine brightly. I am shining like a city set upon a hill. I am glad and I rejoice because the Lord has caused me to inherit the riches of the heathen. Where I did not toil and labour I am harvesting. The Lord Has granted me access to the hidden treasures of this world. My prosperity is noticeable by all man and they glorify my father who is In Heaven. All the nations call me blessed for I am blessed with great riches and wealth. The trees and the hills clap their hands with me rejoicing for the Lord has done great and wondrous things in my life. God’s Word is life and health to my body. Its transforming power changes the circumstances of my life and causes my health to flourish. I live in the Word and I refuse to fear, be sick, or be defeated! I will not be subject to disease or infirmity. I affirm that I am blessed and highly favoured of the Lord. I am in God&#x27;s place for my life; thus, I fly high on the wings of the Spirit. My days on earth are full of Joy, grace, pleasure, beauty, and glory. I&#x27;m from the government of heaven, I was born right in God’s presence, where there’s fullness of joy, and I dwell with Christ at His right hand; where there’s an endless pleasure.

<p>I affirm that I received abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness to reign in life by the name of the anointed one, Jesus Christ. I live in His authority and that makes me immune to lack and poverty. When I call on that name, all nature responds and heaven stands at attention.
