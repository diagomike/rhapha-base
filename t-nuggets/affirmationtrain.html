<p>KINDLY SAY THESE WORDS OUT LOUD</p>
<p>No sickness can thrive in my body! I have the overcoming, disease-destroying life of God in me, which makes my body indestructible, incorruptible and impregnable to disease and infirmity!
I (your name) affirm that the knowledge of God’s word has increased the grace of God in my life. I have the upper hand; for I’ve received abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness. I grow stronger by the day, like a cedar in Lebanon, and flourish like the palm tree! I make advancement by the Spirit, and of my increase, progress, and prosperity, there shall be no end!</p>
<p>I experience unparalleled advantages, unprecedented favour, and prosperity in all that I do. I move forward by the power of the Holy Spirit, making progress with giant strides, and waxing stronger every day. I am set on the course on which I must follow; therefore, I refuse to condescend to this earthly plane of life.</p>
<p>My entire being is inundated by the life of God that flows in every fibre of my being, every cell of my blood, and every bone of my body. I live the transcendent life of endless possibilities and victories unlimited. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>I am not ordinary; the Lord is the strength of my life, thus, there’s no room for weakness in me. I am sufficient in Christ’s sufficiency, and nothing is impossible to me.</p>
<p>The Lord has set me on high; glory and honour are in His presence; strength and gladness are in His dwelling! Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil; for He’s my shield and eternal protection.</p>
<p>I am born of the Word and filled with the Holy Spirit, I am impregnable to anything that hurts or binds because I hail from God! I am blessed and fortified in Christ Jesus with everything I need for life and godliness. Glory to God. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>The power of promotion is activated in me, and I am making progress in every area of my life! I’m the seed of Abraham, and his blessings rest on me. I’m like a tree by the stream, well-watered and ever flourishing, bearing fruits of righteousness and experiencing luxuriant growth in every area of my life. Truly, the lines are fallen to me in pleasant places and I live in prosperity and victory every day. Hallelujah! I am strengthened through the ministry of the Spirit in my life! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>I affirm that God has made me a wonder to my world! I am full of power, grace and glory, because the Holy Spirit lives in me in His fullness! He’s my ability and the strength of my life. I’m perfected in Him, exuding His righteousness, peace, joy and excellence. My understanding is enlightened to function with the precision and accuracy of the Spirit.

<p>6TH  FEBRUARY.</p>
<p>OUT-SHINING OF EXCELLENCE AND PERFECTION..</p>
<p>I affirm that I am the manifestation, the out-shining of the glory of God. His splendour, excellence and perfection are expressed through me. And despite the darkness and hardship in today’s world, I’m more than a conqueror, for Christ in me is the hope of glory! I walk in the glory—in my health, academics, job, business, family and finances. My days on earth are days of blessings. I am blessed with the fullness of the blessings of the Gospel of Christ. I am blessed in the city and in the field; blessed in my going out and coming in. In my path are life and peace, glory, abundance, and eternal rejoicing, now and forever.</p>
<p>I am blessed with divine wisdom and knowledge; blessed with with strength, health, divine supply, insight, and ability. I am so blessed by the Spirit of God and that blessing has brought precision and excellence into my life. I am not ordinary; I am powered by the Spirit of God to determine what comes into my world. Today, and always, I disallow every kind of illegal transaction in my life. I vehemently refuse sickness, poverty, death, and everything that hurts and binds. Only things that are consistent with the God-life are permitted in, and around me.</p>
<p>I am powered to do the right thing always. I’m the seed of Abraham, and his blessings rest on me! I am like a tree by the stream, well-watered and ever-flourishing, bearing fruits of righteousness and experiencing luxuriant growth in every area of my life. Truly, the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places and I have a goodly heritage. I live in prosperity and victory every day. Hallelujah! I am born with untold blessings, and my spirit is opened continually to the truth; thus, every part of me is full of light. Glory to God. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>1ST MARCH</p>
<p>FOR THE JOY OF THE LORD IS MY STRENGTH!</p>
<p>I affirm that the Lord is the portion of my inheritance; therefore, I am made forever! I am strengthened with all might by the Holy Spirit. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. I am ever strong and alive, for the joy of the Lord is my strength! My life is beautified by the Spirit of God; for I am the workmanship of God in Christ Jesus, created unto good works. Hallelujah! I am alive; I’ve passed from death to life, sin and all its rudiments have no power over me.</p>
<p>I am a student of the Word; I am taught by the Spirit of the Lord to look beyond these present moments and connect everything I do here on earth to eternity. My choices and decisions concerning my family, job and everything else about my life are founded on the Word. I am full of God’s might; led and guided by the Spirit always! I function by His power and glory today, full of the Spirit in wisdom, having a deep spiritual understanding of all things!</p>
<p>I am more than a man, the spirit of perfection is at work in me. I live out the supernatural life naturally, demonstrating the glory, wisdom, and excellence of divinity. I am joined to the Lord and have become inseparable with Him, bearing fruits of His righteousness that is inherent in my spirit. I am loaded, my life is like a well-watered garden. I am fruitful and productive; making progress in every area of my life. I am complete in Christ, and every facet of my life is perfected for excellence. Glory to God. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>2ND MARCH.</p>
<p>TO REIGN AND RULE OVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES…</p>
<p>I affirm that I am the light of the world and the salt of the earth! I belong in God’s superior class of divine beings; therefore I look beyond the natural realm of existence to my heavenly rights, blessings and provisions in Christ Jesus! I recognize today and take hold of my divine right to live in health, prosperity, victory, success, dominion and excellence! The devil and his demons has no place in me; for my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and I have the right to reign and rule over the circumstances of life and exercise dominion over satan.</p>
<p>I am in God’s place for my life, and the knowledge of God’s Word has brought expansion into my life. My capacity, vision, dreams, and ideas have expanded. I’ve received an unusual grace and I expand by the power of the Holy Spirit. I grow stronger by the day, like a cedar in Lebanon, and flourish like the palm tree! I make progress by the Spirit, and of my increase, greatness, and prosperity, there shall be no end! My entire being is inundated with the life of God and I am blessed and strengthened by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>I am set on the course on which I must follow and the Spirit of God is leading me in the path of perpetual victory, success, and prosperity. Hallelujah! This is my set time and I’ve moved to the next and higher level of glory. The grace to expand has been released; I do not struggle but enjoy unstoppable growth and progress as I receive guidance and light from the Lord. I am enthroned; I am seated with Christ in heavenly places, far above all the hardships, troubles, perils and corrupting influences in the world. I dominate and triumph over circumstances today and always. Glory to God! Hallelujah!</p>

<p>I affirm that this is my month of possession! I am rightly positioned by the Spirit of God. I am in God’s place for my life! The eyes of my understanding are enlightened through the Word, to see and receive every good thing that belongs to me in Christ Jesus. As I see them, I call them real and walk in the reality of God’s manifold and eternal blessings. Fear has no place in me; for God has not given me the spirit of fear but of love, power and of a sound mind.</p>
<p>I am bold to act my faith; I function with the ability of the spirit today for the Spirit of God is working in my life and causing me to have divine courage and confidence. I live joyfully today and always, knowing fully well that all of God’s promises to me in Christ Jesus are yes and amen; I am living in the realities of my inheritance in Christ. Christ dwells in my heart by faith, and I am rooted and grounded in love. God’s Word is in my heart and in my mouth; and as I study and meditate on the Word today, the circumstances of my day align with the will and purpose of God for me!</p>
<p>I attract myself only to thoughts that are consistent with my destiny in Christ; thoughts of victory, increase, success, health, and strength. I am fully aware that the quality of life that I live is based on the faith-filled words that I utter. Therefore, I hold fast to the profession of faith without wavering.

<p>5TH MARCH 2024</p>
<p>I affirm that I’m built up, thriving on my most holy faith, making progress by the supernatural, and rising like an edifice, ever higher and higher, as I pray in the Holy Ghost! I’m never disadvantaged; I have eternal life. I live and function with the consciousness that I am an associate of the God-kind. The life of God is work in every fibre of my being, repelling sickness, disease, infirmity, death, poverty, and everything that’s inconsistent with the provisions of the divine life. I am born with the ability to reign and rule over the elements of this world.</p>
<p>I have the yeast to rise above every challenge, therefore, it’s impossible to go down in life, irrespective of what’s happening around the nations of the world. I know who I am, the child of the Monarch of the universe! Nothing is impossible to me, for as Christ is, so am I in this world. I’m healthy and strong, strengthened with might by God’s Spirit in my inner man. The mysteries of life are unveiled to my spirit. Never will I walk in darkness, for the true light that lightens every man’s world shines in my heart.</p>
<p>I refuse to be described as a victim because I am mightily helped by the Spirit of God. Everywhere I go, the Lord has the right people at the right place and at the right time to favour my course. Hallelujah! I refuse to be a part of the suffering masses; for I’ve been transferred from the kingdom of this world into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son. Out of my belly flows rivers of living water; for all the fullness of the Father tabernacles in me. I live from my spirit because my heart is where the Kingdom of God dwells. Glory to God. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>I affirm that I was born for such a time as this. The Father has granted me insight into the workings of His Spirit in my day. The knowledge of His Word has increased, alongside angelic ministrations on my behalf, as I urgently and fearlessly proclaim the Gospel around the world. I’m committed to the Gospel and its spread around the world, by the power of your Spirit. The grace of God is multiplied in my life. I manifest the glory of God; His splendor, excellence, and perfection are expressed through me, even as I walk in the victory, boldness, and dominion of Christ.</p>
<p>The eyes of understanding are enlightened; I see the invisible and I am powered to do the impossible. Hallelujah! My mind is full of possibilities because the Word of God has given me a mindset. Daily, as I meditate on the Word, I make my way prosperous. My whole being is saturated with the anointing and power of God’s Word, such that thoughts of success, possibilities, and glory are inspired within me. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>I am anointed by the Spirit of God! I am not moved by what I see or hear! The unfavorable economic situation in the world isn’t set against me. I’ve overcome the world and its failures, hatred, corruption, decadence, and limitations. I grow stronger by the day, like a cedar in Lebanon, and flourish like the palm tree! I am an answer from God; a channel of blessing, through which the nations of the earth are blessed. Glory to God! Hallelujah!</p>

<p>I FUNCTION WITH THE DOMINION OF CHRIST…</p>
<p>I affirm that I am set on the course on which I must follow. I’m completely given to the ministry of the Word in study and meditation, and therefore, nurtured, edified, developed and sustained in the victorious life. I am powered and enabled by the Spirit on every side to do greater things. Everywhere I go, and in everything that I put my hands to do; I am a success. I walk in divine health, prosperity, and enjoy unprecedented increase in every area of my life. Irrespective of what is happening around the world, I can’t think of failing! I can’t comprehend failure! I do not fail, FAIL! ME! NEVER!! I DON’T FAIL! It’s not consistent with my nature. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>I am a success on every count. The wisdom of God is at work in me mightily. I can’t think otherwise because the Word of God has given me a mentality. I have the mentality of a CHAMPION. Hallelujah! I’ve been taken out of the power, dominion, control, and authority of darkness, into absolute safety! I live in the presence of God, and function with the dominion of Christ; I’m seated with Christ in the realm of glory—too far and too high from Satan’s domain! I’m superior to Satan! Hallelujah! I am in God’s place for my life, and He has perfected all that concerns me. Even now, He is causing all things to work together for my good.</p>
<p>By the reason of my fellowship and partnership with the Holy Spirit, He has made me a distributor of eternal verities to my world. No man or institution can place a limit on me because greater is He that is in me, than he that is in the world. Angels have been dispatched for my favour right now. The word of God in my mouth is producing results for me, in every area of my life, even in my ministry as a soul winner! God’s blessings have overshadowed me. They have gone ahead of me to make every unpleasant path, unpleasant days to become pleasant. Glory to God. Hallelujah!</p>

The glorious life is mine as I acknowledge and receive every good thing that I have in Christ Jesus, walking in the light and reality of who I am in Christ.

Everything in my world, whether living or non-living, is constantly charged with life and vitality! I see myself making progress with giant strides; my path is that of the just that shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. I am not a part of the suffering masses; therefore, I refuse to be subject to the principles of this world’s system. I am heavenly; I am seated with Christ in the place of authority! Hallelujah. My spirit is enlightened; I have understanding and knowledge of my victory in Christ Jesus over satan and the powers of darkness.</p>
<p>I live to serve the Lord, free from fear of the devil and the wickedness in this world! Today, I go out knowing that no evil shall befall me and I am delivered from wicked and unreasonable men. I belong in God’s superior class of divine beings; thus, I look beyond the natural realm of existence to my heavenly rights, blessings, and provisions in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah! I recognize today and take hold of my divine right to live in health, prosperity, victory, success, dominion, and excellence! I reign and rule over circumstances and exercise dominion over satan. Glory to God. Hallelujah!</p>
