<p>Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips (Hosea 14:2).</p>
<p>Being born again, we’re engaged in a spiritual warfare: a fight of faith. Actually, it’s called “the good fight of faith” (1 Timothy 6:12). It’s a good fight because we always win. If a Christian loses in the good fight of faith, then he or she isn’t using the right arsenal; and part of that arsenal is prophecy.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 1:18, the Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, gave an important charge to Timothy, and by extension the rest of us, saying, “This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare.”</p>
<p>We make war with prophecies. Don’t let the Word of the Lord that has gone forth concerning your finances, health, family, business or career fall to the ground. Use them in your fight of faith. Make war with them. No matter what comes against you; no matter the challenges or crises you face, declare the Word.</p>
<p>It’s time to make war with those prophecies you wrote somewhere in your note or diary. God gave you those words for you to affirm the same in consent. If you don’t say it, it won’t work. “He said; so that we may boldly say...” (Hebrews 13:5-6).</p>
<p>For example, Isaiah 43:2 says, “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.” Don’t just read that and be quiet; respond. Declare, “I’m forever protected and fortified against all evil and wickedness in this world. I dwell in the safety and peaceful habitation of the Almighty; a place of glory, dominion and everlasting joy, where I reign and rule with Christ over circumstances.”</p>
<p>In the face of trouble or adversity, make war with words. Affirm your victory. <em>Hallelujah!</em></p>

<p>(SUCCESS ALWAYS STARTS FROM WITHIN)</p>
<p>“Everyone admires a man with good sense, but a man with a warped mind is despised.” -  Proverbs 12:8 TLB</p>
<p>Some people have the erroneous idea that the most important requirement for success is money. So they go for money, and all their lives, they keep going for more of it until they eventually get frustrated. That’s not how to become a success.</p>
<p>Success always begins with a dream. Joseph was a young man who had a dream of success. His brothers envied him for his dream and tried to kill him, and eventually sold him into slavery in Egypt. You see, they couldn’t kill him. It’s hard to kill a man with a dream. Joseph’s dream kept him alive until it eventually came to pass. If you have a dream and you’re disciplined enough to pursue it, nothing can ever stop it from coming to pass. The only person that can kill your dream is you.</p>
<p>Your dream in life shouldn’t be about how or where to get money. Instead, it should be about improving your world to be a better place than you met it. To realise your dream, you need capital, and by that, I don’t necessarily mean money. Money is not the most important capital you need to realise your dream. The first and most vital capital is your mind. That’s what determines whether you become a success or not.</p>
<p>Your mind is where earth-shaking ideas are born. Those ideas, if properly harnessed, are more valuable than money. Money is a slave of your ideas. If you nurse your ideas long enough and discipline yourself in the direction of your ideas, money will eventually come looking for you.
It’s important what you set your mind upon every day. Get rid of the wrong stuff that won’t do your mind any good and polish your ideas; refine them and get ready for a great future!</p>
<p>FURTHER STUDY: Joshua 1:8; Ecclesiastes 7:12; Proverbs 18:15</p>
<p>CONFESSION: I’m a dreamer. Money is a slave of my ideas. I fill my mind daily with the Word of God, and as I do, my eyes are opened to see opportunities all around me.</p>

<p>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest (Joshua 1:9).</p>
<p>The scripture above was God’s message to Joshua, as he led the children of Israel through the wilderness. God said to him, “Be not afraid.” Why? Because there were frightful experiences in his way. But God said, “Be not afraid.” Then He took it further; He said, “…neither be thou dismayed.” When things begin to look like you’ve been defeated, don’t be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you. What an assurance!</p>
<p>Many years ago, I heard a story that’s remained indelibly on my mind. A Pastor told a story of how God visited a certain man in a vision. As he and the Lord walked together, the Lord assured him “I am with you no matter how difficult the journey may be.” Though he couldn’t see the Lord, he could see the footprints. As they journeyed, there were two different footprints so, he was sure the Lord was with him. Every now and then, he looked and saw the Lord’s footprints, and kept going.</p>
<p>At a point, things got tougher and harder. Then he looked, but this time saw only one footprint! He cried and said, “Lord, where are you? Things are worse here! How could you leave me now that I need you the most?” Then he heard the voice of God, “I’m still here.” But the man said, “No, I was seeing your footprints all along; but you’ve stopped. All I see now are my footprints.” Then God said, “No, the footprints that you see aren’t your footprints; they’re mine, because I’m now carrying you.”</p>
<p>What a soul-stirring response from the Lord! How loving our God is! Even when we’re not aware, and it looks like He’s left us, He’s there. The man was crying because he thought he was alone. But God was carrying him. He has said, “…I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (Hebrews 13:5). At the most difficult part of the journey, He’ll carry you.

<p>.
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth (John 4:24).</p>
<p>When we talk about worship, there’re those who don’t understand what it is. They wonder, “Who do you worship?” “Why do you worship?” “What are the benefits of worship?”
Worship is the recognition and appreciation of the goodness, blessings, kindness and righteousness of God. It’s the recognition, appreciation or confession of His character. For example, when you give thanks to God and say, “Lord, you’re good; you’re kind; you’ve blessed me; you’re righteous,” etc., you’re defining, recognizing, and appreciating His character.</p>
<p>God likes it when you worship Him like that because it shows who He is in your life; it separates Him from everyone else and from everything else. When you thank Him for His goodness, provisions, blessings, and all the wonderful things He’s given you, and done for you, you’re attributing those beautiful works to Him. The necessary result is that He’ll do more in your life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, worship brings to us a greater revelation of God. This is why we worship God and not men, angels or things. Neither men nor angels have the capacity or ability to reveal themselves beyond what they themselves can perceive. You can’t grow spiritually from knowing an angel or another human being; no human can reflect you to you, because every human being is unique to himself. But in fellowship, God reveals Himself to you, and in that process, He reveals you to you, and also reveals your future, your life, your personality, your value and then His purpose for your life.</p>
<p>That’s why when you study the Bible and read of men and women who encountered God, they all had a divine revelation of God’s purpose for their lives, an understanding of the future that God was leading them into, and a revelation of God Himself. Thus, worship for us is something much more than a form, a ritual or mere religious activity. When we worship God, there’s true recognition, a true perception, and real encounter with Deity.</p>
<p>When you’re in church and it’s time for worship, or when you worship in your closet, give it your attention; worship the Lord in reality, with this understanding.</p>

Romans 12:6-8 says, “Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy…Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation….” So, we’re given gifts, special abilities, according to the grace that God gives us, showing that there’re different measures of grace, depending on what He tells us to do.</p>
<p>For example, if as a minister, you started out by reaching a certain number of people, God will give you the grace to handle that number. When you’re to reach ten times that number of people, what He does for you is to give you more grace, not more anointing or more power.</p>
<p>There’s nowhere in the Bible He tells us He’ll give us more power or more anointing. What power could be more than the Holy Spirit who already lives in us? He’s the power of God! However, James tells us in our opening verse, “…he giveth more grace….”What is grace? It’s the divine influence on a man’s spirit. It’s the outworking or outward reflection of that inward divine influence: the beauty, ability, perfection, excellence, virtue and glory of divinity in your human spirit.</p>
<p>The problem some have had is the misuse of language. What many call anointing is actually grace, but they don’t realise it. They’ll say, “God has given me a greater anointing,” no; He didn’t! He gave you more grace. That means His power that’s inside you is released more now on the outside, on the basis of His calling on your life.</p>
<p>You can walk in increased grace and accomplish more for the Lord! You can have His beauty, glory, and goodness released in your life in increasing measure, and the scripture tells us how: it’s by your humility, submission to the Word, and faithfulness in the things He’s called you to do.</p>

For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me (Hebrews 10:4-5).
When you study the twenty-ninth to the thirtieth chapter of the Book of Exodus, you’d find how that the Lord gave the children of Israel certain instructions, and asked that they rendered sin offering, burnt offerings and incense. These were to be done every day.
However, God wasn’t pleased with the sacrifice and offerings of these animals; He wanted the perfect sacrifice: Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Over in the New Testament, Jesus became our sin offering. He was offered for us as one sacrifice, forever. We never need to offer animals to God anymore. Hebrews 10:14 says,  “For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.” He wasn’t just the perfect sacrifice; His sacrifice perfected us.
The Psalmist, David, gives us a light into this and tells us something striking in Psalm 141:2. He said, “Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.” Being a prophet, he had a revelation of the future and the new dispensation that should come into effect after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
The sanctuary of the old covenant was going to be removed and replaced. What then would take the place of the incense that was offered to God regularly, and the sacrifices that He commanded the priests to offer morning and evening?
It’s our prayers of worship and the lifting up of our hands! God says this should be perpetual; it should never cease. It’s the reason we worship Him always, with our hands lifted. Every time you worship the Lord, especially when you do it in the spirit, that is, in other tongues, your prayers go to Him as incense. The Bible says, “And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand” (Revelation 8:4)
.
As you lift your hands to Him, eulogizing and making confessions to His Name, it’s like the evening sacrifice, a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice that pleases God. And we’re to do this every day.</p>

<p>QUESTION – John Jeff Momoh (Sierra Leone): I want to know if deliverance is necessary for a Christian especially when you think of the African background and the ceremonies and rituals performed. Why don’t you preach on deliverance?</p>
<p>ANSWER: He’s asking me “Why don’t I preach on deliverance?” {Smiling} Well, I do preach on deliverance; I may not preach the kind of deliverance that you might be thinking about, but I believe the Word of God brings us deliverance [really]. And, once we receive Christ, we are delivered! That’s what it’s all about! See, the Gospel is a gospel of deliverance – you are automatically delivered. Now, when we receive Christ, we receive Him as Lord of our lives. You have to understand this – how we got salvation. In Romans Chapter 10 verse 9, the Bible says “If thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in thine heart that God raised him up from the dead, thou shall be saved.” Now that means that Jesus Christ has become Lord of your life! If He’s become Lord of your life – and by that, you became saved – then what do you need to be delivered from anymore? That is the deliverance! The Lordship of Jesus Christ over your life is what broke the dominion of Satan from your life completely because Jesus became your Lord! You cannot have Jesus as Lord of your life, and at the same time have Satan lording it over you. So that’s the deliverance! So the gospel of Jesus Christ already brought deliverance!</p>
<p>Deliverance</p>
<p>Now, it doesn’t matter what kind of background, like you talked about fetish background, African rituals and all those things that people used to perform; when you become a Christian, the Bible says in 2nd Corinthians Chapter 5 and verse 17: “…if any man be in Christ, he is a new creation” automatically! Then it says “… old things have passed away and all things have become new.” So, that’s why the Christian does not need deliverance. The Christian has already gotten his deliverance when he made Jesus Christ the Lord of his life! When you became a Christian, you already received your deliverance into Christ. So now you’re in Christ! The trouble with a lot of people is that, even though they are in Christ, they still have the mentality of bondage; they still have the mentality of the oppressed; they have the mentality of satanic strongholds.</p>
<p>This is their problem, not because what they are experiencing is real – they are experiencing a mirage! You see, and you know, Jesus said: “Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” [John 8:32] The truth is vital. So, the Bible already tells us that he begot us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So we are into that living hope today by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And remember, when Jesus died, we died with him; when he was buried, we were buried with him; when God raised him from the dead, we were raised together with him! So today we have a new life in Christ. We are no longer in bondage. We don’t need that deliverance anymore. So, when you became a Christian, you were completely delivered. Now you don’t need another deliverance; Jesus Christ is Lord of your life! He’s already your Lord; you don’t need another deliverance. So, I preach deliverance, just not the way you were thinking I should.</p>

<p>Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place (2 Corinthians 2:14).</p>
<p>In Psalm 7:17, David said, “I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.” Looking back at the passed 6 months, our hearts are filled with gratitude to the Lord for all the extraordinary accomplishments we had both as a ministry and in our individual lives.</p>
<p>Irrespective and independent of the situation or your immediate circumstances, you should give thanks to the Father. Worship and praise Him, no matter what! The Bible says, “In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you” (1 Thessalonians 5:18). “In everything” means “in every situation”; you’re to give Him thanks in, and for, all things.</p>
<p>When you look at the passed 6 months in retrospect, be joyful and excited in your spirit, thankful to the Lord for all He’s done for you. Count your blessings. Don’t muse over the disappointments or things you wished you had accomplished but that you didn’t. Rather, rejoice over what He’s done for you and celebrate your accomplishments.</p>
<p>Remember, we walk by faith, and not by sight; joy is an expression of your faith. In rejoicing and giving thanks to the Lord, you’re getting His attention on your faith. Sometimes, we give thanks in expectation. That’s why He tells us, “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6-7 NKJV).</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="glorified-by-pastor-chris609">GLORIFIED! By Pastor Chris~609<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to GLORIFIED!

<p>“For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified” (Romans 8:29-30).</p>
<p>There are Christians who are reaching out for the glory, always praying and asking for the glory of God to come down. Sometimes, in a church service, a singer could even be called to sing in order to “bring the glory down.” They fail to realize that the one who’s born again is born into the glory of God. We’re the Church of Jesus Christ, and the Lord Jesus has given us the glory: “And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one” (John 17:22). So, you don’t need anyone to bring the glory down. You’ve been glorified.</p>
<p>Imagine you were in a room or outside somewhere, and someone said, “Let’s bring air into this place”; that wouldn’t make sense. However, some people may start looking for where the air is going to come in through, but the truth is they had been breathing the air all the while, even though they weren’t conscious of it. Now that we’re used to certain things, like air, it doesn’t mean we should no longer be conscious of their reality. But blessed be God! The glory of God in us isn’t such that we can ignore. That glory is in our spirit; it increases as we pray, study, and meditate on the Word of God.</p>
<p>Psalms 87:3 says, “Glorious things are spoken of thee O city of God.” That refers to you—the new creation in Christ Jesus, you’re the city of God. Glorious things are spoken of you in the Word: glorious things about your heritage, placement, ability, liberty, and privileges in Christ Jesus. Your responsibility is to look into the Word to locate, and enter into, the glorious things that are written of you, and fulfill your destiny. Your destiny is in the Word of God, and it’s been settled; it’s not determined by your family background, country of residence or the government of the day. You’ve been destined for greatness, set apart for a life of victory and triumph from glory to glory.</p>
<p>1 John 4:4 says, “Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.” This means your origin is in God; you hail from Him, and you’re already victorious over Satan and the adversities of life. This is your destiny. Personalize this and other glorious things written of you in the Word, and walk in the light of them.</p>
<p>Another way to walk as the glorified one is to worship Him. God’s glory changes constantly and continuously on His throne. The angelic beings see His glory and bow in worship. By the time they raise their heads, the glory has changed, and they bow again; this continues throughout eternity (Revelation 7:11-12). Something beautiful happens when we behold the glory of God and worship Him. The more of His glory we see, the more glorious we become; the more we’re beautified by His glory, and we can’t but glorify Him again. Through worship, our spiritual eyes are opened to behold the glory of God.</p>
<p>Incidentally, when we see His glory, we see our glory. That’s why God tells us to worship Him; it’s so we can behold His glory and be glorified. You can expect miracles when you worship Him because, then, your eyes are opened to see what you’d never have seen any other way. You’re the glory of God, and He demonstrates His manifold wisdom through you!</p>
<p>Walk in the glory; live in the consciousness of who you are in Christ. You have been glorified!</p>

<p>“But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word” (Acts 6:4)</p>
<p>Christians must strive at having effective prayer lives. Prayer is not only a fellowship, it’s also a labour. That’s why I think it’s ridiculous to think we should pray only when we feel like.</p>
<p>Then again, because prayer doesn’t appeal to our minds and senses, our bodies and minds may not enjoy praying and can even rebel against it. Many times we put off praying till the end of the day but the time we’re through with the activities of the day, we’re tired and drowsy and our thoughts start wandering while we’re praying. This is where the labour comes into prayer, this is where the fight is, but it’s not a fight with devils or men, neither is it a fight with God. It’s a fight to keep yourself on track against the dictate of the flesh.</p>
<p>This takes training and so you must be resolved to stick with your personal prayer schedule. Some Christians find it almost impossible to do this simply because they’ve not been able to discipline their flesh. They go to work everyday of the week without ever considering getting to work late, much less not going at all. If you can train your mind and body to do this then you can train yourself to pray regularly and on time too.</p>
<p>The problem is that too many aren’t willing to make such a sacrifice for their prayer lives, and that’s because they don’t know the importance of prayer. But when trouble comes, they’re the first to cry, “Please, pray for me!” Don’t depend on ’emergency prayers’, consistency is the key.</p>
<p>MAKE A FRESH COMMITMENT TO YOUR PERSONAL PRAYER LIFE TODAY. There are so many things that will compete with your prayer time, but there’s so much you can achieve on your knees. So, stay connected to God, and maintain a disciplined prayer LIFE.</p>

<p>And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit.  EPHESIANS 1:13  (NIV)</p>
<p>A seal is a sign or symbol of ownership. Whoever receives Jesus is marked with God&#x27;s seal guaranteeing that God owns him, that he is a true son of God. In churches, offices and workplaces, properties such as cars, furniture, TV sets are acquired and marked with the name of the organization. That is a form of a seal on the property and it implies that a property still belongs to a particular organization even if it is found outside the confines of that organization.</p>
<p>In a similar way, we have been sealed by God right from the day of salvation. Though God does not want us to be at the wrong places, we remain his even if we find ourselves at wrong places, his seal on us is indelible, nothing can change it. The Holy Spirit in us is our seal or guarantee that we forever belong to God.</p>
<p>God does not make mistakes and so if he seals you on the day of salvation, his seal on you remains eternally, regardless of your good deeds or bad deeds. We were purchase with the precious blood of Jesus. God cannot sell us back, no one can buy us back and since we are not our own, we cannot sell ourselves. This is how secure we are in God’s custody. It does not also mean we should live anyhow.</p>
<p>I have God&#x27;s indelible seal on me and that is enough guarantee of my eternal security.</p>

<p>Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret (1 Corinthians 14:13).</p>
<p>The Bible says Jesus Christ is the embodiment of all knowledge and wisdom (Colossians 2:3); and you’re complete in Him (Colossians 2:10). This is what makes it possible for you to know anything through the Holy Spirit. I admonish God’s people to speak in tongues all the time, because it’s the coded language of the Spirit! It’s the quickest way to activate and condition your spirit to receive spiritual information and guidance.</p>
<p>Perhaps you require guidance for something, or there’s a piece of information you need; speak in tongues. Go on until you know you’ve got the guidance or counsel you need, or the information you require. The answer may be given to you in your spirit, in other tongues. In that case, you’ll require the gift of interpretation of tongues. This is important because if you can’t interpret the answer in your understanding, you may not be able to apply it to your benefit. In that case, you’d have to ask the Holy Spirit to help you bring the message to your understanding in prophetic utterance.</p>
<p>If you thought you were blessed speaking in tongues, wait until you receive the interpretation! The Bible says, “Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret” (1 Corinthians 14:13); it’s that simple! Ask the Lord in faith for the interpretation of the tongues you’re speaking, receive the interpretation by faith and speak it forth in your understanding.</p>

<p>“Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.”
John   6:27   KJV</p>
<p>THE MYSTERY OF THE SEAL</p>
<p>Some have said stupid things about the mystery of the seal that caused the faith of so many Christians</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a seal ? We may be talking  about two kinds of seal or three now ..ceiling like under your roof , under a bottle and like a stamp .</p>
<p>The one like a stamp is like a mark of authenticity, security</p>
<p>It means approval ; Jesus was approved by God . God the father sealed Him meaning that God has His mark on Him as His Son and one with authority to give life</p>
<p>What is that meat that ensures unto everlasting life ? The Word of God,<br>
<!-- -->And he told us my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink so God the father sealed..He is the one appointed to give life</p>
<p>Because He was sealed by God remember something the Bible tells us several times even when they wanted to lay their hands on him when it was not yet his time , they couldn’t   ….No one takes his life He lays it down himself<br>
<!-- -->He stands before anything of nature and they obeyed Him .If Jesus was sealed then When was He sealed? How do we know He was sealed at the time ?<br>
<!-- -->How do we know ? How can we tell? Do you know?</p>
<p>On one occasion you would remember that the Bible says that Jesus was baptized by John and when he came out of water the Holy Spirit of God defended on him and he was filled with the Holy Ghost and God said this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.God said it because he has to prove it for the benefit of those  there, for demons and all of nature</p>
<p>Remember when Jesus went to the mountain..</p>
<p>“And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light. And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid. And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only. And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead.”
Matthew   17:1-9   KJV</p>
<p>After that the voice disappeared meaning he was not about to preach a sermon and not just for Peter and those there ..it was said because he sealed him..</p>
<p>When man fell he lost his authority to Satan he lost control ..now God commands everyone must hear Jesus .So Jesus talks to the water , the wind , bread , blind eyes. Even the dead everything responds to Jesus because he was sealed by God .And as long he was sealed by God no one could touch Him</p>
<p>This is one thing I received from my father he gave me power to lay my life down…

<p>BE FOCUSED~636</p>
<p>I remember vividly, in 1999, we were having a prayer and fasting meeting, and the Spirit of God said something to me which I was to take with me in my journey through life; He said to me, ‘don’t look around’. I picked it immediately in my spirit that He wanted me focused, and not to look around. He didn’t want me looking around, trying to measure or compare myself with others.
Same thing I’ll say to you today; don’t look around; stay focused. When you are focused, God can channel His blessings to you in a remarkable way because you are in line with His calling and purpose for your life. Some people get confused in their lives because they look away from the path God has laid for them, and into other people’s assignments and calling.
How many meetings did Jesus have with John the Baptist? Wasn’t it the same God that sent both Jesus and John? How come Jesus didn’t look for ways to bring John into his ministry and start collaborating with him, except when John was to baptize him, after which there was no other meeting?
Jesus was focused, so stay focused. If you are sent to a city, you are there to take the whole city. Everyone else may be angry; they might even say, ‘these Christ Embassy people, they act as if they are the only ones’. Well, we were not told to find out what others are doing; we were told what we are to do, and we should be about it without looking around. That’s the way you should live and carry out your ministerial work. Be very focused!</p>
<p>Hallelujah!</p>

<p>ICLC with Pastor Chris.
Day 1, Session 1~645</p>
<p>Reverend Chris.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re like the Son of Man, yo seek and save them which are lost.
I&#x27;m a soul winner. That is my mentality.
ACTS 20:20 VISION.
Every person represents a house.
They are people who have bee more passionate about their business, than they have been passionate about soul winning.
IT&#x27;S TIME TO REORDER YOUR PRIORITIES. GOD FIRST, after that, everything else.
He didn&#x27;t tell us what is number two or three. If you can get No1 in the right place; everything else will fall into place.</p>
<p>From this time on; FROM NOW ON, GOD FIRST.
THIS IS HOW YOU WILL BE THINKING; God first.
Jesus is the wisdom of God. The wisdom of God talking. Impossible for Him to be wrong. For He is God&#x27;s righteousness.
Matthew 6:33</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t say after seeking the seek the kingdom of God, go and seek after other things, because He knows that when you find the kingdom of God, you find that it is not an empty kingdom.
It has all of God&#x27;s wealth. It&#x27;s got everything in it.</p>
<p>What did you get from Jesus&#x27; instruction in Matthew 6:33;
No1 Is priority.</p>
<p>Each strand of hair on your hair is numbered. Meaning it has a code number.
If any falls of, the Father knows which one it is. You don&#x27;t even take that record, yet the Father knows it.</p>
<p>OUR BEST MESSAGE OF JESUS IS OUR EXPERIENCE OF HIM.
The kingdom of God is us. God is in us. We are the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>He has set eternity in our hearts. How far our spirits can go is beyond this real.
How big is God? What&#x27;s your imagination of God?
Jesus said if you seen me; you&#x27;ve seen the Father. If you want to think about God&#x27;s size, think about Jesus&#x27; size.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s absolutely ominipotent. He&#x27;s all knowing. He&#x27;s absolutely light. He is knowledge personified. He is wisdom personified.</p>
<p>Our minds were not fashioned to be able to reason God out.
To the sun, to the moon, Jesus is a voice. They realate to him as a voice.
When you think about Jesus; think beyond the body of a Jew.
Think of Him as the Word. And that&#x27;s the only way you can know you. There&#x27;s no other way to know you; you&#x27;re a mystery.</p>
<p>God is truth. Every other thing is but a shadow. God is truth.
The true colour of anything will only be known under the true light.
John 1:1-9</p>
<p>My spirit is light.
How great is God&#x27;s spiritual universe.
This physical world as great as it is is only a part of God&#x27;s spirit world.
SPIRIT WORLD.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:24 (AMP)
Men loose things. God don&#x27;t loose nothing.
STOP THINKING LIKE MEN.
Philippians 4:6</p>
<p>God is not raising some of us to be champions and preachers for you.
We are a kingdom of priests. King-Priests. A Royal Priesthood.</p>
<p>The millennial reign of peace is for God to completely fulfil His promise to Abraham and his physical seed, Israel.</p>
<p>The preaching of the Word brings the manifestation of the truth.
Titus 1:1-3
These blessings of God that are in the Word can only be brought to experience by the Church through preaching.</p>

For I have made the heavens and the earth, and everything that has been made. The world is mine, and I have given it to you. I have given you my Word and I am your strength. I am your life.</p>
<p>Have no fear, for I am with you. Have no fear. Fear not the night, nor the darkness. For the darkness has no power over you, and the wicked shall not overcome you.</p>

<p>Walk in the light of my Word. I have made you victorious in all things, therefore walk in victory. Walk in the consciousness of your victory.

<p>I have exalted you, saith the Lord; I will demonstrate my glory before you and men shall know that you are mine. For you shall show forth my praise, saith the Lord, and your mouth shall be filled with testimonies of my goodness.” Hallelujah! Glory to God!!</p>

<p>...When you say “You know, I’m from a poor family. I’m poor I’m nothing. I’m just an ordinary man.” They’ll say it’s true. They like it because they rate you with what they see. Yet if you come and say “HEY!! HELLO!!” First the sound of that voice would disturb them because poor men don’t talk happy. They never talk happy always complaining.</p>
<p>The life that is in you has no colour. This is the thing that is shaking the world. A lot of them are wondering about some of us. I’m talking about Africans, Asians and American and so on and so forth. They are looking at us suspiciously and wonder Why do they talk the way they do? Who gave them something to eat?</p>
<p>We found out! We found out that the colour of the skin has nothing to do with your nature. We found out that anybody could be anything with this. Jesus said it and Jesus never lied to anybody. He was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Anybody can use his tongue and get out of trouble. It doesn’t matter whether you were born in a hut. It has got nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Every day you look at yourself in the mirror and say “Father in the name of Jesus I refuse to be poor. I will not live the down life. I’m going somewhere” Talk to the guy on the other side of the mirror.</p>
<p>Listen, what I’m sharing with you I discovered many years ago and that’s how I got to where I am and that’s how I’m going where I’m going. I stand there and I say “I’m going and nobody can stop me! I’m going to sponsor the gospel to the whole world. I’m doing it.”</p>
<p>Don’t say nobody knows tomorrow. Your tomorrow is assured. You should know it. It is assured.</p>
<p>Joh 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit will show you the things to come tomorrow. If you haven’t seen, listen to him. Then if you still haven’t heard listen hard. Still no voice? Listen very hard. Then even if you haven’t heard anything, stop everything you are doing and give your full and I said full attention to Him. With all that you’ve got. All your heart, your whole mind and your whole body.</p>
<p>Stop cooking, turn off your phone, shut down the laptop, remove your shoes, take your Bible, get somewhere you can be alone even inside the bathroom – just you and the Holy Spirit and no one else. Get to a remote area or get to your room and shut the doors and windows. Just you, your Bible and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Stop thinking about food, rent, homework, laundry, gardening, work for tomorrow. You don’t care, whether if you miss work tomorrow, whether you are going to miss your exam tomorrow, whether the landlord is coming to collect the rent, whether you are getting so hungry and you’ll die of hunger, whether your boss is going to fire you– you don’t care! Until you hear His voice you’re not getting up.</p>
<p>Nothing but Him and Him only. Begin to talk to him through the Bible. Praise him for his mighty works. Thank him for all he’s given you. Thank him for the glorious salvation and the liberty you are experiencing.</p>
<p>Then speak in tongues. Then shut up! Unless you have the interpretation of the tongues which is prophecy. If not, wait. Quietly.</p>
<p>Listen very carefully inside your heart. Wait till you hear his voice. Then every once in a while talk to him. Thank him for the life and revelation that he has given to you...hallelujah God bless you richly.</p>

<p>(PRESENT YOUR REQUESTS WITH THANKSGIVING!)~650</p>
<p>“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” - PHILIPPIANS 4:6-7
One rainy morning, Cindy woke to take her morning devotion. Instead of thanking the Lord for all the beautiful things He had done for her in the year, she complained and whined about several things she deemed unanswered: “Lord, I’m so worried about what’s going to happen in the New Year for my education; I want to get into the university, will you help me?” She didn’t thank Him in anticipation of an answer after the prayer.</p>
<p>There’re times people pray and make requests about certain things; maybe about their family or health, or something that deeply bothers them, and it seems things aren’t changing. The missing link could be that they’re not presenting their requests and supplications with “thanksgiving.” Read our opening verse again carefully, and you’ll notice that your prayer and supplication have to be with thanksgiving. When you present your request in that manner, what follows is the peace of God that surpasses all understanding: “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:7). This is remarkable! The kind of peace that people wonder at, will guard your heart and mind when you present your requests and supplications to the Lord “with thanksgiving.”
Those around you won’t understand why you can be so at peace and in control, in spite of oppositions, challenges and contrary winds that may come your way. Present your special requests and supplications to the Lord, with thanksgiving. Don’t beg; don’t complain. Ask, receive, and be full of joy. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Q&amp;A SESSION WITH PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~652</p>
<p>QUESTION – Chinwe (USA): Pastor, I thank God for your life. Your teachings have impacted my life and that of my family positively, and I thank you very much. My question is about the blood of Jesus. Is it right to pray with it? For example, covering your house, children and so on with the blood of Jesus.</p>
<p>ANSWER: Well, this is one of those many things that a lot of Christians have wrongly applied to their lives because of ignorance. They go shouting the blood of Jesus, and they say “I sprinkle the blood of Jesus.” You don’t have the authority to sprinkle the blood of Jesus. In fact, where did you get the blood from? You have no access to that blood. Jesus Christ presented His blood to God in Heaven, in the most Holy Place in Heaven, at the Mercy Seat in Heaven. You have no access to it. Only the High Priest could sprinkle the blood, only the High Priest. You’ve got to understand that. And before the office of that High Priest was established, Moses was the one who sprinkled everything with the blood of calves back in the Old Testament.  This is very important. Who has the right to sprinkle the blood? It’s not the Christians sprinkling the blood on himself or on anyone else. It’s just the talk; they have no access to the blood. Let me show you something from the Bible very quickly. The Bible calls it the blood of sprinkling. Okay.</p>
<p>So, I’ll like to go straight to Hebrew chapter 9 from verse 19, “For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people, Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. Moreover, he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry. And almost all things are by the law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood is no remission. It was, therefore, necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.[Praise God!] For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:”[Hebrews 9:19-24]  That’s wonderful. It says Moses functioned in the type and Moses sprinkled all things with blood; it was Moses who did that. He didn’t say all the Hebrews sprinkled themselves with blood. They were God’s covenant people, but they weren’t going around sprinkling themselves with blood. That was a responsibility for Moses; afterward, the High Priest did it. Now when I say the High Priest, it is important for us…it’s just the ministry of the blood at the Mercy Seat, but no longer really having to sprinkle the law because that was the beginning of the testament, so Moses had to do it. But, I want you to follow this [Hebrews] because it did say that Jesus Christ didn’t enter into the figure but into Heaven itself to appear before God for us.</p>
<p>blood of Jesus</p>
<p>In Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 24 it says,“And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant [Moses was the mediator of the old covenant; Jesus is the mediator of the new covenant], and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. [Hebrews 12:24]” Let me read to you from Hebrews chapter 8 verse 6, “But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant [talking about Jesus], which was established upon better promises. [Hebrews 8:6]” Jesus Christ is the mediator of this better covenant. So it’s Jesus. Let’s go to chapter 9, Hebrews chapter 9. Now you can catch the whole picture. From verse 14, let me take it from verse 13, “For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:  How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience f</p>

<p>“My whole being shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips when I remember You upon my bed and meditate on You in the night watches. For You have been my help, and in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice.” Psalm 63:5-7 AMPC</p>
<p>Your quiet time is a special time of the day you set aside to be quiet before the Lord. It’s not a time to ponder on all that happened during the day or recollect something nasty someone said to you. Instead, it’s a time to be still so the Holy Spirit can speak to you. To have a fruitful ‘quiet time,’ you need to isolate yourself from your friends, TV, phones, computers, the Internet – everything – and wait on the Lord, studying His Word and thinking on Him.</p>
<p>The Bible gives us several examples of people who practised quiet time. One such person was Isaac. He often went out into the fields to have a time alone with God. Even the Lord Jesus made a habit of going up the mountain or some other quiet place to be alone with the Father. You may not readily find such a solitary place to go to today, but ‘quiet time’ is not so much a physical thing as it is mental and spiritual. In other words, it’s not where your body is that matters, but the inner working of your mind. It’s a mental and spiritual activity.</p>
<p>Choose a good time when you can step away from the busyness of the day and give God ample attention. If you’d give God this time every day, He’ll make you a wonder! He’ll position you in His perfect will for your life. You’ll also begin to see visions, such that when you’re done with your quiet time, you’ll know exactly what to do!</p>

<p>When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them (Acts 5:33 ).</p>
<p>In our opening scripture, Peter had ministered the Gospel to a group of people, and rather than give their hearts to Christ, the people wanted to kill him. That’s why it’s important that before you go out to preach, you intercede for the people you’re going to be ministering to; pray that your message will be accepted and won’t just be a witness against them.</p>
<p>It brings to mind the experience of Stephen in the Book of Acts. He ministered a powerful sermon, full of excellent theology and history. Yet when he was done, the Bible says the people “…were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth” (Acts 7:54). They shut their ears to his message and ran upon him to kill him, and eventually stoned him to death.</p>
<p>Just because the message is great doesn’t mean people will be moved enough to give their hearts to Christ; they didn’t in Stephen’s case. So, before you embark on any evangelical mission or outreach programme, prevail first in prayer, because it’s about the souls of men and the impact the message will have on them, resulting in their salvation.</p>
<p>When you intercede like that, the love of God in you wells up, striving against sin, Satan, and the forces of darkness, and the souls of men are rescued from evil. At that moment, you’re God’s champion; the deliverer.</p>
<p>When you’ve succeeded in bringing them out of that darkness in the spirit, you’ll know it. Then you’re ready to go. Your message may just be for five or twenty minutes, it doesn’t matter; while you’re at it, they’ll be getting convicted and crying out for salvation. This is important. Learn to prevail first in prayer.</p>

<p>“How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him” (Acts 10:38)</p>
<p>Something beautiful that happens in your spirit as you pray is that the Holy Spirit causes the anointing to well up strongly within you. At such times, the words you speak go forth as the sword of the Spirit with which you cut the enemy down and overcome every adversity. As a child of God you’re anointed. Through that anointing you can achieve anything. But not many are conscious of the fact that there’s an anointing at work in their lives.</p>
<p>This was what made the Lord Jesus different from everyone else during His earthly ministry. Remember, though He was the Son of God, He ministered as the son of man while He was on earth. Until the Holy Spirit came upon Him at the River Jordan (John 1:32-33), He didn’t perform a single miracle. The anointing of the Holy Spirit upon His life gave Him the ability to do the mighty works He did.</p>
<p>That same anointing is what you received when the Holy Spirit came to live in you. That anointing is what makes you more than a man, and it’s important for you to be conscious of that anointing always. The more you pray in other tongues, the more the consciousness of your divine origin dawns on your spirit. This consciousness helps you see, think, say and do things ordinary men can’t.</p>
<p>Remember, the anointing of the Spirit in your life makes your life supernatural; therefore become conscious of the anointing! Take time often to pray in the Spirit, and as you do the anointing will well up in you, inspiring in you the ability to change your world.</p>

<p>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church (1 Corinthians 14:4).</p>
<p>Speaking in tongues is so important for us as Christians. The Bible says, “For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people. To whom he said, this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing…” (Isaiah 28:11-12). Peter describes it as “…the times of refreshing….” (Acts 3:19). There’s refreshing, rejuvenation, and flourishing for the one who consistently speaks in tongues.</p>
<p>Also, speaking in tongues improves you. The Amplified version of our opening verse says, “He who speaks in a [strange] tongue edifies and improves himself….” When you speak in tongues, you become sensitive to spiritual realities; you’re synchronised with the Spirit, and His voice becomes clear to you. Some people say they don’t know when God is talking to them. If they’ll speak in tongues, their spirits will become sensitive to God, to hear and understand His Word.</p>
<p>Another important benefit of speaking in tongues is the purification of your faith. (Jude 1:20) says, “But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit” (AMP). Your most holy faith is your most sanctified faith; unalloyed faith, devoid of doubt or fear. It’s your highest, purest, and best expression of your faith so far. God expects you to build on that “most holy faith” through speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul revealed speaking in tongues as one of his secrets of success in ministry. He was bold to tell the Corinthian church, “I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all” (1 Corinthians 14:18). It goes to show how much he spoke in tongues. No wonder, he was so successful. Choose to speak in tongues more than ever. Edify your spirit. Improve yourself spiritually. Flourish and make progress in your life, with speaking in tongues!</p>

<p>“My whole being shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips when I remember You upon my bed and meditate on You in the night watches. For You have been my help, and in the shadow of Your wings will I rejoice.” (Psalm 63:5-7 AMPC)</p>
<p>Your quiet time is a special time of the day you set aside to be quiet before the Lord. It’s not a time to ponder on all that happened during the day or recollect something nasty someone said to you. Instead, it’s a time to be still so the Holy Spirit can speak to you. To have a fruitful ‘quiet time,’ you need to isolate yourself from your friends, TV, phones, computers, the Internet – everything – and wait on the Lord, studying His Word and thinking on Him.</p>
<p>The Bible gives us several examples of people who practised quiet time. One such person was Isaac. He often went out into the fields to have a time alone with God. Even the Lord Jesus made a habit of going up the mountain or some other quiet place to be alone with the Father. You may not readily find such a solitary place to go to today, but ‘quiet time’ is not so much a physical thing as it is mental and spiritual. In other words, it’s not where your body is that matters, but the inner working of your mind. It’s a mental and spiritual activity.</p>
<p>Choose a good time when you can step away from the busyness of the day and give God ample attention. If you’d give God this time every day, He’ll make you a wonder! He’ll position you in His perfect will for your life. You’ll also begin to see visions, such that when you’re done with your quiet time, you’ll know exactly what to do!</p>

<p>According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him (Ephesians 3:11-12).</p>
<p>Some people marvel at us sometimes when we pray, wondering why we could be so audacious and confident. The reason we pray with such authority and audacity of faith is that we pray in the Name of Jesus. In John 14:13, Jesus said, “...whatsoever ye shall ASK IN MY NAME, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.”</p>
<p>The key is asking in His Name; living in the authority of His Name. Many, lacking this understanding pray “through” Jesus, instead of praying “in” the Name of Jesus. There  ’s a great difference between the two. When you pray in the Name of Jesus, you’re exercising the full legal powers He gave you to act in His stead. But to pray through Him is to make Him a medium, which isn’t required now that you’re in Him.</p>
<p>When you understand and have the consciousness, of the power and import of the Name of Jesus, and what it represents, you won’t have to try to “squeeze” up faith when you need it. When you pray or make demands in His Name, it’s as though Jesus Himself were speaking; everything responds to you the same way they would respond to Jesus. The angels, demon spirits, and all of nature respond to you as though they were hearing directly from Jesus.</p>
<p>In Matthew 17:5, the Father spoke from heaven: “…This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.” He was telling all of creation, all of nature animate and inanimate to hear and obey Jesus. So, when Jesus said to ask anything in His Name and it’d happen, it was against this backdrop. He meant that His power would be behind our demands, prayers, requests, and instructions, to bring them to pass. This is the reason for our boldness and confidence in prayer.</p>

<p>1 John 2-21 NIV “As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit-just as it has taught you, remain in him.”</p>
<p>Have you heard some people utter this statement: “The majority can’t be wrong”? Sounds like its true, but it’s not. For example, when the people in Noah’s day saw him building an ark, they thought he was out of his mind. “How can the world be destroyed by a flood; it’s not going to happen. You’re just wasting your time,” they mocked. Imagine if Noah had decided to follow the voice of the people, because of their numbers, instead of obeying God; he and his family would have been destroyed by the flood.</p>
<p>You see, it matters what you hear and who you follow in life. God doesn’t work by numbers or popular demand. He speaks in harmony with His Word. And as His child, He expects you to follow His Word and not what other people say. Moreover, He’s given you His Spirit to lead you aright. The Holy Spirit is your greatest friend and teacher; He’s the One who guides you into all reality and makes God’s presence real to you. So, the best thing you can do for yourself is to continually follow Him. No other personality in life is worth following but the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>But to follow God, you’ve got to yield yourself to His Word and do what it says. It will help you learn to discern the voice of the Spirit from the voice of men. Then you’ll find yourself making the best decisions and right choices always. You’ll always do the right thing the first time, be at the right place at the right time and live an inspiring life.</p>

<p>“My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me”- John 10:27</p>
<p>One question many Christians have sought answer for is: “How do I know when the Holy Spirit is talking to me?” The first and most important thing is to receive the Holy Spirit into your heart. When this happens the Holy Spirit comes to dwell within you and mingles with your spirit. The Bible says, “he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit…”- (1 Corinthians 6:17), thus you become one with Him. Soon, you’ll hear His voice talking to you from your spirit. Romans 8:16 says the Spirit, “beareth witness with our spirit”; so you’ll have the witness in your spirit that He’s the one talking to you. He is the best One to teach you how to know His voice, so first you receive Him, then He’ll be the One to talk to you and teach you to recognize His voice.</p>
<p>Another important thing to do in knowing the voice of the Spirit is to learn the Word of God, for His voice bears witness with the Word. He never says anything outside the Word. Whatever He tells you is always in sync with the written Word, and consistent with God’s will for your life. John 16:13 says, “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.” If you’re acquainted with the Word, you’ll know whenever the Holy Spirit talks to you, for He always bears witness with the Word, and the Word will always bear witness with Him. His voice and the Scriptures are one.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the Master Communicator and knows the best way to get your attention and talk to you when He needs to. The bible tells us for instance how He set a bush on fire to get Moses’ attention. The bush was burning all right, but it wasn’t consumed. When Moses moved closer to see the strange sight, the Lord spoke out of the bush, but said nothing about the fire. All He needed was Moses’ attention, and He got it. From then on, Moses never needed another burning bush to know when God was talking, for the Lord himself had taught him to discern His voice. He will do the same for you.</p>

<p>To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified (Isaiah 61:3).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was in the Synagogue on a certain day and was called up to read the Scriptures. He opened to the book of Isaiah, read the scripture above, and concluded by saying to the people: “…This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears” (Luke 4:21).</p>
<p>Today, that same scripture is fulfilled in us, the new creation in Christ Jesus. The Lord has produced in each one of us, trees of righteousness. We’re the planting of the Lord; He planted us in His garden and has made us co-workers with Him. 1 Corinthians 3:9 tells us, “…we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.” Meaning as Christians, we’re God’s field; we’re His garden, and in that field, there are trees and there are grasses. Zechariah 10:1 says, “Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.” Notice, the rain is to be poured on every one grass, but we’re trees. We’re in God’s farm yard as fellow labourers with God, as trees of righteousness, producing other trees of righteousness.</p>
<p>So, when I, as a tree of righteousness, produce other trees of righteousness and we be come trees of righteousness, we’re a fruitful field. And by the Holy Spirit, as we all continue to multiply, we become a forest. The Lord Jesus, when He read from Isaiah 61, said that scripture was fulfilled in His day. Now, Jesus Christ is gone to heaven and we’re walking in His shoes, in His steps. We’re the ones the Spirit of God is upon today, and like Jesus spoke back then, we too can say today, “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound.”</p>
<p>That’s our message to the world. He sent us with the Holy Spirit to go and preach His message and bring people out of bondage and out of darkness; to bind up the brokenhearted. That’s what we do as trees of righteousness. We bear fruits of righteousness.</p>

<p>ARE YOU STILL SPEAKING the ADAM OF EDEN&#x27;S LANGUAGE?
Change it!~683</p>
<p>IN the KINGDOM of God, ANGELS don&#x27;t UNDERSTAND that LANGUAGE!!! Its ERROR!!! &quot;And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree,
whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?&quot; (Genesis 3:11).
Adam was created with everything, he lacked nothing. In the Garden of Eden there was no language of lack, there were no prayers of supplication. There was no language of sickness. There was no death, there was no grief, no stress, no labour.
What a joy! So what... was the prayer life of Adam like, everyday God would visit him, OH WHAT A
LIFE!!!.</p>
<p>He NEVER ASKED FOR ANYTHING because he lacked nothing. GLORRYYYY!
BUT wait a minute, on this particular day GOD noticed something was wrong with Adam. WHAT WAS WRONG? Adams confession had changed. GOD had created him without lack or the word lack on his lips. GOD had given him everything BUT on this day Adam confessed that he was naked meaning he now lacked Clothes to cover him. GOD knew that was not language of the garden so he knew something was terribly wrong in the garden.
DISOBEDIENCE changed his language, it changed his mentality from an &#x27;I LACK NOTHING MENTALITY to a NAKEDNESS MENTALITY’. Which is why GOD asked him who had told him that he was naked since this was a STRANGE CONFESSION in the garden; they had never had such a conversation with GOD.
The word NAKED was UNHEARD of in the garden. GOD knew that Adam must have been having a conversation with someone else. JESUS came to reverse that which Adam had lost. He came to restore LIFE, He came to restore divine health, He came with another GARDEN in the FORM of the KINGDOM of GOD. Yet we still have Christians who still confess against the word of GOD, unbelieving believers.</p>
<p>By the same token, who told you that you are sick, that is strange language in the kingdom because the word of GOD says BY HIS STRIPES WE WERE HEALED. The bible says goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life! WHO told YOU that YOU have a curse. WHO told YOU that You lacked when the bible says The LORD IS My SHEPHERD I SHALL NOT WANT.
Who told YOU it&#x27;s impossible when the bible says WITH GOD ALL Things ARE POSSIBLE.</p>
<p>Who told YOU that YOU are broke when GOD your papa says silver and gold is his, He owns cattle on a thousand hills. Why are YOU asking him to protect YOU when he says he will never leave you nor forsake you. They have said you will not make it this year, they say YOU will die poor, they say YOU are cursed, they say YOu will never be married; they say u will remain barren. STOP IT!</p>
<p>Stop disobeying GOD by listening to the voice of the devil. Remember and take a HOLD of THIS!
I CAN DO ALL THINGS through Christ WHO STRENGTHENS ME! I&#x27;m the Head and not the TAIL. Let the WEAK say I’m STRONG, LEt the POOR say I’m RICH that is the LANGUAGE OF ZION.
STOP that STRANGE TALK!
The children of Israel could not see the Promised Land because of strange talk. Only Caleb, Joshua and all those who spoke the LANGUAGE OF ZION MADE IT.</p>
<p>DON&#x27;T KICK YOURSELF OUT OF The GARDEN OF EDEN and the promised Land by negative grasshopper mentality. JESUS is LORD, GOD IS WITH You and FOR YOU! Boy! YOU are a SUCCESS!!! Glory to GOD! YOU HAIL from ABOVE! LIVE the HIGHER LIFE! GLORY!!!!</p>

<p>&quot;And be not comformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God&quot; (Romans 12:2).~684</p>
<p>In Luke 24:36-39, the disciples were terrified when Jesus suddenly appeared amongst them for they thought they were seeing a ghost. Jesus knowing their hearts asked, &quot;...Why are you disturbed {and} troubled, and why do such doubts {and} questionings arise in your hearts?&quot; (Luke 24:38 AMP). The thoughts of fear arose in their hearts. This lets  us know that fear comes to us in the form of thoughts. Thoughts, on the other hand, are based on information and information comprises all that you receive through your senses.</p>
<p>As a result, you must take charge of your thoughts by carefully screening the information that fills your heart. You can&#x27;t afford to imbibe all the information available in the world into your mind and spirit if you want to live by the Spirit. The best information available in this world is for the most part contrary to the wisdom of God. No wonder 1 Corinthians 2:14 says, ..the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;</p>
<p>Medical science says,  &quot;You&#x27;re going to die for you have terminal cancer.&quot; Sure enough, the fellow dies and then they say, &quot;Well, we knew he was going to die.&quot; But that doesn&#x27;t make it true! Medicine has done so much to help man. However, medical knowledge is limited, whereas the wisdom of God is unlimited. There are several diseases like cancer, HIV and AIDS for which medical science has no remedy, but which God could heal in a moment of time.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t continue to depend on the wrong information for your life. Some people say, &quot;I&#x27;m broke&quot; because they don&#x27;t have any money whereas the Bible says the Lord has supplied all their needs (Philippians 4:19). Whose report will you believe?</p>
<p>You must renew your mind with the Word. You shouldn&#x27;t continue to live and reason the way you did before you gave your life to Christ.</p>

<p>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27).</p>
<p>Some Christians unknowingly still live their lives on the basis of the revelations in the Old Testament. That’s not God’s plan for the new creation. Until and unless such Christians change their mentality, they’ll keep walking outside the glory of God without realizing it.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, you’ll never find the kind of things that some teach or practise in the Church today. For instance, someone desires a change in his life and says, “I just need a touch from God,” or “I’m praying that God will touch me.” These statements may sound nice and religious, but they don’t convey or express new creation realities. It does, however, explain why such people merely experience the glory occasionally in their lives, if they do at all, whereas, they ought to be basking in it.</p>
<p>Why ask for a “touch” from the Spirit when He lives in you in His fullness? Our opening verse says Christ in you, the hope of glory. The one you’re asking a touch from is mingled with your spirit; you’re one with Him: “But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit”(1 Corinthians 6:17). What you need isn’t a touch, but to be filled with the Spirit always, and the scripture shows us how in Ephesians 5:18-21 (study entire reference).</p>
<p>Christ is in you, and Christ is everything. You have the fullness of the Spirit. You’re replete with God. The Bible says you’re complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power (Colossians 2:10). This is the revelation of Christianity. How much touch do you expect to get from someone who already dwells in you? His hands are in your hands, and His legs are in your legs. He sees through your eyes. You’re His living tabernacle. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Don’t major on the minors, thereby minimizing what God has maximized. Paul said, “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things” (1 Corinthians 13:11). Don’t ask for a touch. The Holy Ghost wasn’t sent to be beside you and touch you from time to time; He lives in you forever. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>The Bible tells us in Ephesians 1:3 that God has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. Forgiveness is one of these blessings that we’ve been given in Christ Jesus. God already made forgiveness available to you; what He wants you to do is to obtain forgiveness when you need it; just receive it. This is different from asking God for forgiveness of sin. You don’t need to keep asking for forgiveness over and again for the same offence; receive His forgiveness as an act of your faith.</p>
<p>The Greek word translated “forgiveness” is “Aphiemi”, which means to let go or have freedom. So, the Father’s focus is your freedom from sin. By that, I don’t mean freedom from the bondage of sin, but freedom from sinning. You were already removed from under the bondage of sin and darkness into the Kingdom of God’s Son when you were born again. You’ve been declared not guilty, acquitted, and free.</p>
<p>Acts 26:17-18 gives us further insight into God’s idea about forgiveness. There, the Lord gave Apostle Paul a message for the Gentiles, to open their eyes, “…and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me”. Notice the underlined word, “receive”; it derives from the Greek word, “lambano”, which means, “to take possession of”; to take something and make it yours.</p>
<p>Just as you don’t need to ask for your inheritance in Christ, because it’s already yours, forgiveness has also been provided for you in the Gospel. The same way you receive an inheritance is how you receive forgiveness, because the verse we read says, “…that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.”</p>
<p>If you did something wrong, instead of wondering what to do and thinking whether or not God has forgiven you, receive (“lambano” forgiveness. Say, “Father I acknowledge that what I did is wrong, and I receive forgiveness in the Name of Jesus”.</p>

<p>BE INSPIRED TO LEAD!</p>
<p>1 Timothy 4:12 MSG “And don’t let anyone put you down because you’re young. Teach believers with your life: by word, by demeanor, by love, by faith, by integrity.”</p>
<p>Many Christians are acquainted with the story of Joseph, who was a slave in the house of Potiphar, yet the Bible says he was a prosperous and effective man.</p>
<p>He exhibited leadership qualities which distinguished him from all the other slaves and soon enough, he was put in charge of Potiphar’s whole estate.</p>
<p>Your greatness isn’t in the definition of your assignment, but in the quality of your spirit and the excellence of your character.</p>
<p>Let your character speak for itself. As a Christian, you’re a steward of the message of Christ. You’re the one He’s authorised to carry forth His message to the people and teach them the same. This means that responsibility of leadership has been thrust upon you.</p>
<p>You’ve been called to lead and the capacity to lead is resident in your spirit. You have the life, nature and character of God in you to do all things.</p>
<p>Wherever you go, let people see your mark as a child of God. You’ve been sent to lead, therefore be that worthy example! Teach those in your home, school, and neighbourhood how to live and do things right through your words, character, love, faith and integrity.</p>
<p>Let your life reflect what you say to others.</p>

<p>START LEARNING HOW TO TALK~688</p>
<p>When you wake up, start talking, create for yourself what is Called a &quot;Talking Session&quot; when all you do is talk;you talk into your future, your family, your finances, and everything that concerns your life. Don&#x27;t be the quiet type. You know, there are some of you young men here who just got married to this young sister, now you have kids, and things have not been going as planned;it&#x27;s as though life has gone against you, and you&#x27;re just there asking &quot;what am i gonna do&quot; i have told you before, i have told you stop thinking of what to do, because i already told you what to do. Young man, start learning to wake up in the night, and when you wake up, don&#x27;t read newspapers, don&#x27;t tune in to the television to search which football is going on, hear me now, start talking, start declaring words of faith. The harder the world pulls it&#x27;s strings, the more you talk, don&#x27;t let them frighten you out of your talking.</p>
<p>The harder things look, the more you talk, because i tell you, the greater the problem, the greater will be the fall before you, it will crumble before you. Let Satan just keep building it against you, don&#x27;t care, just keep talking, the higher the walls, the greater the fall will be. Remember what the Bible says, it said &quot;When the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth. When you haven&#x27;t seen the harvest yet, don&#x27;t stop talking. Use your mouth, the power is in your mouth. Brother, that money is in your mouth, that business, that healing, that child, that change is in your mouth. Glory to God.</p>

<p>Taking the story of Hannah in the Old Testament as a case study, she had been married to Elkanah for several years without a child, and must have been hoping this would change someday, but it didn’t.</p>
<p>One day, she got tired of the situation and made up her mind for a miracle. She said to herself, “It’s today or never!” Then she went into the house of the Lord and fell on her face before God, bringing forth her case. While she was there, Eli the high priest observed her lips moving but didn’t hear any words coming out of her mouth, so he thought she was drunk and rebuked her, saying, “Woman, are you not tired of your drunkenness?” (1 Samuel 1:13-14).</p>
<p>“Sir, I’m not drunk; I’m just pouring out my heart before the Lord,” she replied (1 Samuel 1:15).We’ve always thought all Hannah did was make a vow to God, but she did more; she argued her case before God.</p>
<p>She petitioned God and gave Him strong reasons why she must have a child. Then the high priest answered and said to her, “Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him” (1 Samuel 1:17). Afterwards, Hannah conceived, gave birth to a son and named him Samuel (1 Samuel 1:20).</p>
<p>If you’ve been praying and desiring a certain change in your life, you can decide you want that change today, and it will happen. Many suffer for long because they don’t know it’s their responsibility, not God’s, to effect the change they desire in their lives.</p>
<p>“Bring forth your strong reasons,” that’s what the Lord says in Isaiah 41:21. Hannah did and got the petition she asked of Him.</p>
<p>What is that miracle you desire?</p>
<p>Present your case before the Lord. If it’s concerning your health, 1 Peter 2:24 says, “Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.”</p>
<p>This is your evidence; stand your ground, and then take hold of your miracle today!</p>

<p>Explains difference between Worship and Praise
Global Communion service</p>
<p>In praise  we extol God&#x27;s greatness
A lot of times we sing more about him than to him
When we sing to him we extol  his majesty and person
That&#x27;s praise</p>
<p>You can worship God with praise but it has a place</p>
<p>Worship is primarily a submission
It&#x27;s a presentation of yourself in devotion
While expressing your love to  him in deep surrender
It doesn&#x27;t mean you are not surrendered to God before
But you surrender in attitude, example prostrating, bowing down or lifting up your hand in humility</p>
<p>When you sing &quot;I worship you&quot; that doesn&#x27;t make a song worship</p>
<p>It&#x27;s how you present yourself to the Lord in submission to his power, glory etc
The lyrics of the songs focused on presenting yourself in humility
That what makes up your worship</p>

<p>When you listen to a testimony, it comes with two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Faith - Testimony will produce faith in you because you are hearing the testimony of the fulfilment of the Word of God in an individual&#x27; life. Faith comes to you as you hear the testimony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The favour that produced the initial testimony, is also released to the testimony you are now hearing at a time. Divine power and favour are transferred or transmitted to the testimony, anyone who hears the testimony and believe it; receives that same favour and it becomes theirs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever you listen to a testimony, the grace that caused it to happen to another brother or sister will also cause it to happen to you. This is why you must be excited about testimony time or listening to what God is doing or has done in the life of others. Get excited about it. Hallelujah.</p>
<p>God bless you.</p>

<p>“THE NEED AROUND US IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHINE”..PASTOR CHRIS</p>
<p>“The word is more than all the nice things you think. THE WORD IS GOD. When you understand that the word is God, your thinking would change”.
You have to understand that money was sent to serve you. As long as you think money isn’t enough for you it won’t be and as long as you know that money works for you, it would always come to you.
There’s an angel responsible for money and if you let him he would work for you. And they hear you when you talk. Angels hear you, they are in your homes and they hear you. If you ain’t saying the right thing they can’t work for you.
Malachi 3:16: Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.
There are no dollars in the spirit realm. What you need to do is ACT AS YOU TALK. when you come to church how do you give your offering. As a leader how to you give your tithes and offering. It isn’t for the congregation to give alone. It’s not enough to preach big messages, you must ACT IT. WHEN YOU PREACH, PREACH YOURSELF TO GIVE. I stir up myself in the spirit to give.  I’m speaking and I’m stirring up my self in the Holy Ghost to respond too, cos this is who we are. God didn’t tell you to work yourself to give. When God made man and woman, he made everything available for them.  In better words; he invited them to his REST. A PROSPEROUS MAN DOES PROSPEROUS THINGS. God is looking for someone to bless daily. Imagine you start thinking like this. LIFT YOUR VISION.
It’s something you practice over time so these things don’t look so big to you. It shouldn’t look so big to you. Get stirred about the things of God.
The tree is more important than the fruits. Take care of the tree and it would produce you good fruits but if you take care of the fruits and neglecte the tree, when the tree is no more, the fruits won’t produce you enough as the tree would. So take care of the source: the word of God and it would produce you the fruits to take care of you.
No one can work with God without wisdom. So how come some lack it? Cos many ignore wisdom. Without wisdom you make wrong decisions and most of the problems people face in life is because of wrong decisions. It is my pray that God would guide you and at every point, make right decisions in Jesus Name</p>

<p>MESSAGE FOR THE MONTH</p>
<p>What work does God do? All He does is talk. Jesus said, I do what I see my father do, which is talk. And why is this important? It is important because it&#x27;s a sign of power or authority. You&#x27;d be amazed what you can do in your life by talking. If you say the right things, they will come to pass and so applies when you say the wrong things.</p>
<p>How you see matters. Not everybody sees correctly. Some see one color and another color registers to them. And for such, medically, doctors try to proffer solution. In the spirit, you have to learn to see as God sees and learn to call them as such.</p>
<p>We call the colors we see that way because that was what we have been taught to recognize such colors as. In the Spirit, you can be taught to interpret what you see. You&#x27;ve got different senses and they aren&#x27;t all used for the same thing. You cannot use your sense of touch for sight. Your sensitivity to the Spirit will help you in judging what you see and how to respond.</p>
<p>In training royalty, there are certain things they are taught. They are taught authority and humility together because every truly great man is a humble person. In the teaching of Jesus, He said God exalts the humble. In teaching royalty, you teach them authority and how to use it, alongside humility and how to conquer their emotions. When God teaches His children, He teaches them like royalty. He teaches them how to control their anger because anger destroys royalty.</p>
<p>1 Chronicles 14:2 &quot;And David perceived that the Lord had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel&quot;.</p>
<p>Acts 3:1-8 &quot;...Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God&quot;.</p>
<p>What Peter had wasn&#x27;t the power to pray; the Bible says Jesus gave His disciples the Power to Heal all manner of sickness and diseases, NOT THE POWER TO PRAY. Peter understood that; he didn&#x27;t go into prayer, rather he spoke and helped the man up and instantly the man&#x27;s feet and ankle bones received strength.</p>
<p>Remember the woman with the issue of blood; she felt in her body. It&#x27;s not always about the feeling but faith. That feeling was faith being demonstrated by her. When Peter spoke healing to the man, the man responded in faith. WHEN GOD SPEAKS TO YOU, YOU&#x27;VE GOT TO RESPOND IN FAITH. That&#x27;s where the manifestation is.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a hearing of faith; there&#x27;s a knowing of faith.</p>
<p>SEPTEMBER, THE MONTH OF UPLIFTING</p>
<p>There&#x27;s is an uplift by the power of the Holy Ghost; there&#x27;s an uplift in your family, in your ministry. You&#x27;re going to be standing and leaping up in faith as the word of God comes to you.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="he-can-grant-you-knowledge-of-everyday-events-pastor-chris-oyakhilome706">HE CAN GRANT YOU KNOWLEDGE OF EVERYDAY EVENTS PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~706<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to HE CAN GRANT YOU KNOWLEDGE OF EVERYDAY EVENTS PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~706" title="Direct link to HE CAN GRANT YOU KNOWLEDGE OF EVERYDAY EVENTS PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~706" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#he-can-grant-you-knowledge-of-everyday-events-pastor-chris-oyakhilome706">​</a></h2>
<p>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit (1 Corinthians 12:8).</p>
<p>Something beautiful the Spirit of God does in our lives is that, apart from imparting your spirit with spiritual information, He can also cause you to have knowledge of everyday events. Knowledge, in our opening verse above, is the Greek word “gnosis,”which is knowledge based on science or intellectual activity. God can cause you to have mental prowess. He can supernaturally impart to you abstract or scientific knowledge that’s based on mental ingenuity. This is something we need to be more conscious of as God’s children.</p>
<p>We’ve walked with the Lord in the manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit in certain areas, but there’s much more for us to explore. We need to become more conscious that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of knowledge; He knows all things. Therefore, He can give you a word of knowledge in the field of chemistry, medicine, law, engineering, or business. All you need is to make yourself available to Him to work with.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus is the embodiment of all wisdom and knowledge (Colossians 2:3), and He made all things: the plants, animals everything in the world (Colossians 1:16). Therefore, He can teach you about them. The world is looking for solutions, and God wants His kids to be the solution providers to the world’s problems. He can give you a word of knowledge about your career. The very thought of this is exciting; that you can be praying in your closet and receive a word of knowledge that’ll be the solution the world has been waiting for.</p>
<p>I’ve experienced things like this several times, where I was able to explain natural things through knowledge imparted to me by the Spirit of God. You can receive a word of knowledge from the Spirit of God about your health, job, business, academics and finances. You can receive ideas from Him that’ll change your world.</p>
<p>Look at the sand we all tread on for example; many people don’t know what’s in it apart from using it to build houses. There’s more in the sand than many know about, and God can tell you about it such that you could be the first to discover and educate the whole world on a new and different use for something as common as the sand.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear heavenly Father, thank you for the ministry of the precious Holy Spirit who reveals mysteries and secrets to me. He’s the Spirit of knowledge who knows all things, and teaches me all things so that I can deal wisely in all affairs of life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Hello! Welcome to today’s program! I will endeavor to answer your questions and I believe that this will be a good blessing to you.</p>
<p>QUESTION — Fidelis (USA): How do Christians worship in spirit and in truth?</p>
<p>ANSWER: Well, first, it was Jesus who said that. He said, “God is a Spirit: and those who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”[John 4: 24] “For the Father seeketh such to worship him” [John 4: 23] In fact, Jesus made it clear to us that it was the father’s desire; he said, “the Father seeketh such to worship him,” [John 4: 23] because God is a spirit. So, if you are going to worship God, you are going to have to worship him in spirit and in truth. That’s exactly what Jesus said. Now, to worship God in spirit, you must have the Holy Spirit, because only the Holy Spirit can enable you to worship God in Spirit. Now, before Jesus made that statement people had been worshiping God in several different ways for many, many years.</p>
<p>The men and women of the Old Testament did worship God. God actually gave them the forms of worship; he let them know how to do it, including singing. The Levites had singers—special singers. The priests ordered the worship. In spite of all that, Jesus said, this was not God’s desire. He said, “The time is coming, and now is when the true worshipers…” [John 4:23] He distinguished between the true worshipers and other worshipers. So, they had worshiped but now, he was revealing God’s reality. So, when he says “the true worshipers”, it was not to mean that the others were in falsehood but that he was talking about reality – those who would worship God as God actually desired. It’s like talking about the Old Testament and the laws. The bible says, “The law came by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ,” [John 1:17] which means that Jesus actually brought to us what God’s heart really was. The laws of the Old Testament—the laws of Moses – were righteous laws but they couldn’t produce salvation, and so, Jesus brought salvation; Jesus brought reality. Jesus brought the Father’s heart; Jesus came to reveal to us what God really was like, and so, he said the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. So, you must have the Holy Spirit first.</p>
<p>You know, in worshiping God, you are not just going to be thinking, you have got to say something. In the Old Testament, they said something. There are different ways, there are different things you do to worship God. Yes, the Bible says you come with an offering to worship him but you don’t just drop the offering; you’ve got to say something. It’s actually what you say that gives credibility to what you give to God. What you say gives credibility to what you give to God – what you say about and upon what you give to God – because when you bring an offering to God, you don’t just drop it somewhere, you’ve got to say something to God and those words are very important. Whether you are singing them or you are just speaking them, they are very important to God. In the Old Testament, he taught them what to say when they brought their offerings to God. There were different kinds of offerings and then the tithes, and he said when you bring this to the place that your Lord your God shall choose, ye shall say thus and thus. So, what you say is very important when you bring an offering to God in worship.</p>
<p>But then, in worshiping God beyond what you give to Him, beyond your offering, what do you say? What do you do? These are those things that help us understand the spirituality of worship. So, I am going to read something to you from the Bible. In 1 Corinthians 14, beginning in verse 13: “Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.” [1 Corinthians 14:13] Now, already you know where we are going. It’s got to do with spiritual communication: speaking in an unknown tongue [to pray that he may interpret], which means they are not the same kind of language. And why do you pray that you may interpret? It means that he is not</p>

<p>“I am functioning above the system. Greater is he that is me than he that is in the world. I play by a different set of rules.”</p>
<p>These things must be in your spirit. Program your life and don’t just wish things to work when you are in trouble. Meditate and program your life for success and victory. You will not have to panic when challenges come. Meditation is very important. They must be done way ahead of time. Life must be programmed. Meditate upon these things, they should be consistent in your spirit. It’s got to be in there until your whole life is inundated with this truth. That’s the power of meditation, you meditate until the Word goes from your mind to your spirit.</p>
<p>When challenges show up, you say, “I Refuse to fear in the Name of Jesus!” Remember in Acts 3 how Peter and John met a man; nobody thought that he could walk because he was like that from birth. So which name did Peter use? He used the Name of Jesus. In your name, you may never have the desired results. In your name, you may never be able to walk, or even in your father’s name… we’ve been given a Name above all names. If you have a child who cannot walk, you will put your hand on that child and use the Name of Jesus.</p>
<p>Philippines 2:9  Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given Him a Name which is above every name: That at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. That means ANYTHING, whether it is sickness or disease.</p>
<p>When my little daughter was 2 years old, she had a terrible disease. I saw her getting crippled before my eyes. The doctors said, she will never walk again. We tried using physiotherapy, they said it’s useless. But I knew of a Name, JESUS.</p>
<p>So every opportunity I laid my hands on her and confessed that she is walking, she is running, she is jumping. One day, we were going to a shopping mall, she told me, daddy, look at what I can do. She was leaping, she jumped outside the car herself.  I said Jesus “I knew you would do it.” Before the miracle, when I saw the pictures of her in a wheelchair, I said thousand times NO. Cheer up. irrespective of the challenge, the anointing of God is in this place, the angels of God are here in this place. Remember Jesus did it all.</p>
<p>The anointing is you now. You have become a point of contact. Lay your hands on the sick. The hand of God is on you. Whatever you are wearing now, the anointing is on it. You are blessed, in your business, in your job, education, in your finances, in the Name of Jesus. Amen!</p>

<p>&quot;...If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation&quot; (Romans 10:9-10).</p>
<p>The acknowledgement and confession of the Lordship of Jesus Christ is the God-ordained way to receive salvation. There&#x27;re many who believe that for a sinner to be saved he must confess his sins to God, but that&#x27;s not true. You don&#x27;t receive salvation by confessing your sins. The Bible doesn&#x27;t say <em>&quot;If thou shall confess with thy mouth all your sins, then thou shall be saved&quot;</em>; rather, it says, <em>&quot;If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved...&quot;</em> This is the simple way to salvation.</p>
<p>When you believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is The Son of God and that God raised Him from the dead, you&#x27;re made right with God. But then to enjoy what you have believed---to enjoy the full benefits of salvation, you&#x27;ll have to confess, that is, affirm with your mouth, the Lordship of Jesus. That you believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died for you is not enough. Even the devils, according to the Bible also believe and tremble (James 2:19), but doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re saved.</p>
<p>Believing is not enough. You&#x27;ve to announce your believing; say it with your mouth, for &quot;with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation.&quot; Once you make that proclamation of the Lordship of Jesus, it catapults you into salvation! Thus, that which you believe---the Lordship of Jesus Christ---becomes real to you, and changes everything about your life! You become awakened to the fatherhood of God.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that you&#x27;re the &quot;nicest&quot; person around. You can&#x27;t trust in your good deeds to save you. Jesus said in John 3:7 &quot;ye must be born again&quot; There&#x27;s a definite act required for salvation; it&#x27;s the confession of the Lordship of Jesus. So, if you&#x27;re not yet born again, you can do so right away by praying this prayer: &quot;Lord Jesus, I ask that you come into my heart and be the Lord of my life from this day forward. I confess with my mouth that you are Lord of my life, and believe in my heart that God raised you from the dead; thank you that I am saved now.&quot;</p>

<p>...When you say “You know, I’m from a poor family. I’m poor I’m nothing. I’m just an ordinary man.” They’ll say it’s true. They like it because they rate you with what they see. Yet if you come and say “HEY!! HELLO!!” First the sound of that voice would disturb them because poor men don’t talk happy. They never talk happy always complaining.</p>
<p>The life that is in you has no colour. This is the thing that is shaking the world. A lot of them are wondering about some of us. I’m talking about Africans, Asians and American and so on and so forth. They are looking at us suspiciously and wonder Why do they talk the way they do? Who gave them something to eat?</p>
<p>We found out! We found out that the colour of the skin has nothing to do with your nature. We found out that anybody could be anything with this. Jesus said it and Jesus never lied to anybody. He was telling the truth.</p>
<p>Anybody can use his tongue and get out of trouble. It doesn’t matter whether you were born in a hut. It has got nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Every day you look at yourself in the mirror and say “Father in the name of Jesus I refuse to be poor. I will not live the down life. I’m going somewhere” Talk to the guy on the other side of the mirror.</p>
<p>Listen, what I’m sharing with you I discovered many years ago and that’s how I got to where I am and that’s how I’m going where I’m going. I stand there and I say “I’m going and nobody can stop me! I’m going to sponsor the gospel to the whole world. I’m doing it.”</p>
<p>Don’t say nobody knows tomorrow. Your tomorrow is assured. You should know it. It is assured.</p>
<p>Joh 16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit will show you the things to come tomorrow. If you haven’t seen, listen to him. Then if you still haven’t heard listen hard. Still no voice? Listen very hard. Then even if you haven’t heard anything, stop everything you are doing and give your full and I said full attention to Him. With all that you’ve got. All your heart, your whole mind and your whole body.</p>
<p>Stop cooking, turn off your phone, shut down the laptop, remove your shoes, take your Bible, get somewhere you can be alone even inside the bathroom – just you and the Holy Spirit and no one else. Get to a remote area or get to your room and shut the doors and windows. Just you, your Bible and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Stop thinking about food, rent, homework, laundry, gardening, work for tomorrow. You don’t care, whether if you miss work tomorrow, whether you are going to miss your exam tomorrow, whether the landlord is coming to collect the rent, whether you are getting so hungry and you’ll die of hunger, whether your boss is going to fire you– you don’t care! Until you hear His voice you’re not getting up.</p>
<p>Nothing but Him and Him only. Begin to talk to him through the Bible. Praise him for his mighty works. Thank him for all he’s given you. Thank him for the glorious salvation and the liberty you are experiencing.</p>
<p>Then speak in tongues. Then shut up! Unless you have the interpretation of the tongues which is prophecy. If not, wait. Quietly.</p>
<p>Listen very carefully inside your heart. Wait till you hear his voice. Then every once in a while talk to him. Thank him for the life and revelation that he has given to you...hallelujah God bless you richly 🙏.</p>

<p>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace (Ephesians 1:7).</p>
<p>“Redemption” in the verse above, is the Greek word, “apolutrosis” and it means riddance. In Christ, we have our riddance. He rids or plucks you out of trouble, and rids your life of anything that’s wrong. So, you can say, “I have my riddance in Christ, no matter what!” That’s redemption. It doesn’t matter what mess you may think you’re in, you can trust Him to get you out.</p>
<p>In Christ Jesus, we also have remission of sins. The King James translation uses the word “Forgiveness” of sins, but the Greek word is “aphesis” and it means remission; the total removal or blotting away of sins. God did much more than forgive us; He blotted out our sins. There’s no trace or record of your sins; it’s as though you never sinned.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s wrong for a Christian to keep a consciousness of sin. Some are forever praying and asking God for forgiveness, because they’re always overwhelmed by the burden of sin-consciousness. The truth is that the Bible never tells us to ask God for forgiveness. God never made provision for your “forgiveness.” This might upend some people’s theology, but it’s a present truth.</p>
<p>To forgive means to pardon, in which case the record of wrong remains, though you’ll not be punished. But that’s not the case with God and us. The actual Greek rendering is “to take away completely, to put away, blot out, separate from.” You might want to ask, “How about 1 John 1:9 that says, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness?”</p>
<p>What that simply means is that if we acknowledge (confess) our sins, God is faithful and just to put them away, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. There’s an automatic cleansing going on. That’s what it says in the seventh verse: “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>God wants you to walk free of guilt or condemnation! He wants you to walk in the light of your riddance, your righteousness, your justification, your holiness, and your sanctification in Christ Jesus, not snowed-under by guilt or sin-consciousness.</p>

<p>For he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sins; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him (2 Corinthains 5:21).</p>
<p>One day, I asked a born again gentleman: &quot;Are you righteous?&quot; He paused to think for a while and replied, &quot;I am working on it.&quot; &quot;So, how are you going to know when you are finally righteous&quot; I quizzed him further. At that point, he didn&#x27;t know what more to say. Like that gentleman, many chrstians don&#x27;t think they are righteous because they equate righteousness with right-living. They look at their actions to rate their righteousness. But there is a difference between the two concepts.</p>
<p>The Bible says &quot;....if by one man&#x27;s offence death reigned by one; much more they which recieve abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ&quot; (Romans 5:17). When you received Christ into your hearts, God gave you the righteousness as a gift. It&#x27;s not something you worked for. Righteousness is the nature of God that is impacted to your human spirit that produces in you the ability to stand before God without guilt, inferiority or condemnation. Righteousness is that nature of God that produces in you, the rightness of God, and gives you right standing with God. Now, right living on the other hand is doing what is right and required of God as a way of life. They are not the same.</p>
<p>Right living is the product of righteousness. No man could live right until he&#x27;s first of all righteous; God can only require a man to live right after that man has been made righteous. This is the reason He imparted righteousnes to you freely. The ability to do the right things can only flow naturally from a righteous person. Now some of your actions may still be imperfect but that doesn&#x27;t in any way impact on your righteousness. What you need do is get the Word of God into you and righteousness will find expression through your actions.</p>
<p>When you were born again, you became as righteous as Jesus is, for you were made righteous with His righteousness. You can&#x27;t be more righteous than you are right now, for God&#x27;s roghteousness is perfect which is what you already have in Chríst--and you can&#x27;t improve on perfect. That righteousness is in your spirit, and it produces in you right living---the ability to do right!</p>

<p>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4).</p>
<p>When the Bible says, “Ye are of God,” it doesn’t mean you’re on God’s side; neither does it mean you’re a God-supporter. It means that you hail from God; your origin is in Him; and because of this, it says you “…have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world” (1 John 4:4).</p>
<p>This isn’t a promise, but a statement of fact. You shouldn’t be afraid of anything in this world; you’ve already overcome the world, Satan, and his demons.</p>
<p>Notice He didn’t say you qualify by praying or working hard enough. What God is talking about here is who you are. You’re not an ordinary being; you’re like Jesus. 1 John 4:17 says, “…as he is, so are we in this world.” Jesus was fearless. He had no sense of lack. He lived in absolute mastery and dominion over all things.</p>
<p>The same life in him is what He’s given you. The same Holy Spirit that worked in Him when He walked the earth is the same that you’ve received. Therefore, be conscious of who you are in Christ.</p>
<p>1 John 5:4 says, “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world…”; that means it makes no difference the challenges or difficulties that you face in this world; you’re a victor, because you’re born of God. They may say to you, “O, you’re not going to come out of this one; everyone who ever faced this situation failed.” That’s because they don’t know who you are; the reason you’ve overcome all things is that you’re born of God, and greater is He that’s in you than he that’s in the world.</p>
<p>The devil doesn’t respect you because you’re very “holy” or because you pray a lot. But he recognizes who you are; and when you exercise your dominion and authority on the basis of who you are in Christ, he bows. Never forget what the Word of God has made you!</p>

<p>...Love cares more for others than for self. Love doesn&#x27;t want what it doesn&#x27;t have. Love... Puts up with anything; Trusts God always, always looks for the best, never looks back, but keeps going to the end (1 Corinthians 13:4,7 MSG).</p>
<p>As Christians, we ought to provide a sense of security for one another. I like the idea of living freely among God&#x27;s people as the Bible admonishes us to. That&#x27;s how it ought to be. You shouldn&#x27;t clam up and want to be on your guard always because of some negative reports you heard about others. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to walk in love, for love always believes the best about others.</p>
<p>Some people love to gossip; they are busybodies in other people&#x27;s affairs, and the Bible warns us not to be that way! Such folks sow seeds of discord among brethren and attempt to pollute the whole Church with strife, &quot;speaking things which they ought not&quot; (1 Timothy 5:13). It&#x27;s unsafe to hang around such people for they only spread resentment and rancour. Many churches have had troubles because of them.</p>
<p>When you hear negative reports about people, your reaction is what determines whether you&#x27;re walking in love or not. Always be ready to believe only the best about everyone. Never criticize anyone. Never write anyone off, just because of what you heard they said or did. When you hear a fellow believer defaming or tale-bearing about another brother or sister, correct him or her immediately, in love. We often make the mistake of keeping quiet when we know people are saying the wrong things about others. By such we become accomplices for giving them a hearing ear. If you shut your ears, they&#x27;ll shut their mouths.</p>
<p>Jesus chose to believe the best about His disciples. He knew, for example, that Peter was going to deny Him, yet He said to him,&quot;...Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may siftyou as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.&quot; (Luke 22:31-32). Choose to believe the best in others today, for that&#x27;s the love-way; the way of victory!</p>

<p>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone (Ezekiel 37:7).</p>
<p>To prophesy means to speak words of divine revelation and potency; words that have and give life. Ezekiel understood that it wasn’t just about releasing words, but releasing words with the right sound code; words of the Spirit. He said, “I prophesied as I was commanded.”</p>
<p>As he prophesied, the Bible records that there was a noise and the bones came together, bone to his bone. That’s quite profound, for it means every bone had a code, and the moment the word was given, they knew where to fit into, without any mistake.</p>
<p>God designed energy to be released through words, but you must have the right words. This is why the ministry of the Spirit, fellowshipping with Him, is indispensable in our lives, because it’s the Spirit that actually knows the codes. We listen to the Holy Spirit to receive guidance from Him. He tells us exactly what to say. He could show you in pictures, but you must say it as He said to say it; otherwise, it’ll not work.</p>
<p>Let the Spirit guide you. When there’re crises or daunting challenges, you say, “Holy Spirit, use me to pray accurately, because I know not what to pray for as I ought.” Then start praying in tongues. Sing and worship the Lord in tongues. Do this intensely, and while at it, channel your mind to your purpose, the issue at hand.</p>
<p>As you continue in tongues, soon enough, the gift of prophecy will be stirred from within you to prophesy and make declarations like Ezekiel, and you’ll utter the right sound codes. This is how to effect the changes you want in your finances, job, business, family, and anything that’s of a concern to you. Get the accurate sound code from the Spirit and utter it. You can change hopeless situations and effect positive changes in your life through the creative power of God’s Word in your mouth.</p>
<p>PRAYER: Dear Father, I thank you for the ability to speak words of power by the Spirit; life-altering, destiny-changing sound codes that are guaranteed to produce results. Even now, I declare that my life is for your glory; my future is that of success, progress, and prosperity in the Gospel of Jesus Christ! I dwell continually in peace, divine health, and in your grace, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Someone might be in a precarious health condition and gripe, “I’ve prayed about this sickness; I’ve cried; I’ve fasted, and nothing has changed; I don’t know what else to do!” Well, that’s because you haven’t acted on the Word. That’s what God expects of you. When you act on the Word, things change. There’s a reality in the Word of God that’s beyond science and the senses.</p>
<p>For example, when the world says an ailment is incurable, that limitation doesn’t include us, because when we lay our hands on the sick, they’re healed, irrespective of the condition. We can heal all manner of sickness and disease with the Word. When we speak the Word, diseases dematerialize. It’s like what happened with Jesus in Bible days; they brought to Him many that were possessed with devils, and He cast out the spirits with His Word and healed all that were sick. Notice that He did it with His Word.</p>
<p>When He said, “Receive your sight,” the man that was born blind began to see. When He said, “Rise up and walk,” at His Word, the lame got up, walking and running. His Word restored even those that had their limbs amputated! There’s something about the Word of God!</p>
<p>Act on the word</p>
<p>As you read this, it’s possible you have cancer in your body: All you need do is, speak the Word! Say, “My body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and cannot cohabit with sickness.” Therefore, call its name and say, “I command you to die in the Name of Jesus.” Say, “In the Name of Jesus, I cut you out!”</p>
<p>THIS IS YOUR TIME FOR A MIRACLE.</p>
<p>Wherever you need a Miracle: maybe you need a miracle for a child who has left home and hasn’t return for many days, maybe for a loved one who is sick or for a business that is not doing well… Today, I call forth for a Miracle in that situation in the Name of Jesus. Ministering spirits (Angels) are dispatch on your behalf right now. That needed change in your health, career, family, and ministry are taking place right now.

<p>SUNDAY, 3RD NOVEMBER</p>
<p>When we get into a new month, the blessings of the previous month doesn&#x27;t stop; we carry them into the new month. Don&#x27;t stop winning souls.</p>
<p>The only serious and genuine evidence that you have the Holy Spirit is when you win souls.</p>
<p>Act 1:8 says, But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem...</p>
<p>If you truly have the Holy Spirit, you&#x27;ll preach the gospel. And once you open your mouth to talk, you&#x27;ll be filled with the Spirit of God. Don&#x27;t be timid about preaching the Gospel.</p>
<p>MESSAGE OF THE MONTH</p>
<p>This month, we are going to work in and with a certain type of consciousness.</p>
<p>Consciousness is important; it is the state of your mind - it pulls to you what your mind conscious of. Faith is a conscious expectation.</p>
<p>NOVEMBER IS THE MONTH OF BLESSING!</p>
<p>And you&#x27;re going to work in this consciousness.</p>
<p>Genesis 14:18-20
And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.
19 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:
20 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.</p>
<p>This month you&#x27;re going to walk in the consciousness of blessings.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m the blessed of God!
I&#x27;m blessed in my going out and coming in!
I&#x27;m blessed in my mind and thoughts!
I&#x27;m blessed in my missions!

<p>&quot;Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven&quot; (Luke 6:37).</p>
<p>As a Christian, one of the features of your recreated human spirit is love, and love doesn&#x27;t judge or slander others. Never tell stories that&#x27;ll make your hearers dislike those you&#x27;re talking about. It&#x27;s wrong. When you judge others, God ignores you. You might want to ask, &quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>
<p>One day, Jesus was sitting somewhere and the Jewish leaders and men chased after a woman whom they said was caught in the very act of adultery. So they said to Jesus, &quot;...Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not&quot; (John 8:4-6).</p>
<p>These scribes and Pharisees were ready to stone the woman to death, according to the Law of Moses, and wanted Jesus&#x27; opinion. The Bible says Jesus ignored them and wrote with His finger on the ground, because that&#x27;s what God does to judgemental people. Jesus said, &quot;I do what I see my Father do&quot; (John 5:19). So, when He ignored them, He was expressing the Father&#x27;s response to judgemental behaviour.</p>
<p>When He eventually raised His head, He said to the woman&#x27;s accusers, &quot;Let the one without sin cast the first stone&quot; (John 8:7). But they couldn&#x27;t. So, one after the other, they dropped their stones and left, leaving the woman alone with Jesus. Then Jesus said to her, &quot;...hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more&quot; (John 8:10-11); and she was delivered from the mob.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re to act like Jesus; He said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t condemn you, go and sin no more.&quot; Jesus recognized her sin; meaning we can recognize when people do something that&#x27;s wrong; yet, like Jesus, don&#x27;t judge them.</p>
<p>Give a good picture about others; don&#x27;t be the one to project them in a bad light. Your role is to propagate love.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="soldiers-in-his-end-time-army---pastor-chris-oyakhilome791">SOLDIERS IN HIS END-TIME ARMY - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~791<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SOLDIERS IN HIS END-TIME ARMY - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~791" title="Direct link to SOLDIERS IN HIS END-TIME ARMY - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~791" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#soldiers-in-his-end-time-army---pastor-chris-oyakhilome791">​</a></h2>
<p>Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ (2 Timothy 2:3).</p>
<p>No Christian should lazy through life, for we’re soldiers in God’s army. As a soldier you’re expected to be strong and tough to accomplish the task set before you. There’s absolutely no place for the timid and weak-hearted in the army.</p>
<p>Years ago, I enrolled as a young lad in the army cadet. While there, they made it clear that we had no options; we were only to do whatever we were instructed to do. They didn’t want sissies. We had to look strong and tough, and we weren’t expected to complain or exhibit any sign of weakness.</p>
<p>The same goes for God’s army. A good soldier of Jesus Christ must be trained and fully equipped for the fight of faith; he must be strong and equipped to endure hard times. For example, when you’re told, “Let’s pray,” you can’t complain that you’re feeling tired, or that your hands are hurting when told “lift your hands to the Lord in worship.” You can’t say you’re too tired to go on evangelism; you’re a soldier; soldiers don’t make excuses.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ remains our perfect example of what a true soldier should be like. Consider what the Prophet Isaiah said about Him, “Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand” (Isaiah 53:10).</p>
<p>We’re the result of that travail of soul that He went through. When He saw the glory ahead of Him, He endured the cross, despising the shame (Hebrews 12:2); we’re that glory. He saw what we would be, and went on to give His life to save us. We’re His seed, prolonging His days through the preaching of the Gospel. We must herald it on the housetops, mountaintops, in the valleys—everywhere: North, South, East, and West, and by so doing, establish His Kingdom on earth and in the hearts of men. That’s our job as soldiers in His end-time army.</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us&quot; (Romans 8:37).</p>
<p>In Christ, you&#x27;re ordained to prosper, succeed, and triumph all the time. We&#x27;re supremely and transcendentally blessed in Christ. We win all the time, irrespective of the circumstances and situations we&#x27;re in.</p>
<p>Some people believe that an ever-winning, ever-triumphant life in life is unrealistic; so they live with the notion that &quot;Sometimes you win and sometimes you lose.&quot; That&#x27;s not for the child of God. God&#x27;s blessing for every one of us, irrespective of the challenges, is that you&#x27;re more than a conqueror. It reminds of that old song in which the writer said, &quot;God never said there&#x27;ll be no rain; He never said there&#x27;ll be no sunshine, but He always promised us a heart full of singing.&quot; In other words, no matter what happens, you&#x27;re forever victorious.</p>
<p>Read the Spirit&#x27;s submission through Paul about this; it&#x27;s so inspiring. He says, &quot;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us&quot; (Romans 8:35-37).</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not in the dark. We&#x27;re not at the mercy of Satan or the hardship in today&#x27;s world. In the midst of darkness, turmoil, the adversities of life, your victory is a settled fact. 1 John 4:4 says, &quot;Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.&quot; This is a present-hour reality.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not hamstrung; you&#x27;re not in the battle all by yourself. The Lord Himself said, &quot;When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee&quot; (Isaiah 43:2). Blessed be God! Be confident and assured of victory and a glorious life every day, because Christ is in you (Colossians 1:27). That&#x27;s your assurance of winning every day. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Be not deceived: evil communication corrupt good manners&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:33).</p>
<p>You must be careful in choosing friends, even in the house of God. Are you surprised to hear that? Well, the fact remains that there are ungodly Christians and many unwittingly make friends with them in Church. Those you run with or move with in Church matter because they can either take you up or pull you down. So how do you know the right friends?</p>
<p>Any relationship that brings you closer to God is good for you. Through such an association, you pray more, you learn the Word of God more and you do the things of God more. Now, I&#x27;m not referring to a numerical increase in the activities you&#x27;re engaged in but also your ability to do them better. This is the right kind of relationship.</p>
<p>The right friends don&#x27;t just help by their advice, as they may not even know better than you do. The fact is, your relationship with them causes you all to gather around the Word.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit causes you to share the Word with them and they also share testimonies with you. This kind of relationship helps you to think and develop the right character. But when you have the wrong friends you&#x27;ll keep moving backward and there would be no spiritual advancement. Soon, you&#x27;ll discover that you&#x27;re not as excited to be in Church services, study your Bible and evangelize any more. The colour is gone out of you and that brightness of the Spirit has disappeared. You&#x27;re no longer acquainted with the move of the Spirit and you can&#x27;t even find the love of God manifested in your life anymore, all because you&#x27;re with the wrong folks and have become one of them. You&#x27;ve become a dangerous person for any other person to get close to since you&#x27;re just like the rest of the ungodly bunch. The only time you&#x27;re involved in sharing the Word is when there&#x27;s an argument; then you assume the role of a supporter of God.</p>
<p>I counsel you today, be careful of the folks you keep as friends and the relationships you maintain. Take out time to assess your friends, whether they&#x27;ve been a blessing to you or otherwise; then make the right decision.</p>

<p>&quot;...Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his&quot; (Romans 8:9).</p>
<p>As Christians, we have the Spirit of Christ. It&#x27;s so important for us to be conscious of that reality. The word &#x27;Christian&#x27; means Christ-like; in other words, we&#x27;re like Christ. We&#x27;re to live, love, talk and conduct all our affairs in life like Him. Some Christians know how to be nice only when in Church. The real question is, who are you when you&#x27;re out of Church? When at home, in the office, school, market-place and on the street, do you suddenly forget your identity as a Christian and begin to act and talk like the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Your Christianity must not be restricted to the Church building. You&#x27;ve been called to make a difference; God has placed you as an example and a shining light in this world, never forget that. When you open your mouth to speak, people should experience the love of God through your words. Your words should minister grace to the hearers always, for you have the Spirit of Christ.</p>
<p>Some people are quick to blow their top and become easily infuriated when others offend them, but when you&#x27;re conscious of your identity as a Christian, you would learn to subdue your anger always. You would learn to love and appreciate others even when they hurt or mistreat you. That&#x27;s the way of Christ; that&#x27;s the life of a Christian!</p>

<p>&quot;...Truly I say to you, unless you repent (change, turn about) and become like little children [trusting, lowly, loving, forgiving], you can never enter the kingdom of heaven [at all]. Whoever will humble himself therefore and become like this little child [trusting, lowly, loving, forgiving] is greatest in the kingdom of heaven&quot; (Matthew 18:3-4 AMP).</p>
<p>Great men and women are usually very humble. People who are puffed up or arrogant are never great. In fact, they&#x27;re puffed up because there isn&#x27;t anything great about them. Proverbs 18:12 says, &quot;Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.&quot; James 4:6 also says, &quot;But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.&quot;</p>
<p>Every child of God must be humble. Humility, however, doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re foolish, neither does it mean stupidity. Humility is of the mind and of the heart; it&#x27;s of the inward man. You can know a humble man not just from the outside, but from the inside. True humility is submitting yourself to the Lordship of Jesus Christ through the Word. The Word of God is the only power that can get into your spirit to make the necessary adjustments. When you study the Word and let it guide your thoughts, actions and way of life, you&#x27;re automatically submitting to Jesus because He&#x27;s the Living Word.</p>
<p>God has destined you for greatness! As you get greater, be more humble. Small men are rough, brash and disrespectful. Never esteem yourself by your natural achievements or physical abilities; submit yourself instead, to the Word. Follow instructions and submit yourself to leadership. As you receive God&#x27;s Word and act accordingly, you become more humble, and your life becomes more glorious.</p>

<p>&quot;Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need&quot; (Hebrews 4:16).</p>
<p>Sometimes, in leading sinners to Christ, some people erroneously tell them to confess all their sins. When the sinner begins to confess his sins, God can&#x27;t see them, because He has no records of the sinner&#x27;s sins. What He&#x27;s interested in is the remission---the removal or blotting away of sin from the sinner&#x27;s spirit. Once sin is out of his spirit, he&#x27;s qualified to be recreated.</p>
<p>As a Christian, you&#x27;re a new creation, born without a past. Your life started when you were born again (2 Corinthians 5:17). If, however, at any point in your walk of faith, you make a mistake or do something wrong, the Bible says you have forgiveness in Christ: &quot;My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world&quot; (1 John 2:1-2).</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why our opening verse tells us to obtain mercy or forgiveness. Notice it doesn&#x27;t say, &quot;Ask for forgiveness.&quot; Think about it: If, as a Christian, you&#x27;re asking God for forgiveness, at what point will He tell you, &quot;It&#x27;s okay; I&#x27;ve forgiven you&quot;? You&#x27;ll probably keep asking for forgiveness, and you&#x27;ll never know whether you&#x27;ve been forgiven or not.</p>
<p>But the Bible says, &quot;Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus&quot; (Romans 3:24). To be justified means to be declared not guilty. We&#x27;ve been justified according to the Scriptures; meaning God has declared us not guilty of our sins; He&#x27;s paid the full penalty for our sins through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Therefore, refuse to be &quot;sin-conscious&quot;; rather, have &quot;righteousness consciousness.&quot; If you&#x27;ve done something wrong, be bold to receive forgiveness. Say, &quot;Father, I receive forgiveness for that which I&#x27;ve done wrong, in the Name of Jesus,&quot; and walk guilt-free. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you...&quot; (Acts 1:8).</p>
<p>There isn&#x27;t a thing you can&#x27;t change when you pray. The reason a lot of children feel despondent and helpless when they go through difficult situations is that many don&#x27;t pray; and for those who pray, many do so amiss.</p>
<p>Life may be replete with challenges and persecutions; however, as Christians, we need to realize that even when we&#x27;re going through such, we can still be filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Our continuous fellowship with the Lord through prayer helps us live in victory every single day.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s high time you started praying, and it&#x27;s not difficult at all. As you continue in God&#x27;s Word, the Holy Spirit will guide you on how to pray. When you find yourself in difficult situations, first consider what the trouble is all about. Then, ask yourself, &quot;Is it self-created or is someone trying to put me down?&quot; For all you know, you may have unwittingly put yourself in that situation.</p>
<p>When you discover the reason behind your problem, then it&#x27;s &#x27;half-solved.&#x27; If the problem is you, make the necessary adjustments in your life! If it&#x27;s someone else, you can change things through prayer. Don&#x27;t sit there feeling sorry for yourself; go ahead and effect the necessary changes! Break out in tongues like you&#x27;ve never spoken before and rejoice in the spirit. It makes no difference whether the problem was created by you or someone else, you can change it! Remember, your ability, strength, and confidence, are in God. Therefore, refuse to be a victim.</p>

<p>&quot;Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth&quot; (Proverbs 6:2).</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a spiritual language for the Christian. That&#x27;s why, as a child of God, you ought to put the Word on your lips, because the supernatural life is based on your tongue. Your tongue rules your life. In Matthew 12:36-37, Jesus said, &quot;But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the Day of Judgement. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.&quot;</p>
<p>Literally, this means a man will go to heaven or hell because of his words. Read the Apostle Paul&#x27;s submission about salvation in Romans 10:8-10: &quot;...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.&quot;</p>
<p>The Apostle James likened the tongue to the rudder of a great ship, which the captain uses to direct the ship wherever he wants (James 3:4-5). Likewise, your life is the character of your words. If your words are wholesome, your life will be perfect, excellent, and full of glory. Proverbs 15:4 says, &quot;A wholesome tongue is a tree of life...&quot; Jesus taught that what you say, is what you get (Mark 11:23).</p>
<p>Watch what you say, for your confessions control your life. You can keep yourself in health, safety, prosperity, and victory with your words. Stir your life in the direction of God&#x27;s destiny for you with your faith-filled confessions. Always talk success and increase only.</p>
<p>1 Peter 3:10 says, &quot;For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.&quot; Proverbs 18:21 says, &quot;Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.&quot; Create and sustain your glorious life with your words. You can be anything you want to be, have anything you want, and achieve anything you want to achieve---with your words.</p>

<p>📖 &quot;If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it&quot; (John 14:14).</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to believe in God and not believe in miracles. A Christian who doesn&#x27;t believe in miracles doesn&#x27;t know who God is. A miracle is the supernatural intervention of God in the natural affairs of men, an intervention that transcends human reasoning, ability, science, and logic.</p>
<p>Therefore, to believe in God and not expect miracles is a contradiction. So, believe and expect miracles. The Christian life is a day-to-day experience of, and journey in the supernatural. When you speak, your words aren&#x27;t ordinary, for they contain power, the miracle element to affect and influence your world and cause a change. In Mark 11:23, Jesus said, &quot;You shall have what you say.&quot; In our opening verse, He said, &quot;If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will DO it.&quot;</p>
<p>The underlined word is the Greek, &quot;Poiēō,&quot; and it means, &quot;make&quot;; Jesus is saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll make it in my Name; even if that thing doesn&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;ll make it happen.&quot; See how He loves us! It delights the Lord to bless you and do good things for you. It&#x27;s His joy to answer your prayers and grant your heart&#x27;s desires. He said in Luke 12:32, &quot;Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father&#x27;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.&quot; He can, and will do anything for you, because you believe.</p>
<p>If there&#x27;s a tumour in your body, for instance, declare, &quot;Tumour, in the Name of Jesus, you can&#x27;t stay in this body; I cut you out!&quot; If there&#x27;s been a problem with your heart, command it to function normally, in the Name of Jesus. If it&#x27;s about your finances, command a change, and it&#x27;ll be so. Declare what you want. Voice your miracle. Create and sustain your victorious life with your faith-filled words.</p>

<p>Even so the tongue is a little member; and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! (James 3:5)</p>
<p>God expects us to prophecy-talk our way out of any negative situation, rather than wait for him to do something. That’s why He said, “And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy”</p>
<p>This is the reason you must fill your heart with the Word, for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks (Matthew 12:34). When your heart is saturated with the word, right in the midst of trouble, the Word will well up in you and burst forth through your mouth! It doesn’t matter how dire the challenge you’re confronted with might seem, you can talk your way out of it. This was what the Lord told Ezekiel to do in the valley of dry bones: “And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest. Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.” (Ezekiel 37:3-4).</p>
<p>Ezekiel found himself in a valley full of dry bones and the Lord asked him, “Can these bones live?” That was an impossible situation, but God told Ezekiel to “prophecy to the bones.” As soon as Ezekiel complied, a great miracle took place: “and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone” (Ezekiel 37:7).</p>
<p>The challenges you face are bread for you; refuse to let them drown your faith. No matter how dry the valley may seem, you can talk your way out of it- you can prophecy your way out of any predicament. Keep talking your health, success, prosperity and victory. You can talk your way out of any trouble into the good life God has ordained for you. (Acts 2:17). To prophecy means to speak words of power. Meaning you can prophecy your way to the top; you can prophecy your way out of trouble, into the good life!</p>

<p>…let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith… (Hebrews 12:1-2).</p>
<p>Being born again, you were born into the environment called “Christ.” Christ is a person, and Christ is also a place. So you’re in Christ; that’s your domicile; that’s where you operate from as a child of God. Now that you’re in Christ, the Holy Spirit is leading and guiding you, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be temptations on your path; lots of distractions, to try to sway you off God’s course for your life; but you must keep your focus, and refuse to be distracted.</p>
<p>In the journey of life, many things will fight for your attention. It may be financial concerns, the growing trend of infectious and medically incurable diseases, concerns about the welfare of your family, concerns about your job or business, security concerns, etc. But you must make up your mind to give attention only to the Word of God. Put your trust in the Lord and His unfailing Word.</p>
<p>Set yourself on course to fulfil God’s destiny for your life by making a clear distinction between the world and Christ. Don’t live in this world like a man of this world; Jesus said in John 15:19, “…ye are not of the world….”</p>
<p>You’re to live in this world the way Abraham and other heroes of faith in the Bible did. Hebrews 11:13-16 says, “These all…confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly….” They lived as strangers; they didn’t live as citizens of this world; they didn’t live according to the system of this world.</p>
<p>Refuse to be subject to the principles of this world’s system. Your citizenship is of heaven, not of this world. Philippians 3:20 (MSG) tells us, “But there’s far more to life for us. We’re citizens of high heaven….” Hallelujah!</p>

<p>A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones (Proverbs 17:22).</p>
<p>I’ve had the opportunity to observe people over the years and I made a remarkable discovery: people who don’t laugh easily get sick, whereas laughing people hardly ever get sick. I discovered that laughter is more spiritual than many realize. There’s more to it than a mere response to a joke or hilarious event. In the Kingdom of God, laughter is medicine: A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones (Proverbs 17:22).</p>
<p>Laughter is generally found in the atmosphere that’s full of joy. The anointing of the Holy Spirit is most effective in such an environment, everything that’s not of God, including poverty, discouragement, sickness and diseases are dispelled. Thus it’s no wonder that the sick are easily healed in an atmosphere that saturated with joy.</p>
<p>Moreover, joy inspires success and prosperity. The joy I’m talking about isn’t of the world but of God. You received it the moment the Holy Spirit came to live in you. The Lord Jesus already told us in John 16:22, “but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.” This joy isn’t subject to circumstances of life. Paul the apostle reiterated this when he said, “As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing…”(2 Corinthians 6:10).</p>
<p>Let the joy of the Lord spring up from within your heart in spite of prevailing situations. Learn to laugh your way to victory! Remember, the Bible says “Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation,”(Isaiah 12:3). So learn to be joyful always! Let nothing take the laughter of the Spirit away from your mouth.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you (Luke 10:18-19).</p>
<p>I remember reading a book a long time ago in which the author stated that we ought to talk with satan with some respect. I was surprised. “Dear God! Talk to satan with respect?” I thought. It’s obvious the author didn’t understand what the Lord Jesus meant when He said, “And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils…”(Mark 16:17). Notice that He didn’t say we should ask devils to go out but to cast them out. “Kick out, throw out, chuck out, push out with force”; these are just some synonyms for “cast out.” Surely this isn’t a respectful way to treat someone.</p>
<p>You might be reading this and wondering, “But Pastor Chris, the Bible did say even Archangel Michael didn’t dare insult the devil amidst their dispute.” You’re right but I want to explain why he had to address the devil in that manner. But first let’s read the scripture you’re referring to: “Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee” (Jude 1:9). Firstly, remember that this event took place before Jesus was born into the world. Secondly, at this time, satan still had adamic authority which he stole from Adam in the Garden of Eden, when he disobeyed God and acted on satan’s rebellious words. Now adamic authority was higher than angelic authority. But when Jesus died and resurrected, He gave us a higher authority than what Adam had or what satan received from Adam.</p>
<p>The Bible says that when Jesus died, we died with Him. When He was buried, we were buried with Him. When God raised Him up, we were raised together with Him. And now we’re seated together with Him in heavenly realms (Ephesians 2:5-6). That’s our authority! Our authority is not that of a religious person; our authority is that of the blessed Jesus Christ, the Son of God; we function in His Name.</p>
<p>Several years ago, an evil spirit walked into the room while I was sleeping. Immediately, my eyes opened, I turned to him and I started to say, “In the…” I didn’t get to finish my statement before he disappeared. Hallelujah! So, if satan showed up in your room, don’t be perturbed; rather, tell him to get out, and he will (James 4:7). We are superior to satan; the Lord Jesus has given us complete authority over him and his cohorts (Luke 10:18-19). Therefore, reign in that greater revelation of your authority over him every day.</p>

<p>When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned… (Isaiah 43:2).</p>
<p>When you study God’s Word, the economic problems and upheavals in the world today wouldn’t be a surprise to you. The socio-economic conditions in our world today must not dictate the circumstances of our existence. They must not control our faith in the Word of God. The Bible says those who know their God shall be strong and shall do exploits (Daniel 11:32).</p>
<p>As a child of God, the troubles in the world are not set against you. Your prosperity is independent of inflation, economic meltdowns and downturns. You’re not of this world. You’re the seed of Abraham. Refuse to fret or be anxious, for if you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small (Proverbs 24:10). The Lord is your strength. Remain strong in Him and in the power of His might.</p>
<p>Read what He says about you in the times of dryness, scarcity, and crises: “Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is. For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit” (Jeremiah 17:7-8). Glory to God! Let this be your testimony today and always, because it’s God’s Word concerning you. You’re a victor and a success in Christ Jesus, regardless of the crises and adversities in today’s world.</p>
<p>The darkness isn’t about to go away, for the Bible says, “…behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people”; but the scripture didn’t stop there; it continues, “…but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee” (Isaiah 60:2). In the midst of the darkness, you’ll shine brightly. Actually, the darker the night, the more brightly your light will shine. Therefore, rejoice, because the Lord your God is your prosperity. There’s no failure for you; so there’s no need to fear. Maintain your composure, and your confession of the Word.</p>

<p>Serving God well begins with knowing why Jesus came and making Jesus&#x27; passion become your passion. Jesus thought we were important to God and we are important to God. Jesus came to save us, to deliver us and to give us life. Most of all and the purpose for doing all this, was to bring us into fellowship with God. That was the reason for saving us, for delivering us, for giving us eternal life.</p>
<p>The greatest thing a human being can ever know is to be in fellowship with God, where you can relate with Him knowing that He loves you; and most of all, to be in God and He in you. To discover Him and discover yourself in Him. In reality, that&#x27;s the purpose of life and until you discover that you haven&#x27;t truly lived.</p>
<p>Think of it, what is it that you could think lasting...think about the Pharaohs that were esteemed to be gods but when their time came, they passed on. What do you want? Fame? What truly counts in life? Self satisfaction? All these won&#x27;t change anything.</p>
<p>If people died, why then do they live? Why do we ever come if we have to go? The answer is in Jesus. Why did Jesus come? Why do we live?</p>
<p>Until and unless you discover your purpose for life, you haven&#x27;t lived. Fellowship with God is the idea; this isn&#x27;t be close or friends with God. These are ways to express our fellowship with Him. But when you discover, you&#x27;ll know that you are in Him and He in you. That was what Jesus meant when He said &quot;I am in my Father and my Father is in me&quot;.</p>
<p>When you know this, you move from human intelligence to glorious revelation. Humans are only given human intelligence but when you are born again, it translates human intelligence to wisdom.</p>
<p>ON THE HOLY SPIRIT &amp; GOD</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit isn&#x27;t some smoke, vapour or some cloud. He is a person. You can only describe the Holy Spirit with the scriptures. Never try to describe Him with your mind. You know the Holy Spirit through your spirit; your mind will fail you. It&#x27;s like trying to explain God. You can&#x27;t know that. Jesus had to show us by saying, if you&#x27;ve seen me you have seen the Father. The disciples couldn&#x27;t get it because they were trying to relate with their senses. But when they received the Holy Spirit, they had Spiritual Understanding.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 9:24-26
24. Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.
25. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
26. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t run like it doesn&#x27;t matter; some are living like it doesn&#x27;t matter. Run that you may win the prize. Our race is for an imperishable prize. Live to obtain a prize for Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>MESSAGE FOR THE MONTH</p>
<p>In the Month of June, the message of the Month was on &quot;How to Bless&quot;. In November, it was the Month of Blessings.</p>
<p>DECEMBER IS THE MONTH OF BLESSINGS IN THANKSGIVING</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 14:15-16
15. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
16. Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</p>
<p>When Jesus blessed, He gave thanks. In this month of December, bless God by giving thanks... For who He is, for all He&#x27;s done in your life and for His mighty works.</p>

<p>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward (Hebrews 10:35).</p>
<p>It’s the last month of the year 2019—our “Year of Lights.” Perhaps, you might have been troubled and saying in your heart, “Lord, I still have goals and things I want to do. I want to receive more money for this, and for that; now the year is almost coming to an end.” Don’t think that way with God. Stay in eternity. Live in eternity. Think differently. Don’t “push” God like natural men do. Live with Him in His realm of life. Don’t get under the pressure.</p>
<p>When you get under pressure because of what you want to accomplish within a certain time, you become a slave to time. Don’t let that happen to you. Time should be a slave to you. Psalm 37:4-5 says, “Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.”</p>
<p>Nothing is too difficult for, or impossible with, the Lord; He’s the great God. He said in Jeremiah 32:27, “Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?” His greatness is beyond description. His power is limitless. Trust Him, and trust His ability. He can do for you in a second, what naturally should have taken you ten years to achieve. Within the last part of this year, you can receive anything that you desire of Him. Jesus said in John 16:24, “…ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.”</p>
<p>He wants your joy to be full; therefore, keep your faith active; ask and receive. Stand firm; stay strong. Believe and keep affirming the Word even in the face of staggering oppositions. Never give up, for faith always wins.</p>

<p>It is said that Africans only celebrate people when they are gone (when they&#x27;ve checked out of this physical world). This kind of attitude must change. This kind of culture is not an African culture but a demonic culture. We must learn to celebrate what is good and good things will come to us. We must learn to believe and love the truth. If we love the truth; the truth will come to us. People who love lies will always have lies. Their lives will always be a manifestation of lies.</p>
<p>Love the truth and the truth will celebrate you. Africa, hear me; celebrate good things. When you find something good, don&#x27;t destroy or curse it, don&#x27;t be the one who will not let good things rise. When people do good things, praise them. It&#x27;s so sad that throughout Africa, people only love the dead, they celebrate the dead and destroy the living. Those working in the Media no longer report when good is done... They only spread the news that brings others down and makes our continent look bad.</p>
<p>Today a lot of people in Africa have come to believe that anything good or successful must have some elements of demonic power. This kind of mindset is completely wrong. Celebrate good things and you will find the Spirit of God working on your behalf. We have sportsmen and women who have done well, celebrate them. We have politicians who have done well, let&#x27;s celebrate them. We have all kinds of achievers in our societies, they should be celebrated and not destroyed.</p>
<p>I say to those working in the Media to write good news. Africa, celebrate good things, celebrate what you have. This message is a call for change, leaders of Nations should look for what is good in their country and praise it. Do not destroy the image of a man just so you can look good. In school, praise what is good. The government no longer give scholarship for excellence in school, all that has been forgotten. We have to change such a system and do what is right.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t frame up good people, don&#x27;t castigate their character or make them look bad. If we make everyone look bad, the younger generation has nothing to look up to. Let&#x27;s praise what is good and be wise in our dealings with others. Join me to say, &quot;Africa, be wise!&quot; The call is the same throughout the world calling for Africa to be wise. It&#x27;s time we Praise and celebrate what is good in our society.</p>
<p>If we do this little thing, the will be a great difference and we will begin to celebrate more and more prosperity. The prosperity that few people are enjoying will become what every other person can partake. Everyone may not be rich the same, but everyone can have enough. More than enough such that they can help someone else.</p>

<p>And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever (Genesis 13:14-15).</p>
<p>When the Lord told Abraham to lift up his eyes and look in the scripture above, He wasn’t referring to the man’s physical eyes, but to the eyes of the spirit. God told him all the land he could ”see” was his; it was now up to Abraham to decide how far he wanted to see. Being a man of faith, he looked from his spirit and saw the whole world. The Bible says ”For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.” (Romans 4:13). Abraham became the heir of the whole world by faith.</p>
<p>Now, that’s not the end of the story. The Bible says ”So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham” (Galatians 3:9). You’re as much the heir of the world as Abraham: ”And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). No wonder the Bible declare that God has given you everything require for life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3). However, it’s that which you’ve taken possession of by faith, that which your spirit has embraced, that you can enjoy. SO IT&#x27;S UP TO YOU! As far as your eyes can see, that’s what the Lord has given to you for an inheritance.</p>
<p>The question then is, ”WHAT DO YOU SEE?” Concerning the coming year, for example, what do you see? Can you see yourself making progress? Can you see yourself walking in health, prosperity, joy and peace? You’ve got to see it, for that’s the key. See yourself walking in the wonderful blessings of God in the coming year</p>
<p>As you meditate on the Word and pray about the coming year, see yourself making unprecedented progress in every area of your life. See God taking you from glory to glory. Perhaps you’ve been praying and asking God for a child, see the child with your spirit first. Whatever you’ve taken possession of from within, will certainly manifest in the physical.</p>
<p>Start practicing how to see from your spirit, for your spirit is where the light of God is. God doesn’t function in the realm of the mind or senses. If your going to enjoy all the wonderful benefits of salvation God has in store for you, then you’ve got to see with the eyes of faith and speak forth what you see.</p>

<p>We will continue to outdo our past… We are going to demonstrate the glory of God in our lives. The little one shall become a thousand. Our message, our lives are springing forth from Isaiah 60:1 to the end. Read and see what God has said concerning us. That’s where we are living in right now, and we’re moving with it… He has sent us as lights into the nations of the world. If you thought that God has done great things in your life before now, hear what the Lord is saying:</p>
<p>PROPHECY:</p>
<p>The Spirit of God says I will do a new thing… you will see miraculous interventions of the Spirit in your life and your affairs. Tell my children “I want to do them good. Tell them “it is my joy to do them good, even in simple matters of life”. Everything you don’t want will stop, and everything you want will flow. Refuse to be afraid. We’re moving… Money will hear your voice, for the world is coming to a climax of a confused state. The world is coming to a season of fear, doubt, and unbelief, but God is saying, I have raised my children with my Word. The financial systems of the world will go into chaos…but those that do know their God, they shall be strong and do exploits.</p>
<p>As we journey into the coming year, fear not to give unto God… it is for your advantage, your security. For the powers of the world shall be shaken saith the Lord, and there shall be a great fear. Many that were high shall be brought low, and they shall wonder and say, “how did this happen?” Many shall wonder and say How did this happen? But your light is come, and the glory of God is risen upon you. When men shall say where is help? You shall say “I am helped”. When men shall say where is God? You shall say “He sent me to you.” For there shall be great fear and great confusion all around the world. But my glory shall be seen all around my children. For their light shall shine brightly, and even more brightly, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death (Revelation 12:11).</p>
<p>Some Christians sometimes find themselves in a situation where, right after testifying of a miracle or a prophecy they received from the Lord, everything seems to turn upside down. For example, someone received healing and went ahead to testify openly of his miracle. Shortly after, the same symptoms he used to experience came back, and became even more severe. That’s an attack from the enemy, testing your confidence in what God has done in your life. At such times, what you ought to do is to maintain your testimony. You keep your victory shout on and refuse to allow those symptoms rob you of the healing you’ve received.</p>
<p>That you’re not “feeling” any symptom of sickness isn’t the proof that you’ve been healed. The proof of your healing is the Word of God. So, concerning your miracle, always maintain your testimony; don’t give in to the lies of the devil. The devil isn’t going to stand back and congratulate you when you receive a miracle from God. He’ll fire all his darts at you; but refuse to be moved.</p>
<p>It’s like what transpired right after the baptism of Jesus at the Jordan. God spoke out of heaven and said “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased”(Matthew 3:17). Immediately, satan came to Jesus and asked “If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread” (Matthew 4:3). He tried to counter the very word God spoke about Jesus. But the Master was smarter than that; He told satan off with the Word. That’s what you need to do when satan comes to you with his lies and railing accusations; use the Word against him.</p>
<p>Whenever you receive a miracle or a word from God, you have just signed up for a fight of faith. The enemy will try all his antics and tactics to deceive you, but maintain your testimony, irrespective of how tough times get. That way, you deflate the enemy and deflect all the lying darts he throws at you (Ephesians 6:16, 2 Corinthians 2:11).</p>

<p>And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing (Isaiah 10:27).</p>
<p>1 Samuel 22:2 tells us of the different people that gathered themselves unto David: “…every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.”</p>
<p>This was a rendezvous of broken people with difficulties in various areas of their lives. They were behind in their finances, dissatisfied, unhappy, uncomfortable and discontented. These were the men that came to David, to be trained and mentored by him. But before then, David had been anointed by the prophet of God, Samuel (1 Samuel 16:12-13). So these men gathered unto David, because they understood that the anointing David had received was what they needed to come out of their difficult situation.</p>
<p>When you read further into the twenty-third chapter, several years later, their hitherto disgruntled state had changed. They were now called David’s mighty men (2 Samuel 23:8). When it was time to give for the building of the temple, these men who were once in debt had become so prosperous that they gave so much for the construction of the Temple (1 Chronicles 29:6-7).</p>
<p>It reminds me of when we first started out in the ministry. Those who came to us–those we ministered to and won to Christ–were those who some other Christians thought were too carnal, broken, dejected or too lost to be transformed. But we had the anointing that made the difference. Today, their stories have changed, and the same people are the ones doing great and mighty things for the Lord all around the world.</p>
<p>In Isaiah 32:15, the Bible says “Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.” The Holy Spirit brings the anointing into your life and makes you productive. He turns your wilderness into a fruitful field; He causes water to spring up from your desert. With the Holy Spirit your experience will be that of productivity, growth, increase, expansion and progress in every area of your life, and a bursting forth on every side. Also, the anointing imparts authority to your words and brings grace into your life, causing you to walk in divine favour. Things just fall into place for you; failure, poverty and defeat became separated from your life.</p>

<p>Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. (Psalm 141:2)</p>
<p>Paul prayed a beautiful prayer for the saints at Ephesus, making mention of how he bowed his knees in prayer: “For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named…” (Ephesians 3:14-15). There are certain things you do at times of communication with the Father that are spiritual acts of worship, and tend to make your prayer much more effective. For example, when you bow your knees and lift your hands to the Lord in prayer; it’s a demonstration of deep spiritual truth revealed to us in God’s Word.</p>
<p>Exodus 17, tells us the story of how Joshua led Israel to battle against the Amalekites of Rephidim. The Bible specifically revealed to us that the course of the battle was determined–not by the fierceness of the warlords–but outside the battle ground; on the mountain where Moses lifted up his hands: “And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed” (Exodus 17:11).</p>
<p>When Aaron and Hur discovered this “secret” and observed Moses’ hands had become heavy, therefore going down, they took a stone, placed it under hims, so he could sit down. Then, the Bible says Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on either side. Thus, Moses’ hands were steady until the going down of the sun, until Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword (Exodus 17:12-13).</p>
<p>There’s something powerful in the lifting up of our hands unto the Lord in prayer and in worship. As your hands are lifted up in the presence of the Lord during prayer, and you speak forth words of praise and worship to Him, extolling His majesty, you’re sending incense of a sweet-smelling savour unto heaven.</p>
<p>Learn to do this often. As you bow your knees to the Lord in prayer, let your hands go up as well. This has nothing to do with whether or not you feel like it; do it because the Word says so. 1 Timothy 2:8 says “I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.” The Apostle Paul was referring to spiritual worship, where you extol the King and glorify His holy Name with your hands lifted high!</p>
<p>The more you do this, praying intensely from your spirit, the easier it’ll be for you to make contact with God’s divine flow, making your life an outflow of the miraculous.</p>

<p>Psalms 119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</p>
<p>God’s word is light and truth.</p>
<p>There are many types of mistakes that people make. Some make king size mistakes. But God’s word inside you will help you make the right decisions in life. Nations have gone to war because someone made a mistake. Lives had been lost because someone made a mistake. The destinies of families and children have gone the wrong way because someone made a mistake. A lot of times they didn’t know they were making a mistake because they did not listen to God’s word.</p>
<p>The ending of the year and the beginning of the year are periods of serious demonic manifestations and operations hence, most people are misled. People take decisions at these times because their flesh talked to them and at such times, they cannot be corrected or be given to the counsel of the Holy Spirit. Because they have given themselves to strongholds. Sometimes, they were not even aware of their actions.</p>
<p>Pray in the Spirit and study the scriptures. Diligently study the word. Don’t remove the landmarks which the Fathers have set.</p>
<p>Proverbs 22:28 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.</p>

<p>&quot;For we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:10).</p>
<p>Always, I pray to God to guide my heart in His Word and help me please Him more. This is what you should be most concerned with as a Christian: how to please God and ensure your heart goes after Him.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not talking about the works of righteousness because if you&#x27;re a Christian then you&#x27;re expected to produce works of righteousness. God wouldn&#x27;t reward you for doing right; you&#x27;re supposed to do right. What you are rewarded for is the impact you make in the lives of others and for the life that you lived toward God in your love for Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>God rewards us for our commitment to soul-winning, our giving for the advancement of the Kingdom work, and for every sacrifice of our time, talent and energy to move the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ forward. The Bible says, &quot;And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever&quot; (Daniel 12:3).</p>
<p>I share this truth with you because I want you to be conscious of the end of all things. You can decide now the type of reward you want to receive from God; you can determine it. Just as a builder can determine the quality of the house he wants to build right from the beginning, even before he starts.</p>
<p>You must make up your mind to be a blesser of lives; you must touch lives with the gospel of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>A small rudder on a huge ship in the hands of a skilled captain sets a course in the face of the strongest winds. A word out of your mouth may seem of no account, but it can accomplish nearly anything—or destroy it! It only takes a spark, remember, to set off a forest fire. (James 3:4-5 -The Message)</p>
<p>The Lord has done so much for us, but it’s our responsibility to keep ourselves in the blessing. Just as the Lord told the children of Israel in the wilderness, He’s saying to you today, “I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing” (Deuteronomy 30:19). Through your confession, you can choose what you want your life to be. Your mouth is the key that’ll unlock the blessing in your life!</p>
<p>You can open the doors of life and blessing in your life with your mouth; and with the same mouth you can introduce death and curses as well. 1 Peter 3:10-11 says, “For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile” Through your tongue is small, it controls everything in your life; with it, you can chart your course unto a victorious life.</p>
<p>The Lord has given us the keys of the Kingdom of heaven, and that means we can use our mouths to unlock doors of blessings (Matthew 16:19). Therefore, you have to fill your heart with God’s Word, “…for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh”(Matthew 12:34).</p>
<p>Proverbs 15:4 says, “A wholesome tongue is a tree of life…” There’s no situation that can’t be changed and no wound in your body that can’t be healed. You can cause a change by making your tongue your own tree of life by declaring God’s Word over your life and situation.</p>
<p>The fact that you can walk out of misery, poverty, lack, depression, unhappiness and death, is simply exciting. You can walk out of anything that demeans you today. All you need is to get into the good life by using your tongue right and your life will change.</p>

<p>I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting (1 Timothy 2:8).</p>
<p>The Bible shows us something remarkable on how the children of Israel recorded victory over the Amalekites. Moses had instructed Joshua to take soldiers to fight Amalek. Joshua did as Moses instructed, but Moses decided to go to the top of the hills, with Aaron and Hur, whilst Joshua battled the Amalekites. As the battle progressed, Aaron and Hur made an observation. They noticed that every time Moses held up his hands, Israel prevailed in the battle against Amalek. However, when his hands went down, Amalek prevailed. They decided, therefore, to support Moses by lifting his hands on either side, while Moses sat on a stone. As a result, the Bible says, “…Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword” (Exodus 17:13).</p>
<p>What’s most inspiring about this is how an act of faith in the earth activated heavenly powers, and caused victory for God’s people. Moses wasn’t talking, but as long as his hands were lifted to the Lord, Israel prevailed. It shows that there’s a profuse effusion of divine power as we lift our hands in prayer and worship. There’s victory-power through our hands. No wonder Paul said, “I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands…” (1 Timothy 2:8).</p>
<p>If you want to see more success and victories in your life, learn to lift your hands to the Lord as you set your mind on Him in prayer and worship; it’s a strategy of the Spirit to discomfit the adversary.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re in church, your cell-group or fellowship meetings, and the Pastor or leader says, “Lift your hands to the Lord in worship,” don’t take them up and bring them down carelessly, because you feel tired. Keep them lifted to the Lord. Train yourself in this. There’s something deeply spiritual about lifting and waving your hands to the Lord in worship and prayer. It brings and signals victory and dominion over your circumstances and adversaries. Glory to God!</p>
<p>PRAYER
Gracious Father, my hands are lifted to you in worship and adoration. There’s none like you; you’re great and mighty; you alone are God! From generation to generation, you’re the same: faithful, righteous, and true! You’re the strong and breastfed one, my ever-present help in times of need. I worship you today</p>
<p>Merry Christmas...</p>

<p>I am in God’s place for my life! I am like a tree planted by the rivers of water, my leaves are evergreen and shall never wither. I flourish like a palm tree and like the cedars of Lebanon. I do not know when dryness comes.</p>
<p>I function under the auction of the Holy Spirit and I know all things. I am like the city set on a hill, I cannot be hidden. I am the light of the world; the salt of the earth, I preserve the earth. I do not walk in darkness because my path is that of a shining light that shines brighter and brighter unto the perfect day. It can only get better for me.</p>
<p>I walk in divine health because I have got the life of God in me, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet. Every fibre of my being, every bone of my body, every cell of my blood is inundated with the life of God.</p>
<p>I am a champion for life. Prosperity is mine, Favor is mine. My victory is sure. I am making progress, moving forward and upward only. No stagnation in my life! I am a success for life because of the Holy Spirit. I deal excellently in all my affairs, none of my feet shall ever slide. I have an excellent spirit. Hallelujah.</p>
<p>The wisdom of God is at work in me mightily; I know what to do, what to say, who to meet. All at the right time. I’ll never miss my way. The knowledge of God is increasing in my life. I increase in Grace which produces in my life, beauty, honour, acceptability, loveliness, goodwill, benefits, endurance, promotion, elegance, charm, glory, favour.</p>
<p>I increase in divine favor, I increase in speed and accuracy. No weapon formed against me shall ever prosper. Greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world.

I can never be disadvantaged; for all things are orchestrated for my benefits.</p>
<p>I cannot be disadvantaged in any way, its all working together for my good because I love the Lord. My finances are booming all the time, I lay up gold as dust. I increase in fortune. Great is my peace and prosperity. I am a great personality; a force to be reckoned with, I have access to all nations, no limitations, no boundaries.</p>
<p>The glory of God is risen upon me, I am the effulgence of God’s presence. God tabernacles in me, I carry His atmosphere of miracles everywhere I go. I am strengthened, energized, endued with power, ability and might. I am a great minister of the gospel of our Lord Jesus. I am an ardent soul winner. The word of God shall prosper in my life and fulfill in me what it talks about.</p>
<p>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. I am who God says I am. I am a blessing to my world and All I lay my hands upon to do shall prosper and be blessed. Kings shall come to my rising. My future is bright and glorious, I cannot fail, neither can I be defeated. I win always, in every situation. Every mountain before me is made plain, all crooked paths are made straight. Hallelujah.</p>
<p>I am the head and not the tail. Any careless word that I have spoken or has been spoken concerning me is nullified in Jesus Name. Grace and peace are multiplied unto me. Springs of joy wells up within me all the time. The word of God is effective in my life.</p>
<p>I am super-favoured, I live in superabundance because I am connected to God’s unending supply system. The love of God is shed abroad in my heart and this love radiates to all around me. Nothing can stop me, nothing can hinder me. The hand of God rest upon me and my household.</p>
<p>I function from the position of rest, I live a struggle free, worry free life all the time…Oh glory to God!! I’ve been qualified to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in light. Darkness has no place in me, for I’m native-born to the light.</p>

<p>December 24, 2019.</p>
<p>MESSAGE: FOR THIS PURPOSE.</p>
<p>We are gathered here today in honour of our Lord Jesus Christ. The angels celebrated the virgin birth of Jesus. All of creation celebrated Him. He wasn&#x27;t born for nothing. He was born for a purpose. Our celebration is for a purpose. Our singing, our dancing are all for this purpose.</p>
<p>Three Important Things That We Should Always Remember.</p>
<p>Why Christmas? It is not so we could have a holiday like some people think. Christmas is more than a holiday.</p>
<p>Luke19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>
<p>His purpose was clear. He came on a mission. He lived His mission. God has never created anything without a purpose. There is nothing that exist in the earth without a purpose.</p>
<p>Nothing exist in the earth without a purpose. You were not born for nothing. You came into this world for a purpose. Discover your purpose. Don&#x27;t live am empty life. Discover your purpose and live it. Jesus knew His purpose. The son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>
<p>1 Tim 1:15 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>
<p>He came into the world to save sinners. He came into the world for a purpose. Imagine that you were born with the understanding, the knowledge that you were born to die for others. So you grew up that the knowledge that your life is to be poured out for the sake of others.</p>
<p>I John 3:5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.</p>
<p>The Bible says He was in the world, the world was created by Him and the world knew Him not. Now He says He was manifested to take away our sins and in Him is no sin.</p>
<p>1 John 3:6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him. 7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous. 8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus came to seek and to save the lost.
Look at Jesus at the well at Samaria. He knew that the woman was going to be there. Her life was a mess. Jesus went seeking her. She would be embarrassed to see 13 men so Jesus sent His disciples to go buy food. Jesus didn&#x27;t want her embarrassed because her life was a mess, broken. She has had five husbands and the one she was with was not her husband.</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus told her, if you knew who is asking you for water, you would rather ask him for water and if you drink my water you will never thirst again Jesus ministered the word to her and she believed and ran back to the city and told every one because now she became bold. When you encounter Jesus, something happens in your life, your shame is forever gone. Here was a woman who was ashamed to come to the well. She had to come when nobody else was there, now she goes to the city, calling everyone to come see a man who told me everything I ever did. Isn&#x27;t this the Christ, the messiah?</p>
<p>He came to seek and to save the lost. Have you ever said to yourself, I have got to go seek and save the lost or do you always wait until they come to you?</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>He came to give us life that we may live.
Every time we celebrate Christmas, remember that He came to seek and to save that which was lost, to look for them and to save them.</li>
</ol>
<p>There was a man who Jesus described as full of sores. He was a beggar at the gate of a wealthy man. In the process of time, Lazarus died and the angels came to pick him up. Why did the angels waited for so long? Why didn&#x27;t they pick him earlier? It is because every sick man, every poor man, every needy person is our opportunity. God knew what to do all the time. He could have taken him much earlier but he was giving the rich man an opportunity. Lazarus at the gate of the rich man was an opportunity for the rich man.</p>
<p>There is a man at your gate for your salvation. We think that they did something bad,</p>

<p>For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day (2 Corinthians 4:16).</p>
<p>Eternal life is the life with agelessness. When you received eternal life, you passed from death to life; from time into timelessness; from age into agelessness. In Christ, we grow; we don’t age.</p>
<p>It’s important you catch this, because the generation of the Church that catches this truth is the generation of the glory. The human body wasn’t made to grow old and die. In Bible accounts, some people lived to be over nine hundred years, some eight hundred, and others seven hundred and so on. But the number of years that man lived on earth progressively reduced because of sin, according to the scriptures.</p>
<p>However, the Bible says that Jesus Christ took the punishment for our sins, and died to save us. If indeed this is true; if indeed, He laid down His life for us on account of our sins, it therefore means that the problem of sin has been dealt with. In that case, the effect of sin should no longer continue.</p>
<p>As a result, man should no longer be a victim of age. His years should no longer be limited to 70, 80, or 120, because being born again, you’ve been brought into His glory and should be living a glorified life. You’re supposed to be a victor everyday of your life. Nothing on earth should make you a victim; not even old age, because when you come into the zone of agelessness, you can grow without ageing.</p>
<p>Take Moses for example, the Bible says that at a hundred and twenty years of age, his eyes weren’t dim; his physical stature wasn’t abated: “And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated” (Deuteronomy 34:7). Even though he could see that he was clearly an old man, his physical stature was strong.</p>
<p>He wasn’t the only one. At the age of eighty-five, Caleb said, “I am as strong today as I was when I was forty; therefore, give me this mountain” (Joshua 14:7-12). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Grow, but don’t age! Don’t be like those who are only forty-two and they say, “You know I’m not so young anymore.” Christ makes you forever alive, strong, and effective. You have eternal life; meaning you’re in the ageless zone. Blessed be God!</p>

<p>The year 2020 is a special year. Not because it is twenty twenty, no, not because we are starting a new decade. The year is special because of the plan that God has for us. God lives in eternity. We live in time and time is a segment of eternity.</p>
<p>Genesis 6:9 KJV<!-- -->:These<!-- --> are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.</p>
<p>Genesis 17:KJV<!-- -->:And<!-- --> when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.</p>
<p>2020 IS THE YEAR OF PERFECTION!</p>
<p>Perfection is a word that terrifies a lot of people. We have been told all our lives that no one is perfect. They train us to accept our imperfections.</p>
<p>In the scriptures, God never said perfection is impossible. On the contrary, perfections is what God desires and demands. Perfection is at different levels.</p>
<p>Perfection means to be flawless, complete.</p>
<p>Look at the Scripture God told Abraham to walk before him and be perfect. He wants him to be flawless.</p>
<p>We produce perfect stuff, perfect devices, perfect machines. This should let you know that perfection is possible.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s another thing. Job 1:1 KJV<!-- -->:There<!-- --> was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</p>
<p>Look at verse 8 God is addressing the devil and he said 8 KJV<!-- -->:And<!-- --> the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s hear Jesus just incase you are thinking these are old testament. Matthew 5:48 KJV<!-- -->:Be<!-- --> ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</p>
<p>Jesus said so, imagine a child when he is born, he can&#x27;t do anything for himself; but this baby is as perfect as anyone else.</p>
<p>Ecclesiastics 3:14</p>
<p>KJV<!-- -->:I<!-- --> know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</p>
<p>Whatsoever God made lasts forever.</p>
<p>I once prayed for some people and one of them was blind. After I prayed, I asked if any of them had been healed and non raised a hand. I when back to my seat and asked God what happened? God told me that the blind man was healed. I met him and he claimed he still can&#x27;t see and i told him that he was healed. We argued it for some time. Then I told him to stop saying he can&#x27;t see. I asked him to look a few times and he began to see. He left there healed. He could have left that meeting still blind.</p>
<p>God&#x27;s Word is truth. Truth is different from fact.</p>
<p>I am a perfect being from a perfect God.</p>
<p>FOUR (4) THINGS THAT ARE NECESSARY</p>
<ol>
<li>ALIGNMENT</li>
</ol>
<p>There is going to be an alignment. It&#x27;s a training. There will be an alignment of your will and purpose with God&#x27;s purpose and will.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>COMPLETENESS.</li>
</ol>
<p>It from the Greek Plerul. It means to be full. You will be full of God&#x27;s word. When this happens, you will be amazed at what will be produced.</p>
<p>I will be full of God&#x27;s Word in 2020. God&#x27;s Word will dwell in me richly.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>EXCELLENCE.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will bring you into that ultimate position. Excellence is not something you struggle for. It&#x27;s your nature. I have an excellent Spirit. Live your life every day and think just like this.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:1KJV<!-- -->:Be<!-- --> ye therefore followers of God, as dear children</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>TELESPHORI</li>
</ol>
<p>Luke 8:14 KJV<!-- -->:And<!-- --> that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</p>
<p>This means to come to fruition. It means to come to the state where it produces result. It&#x27;s like a pregnant woman who carries her baby to the time of birth.</p>
<p>There will be no aborting of your plans. You will produce result with your ideas. You will bring your babies to fruition.</p>

<p>For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Romans 10:10).</p>
<p>Our opening verse says you believe with your heart, and are made right with God; however, with the mouth, confession (Greek: homologeo) is made unto salvation. It is your confession that activates and causes the blessings of salvation to be actualized in your life, so don’t be quiet. Speak the Word always.</p>
<p>There’re those who say Christianity is of the heart, so you don’t have to say anything; just keep it in your heart, to yourself. Well, that’s not Christianity! You can’t know the Word of God and be quiet; more so, the Bible says, “with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” There’re tremendous blessings in salvation, and to enjoy them, you’ve got to be a talker; a Word-talker.</p>
<p>Salvation is a big word; it encapsulates all the beautiful results of the redemptive work of Christ: salvation, divine life, healing and health, freedom, liberty, preservation, deliverance, etc. These are all in the blessings of salvation; they all came in one package. If perhaps, you’ve been in a mess or have found yourself in some predicament, what you need to do is to confess the Word, and by your confessions, you catapult yourself to the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how deep in the dungeon you find yourself; it doesn’t matter how overwhelming the problem is, confess the Word and you’ll come out victoriously. You might want to ask, “How do I confess the Word?” Confession is your response in agreement with the Word.</p>
<p>For example, you may feel headaches, but what do you say in such a situation? Someone may say, “O, my head is really aching”; that’s the wrong confession. You ought to say, “I have the life of God in me, therefore, every fibre of my being, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, is vitalized by the Spirit of God that lives in me! I’m healthy and strong.”</p>
<p>You’re not an ordinary person; you’re born of God; you’re born of His Word, and must therefore live by the Word. We’re victorious by the Word on our lips—the words we speak in agreement with God’s Word.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="believe-in-perfection-pastor-chris-oyakhilome1024">BELIEVE IN PERFECTION ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~1024<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BELIEVE IN PERFECTION ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~1024" title="Direct link to BELIEVE IN PERFECTION ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~1024" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#believe-in-perfection-pastor-chris-oyakhilome1024">​</a></h2>
<p>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect (Matthew 5:48).</p>
<p>There’re many who don’t believe that perfection is possible. When you try to talk to them about perfection, they don’t want to hear it. With a sneer, they accuse you of being a &quot;perfectionist,&quot; because in their erroneous belief, &quot;nobody can be perfect.&quot; Yet, when you study the Word, there’s no place that suggests to us the impossibility of perfection. God doesn’t give us a chance not to be perfect. Everything about Him calls for perfection; He requires us to be perfect, not when we get to heaven, but here and now—in the earth!</p>
<p>The reason most people don’t think perfection is possible, which is why they’re not perfect, is that they don’t know what perfection is. Perfection is like success, which can be measured at different stages of your life, according to the set-out objectives, purpose, and goal. Perfection is measured according to the light, instruction, or information that you have with respect to the underlying objectives.</p>
<p>Our opening verse says, &quot;Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.&quot; The word &quot;perfect&quot; here is the Greek &quot;teleios,&quot; which describes perfection in your heart; a completeness; measuring your heart with the heart of God. The way to do this is through the Word. Think, love and forgive as God wants you to—let your heart be like the Father’s heart.</p>
<p>The word &quot;perfect&quot; is also used in 2 Corinthians 13:11; it says, &quot;Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect….&quot; This time, another Greek word, &quot;katartizo&quot; is used for &quot;perfect.&quot; It means to do things perfectly. This is not the perfection in the heart (teleios) but of your actions: the things you do and how you do them. The emphasis here is on doing things impeccably right the first time. And the first step in achieving this is learning to pay attention to details!</p>
<p>Believe in perfection and don’t be intimidated by it. Your perfection will be judged according to the training and information that you’ve received, not the one you didn’t get. So, practise being perfect; think and talk perfection, because the Lord requires it of you.</p>

<p>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them (Ephesians 2:10).</p>
<p>Never accept anything contrary to what the Word says about you. If you’re experiencing weakness, doubt, discouragement, and other negativities in your life, don’t accept them. Your life is for the glory of God; you’re God’s workmanship, fashioned for excellence. You’re born of God, for glory and for beauty.</p>
<p>Read 1 Peter 2:9 (AMPC) and shout for joy! It says, “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.” The Word of God is for doing. When you read a scripture like this, you must respond. You declare, “I’m the crowning beauty of God’s creation; the consummation of His work! My life is full of the glory, beauty, wisdom, and perfections of God, and I manifest these to my world!”</p>
<p>God created you for His glory, and not for poverty, sickness, disease or failure. You’re His excellent handiwork; how could anyone think of you as a failure? God wouldn’t, and couldn’t make anything that fails, let alone you. You’re God’s workmanship, meaning you’re the best of you that there is and could ever be! The Bible says, “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures” (James 1:18).</p>
<p>You’re the first and the best of everything God made; you’re peculiar. You can whip any giant and beat down any mountain, because you’re God’s workmanship; He’s confident in your ability to always win in the crises of life because He knows His product. His stamp or seal of perfection is on you, certifying perfect health; you’re immune to satanic attacks; you’re “poverty-proof!” You’re without blemish. Therefore, give no room to anything that’s not of God in your life. Blessed be God!</p>

<p>A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit (Proverbs 15:4).</p>
<p>Using your mouth rightly is a vital key that unlocks the blessings of salvation in your life! Stressing the importance of this, 1 Peter 3:10-11 says, “For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.” Though your tongue is small, it controls everything in your life; with it, you can chart your course in righteousness, dominion, success, and prosperity. There&#x27;s no situation that can’t be changed, and no wound in your body that can’t be healed, if you&#x27;d make your tongue your own tree of life by declaring God’s Word over your life and situation.</p>
<p>The word, “wholesome” in our opening verse is translated from the Hebrew word, “marpe,” which means healing and health. A “wholesome  ” tongue, therefore, is a tongue that’s curative, a fountain of life, because it&#x27;s filled with the Word of God!</p>
<p>Speak God’s Word; speak health, wellness, and life to your body; that’s what your mouth is for. Your mouth wasn’t given to you merely for eating and drinking; its greater use is for controlling your life. Your present position in life is the result of your “mouth-work.” Matthew 12:37 says, “For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned,” letting you know that you’re to regulate your life with your tongue: What you say is what you get!</p>
<p>Often times, there’re those who wonder why the circumstances of their lives, and their experiences, don&#x27;t seem to align with the wonderful blessings and provisions of the Gospel, despite being born again for several years. The reason for this dilemma is that they haven’t made their tongue their own tree of life. </p>
<p>You can be anything you want to be, have anything you want to have, and achieve anything you want to achieve within God’s perfect will. The key is in regulating your life with your tongue, making your tongue your own tree of life!</p>

<p>Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff (Isaiah 41:15)</p>
<p>In Joshua 1:2-3, The LORD said to Joshua: “….now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.” Thus, by this instruction the children of Israel knew that all they had to do to take possession of the land God gave to them was to step on it. Once they stepped on it, it became theirs.</p>
<p>But in the New Testament, there’s a difference. The power isn’t in your feet, but in your mouth. Many Christians haven’t understood this truth, so they walk in ignorance. When trying to acquire something, like a piece of property for example, you’ll find them marching around it because the LORD said, “Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.” Oh, that they would realize that the victory is now in their mouth! Today, it’s no longer “Where the soles of your feet shall tread upon” rather, it’s “you shall have what you say!” Possession is with your mouth.</p>
<p>The Old Testament folks were taught to battle that way because they functioned in the sense (physical) realm. But now in the New Testament, we battle differently, from the realm of The Spirit. In that realm, there’s no recognition of distance; you don’t need to march around a building to get it. All you need do is use your mouth, for it has been given to you to chart your course and to do battle which is your fight of faith. How important the mouth is!</p>
<p>Every time you release words with your mouth, you’re wielding a dangerous weapon. The Greek word for mouth is “stoma”, which means “the front or edge of a weapon.” With this weapon, you can cut down such enemies as poverty, failure, cancer, diabetes, HIV and so on. When you declare: “This growth will not stay in my body,” you’re cutting it down with your weapon. No wonder the Bible says, “For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds” (2 Corinthians 10:4)</p>

<p>SUNDAY, 12TH JANUARY</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Starting the year in the right way is very important. From the beginning of the year you can determine how the year is going to wind up - to determine that by the end of the year, God&#x27;s glory will be far greater. That&#x27;s your responsibility not God&#x27;s.</p>
<p>1 Peter 2:9 (KJV, AMPC)</p>
<p>This scripture is talking to us who are born again. When you&#x27;re born again you&#x27;re brought out of darkness, out of the systems of this world into God&#x27;s kingdom, a new environment.</p>
<p>When you&#x27;re born again, you receive the life and nature of God. This new life surplants the old. It&#x27;s your spirit that&#x27;s born again. When you&#x27;re born again, you&#x27;re brought into the body of Christ and become one with the Saints of Christ.</p>
<p>The Bible is the mirror of the Spirit; it&#x27;s God&#x27;s mirror. And when you&#x27;re born again, you receive the Spirit for the interpretation of the truth in God&#x27;s word.</p>
<p>1 Peter 2:9 tells us that we are royalty. The word &quot;shew forth the praises&quot; in the KJV means to constantly display those things that will be praise to God. The AMPC version explains it well as follows;</p>
<p>&quot;But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.&quot;</p>
<p>We are imitators of God. You can&#x27;t copy God if you don&#x27;t know His word. God wants us to set our minds on spiritual things. Therefore, our reasoning must change.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s my year of Perfection and I&#x27;m going to display the virtues and perfections of Him who called me out of darkness into His marvelous light.</p>
<p>Anger, rage, lying aren&#x27;t the virtues of God. God thinks high, novel thoughts and what&#x27;s you to display His virtues.</p>
<p>Measure your perfections from God&#x27;s viewpoint. That means you should set your goals higher. Don&#x27;t allow negative thoughts come to your mind. Refuse to allow or accommodate them. You&#x27;re born and full of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Where am I now? In God&#x27;s marvelous light; a light that no one can approach unto. No wonder the Bible says that in Him there&#x27;s no darkness at all. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the life that God&#x27;s expecting you to live in 2020. This is the picture. No darkness at all in your life; no feeling sorry for yourself; no disliking anyone. This is your calling. As long as you live less than this, you&#x27;re not living the life. This is the Christian Life.</p>
<p>Children when they are learning to walk, they start with crawling and after a while start working properly. Some Christians however are still crawling when they should be walking.</p>
<p>This year, you&#x27;ve got to keep your sight on the word and walk in perfection.</p>
<p>The Bible says to &quot;...take heed to the word&quot;, to look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who&#x27;s able to keep us from falling.</p>
<p>God&#x27;s instructions reveal to you what He thinks about your ability. When God said to Abraham to walk before Him and be perfect, it shows He knows Abraham had the ability.</p>
<p>As the word comes to you, your mind is renewed. God&#x27;s word is light and lights every heart. You walk in the light by walking in the word; walking in the light of His justification.</p>
<p>Jesus said, you err because you know not the scriptures. Foundation School is meant to tell you the basics of the word; to build your grounds in the word.</p>
<p>My life in 2020 is to display the virtues and perfections of God!</p>
<p>MESSAGE OF THE DAY👇🏻</p>
<p>Ezra 6:14
And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.</p>
<p>Notice that the people prospered through the ministry of the men of God. This tells us the place of the word of God. That&#x27;s why you should take out time every week to be in church on service days because as you do your business, you need to be hearing the word to guide and encourage you. This helps to build you</p>

<p>SUNDAY, 19TH JANUARY</p>
<p>What great grace that Jesus brought to us. Phantomless as the sea, flowing for eternity. You can spend it all. And it&#x27;s enough for me.</p>
<p>The word of God thrust us into an extraordinary place of glory. Until you see it, you can&#x27;t live it. You&#x27;ve got to know it. This is my Year of Perfection!</p>
<p>The Four(4) Aspects of Perfect:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alignment</li>
<li>Completeness</li>
<li>Excellence</li>
<li>Fruition</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;And they (the Angels) were dancing and rejoicing (like kids) because they see the glory of God being manifested.&quot;</p>
<p>If you really want to know about our salvation, you&#x27;ve got to study the book of Romans.</p>
<p>Romans 6:1-4</p>
<p>The reward system is the problem. People in school today are studying to pass and not for life. School is meant to prepare you for life and not about just passing exams.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not enough to quote the dictionary definitions of grace, salvation, redemption and justification. You&#x27;ve got to know what the Bible says about them. Salvation has to be understood in the context.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a reason for the structures you have in school. It&#x27;s not enough to read it by yourself; there&#x27;s an aspect of relationship with others in a class. People who didn&#x27;t really go to school to mix with others in a school community have a very different behaviour in life. There&#x27;s a kind of education you get when you relate with others in the school community. In the same way, coming to church has a unique impact. That&#x27;s why studying the Bible at home isn&#x27;t enough.</p>
<p>&quot;Newness of life&quot; as used in verse 4 means - in this new state of life. When you&#x27;re born again, your life is different from before; you&#x27;ve a new quality of life.</p>
<p>If you live with your mind, you&#x27;ll never get it. That&#x27;s why the scriptures was given to us. You&#x27;ve got to use your spirit - divine wisdom &amp; spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>When Jesus was on the cross, I was on the cross. That&#x27;s what God sees - everybody was on the cross. Because Jesus was on the cross, representing God to us and man to God. When He died, man died. Remember the Bible says that Adam&#x27;s sin was reckoned unto all. Now one man comes up and all the guilt/sins of the world was put on Him. Jesus came out of the grave with the new kind of life.</p>
<p>Verses 5 - 20</p>
<p>You can do it except you&#x27;re born again. Without the Holy Spirit you can&#x27;t live the Christian Life.</p>
<p>&quot;Christ&quot; as used in verse 9 is talking about Jesus and the Church. Anytime you see Christ used alone in the New Testament, it&#x27;s talking about the head and the body. If death had no more dominion over the head, then it doesn&#x27;t over the body.</p>
<p>&quot;Reckon&quot; in verse 11 means to record/number/think (ref. Mark 15:28) - for us to think like this; that we are dead to sin. God thinks that you were dead &amp; raised with Christ; that&#x27;s how He sees you.</p>
<p>Oh, I&#x27;m alive to God!!!</p>
<p>Verse 12 was talking to babes in the scriptures. Don&#x27;t let your bodies be used as instruments of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>The members of my body are not instruments of unrighteousness! I&#x27;m alive from the dead!</p>
<p>In life, for a lot of people, they get too much deaths in a lot of things but this is why we have the gospel - to bring life to them.</p>
<p>Verse 14 (ref. Verse 9)</p>
<p>Verse 15 - grace brings us into the righteousness of Christ. Verse 18 tells that we were set free from sin and became servants of righteousness. But Paul in verse 19 informed that this wasn&#x27;t the real intention of his communication because of lack of words to communicate.</p>
<p>Verse 20 - &quot;free from righteousness&quot; actually means righteousness free...</p>

<p>This is the year of perfection. It&#x27;s about what God is doing in your life. Starting the year in the right way is very important. You can determine how the year will wind up. You can determine that Gods glory will be far greater by the end of the year. It&#x27;s your choice. The perfection of God will be wrought in my life.</p>
<p>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light;  (1 Peter 2:9 KJV).</p>
<p>He&#x27;s not talking everybody. He&#x27;s talking to those who have been born again, brought out of darkness into His marvelous light. Into Gods system. You have been baptized into a new environment.</p>
<p>Our biological parents are fathers of our flesh. It&#x27;s our spirit that&#x27;s born again. We are the church of Jesus Christ, one with the saints of God.</p>
<p>Yes are... He wants us to know who we are. It&#x27;s Gods mirror. You can&#x27;t discover these things with your senses.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re a chosen breed, Royal priests, King priests, a kingdom of priests, every priest is royalty. A holy nation, a peculiar people. That you should shew forth, display, to consciously display. Display those things that cause angels to sing His praise.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s see it in the amplified version.</p>
<p>Dedicated to God, you&#x27;re Gods property. Gods own purchased special people, that you may show, and display and praises...</p>
<p>Set forth - display the wonderful deeds... You&#x27;re doing Gods wonderful deeds, you do what you see your father does through the word. Be imitators of God. You can know through the spirit. Children copy their parents. We&#x27;re spiritually minded. Set your mind on who you are. Our reasoning must change...</p>
<p>Display the praises of Him.... The virtues and perfections of God. We are to display it. It&#x27;s our year of perfection. I&#x27;m going to display the virtues and perfections of God.</p>
<p>Hatred, bitterness, rage, anger, lying, are not virtues of God.</p>
<p>Virtues are excellencies. God thinks high, noble thoughts. That&#x27;s our lives. Copy God. I will display perfections in my life.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t allow negative and worldly thoughts to come to my mind. I&#x27;m to display His virtues and perfections, God&#x27;s overpowering light. No one can approach it. In God, there&#x27;s no darkness at all. Glory to Jesus, hallelujah. Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the life God expects you to live in 2020. No darkness in your life or in your heart at all. No feeling sorry. What a life. This is your calling. Otherwise, you&#x27;re not living like a Christian. A baby cribs, but, like a human being, he will grow and walk like a human being. That&#x27;s how some Christians grow... This year is your year of perfection. Set your eyes on the word. He&#x27;s able to keep you from falling.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the way my mind works. I&#x27;m not aware that I may fall. I take heed to the word. He&#x27;s able to keep me from falling. He&#x27;s the perfecter and finisher of my faith, He&#x27;s able to keep me from falling. Gods instructions reveals to me what He thinks about my abilities. Walk before me and be thou perfect...</p>
<p>I love it. What the word does to us. The word is cleansing me. It&#x27;s a cleanser. If we walk in the light as He is in the light, all these things are justified. I walk in the light of His justification, perfections, redemption...</p>
<p>Go through the Foundation School. MBTC takes care of that. There&#x27;s more. These things will help you in your life. These things are about life and the challenges of life. You err because you know not the scriptures. Foundation School sets you up.</p>

<p>And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes</p>

<p>&quot;…Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his&quot;  (Romans 8:9).</p>
<p>As Christians, we have the Spirit of Christ. It’s so important for us to be conscious of that reality. The word ‘Christian’ means Christ-like; in other words, we’re like  Christ. We’re to live, love, talk and conduct all our affairs in life like Him. Some Christians know how to be nice only when they’re in church. The real question is, who are you when you’re out of church? When at home, in the office, school, market-place and on
the street, do you suddenly forget your identity as a Christian and begin to act and talk like the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Your Christianity must not be restricted to the Church building. You’ve been called to make a difference; God has placed you as an example and a shining light in this world, never forget that. When you open your mouth to speak, people should experience the love of God through your words. Your words should minister grace to the hearers always, for you have the Spirit of Christ.</p>
<p>Some people are quick to blow their top and become easily infuriated when others offend them, but when you’re conscious of your identity as a Christian, you would learn to subdue your anger always. You would learn to love and appreciate others even when they hurt or mistreat you. That’s the way of Christ; that’s the life of a Christian!</p>

<p>YOU ARE SIN-FREE</p>
<p>In line with understanding the message of the Year of PERFECTION, you must understand and put these 4 factors into consideration, in perfecting your life.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ALIGNMENT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COMPLETNESS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EXCELLENCE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FRUITION</p>

<p>Romans 6:1, 16,  OUR SALVATION. It is important to study the WORD of God between the lines so that you will understand what the WORD of God says about the main subject matter. When you are meant to define salvation, you have to define it in its context. That is why it&#x27;s important to attend foundation school. In Christianity you don&#x27;t understand with your mind but you understand with your Spirit. Christianity is a Spiritual life. Without the Holy Spirit we can&#x27;t live a Christian life. As Jesus came out of grave with a new kind of life, we also came out with Him. Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more. Death has no more dominion over Him , if death has no more dominion Him, therefore it has no dominion over every other part of the body</p>
<p>Mark 15:28 Jesus was numbered with the transgressors. Therefore reckon, consider, reason, likewise think like this that you are same with Jesus . Think like God. God think you are dead to sin and alive unto God. So think the same way.</p>
<p>Romans 6:1 KJV: What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? (2) God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?There&#x27;s so much in this verses alone. He asked the question above because he explained the power of grace over works.</p>
<p>Some people study to pass exams in school and that is not enough. It&#x27;s the same with Christianity, you need to really know it. For example, what is salvation? What is redemption? What is the doctrine of baptism?</p>
<p>These things are vital. There are structures put in school to help you grow up fine. Those who didn&#x27;t really go to school have a way they think. This is the same reason we must go to church. These structures are very vital.</p>
<p>3 KJV: Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</p>
<p>4KJV<!-- -->:Therefore<!-- --> we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>
<p>Whenever you see the Word: <em>&#x27;Christ&#x27;</em> used as it is above, it refers to Jesus and his body (the church)</p>
<p>The Word newness of life means a new state of life. When you got born again, you received a new kind of life and we must walk in it.</p>
<p>When Jesus was on that cross, in the mind of God, we were on that cross. Man was on that cross.
9 KJV<!-- -->:Knowing<!-- --> that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. (10) <!-- -->:For<!-- --> in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 11 KJV: Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>Reckon: account, add, log, think.</p>
<p>Mark 15:28</p>
<p>12K JV<!-- -->:Let<!-- --> not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof 13KJV<!-- -->:Neither<!-- --> yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let the members of your body be used as instruments of unrighteousness. Say &#x27;I am alive from the dead.&#x27;</p>
<p>Say &#x27;the members of my body, the parts of my body are instruments of righteousness unto God.</p>
<p>Verse 18. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servant of righteousness. Hallelujah 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌</p>

<p>Prayer</p>
<p>Song.... How marvelous, how wonderful</p>
<p>Thank Lord, there&#x27;s none like you... Thank you for the Holy Spirit that lives in us...</p>
<p>Glory hallelujah...</p>
<p>Praise God...</p>
<p>We just take off... Last Sunday, we got to Romans 6. Do you remember... And we had to emphasize certain particular areas and I explain why it&#x27;s important. Your knowledge of them will determine the kind of life you live and your mentality, perspective of the gospel. Because many are unacquainted with the truth, they have a Christianity far from what Jesus came to give us. For example, when we got to verses 18-20, I explain the homiletics...</p>
<p>I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. (Romans 6:19 KJV).</p>
<p>When you see the word.... It refers to the senses and frailties of the human to appetites and passions... How the subject their senses to the ungoverned appetites and passions...</p>
<p>For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.  (Romans 6:20 KJV).</p>
<p>He had to use that to help them understand because of the limitations of language.</p>
<p>The verb and the noun of &quot;utirios&quot;...</p>
<p>As a noun... The righteousness can be a noun or adjective. Alcohol free....</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a noun here.... Righteousness free... English can&#x27;t give it to you in one word. Understand it so that your Christianity won&#x27;t be up and down...</p>
<p>The children of the spirit and of the flesh....</p>
<p>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.  (Galatians 4:22 KJV).</p>
<p>It is a noun here. It&#x27;s not freed.... I freed him is a verb. He&#x27;s been made free can also be a verb or you can separate them &quot;the made from free&quot; meaning that he&#x27;s been made a free man...</p>
<p>Paul is apologizing for using the idea that we have been made or set free.... Their reasoning couldn&#x27;t comprehend what Paul tried to communicate.</p>
<p>In Acts 22, Paul wanted to defend himself...</p>
<p>And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air, The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him (Acts 22:23 - 22:24 KJV).</p>
<p>They were going to whip him... This is bad...</p>
<p>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?  (Acts 22:25 KJV).</p>
<p>When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman. Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea. And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born (Acts 22:26 - 22:28 KJV).</p>
<p>He paid a lot to become a Roman. Paul said I was free born! Did you get it!</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what I want you to get. The word free wasn&#x27;t in the original Greek. He said, I was born. The translators put it for clarity. I was born that way, I was born a citizen. There&#x27;s a great difference between them. In the USA only born citizens can become presidents. You get it...</p>
<p>We&#x27;re born that way, not set free. We&#x27;re not made or set free.... Except Christians are taught, they&#x27;ll not know....</p>
<p>Being made sin-free is what he&#x27;s teaching us because of the implications.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got to understand the message... The language matters.... The illustration may affect how you translate it.</p>
<p>As he spake these words, many believed on him. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free (John 8:30 - 8:32 KJV)</p>
<p>The truth shall free you...</p>
<p>They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? (John 8:33 KJV)</p>
<p>The writer separates the two words in the response...</p>
<p>They knew they were Abrah</p>

<p>&quot;He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already,  because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God&quot; (John 3:18).</p>
<p>The devil doesn’t have any regard whatsoever for your financial status. He afflicts both the rich and poor with all kinds of sickness. He doesn’t look at your academic qualification nor does he consider your family background. The Bible calls him the thief that comes to steal, kill and destroy. That’s all he knows to do! Unfortunately, many are  still oblivious to his activities, thinking everything in this world happens by chance. They  say they don’t believe in God or the devil. You see, life is spiritual and there’s no middle ground; you’re either walking in the blessing or in the curse.</p>
<p>The Bible says the fool has said in his heart that there’s no God (Psalm 14:1). So you  see, it’s only fools who think there’s no God. “I don’t believe these miracle preachers”   they retort, but their shelves are full of all kinds of drugs and they’re criss-crossing the    globe for medical checkups! I feel sorry for such folks who think we’re stupid for believing in miracles.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that “…the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither  yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of  skill…” (Ecclesiastes 9:11). It’s simply by the grace of God. There are people who were  the best in their class back in school but can’t even keep a job today. Many are unwittingly
walking under the curse and that’s why the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is absolutely indispensable in our world today. This message we preach will catapult anyone who believes it unto a glorious life. You either believe it or you don’t; there’s no middle ground.</p>

<p>(Don’t Faint In The Day Of Trouble!)</p>
<p>“If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small.” - Proverbs 24:10 AMPC</p>
<p>Christianity is a bed of roses, with tests, trials and challenging times in the journey of faith. Such challenging times are what the Bible refers to as “the evil day” (Ephesians 6:13), or “the day of adversity” as read in our opening verse. Some believers dread such periods and specifically pray to God never to allow them go through trials and challenges. To avoid situations that challenge your faith is to checkmate your chances of promotion.</p>
<p>James 1:2 says, “My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials.” Why would God admonish you to rejoice when tests and challenges come at you on all sides? It’s because He knows that victory is in your spirit. Having been born again, you’ve become an overcomer and more than a conqueror. Consequently, no situation that you face should overwhelm you.</p>
<p>God knows what stuff you’re made of, that’s why He said, “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it” (1 Corinthians 10:13). You have what it takes to overcome any trial, temptation or adversity. So you must not cower, give in or faint under any pressure whatsoever. Be tough because Jesus was tough.</p>
<p>There’re things that make you tough as a Christian, and if you don’t welcome them, you’d remain at the same level of faith and maturity. This means, your adversaries are important in the toughening process, so don’t pray against them, no matter what troubles or difficulties they bring your way. Welcome them as necessary challenges to strengthen your faith-muscles and you’ll discover they’re the agents for your promotion.</p>
<p>PRAYER: Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for helping me see through your Word how the challenges that come my way strengthen my faith and result in my promotion, as I handle them with the right attitude. I’m fully convinced of my eternal victory over satan, the world and every adversity that may come my way, therefore, I rejoice, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Praying is such an important part of our lives as Christians. First of all, we must recognize prayer as a privilege as well as an honour. Every moment of prayer is an investment in eternity and true prayer is a romance of righteousness. Our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Through prayer we participate in the communion of the God-kind; it&#x27;s a throne-room caucus rendezvous: Jesus made it so! Oh, that the eyes of our understanding may be enlightened to see this awesome truth and that we may walk in the light of it! What a time of rich communion with the Lord prayer provides us Scripture enjoins us to pray without ceasing (1 Thessalonians 5:17). Prayer helps to season our spirits as a dependable receptacle for God&#x27;s Spirit and power. Then we can connect to His ideas, visions and leadings more easily in order to change the world.</p>
<p>When we pray, we make tremendous power available, dynamic in its working, causing changes in our favour. Certain prayer sessions are specially designed by the Lord to help straighten out things in the spirit-realm regarding our immediate or later future as individuals, families or ministries. How wonderful that we can change circumstances and alter destinies in His Name through prayer!</p>
<p>We serve a kind, loving, great and gracious God who daily loads us with benefits (Psalms 68:19). During times of prayer, we can meditate on His goodness and appropriate these benefits to our life&#x27;s circumstances.</p>
<p>Begin to make declarations concerning your circumstances to God in prayer now.</p>
<p>God bless you and grant you your heart desires in Jesus Name. Amen</p>

<p>..</p>
<p>(Use The Name Of Jesus)</p>
<p>“Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in my name, I will do it.” John 14:13-14 RSV</p>
<p>Some people read this scripture and think Jesus was referring to prayer, but He wasn’t. Let’s look at it again: “Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in my name, I will do it” (John 14:13-14 RSV). This isn’t prayer, because the original Greek word translated “ask” here means “demand”. This scripture refers to making a demand in the Name of Jesus, and is quite different from John 16:23,where He meant praying to the Father in His Name.</p>
<p>In John 14:13-14, the Lord is saying that if you demand anything to happen in His Name, He’ll make it happen! An example of this is shown in Acts 3. Peter didn’t pray for the cripple at the gate called Beautiful: he made a demand in the Name of Jesus when he said, “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk” (Acts 3:6). That Name is for you to use today!</p>
<p>You can have miracles happen anytime and anywhere just as Peter did. A miracle simply means God intervening in the natural course of events, and He produces them through you. You can’t be bound by anything in life! You can always cause a change in any unfavourable circumstance using the Name of Jesus, and it will turn around to your benefit. Glory to God!</p>
<p>PRAYER:
Thank you Father for giving me the right to make demands in the Name of Jesus. Through His Name, miracles happen in my life and circumstances are turned about in my favour. Amen.</p>

<p>For I never shrank or kept back or fell short from declaring to you the whole purpose and plan and counsel of God (Acts 20:27 AMPC).</p>
<p>In 1 Samuel 8, we read about the children of Israel asking Samuel to appoint a king to lead them like other nations. The prophet, obviously displeased at their request, took it before the Lord. Then the Lord said to Samuel, “…Hearken unto their voice and appoint them a king…” (1 Samuel 8:22 AMPC).</p>
<p>Even though the prophet Samuel wasn’t comfortable with their request, he told the children of Israel exactly what the Lord had said, not his own opinion. Thereafter, the Lord appointed Saul to be king over Israel. Samuel knew it was the Lord who called the shots; so he quickly executed the Lord’s directives in appointing Saul to be king (1 Samuel 10:1).</p>
<p>That’s the right attitude for every true messenger of Christ; you follow the Lord and His Word, not your emotions or opinions. As long as God has given the Word, you ought to say, “Yes Sir,” because He’s the Boss. It’s not about you, it’s about Him; you voice His will, plans and purpose, not yours or anyone else’s.</p>
<p>Irrespective of your opinions, the Word of God is forever true! So, if the Word says it, you’re going to have to do it, even if it doesn’t align with your culture. We’re God’s messengers; we preach for God, not for ourselves.</p>
<p>1 Peter 4:11 (NKJV) says, “If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.” Consciously train yourself to think like Him. Train yourself to speak His Word, not your ideas. Glory to God!</p>
<p>CONFESSION:
The Word of God is in my heart and in my mouth, and I speak it with boldness as I’m inspired by the Spirit, conveying God’s ideas, thoughts, plans, and purposes. His perfect will is established in my life and in the lives of my hearers because of the influence and power of His Word, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Listen to what I am saying; pay attention to what I am telling you (Isaiah 28:23 GNB).</p>
<p>Some people don’t pay attention to the different activities of the Spirit that happen during the service when they’re in Church. They get carried away such that even though the presence and power of God could be so strong in that environment, their lives are not improved, because they’re distracted.</p>
<p>Your individual attention is so vital each time you’re in the presence of the Lord in the Church, and even during your personal devotions. God always has something special for you, a word for you that’ll increase your glory, but you’ve got to pay the right currency—your attention. When you give Him your attention, you get everything He has for you.</p>
<p>God’s Word is God’s answer, and with your attention, you allow its free entrance into your spirit, until it changes your frame of mind, your way of thinking, and influences your words and delivers your inheritance to you. So, in praying to, and worshipping the Lord, always let it be from your spirit, with focus and attention. That way, the Spirit will minister to you, even as you minister to Him.</p>
<p>Give the Lord your attention; give Him your heart; give Him your mind. Let Him minister to you, and through you. Hebrews 10:22 says, “Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith….” This doesn’t mean to “come close” to God, because you’re already in Him, and He in you. Rather, it refers to turning your attention to Him, making Him your focus. It’s a terminology that refers to a consciousness of your spirit, because we can’t draw any nearer to Him than we already did; we’re one with Him.</p>
<p>Howbeit, our hearts can be far away. That’s why the Bible says, “draw near with a true heart.” So, every opportunity you have to fellowship with the Lord, give Him your full attention, and open your heart to receive all He has for you.</p>

<p>Often times you hear people say that they aren&#x27;t perfect. They share the idea that perfection is impossible. The scriptures however tells us that perfection is God&#x27;s plan for us. To think otherwise is to say God&#x27;s not true.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &quot;be ye perfect...&quot;. There are several persons in the Bible that were recorded as being perfect. For us to apologise about our perfection is to accuse God of a lie.</p>
<p>Our perfection isn&#x27;t measured by man&#x27;s standards. When Jesus walked the earth, they didn&#x27;t think He was perfect. They accused Him of not conforming to the known standards.</p>
<p>Jesus was the manifestation of truth - the word &amp; will of God manifested to us. Everything about Him; God&#x27;s will isn&#x27;t an act or a thought; God&#x27;s love/word isn&#x27;t an act; God&#x27;s word/will and love is a man - Jesus manifested to us.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &quot;God is love&quot;. Jesus is love. Jesus is God&#x27;s love in manifestation. So when you saw/heard Jesus, you saw and heard love. Jesus was the expression of the Father&#x27;s person. You are the expression of Jesus (the Father&#x27;s person). It is called the word of God.</p>
<p>Think on this - Jesus (who is God) was born a baby like every other and had to grow the normal way; requiring aid through infancy and childhood.</p>
<p>When you were born again, you were born a Spiritual baby. It doesn&#x27;t matter your age when you were born again.</p>
<p>The Bible says in 1 Peter 2:2 &quot;As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:&quot;</p>
<p>Jesus was subject to His parents. So don&#x27;t think on your mistakes. I&#x27;m perfect!</p>
<p>Only if you&#x27;re perfect will you be able to do perfect things. Like righteousness, it is a result of righteousness in nature (righteousness of God).</p>
<p>If you walk in the Spirit, you won&#x27;t do fleshly things but if you walk in the flesh, you can&#x27;t do Spiritual things.</p>
<p>Consistency in walking with God is the most natural thing for a Christian who has the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>MESSAGE FOR THE MONTH</p>
<p>Right in God&#x27;s will (in the centre of His plans) is the best place to be.</p>

<p>Psalm 67:1-7
&quot;God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah. That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.

Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee. Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us. God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.&quot;</p>
<p>FEBRUARY IS THE MONTH OF SONGS!</p>

<p>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him (2 Kings 3:15).</p>
<p>It’s so important to worship the Lord. Through worship, you set up an atmosphere for miracles in and around you, and create the right environment for the Spirit of God to operate. It may be with a song or a scripture; as you sing or declare it in worship, the presence of God can literally overwhelm your situation, resulting in a miracle. It’s one of the several reasons we make music unto the Lord.</p>
<p>The right spiritual song of worship can position you to hear from God. Once, Elisha was with three kings who came to him for counsel. But because he was offended at one of them, the king of Israel, and had responded to the king in anger, he couldn’t minister under the anointing (2 Kings 3:13-14). The kings wanted to receive the Word of God from him, but he couldn’t readily prophesy. So, what did he do? He said, “Bring me a musician.” The Bible says when the minstrel—the musician—played, the Spirit of the Lord came on Elisha, and he began to prophesy (2 Kings 3:15).</p>
<p>If you’ve been a Christian for so long, and you’ve never heard the Lord talk to you, this might be the missing link. You have a role to play. You need to position yourself to hear Him. You need to be free in His presence, not rigid, languid, dull or uninspiring; worship Him from your spirit, with the right songs, and before long, your spirit will make that divine contact with Him, and you can hear as He ministers to you. He’s a master communicator; He ministers to you even as you’re ministering to Him.</p>
<p>It’s not about singing “your best” song; it’s about singing the “right songs” for the move of the Spirit. There’s a time for your best song or your own song, but there’s also a time for the right song. So, in worshipping Him, you have to sing the right songs; songs that are inspired by the Word, not just any song. It’ll tune your spirit correctly and you’ll hear the voice of the Lord.</p>

<p>Never lag in zeal and in earnest endeavor; be aglow and burning with the Spirit, serving the Lord (Romans 12:11 AMP).</p>
<p>Part of the reason young people can be very successful, where older people fail, is that many young people don’t know enough to be afraid. Most older people know too much; they have too much information about what doesn’t work. They remember when they tried out something and it failed, and so they became cynical. It’s a lot harder to inspire such people to make a fresh move or have a fresh start.</p>
<p>Understand that being old in this context isn’t so much about a person’s age, but about the state of his mind. Your body might age, but refuse to age in your mind. Think fresh; think success. God loves to use young people, because they think fresh all the time; they easily believe, and are always passionate about learning something new.</p>
<p>It’s never too late to learn and be inspired by a dream of success. Even if you’re already grey-headed and advanced in years, God can still use you. Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died, and at that age, he was still strong and vibrant. The Bible says, “...His eyesight was sharp; he still walked with a spring in his step” (Deuteronomy 34:7 MSG).</p>
<p>What will you be like when you’re ninety-two? I can tell, if you put this message to work: You won’t be crying that nothing works. Instead, you’ll be the one teaching and imparting faith to the younger generation. You’ll be changing lives with the Gospel, speaking in tongues, prophesying, and speaking words of faith by the power of the Holy Spirit!.</p>

<p>(God Loves You SO Much!)</p>
<p>“God loved the people of this world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who has faith in him will have eternal life and never really die.” -  JOHN 3:16 CEV</p>
<p>John 3:16 is probably the most popular Bible verse in the world, but many haven’t understood the power of that verse. What world did God love? Was it the hills and the mountains? It was none of these. He loved the world of human beings, as sinful and wicked as they were! It should amaze you that when Adam sinned back in the Garden, it was still God who came looking for him (Genesis 3). Adam was hiding from God, because he had sinned, yet God still covered his nakedness with animal skin, showing that he loved him.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins” (1 John 4:10). So clearly, God demonstrated His great and boundless love for us, while we were yet in sin. You may be reading this today and you’re wondering, “Can God possibly love someone like me?” Emphatically yes! No matter what kind of life you may have lived, He wants you today. Now that you know how much God loved the world of sinners, think about how much more He loves those who are born of Him! The Bible says “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much “more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life” (Romans 5:10). If He loved the world of wicked men, He loves His kids even more.</p>
<p>He does all the wonderful things He does for us not because of our good deeds, but because of how much He loves us! He didn’t even wait for you to pray to Him and ask for your sins to be forgiven before He sent Jesus Christ to die for you. That’s how much He loves you!</p>
<p>PRAYER: Thank you heavenly Father for your great love for me; my heart is established and rooted in your love, which indeed is higher than the mountains and deeper than the oceans! I’m so glad that you sent Jesus to die for me as a demonstration of your love for me. I rejoice in your love today, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>…Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s (2 Chronicles 20:15).</p>
<p>In 2 Chronicles 20, we read something inspiring that King Jehoshaphat did when Judah was besieged by enemy nations. He and the armies of Judah were completely out-numbered, and in his own words, he admitted Judah’s vulnerability, but not without seeking help from the Lord. He prayed, “O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee” (2 Chronicles 20:12).</p>
<p>Then, verses 14-17 tells us something beautiful; it says, “Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah…came the Spirit of the Lord…And he said, …Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. Tomorrow go ye down against them….Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them: for the Lord will be with you.”</p>
<p>Those were the Lord’s comforting and assuring words to Jehoshaphat. But notice the next thing Jehoshaphat did, in readiness to confront the invading army: he appointed singers unto the Lord, to praise the beauty of Holiness, chanting, “…Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever” (2 Chronicles 20:21). This was a song of victory.</p>
<p>As they went on singing and marching towards the enemy’s camp, the Bible declares that “…the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten” (2 Chronicles 20:22). When Judah’s army came in from behind the singers, their entire assailants had perished, having destroyed one another. Jehoshaphat, with his army, simply took the spoil without a fight! This was an unusual strategy, and it’s for our learning.</p>
<p>Our songs of worship and praise, in the face of daunting circumstances, spell defeat for the adversary. It doesn’t matter how severe you think the challenge is; praise and worship the Lord from His Word of victory. Regardless of the might of the adversary and adversities, never give up! Sing songs of victory. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love (1 John 4:7-8).</p>
<p>Love is the totality of God’s nature. This is beyond someone having love in his heart or the ability to love; it means that He’s love personified. God is love! And because He’s love, He doesn’t have the capacity to hate; it’s not possible for God to hate. Hate is of the darkness. God is light, and in Him, there’s no darkness at all (1 John 1:5). The Bible says, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning” (James 1:17).</p>
<p>Someone may reference Romans 9:13 and ask, But didn’t God say, “…Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated?” (Read Malachi 1:2-3). This is where understanding the place of poetry and prophecy, and the dichotomy of expression in the Scriptures come in. The language of the Prophets in the Old Testament shouldn’t always be interpreted at face value; you’d have to look through the words of other Prophets to interpret them. You’d also have to judge their communication in line with the revelation of God that we see in the New Testament, in the person of Jesus.</p>
<p>God is love. When the Holy Spirit reveals God to you and you get to know Him, His love will dominate you. This is because the more you love Him, the more like Him you become. As you meditate on His love for you, you’ll find yourself demonstrating that same love in your life.</p>
<p>You’re a product of love. Let the love of God in your spirit dominate you. It’s something you do. The Bible says for us not to love only in words, but in deeds as well (1 John 3:18). Be like God whose essence is love, because as He is, so are you in this world.</p>
<p>Have you received the love Jesus showed you by giving His life for yours? If no, You can do so right away by praying this prayer:
“O Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ,Son of the living God. I believe He died for me and God raised Him from the dead. I believe He’s alive today. I confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day.Through Him and in His Name, I have eternal life; I’m born again.Thank you Lord, for saving my soul!
I’m now a child of God. I now have Christ dwelling in me and greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4)! I now walk in the consciousness of my new life in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!&quot;
&quot;CONGRATULATIONS&quot;, you are now born into the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>PRAYER:
The love of God is expressed through me today; my communication, actions, and all that emanate from me are expressions of the love-nature of Christ that’s in my spirit. I’m the embodiment and expression of the love of Christ. Hallelujah!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="laughter--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1596">Laughter ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome~1596<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Laughter ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome~1596" title="Direct link to Laughter ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome~1596" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#laughter--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1596">​</a></h2>
<p>There’s a popular saying that “Laughter  is the best medicine.” It’s a manifestation  of joy; an expression of mirth. It’s making  sounds and movements with the face  and body that show joy, amusement and  contentment.</p>
<p>Laughter causes the release of endorphins, which are the human body’s natural pain relief hormones. It relieves tension, anxiety, shame and guilt, and helps one maintain a  positive attitude even in negative situations. Moreover, it is able to raise energy levels, thereby completely getting rid of depression. It helps reduce stress that comes in the course of your daily activities. It also improves your emotional and mental health, and ultimately  creates a sense of well-being within you.</p>
<p>People laugh for various reasons, but the  Word of God gives us insight into the  spiritual benefits of laughter. Proverbs  17:22 says, “A merry heart doeth good like  a medicine….” In other words, wonderful  healing power is unleashed every time you  laugh! Although laughter is a psychological  response to humour, it doesn’t always have  to be initiated by an external influence or  condition. It can spring up from inside you  and burst forth on the outside.
Hallelujah</p>

<p>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law (Romans 13:10)</p>
<p>Everyone deserves and qualifies to be loved, including those you may perceive to be “your enemies.” Jesus said, “But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you” (Matthew 5:44). You don’t only love those who love you; you love everyone with the unconditional love of Christ.</p>
<p>All people are the same when it comes to love. Everyone has the capacity to give and receive love. Everyone wants to be loved, though not everyone wants to give it or respond to it. Love is the greatest power in the universe. It goes beyond cultural divides, religious barriers, ethnic differences, and social stratifications.</p>
<p>Train yourself to walk in love. It’s a conscious choice you have to make; it’ll transform your life. In John 13:34, Jesus said, “A new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.” Tell yourself, “I’m going to walk in love, no matter what. I’m going to love others genuinely, even when their actions aren’t deserving of love.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that God demonstrated His love for us, while we were undeserving of kindness: “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). We’re therefore to love like Him, as His beloved children: “Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour” (Ephesians 5:1-2).</p>
<p>To walk with God is to walk in love. 1 John 4:7-8 says, “Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.” Let your life be the out-shining of His love.</p>
<p>CONFESSION:
My life is the expression of the love of the Father. I abound in love today, towards those in my world, and beyond, and declare that my heart is established, blameless and in holiness before the Lord, for His love is perfected in me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men (Titus 3:8 ).</p>
<p>The Christian walk is that of continual affirmation of the Word. Jesus said, “For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak” (John 12:49). Thus, what you re-echo must be the Father’s words. The Father’s words are words of the Kingdom; words of life.</p>
<p>When we say we have the God-life in us, or talk about being born again, or the new creation life, these aren’t religious clichés derived from philosophy. These are expressions of the Word. In Christianity, we affirm the Word; we confess the Word. Whatever we say or speak should, and must always, be in conformity with the Word of God.</p>
<p>Constantly affirm that you’re a new creation in Christ Jesus, infused with the life of God, not vulnerable to the crippling influences of this world! Affirm that the life of God is at work in your spirit, soul, and body.

<p>Never say, “I’m sick,” or “I have a headache,” because sickness doesn’t belong in the Kingdom of God; it never comes from the Father. So, don’t affirm it. Don’t affirm poverty, weakness, lack, or fear. Declare that you’re bold, strong, and courageous.</p>

<p>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed (Acts 16:25-26).</p>
<p>Acts 16 chronicles how songs of praise from Paul and Silas resulted in a divinely orchestrated earthquake that saw to their release from an obnoxious incarceration. When you praise the Lord from your heart in the beauty of holiness, the result is a divine explosion of glory. Praise and worship the Lord in the face of daunting challenges, and His glory will be manifested in your behalf.</p>
<p>If you desire a miracle today, whether it’s in your job or finances or even trouble at work; or perhaps it has to do with your health or that of a loved one; whatever it is, as an act of faith, set this matter before you, and begin to sing songs of praise in the spirit and also in your understanding again and again, as the spirit gives you utterance. By this act of faith, you’re invoking the power of the mighty God—the most High God—over the matter before you.</p>
<p>You don’t have to say much. Don’t talk about the thing that’s been bothering you; keep your focus on the Lord, as you sing and dance to the Lord, chanting verses of praise to extol His majesty, the power of God will surge through your being. Don’t stop at this time; as the inspiration increases, speak in tongues again and again, until you have a note of victory.</p>
<p>No matter what the case is, such worship will be followed by the miraculous. Rather than feel downcast, helpless or overwhelmed when you face challenges, employ the worship and praise strategy; the power of God’s Spirit will be stirred, and you’ll have a testimony.</p>

<p>But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit (Jude 1:20 AMP).</p>
<p>Progress means advancement; moving forward. Progress must be measurable, otherwise, it’s not progress. You must have goals; if you don’t have definite goals, you may not be able to really measure your progress.</p>
<p>In making progress there’re certain things you must consider. First, locate your present position in that area of your life in which you desire to make progress. Is it in your health, finances, job, business, or your family? Whatever it is, locate your present position. Secondly, envision what the next level will be for you.</p>
<p>Thirdly, determine what you must do to get to your next level. That means your input in terms of effort, time, and resources. Resources could refer to money, materials, information, etc. Fourthly and finally, take action; do what you need to do to get you the results you want. Otherwise, your visions, goals and aspirations will fail and come to nothing.</p>
<p>I’m sure you already have clear-cut goals for the year; stay focused on your goals. Every now and then, pray in the Holy Ghost about your goals; this is so important, because it’ll guarantee your progress in achieving them. Our opening verse says, “But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>This year, you’re going to make progress, and move forward in your life like never before, irrespective of what’s been happening with you or around you. It’s your time and season of advancement. And it’s my prayer that the Spirit of God will inspire and guide you to take the necessary actions that’ll cause you to have evident and unprecedented growth, increase, and prosperity in 2020, and beyond, in Jesus’ Name.</p>

<p>This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men (Titus 3:8 ).</p>
<p>The Christian walk is that of continual affirmation of the Word. Jesus said, “For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak” (John 12:49). Thus, what you re-echo must be the Father’s words. The Father’s words are words of the Kingdom; words of life.</p>
<p>When we say we have the God-life in us, or talk about being born again, or the new creation life, these aren’t religious clichés derived from philosophy. These are expressions of the Word. In Christianity, we affirm the Word; we confess the Word. Whatever we say or speak should, and must always, be in conformity with the Word of God.</p>
<p>Constantly affirm that you’re a new creation in Christ Jesus, infused with the life of God, not vulnerable to the crippling influences of this world! Affirm that the life of God is at work in your spirit, soul, and body. Affirm that the same Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead vitalizes your body and invigorates you through and through, always!</p>
<p>Never say, “I’m sick,” or “I have a headache,” because sickness doesn’t belong in the Kingdom of God; it never comes from the Father. So, don’t affirm it. Don’t affirm poverty, weakness, lack, or fear. Declare that you’re bold, strong, and courageous.</p>

<p>&quot;...our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full&quot; (1 John 1:4).</p>
<p>People say that man needs air, food, water, shelter, light, money and so on. However, they forget that a man may have all these basic necessities of life, and still be dissatisfied and frustrated. The reason for this is not farfetched. All of the ‘basic necessities’ of life aren’t enough to give man lasting joy; he needs something more. He needs a relationship with God.</p>
<p>Someone rightly said that there’s a God-shaped vacuum in every man which only God can fill. Man is restless until he finds his rest in God. This is the reason some very  rich people aren’t at peace and live miserable lives in spite of their immense wealth. Being rich and famous isn’t everything about life. The love of your spouse or friends wouldn’t fill that vacuum, for that part of your being is exclusively reserved for God alone.</p>
<p>When you have a rapport with someone, maybe your neighbour, you feel happy and at ease when you’re with him. If, however, the reverse is the case, you’ll always have reservations and doubts when you’re with him, especially when you have a request, since you won’t be sure he’ll oblige you. In the same vein, the reason some people pray without the assurance of getting answers is that they have no faith in their relationship with God. The Bible says, “And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him” (1 John 5:15).</p>
<p>When you get to know that you’re loved by a faithful God Who hears your prayers, you’ll always be joyful. True and lasting joy emanates from this kind of relationship with your heavenly Father (Galatians 5:22).</p>
<p>Without a relationship with God, life is empty. The Holy Spirit is the Communicator of the presence of God on earth. Fellowship with Him today, for that’s the secret to an unending overflow of joy in your life. Oh, how I love Him! Through that fellowship God’s presence rubs off on you and overwhelms you; you’re refreshed and filled with joy unspeakable and full of glory. Hallelujah.</p>

<p>&quot;… that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God&#x27; (Luke 16:15).</p>
<p>Never try to live your life based on the opinion of men. People who run their lives based on the verdict of men easily become frustrated and despondent. As a child of God, your success has nothing to do with the verdict or opinion of men. Therefore, don’t try to be a success in the mind of others. In other words, don’t worry about what others think or say about you. The Lord Jesus said, “…Ye…justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God” (Luke 16:15). The opinion of men about you doesn’t count at all; they are useless before God.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about being esteemed by men, it doesn’t mean anything! Men may call you a failure, but that wouldn’t make you a failure. They may call you poor, it doesn’t  mean you’re poor. They may call you a ‘nobody,’ but that doesn’t make you a ‘nobody.’ The only opinion that matters in life is God’s opinion of you. What He calls you is  what’s important and let it be the name you answer. Guess what? His opinions of you are beautiful. Study the Bible and you’ll discover that He calls you a bundle of success;  He calls you the rich, prosperous and victorious. He calls you someone special—His  peculiar treasure! These are His opinions of you and they’re the opinions that count. Hallelujah.</p>

<p>…It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God (Matthew 4:4).</p>
<p>In today’s world, people are more particular about what they eat. While some eat the right food to stay healthy, there’re those who, from eating all the wrong things, have put their health in jeopardy. It’s the same thing spiritually. As a Christian, you must feed on the right information. You must feed your faith with the Word of God. Some Christians would rather feed their fears than feed their faith. You feed your fears when you give attention to wrong or noxious information.</p>
<p>The food for the human spirit is God’s word. Jesus said, “…Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4). Whilst God’s Word makes the human spirit come alive—buoyant with faith, hope and love, unwholesome words poison and destroy the human spirit. Such negative information that are harmful to the human spirit proceed from giving attention to the wrong things.</p>
<p>The effect of feeding on wrong information in the life of a Christian may not be seen overnight; but with time, such a person gets weaker and weaker spiritually. Before long, he’s no longer as fervent in spiritual things as he used to be. Then, his life takes a completely different turn from God’s original plan.</p>
<p>Give attention to the right information. Fortify and energize your spirit for success with God’s Word. The forces of life are domiciled in your spirit; as you feed your spirit with the Word, you’ll be able to produce every good thing you want in life from within you. Jesus said, “A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things” (Matthew 12:35).</p>

<p>“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds;) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:3-5). “Strongholds” in this context connote arguments, theories or ideas that the society has sold to us. They form the basis for the “imaginations” of the ordinary man; his reasoning is molded by them. For example, a medical doctor has knowledge of facts and theories that form an integral part of his personality.</p>
<p>Different people have their mentality shaped in one way or the other, by education, training or culture. And so, these diverse forms of knowledge tend to militate against the Word of God in their hearts, creating doubts in their minds. But the scripture in 2 Corinthians 10:3-5 lets us know they can be refuted using the weapons of our warfare: our divine utterances, speaking in other tongues, and our bold proclamation of the written Word of God. By these, you’ll pull down strongholds and cast down imaginations that arise from your mind. Hallelujah.</p>

<p>To doubt in your spirit means to be double-minded, or to waver or withdraw alternately fromyour conviction. James says, “...He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways” (James 1:6-8).</p>
<p>It also means to stagger at God’s Word. The Bible says in Romans 4:20-21 that “he (Abraham) staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform”</p>
<p>Abraham refused to stagger at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith. Strong faith is the antidote for doubt in your heart. When you find yourself staggering at God’s Word and struggling tobelieve it; being double-minded and unstable; what you need to do is strengthen your faith. And this happens as you put your faith to work.</p>
<p>The more you put your faith to work, the stronger it becomes. If your faith is weak, it indicates there’s doubt in your heart; and such weak faith is the result of not exercising your faith. The cure, therefore, for weak faith is acting on the Word, exercising your faith. If you want your faith to be strong, start doing the Word! For example, the Bible says, “In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you” (1 Thessalonians 5:18). So what should you do? Start practising the scripture by giving God thanks. Let your life become an unending streamof praise and thanksgiving to God, irrespective of your situation or circumstances. That’s acting on the Word!</p>

<p>O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph (Psalm 47:1).</p>
<p>Our opening verse is talking about the shout of victory. Some people shout out of fear, but in Christianity we shout in victory. We shout unto the Lord with the voice of triumph. It’s like the shout the children of Israel gave in conquering Jericho. As they journeyed to the Promised Land, they got to Jericho, but the city was shut with thick and imposing walls (Joshua 6:1).</p>
<p>The Lord, however, gave Joshua the strategy to conquer Jericho. It was the “shout strategy”: And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall SHOUT WITH A GREAT SHOUT; AND THE WALL OF THE CITY SHALL FALL DOWN FLAT, AND THE PEOPLE SHALL ASCEND UP EVERY MAN STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM” (Joshua 6:2-5). When the people did as the Lord instructed, the walls came down flat (Joshua 6:20).</p>
<p>Some people don’t understand it when we shout; it’s spiritual. The Bible tells us about Jesus, that He shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:” (1 Thessalonians 4:16). It’s like the kind of shout He gave at the tomb of Lazarus; the Bible says He yelled with a loud voice, “..Lazarus, come forth” (John 11:43).</p>
<p>Lazarus, having been dead, and buried for four days, already believed to be putrefying, came out of the grave alive! When we shout in victory, the enemy is discomfited; the dead come back to life. Some people only shout out of fear; and that’s the wrong shout; ours is the voice of triumph. We shout ahead of the battle; ahead of the challenges; therefore, when they come, they’re walkovers.</p>
<p>There’s no victory without a shout. When you face challenges, shout, not in exasperation, but in triumph. Even when you’re not happy, shout! Even now, shout aloud with the voice of triumph; it’s an act of faith. Shout and declare that you’ve won. The future can depend on your shouting; so don’t keep quiet; shout your victory.</p>

<p>If you didn’t have the ability to believe God for something and have it come to pass, He wouldn’t have told you to do so. God never tells you to do something you can’t do.When we make demands through the prayer of faith, it’s so vital for us to know what role we’re expected to play. Often, there’s an act of obedience that God requires of us. Many people are ignorant of this truth, and so they fail to take the necessary steps besides praying. In the end, they would have reasons why their expectations weren’t met. But when you’re in sync with the Spirit of God in prayer, He’ll show you what your role is, and you ought to be diligent to play your part.</p>
<p>When Christ ministered to certain people through the Word of faith, there was always something Here quired. “And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, what saith my lord unto his servant?” (Joshua 5:13-14). It was the Holy Spirit who referred to Himself here as the Captain of the Lord’s Host. He came to tell Joshua what to do as he stood before Jericho, contemplating how best to take it. Jericho was a part of the Promised Land, and God said to Joshua, “…see I have given into thine hand Jericho and the king there of and the mighty men of valor” (Joshua 6:2).Notice He didn’t say, “I will give…,” but “I have given...” This wasn’t a promise; it was a statement offact coming from the mouth of God. It’s quite remarkable that though God had given the Israelites Jericho, there were still great walls surrounding the city when they got there. The walls were so huge that thechildren of Israel couldn’t scale over them. Even if they did, the armies of Jericho were in position topick them off like sitting ducks.</p>
<p>It seemed Israel would be unable to go in and possess the land the Lordhad given to them. But the Holy Spirit, the Extraordinary Strategist, was present to tell Joshua what heneeded to do to conquer Jericho: “And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou dosix days. And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh dayye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. And it shall come topass, that when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, allthe people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shallascend up every man straight before him” (Joshua 6:3-5).</p>
<p>The strategy given to Joshua was obviously strange (but supernatural), because no human mind would’ve thought of bringing down those walls through the mere sound of trumpets and the shout of weary men. But the walls miraculously came down because Joshua and the host of Israel acted on the instruction ofthe Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It’s sad that many Christians have had promises from God that they never enjoyed, and prophecies thatnever came to pass, just because they didn’t know what the Holy Ghost would have them do.When the Lord told Joshua, “I’ve given you the city; I’ve given you the king and all the men of valorthere. I’ve given all into your hand,” Joshua could have shouted, “Wow, thank God, Jericho’s mine!” and just gone to sleep. The next day he would have woken up to see those walls looming as defiantly as ever,and he would have wondered, But God told me He had given the land into my hand; why can’t He bringto pass what He promised?That’s just like someone who says, “I thought God said the job was mine. I went there and they didn’tgive me the employment letter; in fact, they threw me out!”</p>
<p>Yours can be a different story. You can confidently declare God’s Word in faith and get the results you</p>

<p>For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body (James 3:2).</p>
<p>The words you speak are a true measure of your spirituality. It makes no difference what others might think or say about you; what matters are the words that come out of your mouth every day, irrespective of who you may be talking to: God, men, yourself, circumstances, or nature. Be sure you always, speak gracious, faith-filled, and spirit-building words. Tame your tongue.</p>
<p>The Apostle James likened the tongue to the rudder of a great ship that the captain uses to navigate the ship aright, irrespective of the fierce winds driving against it (James 3:4-5). This means that with your words, you can keep yourself in health, in faith, in success, and in the transcendent life. Don’t talk fear, lack or your inabilities. Talk the Word! Consciously put the Word on your lips.</p>
<p>Isn’t it wonderful that with your tongue, you can disallow sickness, disease, infirmity, and weakness from your body? Always speak health and strength to your body. Many are sick, weak, broke and suffering today because of their careless talking through the years. Get your tongue under control and have your life under control!</p>
<p>Use your tongue to come out of trouble, depression, sickness, pain, poverty, and frustration. Today, where you are, and what you are in life, are the result of your words. If the result isn’t such that you’re pleased with, you can consciously begin to chart a new course, and decide what the next five or ten years will be like for you. If the results are already wonderful, you can walk in greater glory and higher levels of success if you use your tongue right. Jesus said you shall have what you say. Therefore, use your tongue to beautify your life (Mark 11:23).</p>

<p>&quot;A prudent man foresees evil and hides himself, But the simple pass on and are punished&quot; (Proverbs 22:3).</p>
<p>Success can be defined as the ability to minimize your errors. The virtue that imparts this ability is prudence. Prudence is practical wisdom that is applicable everyday and every time. With it, you make wise choices and wise decisions. It ensures that you make fewer mistakes in your life by guiding you to make right choices. With this virtue, you’ll never be financially bankrupt. You’ll always get things right the first time you do them.</p>
<p>A prudent person is someone who is marked by sound judgment. If God endows you with prudence, others will take notice that you have such a virtue. When Job was in great distress, everybody who came to see him reminded him of his suffering. His wife advised him to curse God and die, but Job, standing his ground said, “…the counsel of the wicked is far from me” (Job 21:16). Job was able to stand his ground because he refused the wrong counsel.</p>
<p>What people need today to strengthen the virtue of prudence is the counsel of God’s Word; nothing else can replace it. It’s the only correct answer to every human question or desire. “The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge” (Proverbs 18:15). You must make personal efforts to study God’s Word. This way, your paths in life will be directed by the Word of God. This is what will guide you into making the right decisions.<br>

<p>The immune system is the body’s natural defence against infectious organisms. A healthy immune system protects the body against infections and diseases. There are several ways to boost your body’s immune system. Outlined below are five great ways to do that naturally:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Watch What You Eat:
A diet rich in antioxidants is essential  to supporting your immune system.  Antioxidants are abundant in many fruits and vegetables. Healthy fats such as omega-3 fatty acids available in oily fish, flaxseed, and krill oil also help to increase your body’s production of compounds involved in regulating immunity. Including garlic and ginger in your meals is also helpful. Garlic has been proven to possess virus-fighting and bacteria-killing properties, while ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drink Plenty of Water:
Drinking plenty of water and steering clear of sugary beverages, like soda and energy drinks, may also help boost your immunity by cleansing your system. Also as much as you can, avoid caffeinated drinks. Caffeine robs your body of minerals and vitamins, and dehydrates you. If you drink coffee, make sure you add an additional two glasses of<br>
<!-- -->water to your water intake per cup of coffee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise Regularly:
Regular exercise can mobilize your “T cells”, a type of white blood cell known to guard the body against infection. Studies have shown that people who engage regularly in moderate exercises (such as brisk walking) are generally healthier than those who don’t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleep Well:
The amount of sleep people need varies widely. It ranges from 5 to 10 hours per night. It is important to find your own personal sleep requirement and get it! Sleep has been linked to balanced hormone levels, clear thinking and reasoning, improved mood, and healthy skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take Care of Yourself:
Caring for yourself and doing things that you love help immensely to boost your wellbeing. Spend time with your loved ones and engage regularly in activities that truly make you happy. You’d find that you’d live healthier  and stronger!
Glory to God.</p>

<p>&quot;Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much&quot; (James 5:16).</p>
<p>When the Bible talks about confession, many only relate to it in terms of confession of sins, but confession is much more than that. Confession means to speak the same thing with God in consent; it derives from the Greek word &quot;homologia&quot;; it&#x27;s a principle in the Kingdom of God that begins with your salvation as a child of God.</p>
<p>You couldn&#x27;t have been saved without confession; not the confession of your sins, but the affirmation of the Lordship of Jesus over your life. Romans 10:9-10 says, &quot;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.&quot; This is the true confession that catapults you into salvation.</p>
<p>The only time you confess something you did wrong is after you&#x27;ve become a Christian and have received eternal life. When you do something wrong, you talk to the Lord about it and you&#x27;re cleansed. Even though you talk to the Lord, you don&#x27;t really confess your sins, because He didn&#x27;t tell us to confess our sins to Him; He knows already. You only confess or acknowledge your faults to your brothers and/or sisters whom you&#x27;ve offended. That&#x27;s what we read in our opening verse.</p>
<p>Someone might ask, &quot;How about 1 John 1:9 that says, &quot;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness?&quot; For some people, they believe this means we&#x27;re always sinning; we&#x27;re in a perpetual state of sin and confession; but that&#x27;s not true; it means, if we acknowledge our sins, He blots them out. 1 John 2:1 says, &quot;if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.&quot; Notice it doesn&#x27;t say, &quot;When any man sin,&quot; but &quot;If any man sin,&quot; letting you know that sin isn&#x27;t perpetual.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Bible says, &quot;For sin shall not have dominion over you.&quot; (Romans 6:14). Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:1).</p>
<p>One of the most striking thoughts in the Bible, which many of God’s people seem not to be conscious of is the fact that as Christians, we are more than “saved people” or “good people.” We are actually “saints of God.” The word “saint” as used in
both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible means the same thing. It means “Holy ones; those who are consecrated or separated unto God.” If you are born again, you are a saint of God. You are consecrated, separated, chosen by God and separated from others. I’m aware that some people say saints are those who are dead and gone to heaven. But that’s inconsistent with the scriptures. The Apostle Paul made mention of the saints at Philippi (Philippians 1:1). He also talked about the saints in the city of Colosse (Colossians 1:2) and the saints at Rome (Romans 1:7). These were all people who were living in these cities at the time. Until you recognize who you are, you will never walk in the light of it.</p>
<p>Some people find it difficult to accept that they are saints because of the wrong things they’ve done. Well, the Bible didn’t say that a saint is a perfect person. Rather, he’s being perfected through the ministry gifts. That’s the reason the Bible says, “And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ” (Ephesians 4:11-12). “Saint” is not a title. So, it’s not a question of just using it as a prefix to your name; don’t lose the power of the revelation. It’s about understanding that the Spirit of God has chosen and consecrated you; you are separated from the world and separated unto God.</p>
<p>You have been separated from sickness, poverty, death, sin, lack and the suffering that the ordinary people of the world go through. You’re God’s property, bought with a price and set apart for the beautiful life in the beloved country of Zion! Can you call yourself a saint today; for if you don’t call yourself one, nobody else will.</p>

<p>Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men (Proverbs 22:29).</p>
<p>The opening verse shows us a key ingredient for a successful and prosperous life—diligence! Some people find themselves in a regrettable state in life due to their inability to apply diligence in their lives, and in the things that God has called them to do.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was humbly diligent; He said in John 4:34, &quot;my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” He recognized that His success was in doing the work of the Father, and finishing it. He knew the importance and eternal significance of His assignment, and committed Himself to it with extraordinary discipline and diligence.</p>
<p>There’re people who never finish or complete anything that’s committed to them; and there’re others who are perpetually late to their workplace or come up with excuses for non-performance. Yet, such people wonder why things aren’t working out right for them, or why they aren’t being promoted. The reason for their predicament is simple: they slothfully ignore the application of diligence in their everyday life. Diligence is a key factor that sparks off true success in you. I’m talking about the God-kind of success; not the world’s definition of success.</p>
<p>Diligence brings you before kings and into honour, while slothfulness leads to poverty and obscurity. Diligent people make their organizations more successful and prosperous than the way they met it. That’s one of the hallmarks of truly successful people. Become diligent in anything and everything that’s committed to your trust.</p>
<p>A close look at the lives of successful men and women around the world, no matter what field of endeavour they belong to, will reveal one common factor in their lives—diligence. The same thing applies to things of the Spirit. As you diligently study the Word of God and apply it, it enriches your spirit; you become successful in your spirit, and your fellowship with the Lord is enhanced.</p>

<p>“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the COMMUNION of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen” (2 Corinthians 13:14).</p>
<p>“Communion” refers to a partnership, a communication, a fellowship with the Holy Spirit. It means talking to the Holy Spirit and listening to Him talk to you. This is how you get to know what He wants you to do. It’s not enough to have a vision or to proclaim what you want; you’ve got to know the right steps to take to make that vision a reality, then you can go ahead and do it.</p>
<p>You see, it’s not God’s idea for us to always call on Him for our needs. Most of the time, our cries and pleas to God are unnecessary, for He’s given us the power to bring about whatever kind of change we want in our lives.</p>
<p>Paul prayed in Ephesians 1:17-18:
“That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him: The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.”</p>
<p>As you become acquainted with the great provisions that God has freely given you, not only would your prayer language change, you’d also begin to understand the necessary actions you need to take in order to enjoy your divine inheritance. You’d cease to pray the “Lord-give-me” prayers; instead, you’d be acting on the infallible Word of God and getting remarkable results. You’d know beyond doubt that all things are yours, and anything is indeed possible. Amen.</p>

<p>Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity (2 PETER 1:5-7).</p>
<p>The Greek word for brotherly kindness is “Philadelphia,” which means fraternal affection; learning to be helpful in a brotherly manner; having godly affection for your brethren. When you have “Philadelphia,” it means you esteem, honour and love others dearly.</p>
<p>It’s what the Lord wants, and it’s something you have to practise. He said, “Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another” (Romans 12:10). Practise kindness; practise walking in love. Practise honouring and esteeming others. This is one of the prerequisites for a fruitful and productive life. 2 Peter 1:8 says, “if these things be in you, and abound, (one of which is brotherly kindness) they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Part of fraternal affection is to always speak kindly of, and be pleasant to, your brothers and sisters. God places a far greater premium on inter-personal relationships among His children than most people realize. He said in Galatians 6:10 (TLB): “Whenever we can we should always be kind to everyone and especially to our Christian brothers.” That means you ought to give preference to your brothers and sisters in Christ and hold them in the highest regard.</p>
<p>Romans 12:10 (CEV) says, “Love each other as brothers and sisters and honour others more than you do yourself.” Imagine that the Lord says to esteem others above yourself! Don’t judge or try to outdo others. Relate to them with the love of Christ that’s in your heart. Be gracious, loving, and kind to them always.</p>
<p>CONFESSION: I’m gracious and kind, even as my heavenly Father is gracious and kind. I esteem my brothers and sisters in Christ highly, because the love of Christ in me compels me to do so. The kindness of the Spirit of God is seen in my communication, attitude, and character. Therefore, my life is fruitful and productive, in Jesus’ Name. Amen</p>

<p>“Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined” (Psalms 50:2)</p>
<p>Zion is described as the perfection of beauty. It refers to the Church of Jesus Christ (Hebrews 12:22-24) of which you’re a member. This means you’re so beautiful, for the Bible says Zion, where you dwell, is the perfection of beauty. True beauty isn’t the shape of your nose or your facial formation. It’s not the complexion of your skin or the shape of your body. True beauty is satisfying and thirst-quenching. It means to be awe-inspiring, pleasant, adorable, glorious, full of favour and grace.</p>
<p>You’re the epitome and perfection of beauty; you’re the most beautiful thing the world has ever seen. You’re too beautiful to be sick, poor or afflicted. You’re too beautiful to cheat, steal
or tell lies. Therefore, refuse anything in your life that’s contrary to God’s provision for you through Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>The Bible calls you the glory of God (2 Corinthians 3:18). What could be more beautiful than that? Don’t be fixated on your physical body or you may see something you don’t like; you may not like your nose, ears, eyes, hair or the way you walk. God wants you to look on the inside, for there’s something better on the inside. Look with the eyes of your spirit and behold yourself in the mirror of God.</p>
<p>Don’t wish you were someone else, for God doesn’t have a copy of you. Nobody in the world has ever been or will ever be exactly like you. Nobody can smile the way you do; nobody
can do things the way you can. You’re God’s only one of you, and so He wants to use you to shine. You’re more beautiful than you see, for you look like your heavenly Father.</p>

<p>Life in Christ is a super life; it’s a daily expression of victorious and triumphant living! You have to understand that when the Bible saysold things are passed away, it’s talking about the old nature that was subject to sin, defeat, sickness, failure, and death.</p>
<p>You have received a new life and have been made a new creation. When you understand this truth, sickness and failure will not be part of your life anymore. This is because these are all products of the old nature, Adam’s fallen nature.</p>
<p>The reason some Christians live in defeat, fear, sin, poverty, sickness, and disease is because they’re living in the past. They’re still living with the mindset of what they used to be and where they came from. They haven’t come into the reality of the new life. They haven’t understood that this new life is a super life void of struggles, failure, sickness, and disease. Christianity is a life of dominion. The Bible says in Romans 5:17, “For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>God never fails and He hasn’t changed. “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today and forever”(Hebrews 13:8). He hasn’t changed! What He did in Bible days, He’s able and willing to do today. Ask Him to help you today. He specializes in doing good things for His children. Healing is your bread!Maybe you’ve been sick for very long; maybe you’ve been confined to a wheel chair and the doctors have given up hope on you. Hey, I’ve got news for you: God desires above all things that you rise from that sickbed! He desires for those deaf ears to be unstopped today. God wants you healthy and prosperous; refuse to accept anything contrary.</p>
<p>Come into agreement with Him so His wish concerning you can be actualized. He has given you divine, perfect health. It’s your right.You reign over sin, sickness, death, and every circumstance of life. God has put His blessing in you; that blessing is a special endowment, a divine elixir that causes you to do well and excel in life. It’s a mark of the people of Zion; it differentiates and separates them unto greatness, health, and excellence. Glory to God, you’re a new creation in Christ Jesus; you’re made for the super life, Hallelujah!</p>

<p>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him (Colossians 2:6).</p>
<p>The New International Version’s rendering of our opening verse says, “So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him.” Notice the underlined expression; it let’s us know that Christ is a place. You were born into the place called Christ when you were born again. He’s your home. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Bible says, “Therefore if any man be in Christ , he is a new creature” (2 Corinthians 5:17). 1 Corinthians 12:13
says, “For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body”
and that body is Christ. In the New Testament, wherever the word, “Christ” is used without “Jesus,” understand that the reference is beyond the person of Jesus Christ. Christ is a person and Christ is a place.</p>
<p>The Bible says God made Jesus to be the head of the body of Christ, and the Church is His body. So, you’ve been born into Christ; that’s where you live now and this must be your consciousness. Nothing that’s inconsistent with Christ and the Christ-life or nature should have a place in your life.
The life you’ve received is one of absolute mastery—a life of
righteousness, dominion, power, glory and excellence.</p>
<p>In Christ, not only have you been made righteous, you’ve also been made the righteousness of God. Therefore, living the righteous life that He gave us has become our natural way of life. In Christ—our home country—we express and manifest the righteousness of God. We bear fruits and produce works of righteousness.</p>
<p>In Christ, there’s no sin, sickness, disease, failure, poverty, defeat, weakness or death; all we have is health, joy, peace, success, strength, prosperity, beauty and life forever more! We reign and rule over Satan and his cohorts of darkness. We’re more than conquerors. We’re forever triumphant. Nothing can defeat or put us down. That’s the life we have, and live in Christ. So, when you say, “I’m in Christ,” you ought to understand the import of that statement, for it means that’s where you live; your address is Christ! Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Christ is my life. Having received Jesus Christ as my Lord, I live triumphantly in righteousness, glory, health, dominion and authority! I walk, conscious of my oneness with the owner of the universe; therefore, the whole world is mine. Blessed be God!</p>

<p>In the literal sense, a petition is a formal written plea with legal demands. A petitioner writes according to legal guidelines and makes his request in such a way as to convince the one he is presenting his petition to. It is also defined as a solemn entreaty; a supplication or request appealing to an authority, or an earnest or humble appeal for something or to someone.</p>
<p>The prayer of petition does entail much seriousness; it’s an earnest request accompanied with a great deal of intensity. However, its effectiveness or efficacy doesn’t necessarily have to do with lengthiness. You can make far-reaching impact in your world and turn circumstances around in just a few minutes through the prayer of petition.</p>
<p>“I exhort therefore, that first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men” (1Timothy 2:1). The word ‘supplications’ here also means ‘petitions’ or ‘entreaties.’ So, put differently, Apostle Paul was instructing Timothy to make petitions a priority in his prayers.</p>

<p>Exodus 31:1-5
&quot;And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,&quot;</p>
<p>When you study the Bible, it points us to the Seven Spirits of God. Seven is the symbol of completion, the number of perfection.</p>
<p>Verse 3 above talks of a man filled with 3 of God&#x27;s Spirit.</p>
<p>Isaiah 11:1-3
&quot;And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD; And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:&quot;</p>
<p>Before the Messaih (Jesus Christ) came, nobody was filled with all Seven Spirits of God. In the old testament times, the Spirit of God rests on people and used them for mighty works.</p>
<p>Daniel 12:1-4
&quot;But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.&quot;</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;knowledge shall be increased&quot; means that God is going to cause the increase,</p>
<p>THIS MONTH OF MARCH IS THR MONTH OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p>Every Child of God has received the fullness of the Spirit (Seven Spirits of God). In this month, there&#x27;s going to be a manifestation of this particular Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit is going to cause knowledge to increase and you&#x27;re going to be open to receive this increased knowledge.</p>
<p>Proverbs 8:10, 10:14
&quot;Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.&quot;</p>
<p>God is telling you that knowledge is more important than choice gold.</p>
<p>Proverbs 18:15, 19:2
&quot;The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p>This is knowledge that can be applied for life; that can cause progress and improve one&#x27;s life.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people that have useless knowledge that can&#x27;t help them in life. That the soul be without knowledge is not good.</p>
<p>Proverbs 23:3-5
&quot;Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat. Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>Knowledge is what you&#x27;d need to get from the outside. The other virtues are from within you. So acquire knowledge; learn something new this month.</p>
<p>2 Peter 1:5
&quot;And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;&quot;</p>
<p>There are three basic kinds of knowledge we are introduced to in the New Testament - Sonesis, Ginosko and Epignosis.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:10 talks about Epignosis. This knowledge relates with God; the more you know Him, the more you&#x27;re like Him.</p>
<p>2 Peter 1:2-3
&quot;Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:&quot;</p>
<p>You want more grace in your life, more peace manifested in your life; it&#x27;s not by prayer or fasting, it is by knowledge (Epignosis) of God and of Jesus.</p>
<p>The word of God comes to build your life, to increase your knowledge. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important for you not to despise the gatherings of the brethren.</p>

<p>Question 1</p>
<p>When having my quiet time with the Lord, can I have my eyes open?</p>
<p>Yes, you can have your eyes open. The reason we shut our eyes while praying is simple to avoid distraction and stay focused.</p>
<p>Question 2</p>
<p>I am a spirit, when I am born again, I received the Holy Spirit, so I have 2 spirits in me or just one.</p>
<p>He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit. This is a mystery yet to true. This is not just about a unity it is a oneness with the Lord. Fellowship can best be described in English language as oneness.</p>
<p>Imagine you have water from one glass, and another water in another water, when one water is poured into the other, the water becomes one. You can&#x27;t distinguish one from the other. This is exactly what happened to us. The Holy Spirit has mingled with our spirit.</p>
<p>Question 3</p>
<p>Is it good for one to have water while fasting and praying and is there a specific time to break the fast.</p>
<p>When it is a general fast, it&#x27;s okay to drink water. While having your personal fast, especially a long fast, it&#x27;s okay to also drink water.</p>
<p>During Communion Service, our fast ends after the breaking of the bread. For those in North America for example, our Communion Service is their morning service. You can decide to fast till even and have your usual service before breaking the fast.</p>
<p>Question 4</p>
<p>Can I take a loan to fulfil my pledge if the pledge redemption time is due.</p>
<p>If you can take a loan to buy a car and other things, you can also to fulfil a pledge but be sure to have a good plan to pay it back. Don&#x27;t say since I have it to God I can default. No, make sure to pay back as at when due.</p>
<p>MESSAGE FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH — THE MONTH OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p>Exodus 31:1</p>
<ol>
<li>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,</li>
</ol>
<p>2 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</p>
<p>3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,</p>
<p>4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</p>
<p>5 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.</p>
<p>When you study the scriptures, you will discover that there are seven spirits of God. Seven is the number for completion, the number of Perfection. God in the scripture above fills this man with 3 of the 7 spirits.</p>
<p>Isaiah 11:1-3KJV: And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:</p>
<p>2 And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord;</p>
<p>3 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:</p>
<p>4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</p>
<p>Daniel 12:1</p>
<ol>
<li>And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.</li>
</ol>
<p>2 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</p>
<p>3 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</p>
<p>4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</p>
<p>The Lord said to me, THIS MONTH OF MARCH IS THE MONTH OF KNOWLEDGE
In this month, there will be the operation of the spirit of Knowledge. Kn</p>

<p>Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches Proverbs 24:3-4.</p>
<p>Our theme verse highlights wisdom, understanding, and knowledge as three vital ingredients needed for building a successful life. It says with wisdom, a “house” is built; that house could be likened to YOUR LIFE, BUSINESS, CAREER, or FAMILY. It goes further to say that the “house,” once built, is established by understanding; and then by knowledge, you bring riches into it.</p>
<p>Often, you find people whose lives are, as it were, out of joint; they’re frustrated and unhappy, for the simple reason that they lack wisdom. Some others have things going on well with them, perhaps, in their job or career, but they’re unfulfilled because their families are disorientated. Why? Because they lack understanding; it’s with understanding that a family is established and made strong. They had enough wisdom to start the family, but lacked the understanding to establish it.</p>
<p>Some others have enough wisdom and understanding to organize their families or businesses aright, but lack the requisite knowledge of how to make consistent progress from glory to glory. Wisdom, understanding, and knowledge must go together; they’re needed for a life of all-round success, prosperity, and fulfilment.</p>
<p>Proverbs 4:7
wisdom is the principal thing! It’s your capital: “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore, get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.” Notice it didn’t stop at enjoining us to embrace wisdom; it goes further to say, “with all thy getting get understanding,” letting you know that understanding is just as important.</p>
<p>Then in Proverbs 15:5, we’re cautioned not to despise knowledge; it says, the one who ignores knowledge is a fool. Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding come to you through the Word:</p>
<p>“For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding” Proverbs 2:6</p>
<p>You need all three to be effective, and to live the extraordinary life of success, dominion, victory, and excellence that God has ordained for you.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="called-to-a-life-of-glory--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1674">CALLED TO A LIFE OF GLORY ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~1674<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CALLED TO A LIFE OF GLORY ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~1674" title="Direct link to CALLED TO A LIFE OF GLORY ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~1674" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#called-to-a-life-of-glory--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1674">​</a></h2>
<p>God has called you to a life of progress, a life of success and a life of glory. You were recreated to experience the glory of God; you were made for that purpose. No matter what phase of life you’re in right now, I want you to know if you’re born again that God created you for a life of glory, so you ought to be experiencing His glory in your life.</p>
<p>I know people say that life is full of ups and downs but that’s no news. The direction our lives ought to be going is upward and forward. If you find yourself at the down part, you get up and go over! When you’re at theup part, you still go over! The down part shouldn’t make you despondent. No! In the valley, shout His praise; on the mountain top, you shout His praise also. Why? God is God everywhere!</p>
<p>The Psalmist said, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me… Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies” (Psalm 23:4-5). God didn’t say you would not have enemies, but right there in their presence, He prepares a table for you. You see, life takes on a new meaning when you know where you’re going, you know the One Who’s with you and you know the kind of life that He has planned for you to live.</p>
<p>Are you experiencing the glory? Are you walking in the glory? Are you experiencing the upward, supernatural and progressive life? As you read through the pages of this book, you will get to learn and walk in accordance with the pattern that God has revealed in His Word. This pattern shows how you ought to experience the glory of God in your life.</p>

<p>“Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at  the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour; and a certain man  lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid  daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to  ask alms of them that entered into the temple; who seeing  Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms;  and Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, look  on us; and he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive  something of them; then Peter said, silver and gold have I  none; but such as I have give I thee: in the name of Jesus  Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk” (Acts 3:1-6).</p>
<p>This scripture shows us there’s tremendous power in the Name  of Jesus. Peter knew and understood the power in the Name of Jesus. He knew what that Name could accomplish, and he knew how to use  it. He said to the lame man at the gate: “such as I have give I thee:  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.” Peter  knew he had something!</p>
<p>Do you know you have something? If you’re born again, the Name  of Jesus has been given to you to use for your life and for the good of  others. You can use that Name over your body, your children, your  home, or your business. If you have an infirmity in your body, you can  use the Name of Jesus against that sickness and ask it to get out of your  body, and it will. Glory to God.</p>

<p>And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold (Matthew 24:12).</p>
<p>In our world today, we’re more security-conscious than ever; there’s so much fear. It reminds of the words of Jesus as He cautioned against the signs of the end of the age; He said men’s hearts will fail them for fear (Luke 21:25-26). For example, it has become increasingly difficult, while driving by, to stop and help a stranded stranger, because many are afraid that the person could turn out to be a carjacker or a violent criminal.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a beggar who wants some help could approach someone, but because many of such beggars have been found to be tricky, he’s snubbed. That’s part of what our opening verse is talking about. Many have become cold, to the point that they’re not sure who to help anymore. Some have become hardened, because everybody seems to be self-seeking.</p>
<p>However, the wickedness of the world shouldn’t stop us from loving; it shouldn’t dowse our love-fire or make us shut our bowels of mercy and compassion. We must reach out, and keep reaching out, to help those in need. We have the Holy Spirit, and He’ll guide us aright in this; trust Him. If it’s a phony scenario or “funny” situation, He’ll let you know just in time what to do.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you see someone in trouble, don’t be unmoved; be willing to help, even if you’ve been cheated before for so doing. Don’t say, “I’ll never help anybody again,” because someone deceived you. Those who cheat you will get into trouble with God, but you’ll keep getting greater for loving and helping others.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus saw ahead the perilous nature of the days we’re living in: the abundance of wickedness and lawlessness; the superfluity of waywardness. And because of that, He said the love of many shall wax cold. But it wasn’t a recommendation for us to faint, wane, or waver in our love-walk. Yes, the days are evil, but we’re guided by divine wisdom, and compelled by love to walk circumspectly and shine as lights in the midst of a crooked and perverse world.</p>
<p>Love can’t be defeated; you’re never a fool for faith, hope, and love. So, keep the love-fire burning; it’ll always win, in spite of the prevalence of sin, evil, and wickedness in the world today.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-example-of-noah--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1678">THE EXAMPLE OF NOAH ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~1678<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to THE EXAMPLE OF NOAH ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~1678" title="Direct link to THE EXAMPLE OF NOAH ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~1678" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#the-example-of-noah--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1678">​</a></h2>
<p>The Bible specifically exemplifies Noah as a man greatly blessed of God because he walked by faith in a generation that didn’t acknowledge God. By his unwavering faith in God, he condemned the sinful world he dwelt in at the time. One day, God looked upon the earth and was appalled at what He saw.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of thethoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him athis heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. But Noahfound grace in the eyes of theLord” (Genesis 6:5-8).</p>
<p>God was ready to destroy the whole earth along with every last man and beast in it, but one man, Noah, found God’s grace, because he was a man of faith. God told Noah He was going to destroy the world and gave him specific instructions on how to build an ark and select pairs of animals that will be preserved from the deluge. Being a man of faith, Noah followed all of God’s instructions to the letter. No wonder the Bible says in Hebrews 11:7 that he: “being warned of God of thingsnot seen as yet, moved with fear,prepared an ark to the saving ofhis house; by the which hecondemned the world, andbecame heir of the righteousnesswhich is by faith.”  Hallelujah.</p>

<p>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai carrying the two Tablets of The Testimony, he didn’t know that the skin of his face glowed because he had been speaking with GOD (Exodus 34:29 MSG).</p>
<p>Man is a spirit being and not a physical body. Many, however, have put a premium on their outward appearance; they go through rigorous exercises and dietary plans; some even go through severe surgical procedures to maintain or enhance their physical looks.</p>
<p>But you see, don’t be carried away by all the praise you might receive for your outward appearance. The truth is, there’s no glory like that of your spirit. That should be your dream: beautifying your human spirit!</p>
<p>1 Peter 1:23 says, “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.” Thus, you’re born of the Word, and contemplating the Word should be a priority. When you study the Word or receive its ministry in teaching or preaching, it glorifies or beautifies your spirit. You’re strengthened, energized and invigorated for greater works.</p>
<p>Moses had an experience recorded in Exodus 34. He had spent so much time (forty days and forty nights) with God on Mount Sinai, receiving the Ten Commandments. When he came down from the mountain, his face radiated the glory of God, such that everyone who saw him couldn’t look at him.</p>
<p>Moses had to wear a veil to shroud the glory that had rubbed off on him (Exodus 34:29-33). That’s the effect of deep contemplation and meditation on the Word. 2 Corinthians 3:18 says, “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>The Word of God is where the glory is, and the New Covenant is far more glorious. As you receive the Word, at your quiet time, devotion, or church services, the intensity of the glory in your life is increased; you’re enraptured, beautified, and enveloped by His glory.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="abraham-the-father-of-faith--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1682">ABRAHAM: THE FATHER OF FAITH ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~1682<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ABRAHAM: THE FATHER OF FAITH ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~1682" title="Direct link to ABRAHAM: THE FATHER OF FAITH ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~1682" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#abraham-the-father-of-faith--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1682">​</a></h2>
<p>Another great example of faith is Papa Abraham. God spoke to him one day and told him to get out of his father’s house and leave his kindred and country to a land that He would show him.</p>
<p>“Now the Lord had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will shew thee: And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing: And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. So Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran” (Genesis 12:1-4).</p>
<p>God didn’t tell Abraham where to go, yet the Bible says he launched out of his country, having no idea where he was going. He left by faith! “By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went” (Hebrews 11:8).</p>
<p>Abraham lived as a pilgrim throughout his life because he knew by revelation that the Promised Land God spoke of wasn’t a physical one but a spiritual one.</p>
<p>Also, when the Lord promised to give him a son in his old age, he believed. “He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God” (Romans 4:20). When God asked him to offer that son as a burnt sacrifice, he simply obeyed because he knew “that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead” (Hebrews 11:19).</p>
<p>That’s what faith is all about - responding swiftly to God’s instructions and doing everything He tells you. That’s how you can please God in your life. Abraham was called ‘the father of faith’ and ‘the friend of God’ because he lived by faith in God’s Word. This is the life to which we’ve been called as Christians – the faith life! Hallelujah.</p>

<p>Two important things I have to tell you about today&#x27;s meeting. The first is an instruction.</p>
<p>1: PRAYER
2: MIRACLE</p>
<p>A very important thing about prayer pointed out to us in the Bible,</p>
<p>Phil4:19</p>
<p>Prayer and supplication are in the same direction because you are asking for something. You have a request you are making, there is something you want God to do for you. A lot of people complain to God instead of praying. God did not say we should complain, He said we should pray.</p>
<p>What is your request???  Hope doesn&#x27;t change anything and condition. There is a difference between Faith and Hope, Faith changes your conditions but hope doesn&#x27;t. Hope is for the future, it is for tomorrow and as long as it is tomorrow it never changes. You got to change it today by faith. There are many people who have been hoping for a change and it never comes.</p>
<p>Declaration::
I HAVE FAITH AND MY FAITH IS WORKING.</p>
<p>Faith is for now, Hope is for tomorrow..</p>
<p>Faith takes a hold of the now and makes it yours, but this is not the point I want to make, its just by the way.</p>
<p>Col1:11-12</p>
<p>Jesus was the hope of the nations, the hope of Israel, the hope of salvation. In other words if man has to be saved, there has to be a sacrifice and Jesus was the perfect person for it.</p>
<p>God gave us the inheritance through Jesus Christ so we do not have to hope for anything again. Everything that God wanted to give to us has been given through Jesus Christ. Now we use faith to declare what we want, we don&#x27;t pray for it anymore.</p>
<p>Jesus is our ticket, He said use my Name, whatsoever you should ask the Father in my Name, He will do it. Use His Name. When you say you are qualified to get what you want from God, you will have it because once you use the Name of Jesus everything and nature starts responding to the Name .</p>
<p>3John1:2</p>
<p>God&#x27;s number one desire is for your to prosper.</p>
<p>Eph5:20</p>
<p>God understands the human nature more than anyone else, the human brain is divided into two sides, it has the left and right side. The left side controls the right side of the body, the right side controls the left side of the body.</p>
<p>The left side is what you use to analyze, calculate and plan. The right side is the one that spontaneously catches pictures, give answers. Most people uses mostly the left side that analyzes, calculates, that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t give accurate answers because they make use of the left side more. The right side, answers, it&#x27;s for creativity, Beauty. Most people hardly use the right side, why, because as you grow up the world makes you to analyze and reason like the world.</p>
<p>One of the best ways of activating the right side is giving thanks. Those who are full of thanksgiving always activates the right side of the brain. God knows that when you are full of thanks you will always have answers and won&#x27;t be defeated by anything, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p>Col3:17</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s understand the repeated instructions,</p>
<p>1Thess5:18</p>
<p>Giving thanks is the will of God concerning you not the situation.</p>
<p>Heb13:15
That&#x27;s one very important thing about prayer, when you have this attitude about prayer anything you want to happen will happen. Without that attitude, you will suffer.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTION FOR MIRACLE</p>
<p>2: MIRACLE</p>
<p>Mark9: 23</p>
<p>Now the word &#x27;&#x27;believe&#x27;&#x27; needs to be well understood, some versions put it like this, if you can &#x27;&#x27;TRUST&#x27;&#x27;.</p>
<p>Miracles don&#x27;t belong to the rational mind, as long as you have a rational mind you can&#x27;t have miracle, when it does happen they loose it. Miracle happens to a trusted mind. Miracles truly happen whenever one is prepared, I found out that God doesn&#x27;t plan to bless one person and leave the other. According to the Bible, God is a &#x27;NOW&#x27; God, He lives in the now. Don&#x27;t give yourself yo reasons give yourself to FAITH, how can you believe in God when you can&#x27;t touch or see Him. The only way you can touch God is through your faith. Think about it, everything about Jesus was a Miracle. Remember, He commanded His death with words. An average man will last 13 hrs on the cross before he dies, but Jesus com</p>

<p>In this gathering today, we have angels in numbers. Angels. The Bible shows us at much about angels... I&#x27;m talking about supernatural beings. Heavenly beings, sent to minister to us and for us. They do a lot. They&#x27;ll be working here. They&#x27;ve started.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll give you one important instruction about prayer that will help you and one miracle that will help you.</p>
<p>Very important thing about prayer pointed to us in the Bible... You&#x27;re so smart... I&#x27;m so smart because God made me smart.</p>
<p>Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God - Philippians 4:6 KJV.</p>
<p>Prater of supplication with thanksgiving. You&#x27;ve got a request for God to do for you. Request, don&#x27;t complain. What&#x27;s your request... Oh... What&#x27;s happening to... Can&#x27;t take this anymore...</p>
<p>What&#x27;s your request. You see that... The Bible told the man with problem for thirty eight years... Why do people suffer for that long? I wanted to know why people suffer that long even with hope... Hope is good but doesn&#x27;t change anything. Hope is future. Faith changes things.</p>
<p>Hope is always in front. As long as its tomorrow, it never comes. Faith is now. If the condition must change, it&#x27;s got to be now...</p>
<p>Are you still there... I have faith. It&#x27;s working. Faith is for now. Hope is for tomorrow. I hope my business will change. Faith makes it yours now.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not the point I want to make...</p>
<p>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light - Colossians 1:12 KJV.</p>
<p>Did you notice...</p>
<p>Jesus was the hope of Israel. The hope of salvation. He had to come for the sins of the world to be forgiven. Nothing else was good enough. Jesus was the hope of the nations... Remember what John the Baptist said... Behold the Son of God that takes away the sins of the world...</p>
<p>God raised Him up to give us the inheritance. There&#x27;s no need for hope now. Enjoy your inheritance. Everything is granted by Jesus Christ. There&#x27;s nothing for God to do that&#x27;s not already done in Christ Jesus. Use your faith and get them.</p>
<p>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light - Colossians 1:12 KJV.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s been done.</p>
<p>and giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light - Colossians 1:12 NIV.</p>
<p>Imagine if you needed ticket to come in here, with your ticket, you don&#x27;t need to beg anybody. Jesus is your ticket. He said use my name. His name is your ticket. Declare it... You&#x27;re a partaker. Everything responds to you. No struggling...</p>
<p>Life forward and upward always and only, use His name. You&#x27;re qualified to share in the inheritance.</p>
<p>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth - 3 John 1:2 KJV.</p>
<p>Oh boy... Look at it... It&#x27;s in the Bible...</p>
<p>Your spirit is enjoying and God also want you to prosper in every aspect of life... Glory hallelujah...</p>
<p>How can this be in the Bible and you pretend it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ll never be broke, poor or sick in life! No lack or disease. I&#x27;m qualified to share in the inheritance. Even if your parents didn&#x27;t give you an inheritance, Jesus did. It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore. The inheritance in Christ is more...</p>
<p>Giving thanks unto the Father...</p>
<p>Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Fat</p>

<p>“The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working]” (James 5:16b AMP).</p>
<p>The prayer of petition is earnest, heartfelt and continued. Some Christians don’t understand earnestness in prayer, so they miss the benefits of its impact. To be earnest means to be intent and specific in purpose; to be zealous and fervent; marked by a deep feeling of conviction.</p>
<p>Thus, an earnest prayeris specific in purpose, filledwith zeal and fervency, and marked by a deep feeling of conviction. It touches your heart and gets a hold of your emotions as you render it. Furthermore, it entails much persistence and continuance; that means you maintain your stance in a consistent manner and solemn attitude. This is the kind that makes tremendous power available; and such power is dynamic in its working; in other words, it works like dynamite.</p>

<p>Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name (Psalm 74:20-21).</p>
<p>Significantly, the Hebrew word translated “earth” above is “erets,” which also refers to a world or nation. The dark places of the earth or of the nations are places where actions of cruelty and wickedness: genocides, terrorism, wars etc., have found a breeding ground. They refer to injurious and malevolent lands and environments where vicious acts of wickedness are in manifest operation; places governed by agents of darkness and the principalities of evil.</p>
<p>What was God’s answer to the cries coming from these dark regions of the world? First, He sent His Word (Psalm 107:20), in the Person of Jesus. John 1:14 tells us that the Word became flesh, and dwelt amongst us. God’s solution was packaged in the man, Christ Jesus, who came as the Saviour of the world. However, after His crucifixion, burial and resurrection, He ascended to heaven; but not without commissioning us, the Church, to continue the work that He started. Isaiah 53:10 says, “he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.”</p>
<p>We’re the seed of Jesus Christ; His reproduction; and through us, the ministry that He started continues. He gave us the power of attorney to use His Name, and His Word to live by. Now, you ’re God’s light to the dark regions of the world today. When Jesus came, He said, “I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (John 8:12). Then in Matthew 5:14, He said concerning you and me, “Ye are the light of the world.”</p>
<p>The dark places of the earth might have been filled with the habitations of cruelty, but you’re the one to do something about it. You’re the light of the world; so don’t be quiet. Preach the Gospel; shine the light of God’s Word into the dark regions of the earth.</p>

<p>Hosea 4:6 says, “My people are destroyed for the lack of  knowledge” Many are oppressed and afflicted by the devil because  they lack the knowledge of God’s Word. This is the reason you must  take your study of God’s Word seriously. It will show you who you  really are and what belongs to you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>The truth is, the more of God’s Word you receive into your  spirit, the greater insight you’ll have into the life of God in you and  consequently function in. That life will become so real to you and  it’ll be impossible for sickness to dominate you.</p>
<p>Make up your mind not to have a casual relationship with God’s  Word. Go after it like you would go after a treasure; it will transform  your life and cause you to walk in the reality of eternal life! Hallelujah.</p>
<p>Confession:
I am born of God; my origin is in Him! No sickness has the power or ability to destroy my body! I have the overcoming life of God in me, and that makes me indestructible  and impregnable to disease and infirmity,  Hallelujah!</p>

<p>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28).</p>
<p>There’s no hopelessness for a child of God. It doesn’t matter what you’ve faced or are facing in your life; the challenges aren’t for your destruction. Not many know this; hence, they faint in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>We’re built for tough times. 2 Corinthians 4:17 says, “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.” Therefore, face tough times and win. The troubles you face are for your testimonies. In Isaiah 43:2, the Lord said, “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.” It makes no difference what comes against you; you’re more than a conqueror.</p>
<p>Perhaps, you’re in debt, and all your creditors are after you, and it looks like there’s no help in sight; don’t give up. God has a plan for your life. You’ll settle your creditors; keep your faith alive. Refuse to allow depressing thoughts. God is bigger—far bigger—than whatever amount you owe as debt.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve been handed an unpleasant doctor’s report; trust the Name of Jesus! Irrespective of the pain or symptoms, keep declaring, “I know I’m healed; my body is vitalized by the Holy Ghost who lives in me!” There’s someone living inside you that makes you indomitable; no matter what you face, you win.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 4:8-9 says, “We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed”; why? The answer is in the preceding verse 7: “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.” Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them, The LORD bless thee, and keep thee&quot; (Numbers 6:23-24).</p>
<p>As Christians, we&#x27;ve been called to a life of blessings; we&#x27;re to walk in blessings, speak and manifest blessings every day and everywhere. Imagine walking into your home, office, classroom, or board meeting, speaking blessings, for that&#x27;s our calling (1 Peter 3:9).</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like what the Lord said to Aaron and his sons, the priests. He commanded them to pronounce blessings on the children of Israel, even though the children of Israel were His own people. The Jews today are inarguably some of the most successful people in the world, because of their consciousness of the blessings of God. They teach their children, and their children&#x27;s children to speak blessings, and be conscious of blessings.</p>
<p>The blessings upon the Jews are, however, not as glorious as the blessings upon the Church---the new creation. Yet, because not many in the Church have been adequately taught how to bless and receive blessings, we haven&#x27;t seen much results in this regard. For example, when we say to someone, &quot;God bless you.&quot; To some people, it&#x27;s a mere religious platitude that doesn&#x27;t mean much. However, to the spiritually enlightened, it&#x27;s an invocation of something supernatural.</p>
<p>Why would God instruct Aaron and his sons to  bless the children of Israel, who were already a blessed people? It&#x27;s because the pronouncement of blessings activates the power for the blessings to work. He told the priests what to say in pronouncing blessings on the people; it&#x27;s in Numbers 6:24-27; study and meditate on it. Even today, they still speak those words of blessings. Now you understand why anything they do prospers.</p>
<p>In your life, be blessings conscious. When you&#x27;re in Church, for example, and the minister of God stretches forth his hands or pronounces blessings, receive with your spirit. Blessings flow through our hands and from our words. The words of blessings spoken into your life have power; they actually guide your life and lead you in the path that God wants you to go.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elijahs-prayer-of-petition--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1709">Elijah’s Prayer Of Petition ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.~1709<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Elijah’s Prayer Of Petition ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.~1709" title="Direct link to Elijah’s Prayer Of Petition ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.~1709" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#elijahs-prayer-of-petition--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1709">​</a></h2>
<p>Elijah is an exemplary Bible character who made petitions to God in prayer and got results. And the Bible says that he “was a man subject to like passions as we are” (James 5:17). He was like you and me, though not absolutely in the spiritual sense, because he didn’t have the inherent divine nature we possess in Christ. But he was like us in the sense that the natural conditions of his time were very much like ours today. He faced the same kind of pressures we face today and had feelings, affections and a constitution as ours. Yet he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it didn’t rain on earth for three-and-a-half years! He prayed again and the heavens gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
<p>“Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit” (James 5:17-18).</p>
<p>When you read this story from the account in 1 Kings 17 alone, you may not get the exact picture of how events transpired. Here’s what that passage says:
“Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab, As the Lord God of Israel liveth, before whomI stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word”(1 Kings 17:1).</p>
<p>This gives us the impression that Elijah just approached King Ahab one day and told him, “There would be no dew or rain on the land for three-and-a-half years, but according to my word” and stormed out of his palace. It would seem that he spoke a word of faith and that was it. Well, it’s true Elijah spoke in faith, but James’ account in the New Testament shows us there was something behind the word of faith he spoke.</p>
<p>“Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months” (James 5:17).</p>
<p>Ever before Elijah went to Ahab to make his pronouncement, he had already spoken to God in his closet. This is something we must learn to do before making a public proclamation of our faith. If God is going to hear a man in public, He must have heard him first in private. Put differently, before a public proclamation of faith, there must first be a private dealing with the Lord. This is so vital; but sadly, many Christians don’t know it. Here, we see that Elijah made a bold declaration of faith that shook the king and the entire nation of Israel but he had prayed earnestly.</p>
<p>In his account, James doesn’t tell us about Elijah’s public proclamation, but he does let us know he prayed earnestly that it shouldn’t rain. God heard him and there was no rain for three-and-a-half years. Then he prayed earnestly again that the rains should fall, and God heard him and granted his request.</p>
<p>“And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth” (1 Kings 18:1).</p>
<p>Looking at this portion in isolation, one could easily assume that Elijah was somewhere just having a nice time when God said, “Hey Elijah, I want to send rain! Go show yourself to Ahab and tell him it’s going to rain.”</p>
<p>But James makes us understand that Elijah had prayed that there should be rain. 1 Kings 18:1 was God’s response to Elijah’s prayer. Now, since God had already said, “I will send rain,” you’d suppose that as soon as Elijah showed himself to Ahab, the rain would start falling. It didn’t turn out that way! Hallelujah.</p>

<p>Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing (Ezekiel 47:12 NIV).</p>
<p>Did you notice something amazing in our opening verse? It talks about the water coming from the sanctuary, and it says because the water flowing to the trees is coming from the sanctuary, their leaves won’t wither and their fruit won’t fail. The trees would bear fruit every month, and their fruit would serve for food, and their leaves for healing.</p>
<p>This is extraordinary, because it’s about us: we’re the temple of the Holy Ghost; we’re God’s sanctuary: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?” (1 Corinthians 3:16). With the Holy Ghost in you, you’re a living sanctuary unto God. In John 7:37-38, the Lord Jesus said, &quot;If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.&quot;</p>
<p>He said out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water. How can these rivers flow out of your belly? It’s because you have drunk of the Holy Ghost! The day you received the Holy Spirit, you drank of Him; you drank of the Spirit of life. Remember, He’s the life-giver; so, today, when you speak, life comes out of you. The rivers of living water come out of you in words—words of life. Jesus said, “the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life” (John 6:63).</p>
<p>The words that we speak, having drunk of the Holy Ghost, are spirit and life. They issue from the sanctuary—our recreated human spirit—where God dwells, and everything the waters touch, comes to life! Any dead thing in its path receives life. No wonder we’re called life-givers, for we’re born of the life-giving Spirit.</p>

<p>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11).</p>
<p>Isaiah 53:5 says, “But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.” This is one of the scriptures that many Christians use all around the world, to claim healing. In reality, however, the Prophet Isaiah was here talking to the Jews and not to Christians. He gives them a preview of the grace of the coming Messiah, and tells them, “with his stripes we are healed.”</p>
<p>Then the Apostle Peter, in his epistle, looks back at the Cross, and says “by whose stripes ye were healed” (1 Peter 2:24). But he was talking to the Jews. He wasn’t talking to every Christian. The Jews were the ones under the covenant; the covenant of healing was for the Jewish Church, the Old Testament Church. They were the ones healed by His stripes.</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ that was born after His resurrection, in the real sense, doesn’t require healing from God. The Church has a self-healing mechanism. What the Church received is eternal life; eternal life doesn’t need healing. Eternal life is the God-life, the very essence of divinity; life that is “uninfectable,” untainted with sickness, disease and infirmities. If you have eternal life, it doesn’t matter what trouble you may have in your body, if you’d stir up the gift of God—the life of God in your spirit—your whole body will be vitalized.</p>
<p>Our opening text says, “If the spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead lives in you, He’ll vitalize your mortal body. The Spirit in you is life-generating. The Bible says the first man, Adam, was made a living soul, the second Adam was made a life giving Spirit (1 Corinthians 15:45). We’re not born after the first Adam; we’re born after the second Adam, Jesus Christ. Jesus never needed healing; and as He is, so are we in this world.</p>
<p>You have a life-giving Spirit resident in you. You were given a life that’s greater than healing. As long as you’re a babe in Christ, you’ll need healing. The Bible calls healing the children’s bread. When you come to maturity, you’ll give up childish things. You won’t be seeking healing. Rather, you’d say, “I’ve got the life of God in me; therefore, I’ll never be sick.” And if you’re used to getting sick, say, “I’ll never be sick again, because I have the life of Christ in me.” Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage (Galatians 5:1).</p>
<p>In the concept of nationhood as it is in the world, the fundamental human rights of the individual citizen is a much celebrated ideology. Citizens are required to know their fundamental human rights so they can take advantage of such rights and privileges. These are rights and freedoms to which all humans are entitled.</p>
<p>Such entitlements can exist as shared norms of actual human moralities, as justified moral norms or natural rights supported by strong reasons, or as legal rights either at a national level or within international law. However, as important as it may be for you to know your fundamental human rights and pursue them, there’s something far superior and more worthy for you to pursue and take advantage of, and that’s your “fundamental divine rights.”</p>
<p>If you’re born again then you automatically belong in God’s country called Zion, with divine rights and privileges: “But ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem” (Hebrews 12:22-24). So, look beyond your natural human rights to the glorious heavenly blessings, rights and privileges of those who are born into God’ Kingdom! Just as it’s wrong for your fundamental human rights to be violated, God doesn’t want anything or anyone to violate your divine rights, such as the right to live in health, prosperity, victory, success, dominion and excellence; the right to reign and rule over the circumstances of life and exercise dominion over satan and the powers of darkness.</p>
<p>To best explore and take advantage of your fundamental divine rights, privileges and inheritance in Christ, you’d have to study God’s Word, for that’s our heavenly bill of rights and manual for daily living. In it, you’d discover who you are, what you have, and what you can do in Christ. You don’t need to beg God, or pray till hell freezes over to begin enjoying these rights and other blessings in Christ Jesus, they are yours NOW; they’re your present hour-possessions. So lay claim to them and begin to enjoy them.</p>

<p>Some people don’t bother praying, because even when they do, they don’t expect answers. If you don’t have a relationship with God through Jesus Christ, that is, you’re not born again, you shouldn’t expect answers because He wouldn’t even hear you. However, if you’re God’s child, you have a right to expect answers when you pray; but to have those answers consistently, you must pray according to God’s Word revealed concerning prayer in the New Testament.</p>
<p>God invites us to pray; He’s not troubled with our prayers. Some people think they shouldn’t bother God with their prayers because He already has a lot of problems to solve. They figure that with so many people calling on God at the same time, He might just get confused, and so in order not to compound His problems they decide not to pray to Him. Don’t think that way about God. He’s not confused by our prayers. Don’t wonder how He hears when so many people pray to Him at the same time. Remember He is God! Nothing is impossible with Him.</p>
<p>When you pray, God listens because you’re His child, and you pray according to His will. Whilst listening to you, He doesn’t consider your prayer with respect to another person’s. He doesn’t hold something back from you just because another person has asked for the same thing you asked for. He relates with you on a personal level.</p>
<p>God doesn’t prefer one of His kids above another; He relates with you as though you’re the only one in the whole wide world. Did it ever occur to you that if you were the only person in the whole earth Jesus would still have come to die for you? That should let you know just how personal God is with you. He said, “ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full” (John 16:24). This is God’s Word to you: If you ask Him, you shall receive!</p>
<p>People get a lot of encouragement to pray, but a lot of times they don’t know how to. It’s one thing to tell someone to pray and to pray hard, but it’s another thing to let them know how to pray in such a way they can have the desired results and make the necessary impact. Hallelujah</p>

<p>And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD (Isaiah 11:2).</p>
<p>Our opening scripture tells us about the seven Spirits of God – the seven independent manifestations of the Spirit of God, and one of them is the Spirit of wisdom.</p>
<p>Incidentally, that’s the one many Christians aren’t quite acquainted with. Some, like Samson, only experience the manifestation of the Spirit of might, but lack wisdom. So, when things aren’t working right for them, they ask “why?” Its because they ignored the Spirit of wisdom.</p>
<p>But thanks be unto God, Christ has been made unto us wisdom (1 Corinthians 1:30), so you shouldn’t lack wisdom. What you need to do today is acknowledge that you have the wisdom of God functioning in you.</p>
<p>The Bible says “That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus” (Philemon 1:6). Christ has brought the Spirit of wisdom into your life; therefore every day, declare that you have wisdom!</p>
<p>Every once in a while, as you go about your endeavours, say ‘The wisdom of God is in my heart and in my mouth, therefore my choices, actions and words are in sync with God’s plan for my life today!”</p>
<p>When you acknowledge wisdom, wisdom will promote you and change everything about you. You’ll have divine insight into mysteries and secrets, and be able to deal circumspectly in the affairs of life, knowing the right steps to take in everything you do.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:7-8 says the Lord has gloriously lavished on us grace together with all wisdom. Often times we hear people say, “God’s grace did this and that for me,” in the same way, we ought to also be quick to acknowledge the work of wisdom in our lives. When you do, the Spirit of wisdom will promote you and bring more beauty into your life.</p>

<p>And it came to pass on a certain day, as He was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the Law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and
Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them (Luke 5:17).</p>
<p>Our text shows that on a certain day, as the Lord Jesus taught the Word, the power of the Lord was present to heal. There was healing virtue in the room. The Holy Spirit was present with healing power. Remember, until Jesus received the Holy Spirit, He didn’t perform any healing miracle. This is because, divine healing is the work of the Holy Spirit, and until He came upon Jesus, the healing ministry would not begin.</p>
<p>According to the Scriptures, many people saw Jesus, heard Him teach, felt His touch, and compassion, and received healings and other miracles. Today, the very power that made Jesus Christ the Healer; the same Spirit that anointed and brought the healing virtue to Jesus, has come to live in us. Now, your body has become the House of the Holy Spirit. Your body is His living Tabernacle. Therefore, no sickness or infirmity should be housed in your body; refuse to accommodate disease.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter by what name that sickness goes; it could be a growth that seems to be getting larger, don’t bow to it; don’t cave in to it! Put your hand over it and keep saying, “I refuse to accommodate sickness in my body. I command this growth to die and pass out of my body”. Refuse to fear. Christ paid the price for your health. In Revelation 5:10, the Bible says “And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.” So, don’t bow to sickness or disease; exercise dominion. Speak the Word and effect a change.</p>
<p>There’s a definite act required for salvation; it’s the confession of the Lordship of Jesus. You can do so right away by praying the prayer below:</p>
<p>O Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God. I believe He died for me, and God raised Him from the dead. I believe He is alive today. I confess with my mouth that, Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day. Through Him and in His Name, I have Eternal Life; I am born again. Thank You Lord, for saving my soul! I am now a Child of God. I now have Christ dwelling in me, and greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4)! I now walk in the consciousness of my new Life in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!
CONGRATULATIONS! You are now born into the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>PRAYER:
Dear Father, I disallow sickness, poverty, and defeat in my life, and in the lives of my loved ones; and I unleash the forces of health, prosperity, and victory in my life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things? (Romans 8:32).</p>
<p>If you work for a thriving corporation, it may increase your wages regularly, give you lots of fringe benefits with certain allowances – a large house, a chauffeur-driven car, summer holidays abroad, scholarships for your children, free medical care, etc. But all these things don’t compare with what the Lord gives. He is the “greatest blesser.” He daily loads us with blessings – benefits “Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation, Selah” (Psalm 68:19).</p>
<p>Think about it: If a firm could give all such wonderful benefits to those in its employ, imagine then what God would give you for working for Him! God’s blessings upon your life, unlike what that multinational corporation you work for may give you, aren’t temporary; they are permanent and irrevocable “For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance” (Romans 11:29). He doesn’t take back what He gives you.</p>
<p>Your employers may give you all the nice things but they can one day decide to retire you. There is, however no retirement in God nor is there a pension scheme. Nobody is on pension in God’s Kingdom. The more you work for the Lord and with the Lord in His “business” of reaching the lost with the Gospel, the more He honours you for doing it. There’s no man or group on earth that can bless you the way God has already blessed you, and can bless you. Continue to serve Him diligently and He’ll reward your faith and faithfulness.</p>

<p>The Bible described Elijah’s prayer as an earnest, heartfelt and “continued” prayer. There was persistence in his petition.</p>
<p>Many battles are lost because we stop too soon, instead of continuing in prayer. Many times we wait until pressures mount against us before we start praying. But at such times we end up pushing the panic-buttons; we start praying fast because we want fast answers. Since we live in an age where everything happens fast, we allow the jet-age syndrome sap the vitality that our prayers should convey. We have fast food, fast cars, fast airplanes, fast computers…everything moves fast, and we want God to move at our pace. We just want to push some buttons and expect a quick response; but it doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p>Elijah knew better. He cast himself down upon the earth, put his head between his knees and prayed earnestly, with deeply involved emotions, continuing until there was a change (1 Kings 18:42). But unlike
Elijah, some Christians today aren’t willing to sacrifice the time and labour required in the prayer of petition.</p>
<p>If you’re a student, you can’t continue in prayer when the exam starts tomorrow morning. You knew the date for the exam; you had the time to pray and prepare. Now it’s the night before, and you’re suddenly
awakened to prayer.</p>
<p>Think of a man whose wife has complications in labour. She’s about to be taken into the intensive care unit. The man is frantically looking for prayer warriors now to join himin “emergency prayers.” As she’s being wheeled into the surgery room, the man is also running into God’s emergency ward! He wants answers right now, but he had nine months to pray!</p>
<p>This is the problemwith many in the Church today. It appears that the learning of faith has caused many to drift away fromthe essentials of effective prayer. So now they aren’t as willing to linger in (tarry in) prayer as they should. But to live an all-round victorious life in Christ, you must become spiritually adroit in both areas. Plus your faith, you must have the willingness and tenacity to continue in prayer until you have a note of victory in your spirit.</p>

<p>For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man (Ephesians 3:14-16).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul had such a beautiful and powerful understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Consider His prayer in our theme scripture; notice that he wasn’t praying for himself, but for the church at Ephesus, that they be strengthened with might in their inner man by the Holy Spirit. He prayed thus for them because he knew that’s the level in which the Christian ought to function. He was already functioning at that level; recall in Philippians 4:13, he said, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.”</p>
<p>Have you come to know Him as your strength? Have you recognised Him as the strength of your life? David said in Psalm 27:1, “the Lord is the strength of my life” As your strength, you have nothing to fear; no impossibilities; no limitations; you triumph always, in every situation. Affirm always that the Lord is your strength; that’s the language of the spiritually mature. Don’t ask God for strength; affirm He’s your strength. Declare, “I’ve been invigorated with might for every task. I can do all things through Christ who is my strength.”</p>
<p>Yes, before you received the Gospel, you may have been weak and timid, giving up easily and unable to face challenges. But thanks be unto God! The Bible says, “For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly” (Romans 5:6). Now, you’re turned on from within, by His divine power! You’re bold and courageous; audacious in faith. The Bible says God has given us the spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7); that has become your song. You can do anything without fear. Even now, affirm that you’ll do bigger things for the Lord, according to His power, which works in you mightily.</p>

<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1)</p>
<p>One of the extraordinary ways the Lord manifests Himself is in and through the Word. The Word of God created the universe. The Word of God is life. The Word of God is power. The Word of God is light. The Word of God is truth. The Word of God is God. Where the Word of God is, God is!</p>
<p>The Word of God isn’t like the word of a man. Centering your mind on the Word is centering your mind on God. The Bible says He keeps in perfect peace—peace of prosperity—the one whose mind is stayed on Him (Isaiah 26:3). The way to stay your mind on Him is meditating on the Word.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit never does anything without the Word. For example, in Genesis chapter one, we read that in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. But the earth was without form and was empty and covered with darkness. Then the Spirit of God moved over the face of the waters, but nothing changed. The earth was still a chaotic mass until God said, “Let there be light” and light became. The Spirit of God caused the light to manifest. He acted on the Word. Until the Word is given, the Spirit does nothing.</p>
<p>Don’t ignore the Word; some Christians ignore the Word, and that’s so unwise. What you need for your next level or that miracle and promotion you so desire; what you need to prevail in any crisis and live victoriously every day, is the Word.</p>
<p>When you face challenges, when things get tough and rough, keep your confidence in the Word. Refuse to compromise. Get radical with your faith-affirmation and confession of the Word. As you speak, the Spirit will cause things to happen in accordance with your words, because the Word of God in your mouth is God talking! It’ll always prevail. Glory to God!</p>

<p>“Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works” (Titus 2:14).</p>
<p>A Christian is a peculiar person who is always eager to do good works. He doesn’t try or struggle to do good because doing good is his nature. An unbeliever or non-Christian has a different nature as the Bible says (John 8:44).</p>
<p>You see, a man can only be like his father. As a Christian, your Father is the great God of glory, the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ. He’s good and His works are good (Psalm 119:68), and you’re just like Him for you’re His child. Jesus said, “The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do” (John 5:19) and in Acts 10:38, the Bible says, “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”</p>
<p>Now the Bible says, “For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us” (Ephesians 2:10 AMP). When God recreated you in Christ Jesus, He formed you for good works and called you to live the good life which He pre-arranged for you. Now you can heal the sick, save the lost, and bless the world because you have the nature of your Father in you.</p>
<p>Make up your mind to display the glorious nature of your heavenly Father to everyone you meet today. God has ordained you to bless your world and as Christ’s representative in the world today, you should go about doing good for that’s what you were born to do.</p>

<p>Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name (Malachi 3:16).</p>
<p>God is detailed and meticulous about records. He’s got several books in heaven (Revelation 20:12) and He records all our works here on earth. Some of those books will be opened on the day of judgment. (Daniel 7:10), but there’s one which is opened from time to time, that’s His book of remembrance.</p>
<p>In the opening Scripture, we read that those who feared the Lord, and thought upon His Name and spoke about Him often, had a book of remembrance written for them in the presence of God. In other words, these people meditated upon His Name and because their minds were full of God’s thoughts, they spoke the right words frequently one to another. They made the right confessions of faith in His Name; as they did that in the earth, the Lord hearkened and heard it. Consequently, their names were entered into His book of remembrance.</p>
<p>Periodically, when that book is opened, all their confessions are released unto them! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>So while, you’re there in your closet speaking forth the Word of God in faith, it may seem like nothing is changing, but don’t stop, for it’s being recorded in God’s book of remembrance. In the course of time, that book will be opened and the rain of blessings you’ve been expecting will come pouring down all at once. Keep talking the Word and filling up your pages of that book with your faith-declarations. Ecclesiastes 11:3 says, “if the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth.” Your faith-filled confessions will surely produce for you, a harvest of blessings at the appointed time.</p>

<p>Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy path (Psalms 25:4).</p>
<p>Many were brought up under a system where out of ignorance, God was portrayed as a despot and a destroyer. They were taught in school that the earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, coronavirus, tsunamis, and famines that have ravaged lives, cities, and even nations are “the acts of God.” But those are not the acts of God. The Bible says “Every good and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning” (James 1:17). This simply lets us know that whatever is not good and helpful couldn’t be from God, for He’s a good God, and His gifts and acts are good all the time.</p>
<p>Sweet water and bitter water don’t flow from the same fountain (James 3:11). Therefore God, who is goodness personified, cannot be responsible for the sufferings, destructions, and disasters that take place in the world. The Bible shows us that the real destroyer is satan. He’s the evil one responsible for the terrible disasters and catastrophes that steal people’s health, joy, money or peace.</p>
<p>But thanks be unto God, the world is not at the mercy of satan and his filthy acts of destruction! God has given us the power to subdue, tame, and forbid satan from carrying out his maneuvering and manipulative acts of wickedness around us: “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you” (Luke 10:19). Observe that it’s God who gave us, His children power over all the works of the enemy. Hence, He couldn’t possibly be the one responsible for the works He gave us power to forestall.</p>
<p>Acts 10:38 lets us in on the kind of works or acts that can be ascribed to God: “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.” The devil is the one responsible for the evil and oppression in the world today; they’re his works. But the Bible says in 1 John 3:8: “For this purpose, the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”</p>
<p>Every time you hear, see or read about a supernatural intervention in human affairs that defies conventional or natural sequence, resulting in the preservation of life and the general good of humanity, that is a miracle, and that is an act of God. God loves people and it’s His pleasure to see them healthy, prosperous and normal. You can trust Him even now to bring His unlimited power to bear on your situation for you to receive a miracle.</p>

<p>Through prayers we can prevail on circumstances. God has shown us in His Word that we can change anything, including things that were divinely destined to be. This may sound incredible to you but it’s in the Bible! God may have said you’re going to have it one way, but if you discover you don’t want it that way, you can change it. It’s amazing, but it’s true. The only reasons something can happen to you as God said it would are when:</p>
<p>I. You want it to happen
II. You don’t know it’s going to happen
III. You know it’s going to happen, but you don’t know what to do to change it
IV. You don’t do what you should do, even though you know it’s going to happen.</p>
<p>God doesn’t run our lives the way we think He does. Whenever He wants to do something nobody can change, nobody gets to know about it until it’s done. Moses said the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children, but the things that are not revealed belong to God (Deuteronomy 29:29). So when He doesn’t want any human influence on it, and when there can be no human influence on it, He doesn’t reveal it! But if He reveals it to you, He is telling you if you want to change it, you can! And you can only change it when you pray, and pray the right way!</p>
<p>There are several accounts in the Scriptures of men who changed the mind of God from what He had determined to do. One of such accounts is in (Exodus 32:7-14) where we read of how Moses stood between God and the children of Israel. God had determined to destroy them for their rebellion and stubbornness and raise a new generation from Moses, but Moses prevailed on God and prevented Him from doing as He had purposed.</p>
<p>We see another instance in 2 Kings 20 where one man changed the course of an event that had been divinely ordered of God. King Hezekiah had been sick to the point of death, and one day, the prophet Isaiah walked into his room and declared, “Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live” (2 Kings 20:1).</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly the Word and mind of God concerning Hezekiah’s situation. He was doomed to die by none other than God Himself, and there seemed to be no way out. But in the next verse, we read that “he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the Lord” (2 Kings 20:2).</p>
<p>King Hezekiah pleaded his case with God and the Bible says, “And it came to pass afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the Lord came to him, saying, Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord. And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David&#x27;s sake. And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered” (2 Kings 20:4-7). Talk about changing a hopeless situation!</p>

<p>For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming (2 Thessalonians 2:7-8).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul in our opening scripture talks about the second coming of Christ, and shows us that we’re the restraining force against evil in our day. The only reason satan has not led the world to man’s total annihilation is because of the resistance put forth by the body of Christ – the Church (1 Corinthians 12:27). Our presence in the earth preserves it, and forbids satan from unleashing terror upon it.</p>
<p>But someone might say, “There’s so much evil and terror in the world already.” Well, that should let you know how much worse it could have been but for our being here! We’re the ones preserving the earth (Matthew 5:13) and limiting the power of the evil one.</p>
<p>Man, on his own, is capable and wicked enough to destroy himself: “For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, and evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: All these evil things come form within” (Mark 7:21-23). But the prayers of the saints have prevented satan in our day and in days gone by from holding sway over men’s lives. For example, when the death angel came into Egypt, he needed a sign (blood marks on the lintel and doorposts) of the children of Israel to restrain him from destroying God’s people.</p>
<p>Same way, you’re that preventative power against evil today in your home, in your family and amongst your loved ones! The fact that you belong to Christ means His blood is marked on you, and His Name is named upon you! Therefore, when the evil one comes, he passes over you and those of your household. Your presence in a place prevents the devil from dominating and wielding wicked influence over the lives of men and women in the place, because you represent the Body of Christ there.</p>
<p>Understand that you’re the reason there’s a check on the works of darkness in your world, such than men’s lives are preserved and influenced with the Gospel. That’s why you shouldn’t take prayer lightly, especially praying in the Holy Spirit. It dispels the works of darkness and puts to flight the devil and his cohorts. As you speak in other tongues, satan and his demons are perplexed and frustrated, and their evil works vanquished!</p>

<p>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you (Luke 10:19).</p>
<p>Someone once asked me if it was possible for satan to place a hindrance on the path of someone who’s born again and filled with the Holy Spirit. Emphatically yes, but that doesn’t mean anything! As a matter of fact, the easiest challenge to handle as a Christian is that which is masterminded by satan.</p>
<p>In 1Thessalonians 2:18, Paul revealed how he and his team encountered hindrance from satan: “Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again: but Satan hindered us.” Now, Paul was full of the Holy Ghost, and had the Word of God dwelling in him richly, and he discerned that it wasn’t just some natural form of hindrance, but one caused by satan. But that didn’t in any way impact negatively on his ministry. He still did all that God called him to do and fulfilled his God-given destiny.</p>
<p>Understand that the more effective you are for the Lord and in your faith-walk, the more satan seeks to stir adversities against you. But you need not worry about him; he not a factor at all! He and demons are intelligent beings, and they understand and respond to spiritual authority. When you come against them in the Name of Jesus, they’ve got no option but to flee. So, you can blaze through every opposition; not only are you protected from the assault of the enemy, you have the power to cast him out.</p>
<p>Jesus made it clear that we would face tribulations, but He assures us of victory all the way (John 16:33). So it makes no difference the hindrances or obstacles satan tries to place on your path, you’re to blaze through them and walk in victory.</p>
<p>Satan knows you have authority over him; he’s aware Jesus has given you all authority: “Behold I have given you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions, and [physical and mental strength and ability] over all the power that the enemy [possesses]; and nothing shall in any way harm you” (Luke 10:19AMP). As long as you know the power you wield in the spirit and use it boldly, giving no place to fear, you’ll always be victorious in life and nothing can hinder you!</p>

<p>For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts But we have this treasure in earthen vessels (2 Corinthians 4:6-7).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, through the wisdom of the Spirit describes for us in our opening verse something phenomenal about God: He commanded light to shine out of darkness. It’s a known fact that light and darkness aren’t compatible, so how then could light possibly come out of darkness? Well, the Bible tells us that the things which are impossible with men, are possible with God (Luke 18:27). Remember, the earth was a chaotic mass that was enveloped in complete darkness (Genesis 1:2). But at His command, God brought order to the maddening chaos and light leapt out of the looming darkness.</p>
<p>Now, here’s an amazing thought: this same God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, according to the latter part of our opening scripture, has Himself shone in our hearts! This means he brought within us the same ability to cause light to shine out of any dark situation. So as a Christian, the power to cause something good to come out of a negative situation resides in you. Thus, if for example, you’ve been diagnosed with a debilitating ailment, that ailment or disease, as it were, is the darkness, and you can bring out light – divine healing – out of that situation.</p>
<p>No matter what darkness may be facing you today, you can command light to come out of it. If it’s sickness or pain in the body of a loved one, place your hand on the part of their body where the sickness is and call forth healing. If it’s with your finances, call forth prosperity! God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shone in your heart, making impossibilities possible. Can you see why you cannot be disadvantaged? Right in the midst of the seeming impossibilities are your opportunities to excel.</p>
<p>No wonder He says in 2 Corinthians 4:7 “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels” There’s a treasure in you; it’s a treasure of power, love, light and divine perfection. God has shone in our hearts and given us the ability to bring light out of darkness. Therefore, make a change in your situation today. There’s no problem too hard that you can’t solve, no situation is too hopeless that you can’t change.</p>

<p>He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him (Ecclesiastes 10:8).</p>
<p>Every child of God has a spiritual force-field around him; it’s a hedge of protection that repels the enemy. Did you ever read about Job in the Bible? Satan had tried unsuccessfully to attack the man, and so he asked God, “Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side?” (Job 1:10).</p>
<p>Even satan acknowledged that there was a hedge of protection round about Job and everything he had, until Job unfortunately breached it through his wrong confessions as revealed in (Job 3:23-26): “Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters. For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me. I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.”</p>
<p>Here was a man who even satan acknowledged was hedged and divinely protected by God, yet he said “I was not in safety.” Little wonder he suffered terribly and lost everything he had to satan; He broke the hedge of protection placed around him by God through his negative confession. How important it is for us to keep speaking forth faith-filled words and not fear! Negative confessions breach the hedge of protection God has placed around you.</p>
<p>No child of God ought to experience sudden calamities or be overtaken by dire misfortunes; because there’s a hedge of protection around everyone one of us. No matter how the enemy tries to come at you, the Spirit of God will erect a repellent barrier against him: “When the enemy shall come in, like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him {and} put him to flight [for He will come like a rushing stream which the breath of the Lord drives]” (Isaiah 59:19 AMP). But guess what? He does it through you, for He functions and carries out His ministry in the earth through His kids.</p>
<p>So it’s your responsibility to fortify the hedge of protection placed around you by God and extend its perimeter. How? By talking right, and then also by praying in tongues! When you feel the pressures of life coming at you; maybe at your job, business, academics or in any area of your life, that’s not the time to cry, cower or talk fear! Instead, pray fervently in other tongues and talk your faith up until the power of God inundates your whole being and saturates the environment. As you do this often, the spiritual force-field around you gets wider and wider, repelling the enemy farther and farther.</p>

<p>My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings (Proverbs 4:20).</p>
<p>The world today is experiencing tougher times and greater challenges as the end of all things draws nearer (1 Peter 4:7). The economies of many nations are either in recession or at the brink of it. Businesses are collapsing, and life is more difficult today for many than it used to be. However, as one who’s born again, your focus must be on the Lord and His eternal Word. Refuse to be anxious about anything (Philippians 4:6). You must always remember that though you’re in the world, you’re not of the world; you’re from another kingdom—God’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus already said, “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33). The problems in the world aren’t set against you. When you face trials and tribulations, do so with the mindset of a victor—the mindset of one who knows he already has the advantage; and the Word of God is that advantage. The Word of God has the ability to take you through any situation unscathed.</p>
<p>What God requires of you is that you give yourself completely to the Word. Be confident in the integrity of God’s Word. Isaiah 43:2 says, “When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.” Have this consciousness.</p>
<p>In the midst of the trouble, affirm like David, “The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want; He makes me lie down in green pastures” (Psalm 23:1-2). Declare like Paul, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13). Exclaim like John, “Greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world” (1 John 4:4).</p>
<p>Refuse to allow circumstances to condition or constrain you to speak lack, defeat, weakness, or fear. Affirm with gusto, “I’ll never be a failure; I’ll never be broke; I’m born to reign and rule in life!” You’re not being boastful or being braggadocious when you talk that way, you’re simply vocalizing your faith and confidence in the Word. You’re affirming the reality about you on the basis of God’s Word. Make the Word of God your focus and you’ll always be a success.</p>

<p>“To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:&quot; (Ecclesiastes 3:1) &quot;But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work” (John 5:17).</p>
<p>Jesus was time conscious, He said, “I must be about my Father’s business” (Luke 2:49). He knew when to step out and pray for the sick. As a matter of fact every precious time our Lord Jesus used on earth was edifying; result oriented, fruitful,
inspiring and life changing. Some people never keep to time; they’re always late for everything. Some have calculated their time to miss the praise, worship and prayer sessions in church. That’s a mistake; every service is different, it’s divinely prepared for you every week. The worship and prayer sessions have an entirely different ministration which you can’t replace. This is your opportunity for service to God. When you worship Him, He inhabits your praise and fills you with His glory. He would perfect that which concerns you.</p>
<p>Your time is precious; as a fact your time is not yours alone. What you do with it this year, this month, today and this hour, will receive God’s blessings. He made your time fruitful; He’s anointed your efforts. He’s even made your time for thinking productive. God rewards your every effort; whether spiritual or a visitation, your hobby, job or family. God puts quality and reward to whatever you set your heart to do. So don’t waste your gift, everything worth doing requires rewarding time. Don’t let people waste your time. If they have nothing to do and want to spend it with you, make it worthwhile. You’re accountable for your time; you can accomplish a lot in a few minutes or hours. Jesus spent a great deal of His time praying, teaching and healing the sick. His time was productive. The virtuous woman, the Bible says, her price is far above rubies. She manages her time with integrity and wisdom (Proverbs 31:10-28). You can do the same.</p>

<p>When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee (Isaiah 43:2).</p>
<p>Exodus 13:21 gives an interesting account of how God cared for the children of Israel in the wilderness shortly after they came out of Egypt: “And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night” If you’re familiar with the desert or wilderness you’d know it’s such a terrible place, not conducive to human habitation. At night, it’s extremely cold, and in the day it’s extremely hot. This was the kind of weather situation the children of Israel found themselves.</p>
<p>To be under such a harsh weather condition for the number of years they wandered through the wilderness could have meant death for them all. But the Lord was with them, and gave them His own atmosphere. He shielded them as a cloud in the day time, overshadowing them from the scorching heat. Then at night, He was to them a pillar of fire, protecting them against the extreme cold. So the children of Israel traveled with their “own atmosphere” it was the presence of the Holy Spirit!</p>
<p>It you’re born again, you carry this glorious presence of the Spirit in and around you (John 14:17); It’s the blessing of the new creation. You carry your own atmosphere of the miraculous! It therefore doesn’t matter where you might find yourself or what happens around you, that ‘divine’ atmosphere shields and protects you against the harsh conditions and negative circumstances of life. No wonder Jesus described us-believers-as indestructible when He said in Luke 10:19 “and nothing shall by any means hurt you”</p>
<p>You’re divinely shielded and immune from everything that hurts, binds or destroys. Everyone around you may have an infection due to the outbreak of an epidemic, but not you. There’s something about you, in you, and around you that makes you more than a conqueror! There’s something that creates an atmosphere of health and victory around you; it’s the indwelling and abiding presence of the Holy Spirit. So refuse to fear. You’re shielded from harm, evil and destruction. The Bible says “A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.” (Psalms 91:7).</p>

<p>&quot;And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch&quot; (Acts 11:26).</p>
<p>To be a Christian is more than attending church services on Sundays or being a member of a local church. When you say you’re a Christian, understand that you’re not identifying with a religion, because Christianity is not a religion! Rather, you’re
declaring the lordship of the Lord Jesus Christ over your life.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit admonishes us in Hebrews 10:25: “Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.” This isn’t a suggestion but an instruction. There are folks who would rather be present at social, family, or business functions at the expense of their church meetings. This attitude is carnal!</p>
<p>Understand that you’re first a Christian before you’re anything else! That means your service to the Lord and full time commitment to His cause must be your utmost priority. You can’t continue to run your life with the same old pursuits and mindsets you had before you were saved. Some of God’s children are still too conscious of the old life; that’s why they claim to have a Christian life, a business life, a family life, and a school life. Just as you can’t decide to be a man today and a woman tomorrow, in the same way Christianity isn’t a cloak you put on and off whenever you wish; it’s who you are. You’re a  Christian-businessman, -family man, -student, and as such, your conduct in all these areas must reflect who you are.</p>
<p>Your Christianity should take pre-eminence over every other thing in your life. Jesus has become your Lord and that means ‘the Boss of your life.’ He alone has the final say concerning everything that has to do with your life. It’s for this reason that you need to take time to find out what He wants: His purpose, plans and desires for your life. Your pursuits, desires, goals and targets in life must align with His heartbeat and vision to reach the entire world with the Gospel. That’s what you must live for. That’s what it means to be a Christian. Hallelujah.</p>

<p>For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live (Romans 8:13).</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:19, the Bible says “What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?” This means your body belongs to the Lord, and you’re the custodian of it. You’re a spirit, but God gave you a body to function with here on earth.</p>
<p>It’s true that the Holy Spirit dwells in you, but it’s your sole responsibility, not His, to forbid sickness, pains or disease from lording it over you. Our opening scripture admonishes you to put a stop to such “illegal transactions” in your body. That’s what it means when it says “mortify the deeds of the body.” It means to make extinct, put to death or disallow the deeds prompted by the body; letting you know you have the right to decide what happens to your body.</p>
<p>We will all give account to the Lord for whatever we allow in our body (2 Corinthians 5:10). Satan may launch an attack on your physical body, but it’s your responsibility to disallow such illegal transaction. You may suddenly wake up to a terrible discomfort in your body; don’t fret. Instead grab that part of your body and say “I refuse to accommodate any trouble in my body; I demand a restoration in the Name of Jesus”; and it shall be so.</p>
<p>Remember, Jesus said “Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven&quot; (Matthew 18:18). The word “bind” also means “forbid” or “disallow.” In other words, Jesus is saying “Whatsoever thou shalt forbid or disallow on earth shall be forbidden or disallowed in heaven” So if you forbid sickness from your body, as an illegal transaction, it will stay forbidden.</p>
<p>Your body is like your world, and you’re in charge of it. What you endorse concerning it is what God accepts. Therefore, don’t neglect to speak health to your body and give yourself enough rest when it’s necessary. Your body was made to function in such a way as to bring glory to God; not “illegal transactions.”</p>

<p>▪The Second Coming of the Lord Jesus is near like never before.</p>
<p>▪In the Time Table of God, We should expect the rapture of the Church 2,000 years after Jesus ascended unto heaven.</p>
<p>▪What’s happening now is supposed to be in full action after the rapture of the church.</p>
<p>▪The signs are there everywhere.</p>

<p>The Antichrist will come and take charge of:

Economy
Religion</p>
<p>Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
The nations will give to the Antichrist their power and authority
Satan will give him authority</p>
<p>Satan will create his own trinity. Himself (the father), Antichrist (the son), the false prophet (the Holy Spirit)</p>
<p>This is a rehearsal, Satan is trying to do a phase 1.</p>

<p>And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth (Revelation 5:10).</p>
<p>Jesus said in Matthew 18:18 “Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” Here, Jesus didn’t mean that as you bind something on earth, God does the same thing in heaven. No. He meant that when you bind something on earth, you’re making a decree, and that decree is upheld by God in heaven.</p>
<p>God has made us kings, (Revelation 5:10), and the Bible says in Ecclesiastes 8:4, “Where the word of a king is, there is power.” As God’s words carry and transmit power, your words also have in them creative ability to produce for you a harvest of what you say. Sadly, not many Christians have operated in this power; some have only been used to religious Christianity, where they beg God for everything.</p>
<p>You’re a king, and kings don’t beg; they make degrees. Job 22:28 says, “Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee” The reason you can make decrees or issue commands and have them established unto you is because you’re acting on the Word; you’re taking your place as God’s kings-priests, ordained to reign in the earth.</p>
<p>Quit crying or begging God to do something about your situation; decree the Word of God concerning that matter and effect a change. Take advantage of your office today; live as the king that you are; issue decrees and see them come to pass.</p>

<p>for He saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time: behold, now is the day of salvation. ( 2 Corinthians 6:2).</p>
<p>I remember a hymn we use to sing back then, and one of the lines says, ”O God our help in ages past, our hope for years to come”. I got comfortable with the song after a while because I noticed it only referred to the past and the future but left out something very important- TODAY!</p>
<p>Some people find it very convenient to hide in the victories of the past and trust in the glories of tomorrow but leave out today because they don’t know how to take advantage of what belongs to them in Christ, in the NOW. Some would say, “Praise the Lord, Jesus died for me; He shed His blood for me 2000 years ago or He’s coming again; I know Jesus will surely come back” Yes, He died for you (past), and He’s coming again at the rapture of the church( future), but what about today? Between the past and the future is the present-a present where you have to pay attention to your health, finances, family and so on. So don’t limit the blessings of God and the benefits of salvation to the past or sweet-by-and-by. Jesus died for a good life TODAY!</p>
<p>Find out from God’s word your present-hour inheritance; find out what He has made you and given to you to enjoy in the NOW! Locate yourself in the blessings of God-in the benefits of your salvation and live in your God-given inheritance TODAY. It’s good to know what Jesus did for you in the past, and what awaits you in the future, but don’t neglect today.</p>
<p>Decide today to be the best you can ever be; let today mark a new beginning in your perpetual story of success; let it be the benchmark for a continuous life of victory and progress. Enjoy the best in life today, for your best in life today, your best in life NOW.</p>

<p>&quot;This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and have good success&quot; (Joshua 1:8).</p>
<p>This scripture is the key to a successful life and ministry. The first thing I want you to note is that the heart was not mentioned at all in this scripture. It says the Word shall not depart from your “mouth” and not your “heart.” This means you must continually talk the Word. Secondly, “to meditate” means “to mutter” or “to say to yourself.” Thinking is not meditation; you have to say something. It may be by talking quietly under your breath or by roaring it aloud.</p>
<p>You may have the word in your heart, but if you don’t talk it, things will not change. In the first chapter of Genesis, the Bible reveals that God and His Spirit were there, yet the world was a chaotic mass until God spoke. God had to speak before creation leaped into being. You see, talking the Word is of utmost importance to the believer. Romans 10:10 says, “For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” Put differently, a man is not saved by his believing but by his confession. The reason is that the righteousness which is of faith doesn’t keep quiet; rather, it speaks (Romans 10:6).</p>
<p>God reveals Himself to you through the Word that you take into your heart. Meanwhile, that revelation alone wouldn’t change the circumstances of your life. But by the time the Word gets to your mouth and you speak it forth, it becomes rhema–the active or creative Word. This creative Word is powerful and will always produce results. If you want to be a mature son or daughter of God, you must meditate on the Word; you must be a talker.</p>
<p>There are not enough limitations in the world to stop you. All you need to do is fill your mouth with God’s Word; keep talking or speaking it because God’s Word in your mouth is the hope for your future. If you get a hold of this truth, it will catapult you to the mountaintop where you will be gazing together with Jesus at a world full of possibilities.</p>

<p>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself (1 Corinthians 14:4).</p>
<p>One of the synonyms for the Greek word translated “Edify” is to charge, like you would a battery. The rendering in the Amplified Translation is very inspiring; it says, “He who speaks in a [strange] tongue edifies and improves himself” Moreover, in Jude 1:20 (AMP) the Apostle Paul admonished, “But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit.” This is how you get charged in the spirit and embolden yourself.</p>
<p>Is there any challenge before you that seems insurmountable? Are there projects you want to undertake, and you’re somewhat not sure what steps to take? Activate the wisdom and power of God by praying in the Holy Ghost, until you’re filled with the Spirit. If someone were timid and began the exercise of speaking in tongues consistently, it won’t be long before he becomes bold and sound. For someone who’s weak, it’s the same thing; he’d become strong! Glory to God!</p>
<p>When you speak in other tongues, and your spirit is charged, it takes over your mind! Whereas there was fear in your mind, your spirit will rise like a giant from within and dominate the outward man. Paul said to Timothy, “Stir up the gift of God that is in you” (2 Timothy 1:6). One of the ways to do this is speaking in tongues!</p>
<p>Some Christians easily fall into temptations because they don’t speak in tongues sufficiently; consequently, their spirit is weak. Every little dart from the enemy throws them off balance.</p>
<p>Refuse to live an ordinary life. There’s power in you; stir it up always. In your privacy, speak in tongues! When you’re on the go, speak in tongues! This isn’t for a particular Christian denomination; it’s for every child of God. Get yourself charged in the Spirit; rise like an edifice, moving from glory to glory!</p>

<p>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).</p>
<p>The Christian lives in a new environment called “Christ.” Christ is a person, and Christ is also a place. Our opening verse says, “if any man be in Christ”; that’s the environment, and in that environment, we see and live differently; we’re alive to God and to the realities of the Kingdom. In that environment, we live and prevail by faith; we see with the eyes of the spirit.</p>
<p>When you were in your mother’s womb for example, you weren’t alive to the world, even though you were a living thing. Your eyes weren’t open to observe the realities of the physical world; everything was dark, but you were alive. Though you were “in the world,” you weren’t of the world, because you were living in another environment—your mother’s womb.</p>
<p>Then, you were born into this world, into a different environment; and when that happened, things changed. You had to live and feed differently now, from how you fed in the womb, because of your new environment. It’s the same thing spiritually. Now that you’re born into Christ, things are different; life is different; principles are different.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:6 says God has made us sit together in heavenly places, “in Christ”; that reveals our position of authority. 2 Corinthians 2:14 talks about our life of eternal triumph in Christ. In Christ, you can do all things, and have all things; you’re unlimited. The whole world is yours, and everything in life answers to you! You only need to give the word, because being in Christ means you sit in Jesus’ seat; you function with His authority.</p>
<p>Everything in life, living and non-living, has been commanded to hear and obey Jesus (Matthew 17:5), and because you’re one with Him; a joint-heir with Him, with the legal authority to use His Name, when you speak, it’s as though Jesus Himself were speaking. These are some of our blessings, our rights, and privileges in Christ! Christ is our place, our environment of life, honour, glory, dominion, and power! Blessed be God!</p>

<p>2 Chronicles 14:7-13.
1.3million chariots came against King Asa. He was completely outnumbered.
V11: God is greater than all the power of men.</p>
<p>We know what at different times in history happened to the church; when the church slept and the enemy snuck in.
But at any time the church was alert and prayerful, no enemy could succeed. Not once.</p>
<p>We cannot lose the liberty to preach the gospel, to gather in our number as saints. It took a lot for our predecessors to achieve this liberty for us. So, NO, we will not lose it.
We will use everything that we have and that we know to prosecute this matter. We will give no place to the devil.
Instead, we will come out of this with greater liberty, ability and influence.</p>

The POWER IN THE BLOOD</p>
<p>God revealed the power of the blood to Adam In Genesis.
Abel in Gen 4, understood that God would accept a blood sacrifice. God had respect unto Abel&#x27;s offering.
Noah: unclean animals came in 2 by 2. Clean animals went in sevens... Why? Because of sacrifice.</p>
<p>When God gave Abraham the promise (Gen 12), He understood that the promises of God would not be fulfilled without the shedding of blood.</p>
<p>Before God created angels, or the world, He had already spoken the crucifixion of his son. This was even before TIME.  God is eternity.
When God saw the blood of Animals shed, he saw the blood of his son (even though he knew the blood of Animals could not atone for sin)
From the old Covenant, Adam to Jacob, they understood this relationship.</p>
<p>In Exodus 12: 1-13,  23, Moses was told to tell the people of Israel to shed blood for the passover.
The lintel is the cross point on the door. (Upper point and 2 side posts)
Jesus also fulfilled the passover on the cross.</p>
<p>Israel came out of Egypt as a result of the application of the blood.
In Hebrews, we see that we entered into the holy place through the blood of Jesus.
In Revelations, the saints overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony.</p>
<p>Exodus 24:1-8; 25: . Moses built the first altar on the hill after they came out of Egypt. He sprinkled the blood on about 3 million people.
In chapter 25, God then instructed that a Tabernacle be built. Rather than Moses going up and down the mountain. After the sprinkling, he decided to dwell with the people.</p>

2 Thess 2:3
The Rapture of the church, the second coming of Christ and the Day of Christ are 3 different things.
V4-7 (NIV/Amp)
What is holding the Antichrist back is the church, so that He will be revealed In his own appointed time.
Some say it is the Holy spirit that is the restrainer.</p>
<p>There are 3 restrainers of evil that the bible talks about.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Govt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The holy spirit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The church.
Among these 3, which is being referred to in the scripture above.
Definitely not the government
The phenomenon of governments will not be removed from the earth even after the Antichrist is revealed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not the Holy spirit because... After the Antichrist is revealed, the holy ghost will still appoint 144 Jews , He will work through the 2 prophets, and then through the large number of people who will repent during the tribulation period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only the church would have been raptured before the Antichrist is revealed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are 5 different raptures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jesus and those who went with him to heaven</li>
<li>They that are Christ&#x27;s at his coming (rapture we know)</li>
<li>Rapture or the 144 Jews</li>
<li>Rapture of the 2 witnesses who will rise from the dead and the whole world will watch them taken away</li>
<li>The great multitude of saints who were beheaded and persecuted who will join us just in time for the marriage supper of the Lamb.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mistake the devil made is getting us upset/angry. Now we are taking action as the RESTRAINERS OF EVIL.
1 John 2:18.
Now, there are already the &#x27;spirits of Antichrist&#x27; in the world and the spirit of lawlessness. Satan is already carrying out evil works in the world.

<p>“Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof” (Proverbs 18:21).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, God said to the children of Israel, “Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours” (Deuteronomy 11:24). In other words, He said to them, “You’ll have victory everywhere you go.” But over in the New Testament, we’re told about the importance and power of words. We’re made to understand that the power is in our mouths. In other words, the victory is in what you say. That’s why the Bible declares that death and life are in the power of the tongue.</p>
<p>You must learn to use your mouth to speak God’s Word consistently. That’s what will keep you permanently in the pathway of success, health, peace, progress, and prosperity. Everyday, declare that you’re prosperous and highly favoured. Declare that it’s impossible for you to live the down life. Declare that it’s impossible for you to be sick, broke, or afflicted. In the face of contrary wind and adversity, keep talking your way forward.</p>
<p>For example, someone who has been diagnosed with diabetes can destroy that sickness by using his or her tongue. Instead of relying on insulin injections to help ameliorate the effect of the diabetes, use your mouth to destroy every trace of it from your body. Or maybe it’s asthma; say, “No way. I curse this asthma. I forbid it from staying in my body. My lungs are functioning perfectly in the Name of Jesus!”</p>
<p>You may say, “It’s easier said than done.” No. It is done as you say! When you say it, it is done in the realm of the Spirit. Then, you can look out for it in the realm of the physical, for it will surely manifest since God cannot lie. It doesn’t matter the challenges you face, you can change things through your words. Hallelujah.</p>

<p>I want to welcome you to today&#x27;s programme. It&#x27;s a special one. Our monthly communion service.</p>
<p>Q and A With Pastor Chris...</p>
<p>Question about the fall of Babylon in Revelation 4:18 refer to the United States of America?</p>
<p>Answer... It is not referring to the USA. It&#x27;s referring to religion. Babylon is not a reference to the US</p>
<p>Question about what the spirit is saying about... Isaiah 30:23-33, Isaiah 37, Joel 2:7-32,</p>
<p>Answer... It has certain things to do with the time table. But she is mixing up certain scriptures. You&#x27;ve got to realize that everything there are not in the distance future. Some things will be, but others have been fulfilled. There is some about the millennial reign of Christ. They are not all about what&#x27;s happening today.</p>
<p>Question about the kingdom of God and being a perfect Christian and how to go on the first flight...</p>
<p>Answer... Beautiful question.... To be a perfect Christian, you must be growing in grace, participate, be a witness. Go to church, participate, bear witness, be actively involve. Discover God&#x27;s purpose. Be baptised, it represents disconnection from the world. In addition, how to go on the first flight. Hebrew 9:28. 2  Timothy 4:8. There should be Ernest expectation. Look for His soon coming.</p>
<p>Question about what will happen if someone is forced to take the mark of the beast unknowingly or by force.</p>
<p>Answer... There are things the Lord is definite about. Taking the mark of the beast has no middle ground. Reason for taking it is not important. Revelation 14:9-11. Think about that. I told you the reason for it. It&#x27;s not something anybody should somehow take and reverse it. You can&#x27;t reverse the process. The mark of the beast is supposed to bring you into global citizenship. It&#x27;s a trick. It&#x27;s a global ID and takes you away from your local citizenship. These are all the tricks... Look at the bible, God warned us already. I gave you from the scriptures ways to calculate the coming of Christ. I&#x27;ve studied the scriptures and brought the information from the Bible. Do your own search and research. The church was given two thousand years from when Jesus walked away from that temple. The year was that. Jesus was thirty three years old then. He would be somewhere close. He was about thirty years old when He started His ministry. It may be a matter of months. His ministry was about three years. That is it, not knowing the day or hour. We can be as close as knowing the year.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s another thing. When was Jesus born. He was born in 2 BC. If Jesus was born somewhere as 2 BC, it is actually closest to that with other facts. If you&#x27;re counting that it will be AD thirty one somewhere. Have that perspective in mind for a moment. Go to when the fig tree, when it&#x27;s branch is yet tender, summer is near. It&#x27;s referring to Israel, the antichrist will sign a treaty with Israel, that will be the last seven years of Daniel&#x27;s seventeenth week. The period between the 69th and 70th... This generation will not pass.... Israel became a state in 1948. Add 100 years from then. Take that in and then remember, that one includes that 7 years. Blog in all that. You will arrive at almost the same timing. Approximately the same figures.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re talking about the closeness of the Lord&#x27;s coming. It is so close. There&#x27;s a difference between the coming of the Lord and the second coming. The context will help you understand the context. We will meet Him in the air during the rapture of the church. The advent, He will come to the earth with those with Him. This is the more appropriate second coming. At rapture, we will meet Him in the air and in the clouds and we will go away for the period of the tribulation.</p>
<p>Question about the church not passing through the tribulation...</p>
<p>Answer... The elect that will go through the tribulation. God called Jesus the elect and those that followed Him. It applied to the Jewish people and those who will believe in Jesus Christ during the great tribulation. This will be a multitude. They missed the first flight and wouldn&#x27;t miss the second flight. Certa</p>

Another translation says, “Keep vigilant watch over your heart; that’s where life starts” (Proverbs 4:23 MSG). The result of your life is the reflection of what you’ve accumulated in your heart over a period of time.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, “A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh” (Luke 6:45). Jesus is introducing us to another important factor here. He’s showing you that what you say controls or directs the course of your life. James reiterated the same truth when he likened the tongue to the helm of a ship, though small, yet it controls the course of the ship regardless of contrary winds and waves (James 3:4).</p>
<p>Some people unwittingly pronounce death on their finances, bodies and businesses on a continual basis. When the harvest of their confession comes, they’re quick to blame everybody— including God—but themselves for their woes. I would to God that such people would realize they can use their tongue to break that cycle of death. The Bible says, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof” (Proverbs 18:21).</p>
<p>If you see that your life is heading for the rocks, don’t wait until you hit them. Use your tongue to turn to the path of life; make a detour at the right time. The tongue however doesn’t work on its own, as it is controlled and directed by the information you have in your heart. This is why you have to make God’s Word a vital part of your life. Colossians 3:16 says, “Let the word [spoken by] Christ (the Messiah) have its home [in your hearts and minds] {and} dwell in you in [all its] richness” (AMP). If you can put the Word in your heart as often as you should, it’ll surely produce tremendous results in you. For when your heart is full of the Word, you cannot but speak it with your mouth. That way, you’re keeping yourself in the path of life, for God’s Word is life.</p>

<p>So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God (Romans 10:17).</p>
<p>A striking thought to observe in our opening verse is that it tells us how faith comes; it’s by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. Notice it didn’t say “faith cometh by having heard the Word”; but by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.” The emphasis is on “hearing,” that is, the continued bombardment of your spirit with the Word of God. That’s what produces prevailing faith, the faith that always works.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the testimony of a certain gentleman who’s a Lawyer today. He wanted to study law in the University where I was a student at the time, but he wouldn’t be admitted. He prayed, and prophecies came, but each time he went for his admission, he got a rebuff.</p>
<p>I knew the problem was that he hadn’t grown his faith strong enough for it to prevail in that situation. So one evening, when he came to my room, I slotted an audiotape message on faith in the player and instructed him: “Listen to this until faith comes. If faith doesn’t come, you’re not stepping out of this room!” Then I locked the door, kept the keys in my pocket and went out. At intervals, I’d come and listen at the door to know what was going on. By nighttime, he was declaring God’s Word so loudly and boldly that I was sure he was full of faith, so I opened the door and let him out.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, he barged into my room while I was still in bed, fell on the floor and began praying like I had never seen him pray before. It was obvious his faith had grown from listening to God’s Word the night before. He prayed and shouted until he began to prophesy. What happened? His faith had prevailed. In his spirit he had received his miracle from God!</p>
<p>When he was through that morning, he dressed up, went to the admissions office and sure enough, he got his admission. Not only is he a Lawyer today, he’s a Magistrate. Praise God! I tell people faith always works! If it didn’t work, it wasn’t faith.</p>
<p>For your faith to prevail all the time, you need to feed on the Word. You need to keep bombarding your spirit with the Word until it literally oozes out of your entire being! That’s how to grow prevailing faith; you have to get the Word into your system so much that you can only think, talk and live the Word!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="you-can-change-anything-through-prayer--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1842">You Can Change Anything Through Prayer ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.~1842<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to You Can Change Anything Through Prayer ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.~1842" title="Direct link to You Can Change Anything Through Prayer ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome.~1842" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#you-can-change-anything-through-prayer--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1842">​</a></h2>
<p>Remember the Lord Jesus said in Luke 18:1 that we should pray always and not give up. Through prayers we can actually change things. We can change the course of our lives and our circumstances. We can change things in our homes, our jobs, our finances and our bodies. We can even change things in the lives of other people, things in our schools, our cities, our nation and the world! This is why it’s so important that we study and understand how to pray effectively. In Matthew 17:20, Jesus said, “verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you” (Matthew 17:20).</p>
<p>I like it when Jesus talks like this. It gives me the reason to be hopeful and believe that anything, absolutely anything, is possible! A man had brought his lunatic son to Jesus&#x27; disciples to cast the devil out of him. His disciples tried and couldn’t, so he took his boy to Jesus who then cast the devil out of the boy.</p>
<p>The disciples later asked the Master why they couldn’t cast the devil out and He answered them, “because of your unbelief.” Then He added, “If ye  have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you” (Matthew 17:20).</p>
<p>Now, a grain of mustard seed is so small that if you put several of them in your palm and blow just lightly, they’ll fall off. Jesus said if you have faith as small as that grain of mustard seed you will say to a mountain to move from here to there, and it will! Then He said, “NOTHING SHALL BE IMPOSSIBLE UNTO YOU!”</p>
<p>Jesus also said in Mark 9:23, “all things are possible to him that believeth.” So the big question is: Do you believe, and what do you believe? If you believe God’s Word and put it to work in your prayer life, then anything is possible!  Hallelujah.</p>

<p>Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying, I beseech thee, O LORD, remember, now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore (2 Kings 20:2-3).</p>
<p>Our opening scripture shows us what King Hezekiah did when he was in a fix; he had just received a death sentence from God through the Prophet Isaiah. But rather than giving up, he turned his face to the wall in prayer unto the Lord. In other words, he turned away from men and turned to God, and God heard him.</p>
<p>There’re times you may find yourself confronted with a difficult situation. For example, you were served eviction notice, and now you need a new accommodation urgently. Or maybe you’ve been out of a job and have been in desperate search for one to no avail. You’ve wailed, lamented, complained, and solicited help from everyone you knew; particularly those you thought could help, and yet nothing changed. It’s time you turned your face away from men! Stop talking to men about the situation. You already told “everybody” and they couldn’t do anything about it. So stop talking to them. Instead turn to the Lord in prayer.</p>
<p>God alone has the ability to supply all that you need according to His riches in glory (Philippians 4:19). 1 Peter 5:7 (AMP) says “Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately {and} cares about you watchfully.” In Psalm 50:15, He said, “call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.” The Lord is your “very present” help in times of need (Psalm 46:1); so if you find yourself in a dire situation, all you need do is call on Him. He’s ever willing and delighted to hear your voice and answer your prayers: “For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers” (1 Peter 3:12).</p>
<p>The result of Hezekiah’s intense prayer was that not only did God reverse his death sentence; He added fifteen more years to his life (2 Kings 20:6). God is no respecter of persons. If He did it for Hezekiah, He’ll do it for you too, if only you’ll quit seeing men as your source of help and turn to Him in full assurance of faith. Say like the Psalmist “I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth” (Psalm 121:1-2).</p>

<p>PASTOR CHRIS teaching</p>
<p>The word &quot;rapture&quot; cannot be found in the Bible.</p>
<p>The disciples of Jesus didn&#x27;t know the participation of the gentiles in the church.</p>
<p>The same way they didn&#x27;t know about the rapture.</p>
<p>So at the time of Paul&#x27;s writing the verse below, he called it a &quot;mystery&quot;</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:51 - 52</p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 4:16 - 17</p>
<p>Only those who are ALIVE and REMAIN will be raptured.</p>
<p>John 15:4 - 8
To abide in Christ is to bring forth fruit.
Every branch that doesn&#x27;t bear fruit will be cut off.</p>
<p>THINGS THAT WILL SURELY BE</p>
<p>Rev 4:1-2
From revelation chapter 4 depicts a time that the church  has been raptured.</p>
<p>None of the things mentioned there will be for the church.</p>
<p>The tribulation time is a 7years period but the actual tribulation is 3.5 years after the antichrist will break the treaty he signed with Israel and other nations.</p>
<p>Rev 19:1-9</p>
<p>&quot;Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb&quot;</p>
<p>Rev 21:2-9, vs 27</p>
<p>The BRIDE OF CHRIST is a city.
The CHURCH is the body of Christ and a part of the city.</p>
<p>In Christ is salvation, all old testaments saints have gone to heaven. When they died they went to Abraham&#x27;s bosom in hell. Those who didn&#x27;t go there are Enoch, Elijah and Moses. That&#x27;s where Moses came from to the mount of configuration because nobody was able to leave hades until after the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.</p>
<p>Matthew 27:51-53
Jesus was the first to come out of death and the old testaments saint trapped came out with Him.</p>
<p>Rev 19:10</p>
<p>Hebrews 12:22-34 - those written in the book of life</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:8 -16 - the description of the new Jerusalem. The city of God that we are going to be a part of. The old testament saints will be there too.</p>
<p>Rev 7:9-17 - Tribulation saints
Rev 15:2-4
Rev 20:4</p>
<p>All these people called tribulation saints were there at THE MARRIAGE SUPPER OF THE LAMB. The Saints of old testament and those raptured alive will be there.</p>
<p>The supper takes place before the return of Jesus to the earth.</p>
<p>After the supper, suddenly 👇🏾</p>
<p>Rev 19:11-16</p>
<p>Jesus returns fiercely with a robe.
The robe dipped in blood, was his blood with which he bought us with.</p>
<p>Jude 1:14-15 - to execute judgment</p>
<p>Matt 24:30 - he comes out of heaven</p>
<p>Zachariah 14:2</p>
<hr>
<p>PASTOR BENNY HINN teaching</p>
<p>with all that is happening right now, there is no doubt that there is a great persecution is coming for the church. There will be a great falling away of christians.</p>
<p>We need to be more focused on heavenly things and disconnected from earthly things.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s not forget that the resurrection of Jesus is the foundation of our life.</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:10 - here&#x27;s a reversal of what Abraham was looking forward to</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:13-14 - they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrim on the earth.</p>
<p>If Abraham and his family were not mindful of the country they were looking for they would have turned back in the face of challenges.</p>
<p>They desired a better country.</p>
<p>The city will be 15,000 miles in every direction.</p>
<p>1 Peter 1:1 - regarded as strangers</p>
<p>This natural world is regarded as an old garment to be discarded - Psalm 102:26-27</p>
<p>People will say things are the same, nothing has changes not realizing that this world was 0mce destroyed by water and will be destroyed by fire - 1 John 2:17</p>
<p>There will be 2 sets of people</p>
<ol>
<li>Those who will abide forever and</li>
<li>Those who will pass away</li>
</ol>
<p>We have to understand as God&#x27;s people are heavenly
We cannot see ourselves as people who belong to this world.</p>
<ol>
<li>He dismissed his past</li>
<li>He dismissed his present</li>
<li>He looked for a city - he set his affection on things above</li>
</ol>
<p>So how should we be - 2 Peter 3:11</p>
<ol>
<li>Live Holy Life</li>
<li>Looking forward to the day of the Lord</li>
<li>Occupy - stay active, preach the gospel</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&#x27;t wait for zero hour - bring the day closer.</p>
<p>Because are the heavenly people rescued from the domain of darkness, we are a heavenly colony on earth.
Our thinking has to now be domin</p>

<p>Sunday, 12th April, 2020.~1870</p>
<p>The Jesus we talk about is alive. You heard the word of the angels that he&#x27;s not here, He&#x27;s risen as He said. I thought about the beautiful question the angels asked, why do you seek the living among the dead. At Easter time, we celebrate the death, burial and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. So every year we celebrate it. At this time, I want us to remember many of God&#x27;s people who &#x27;re persecuted for their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We &#x27;re in a very special period. Just yesterday, in Kansas USA, there was a judgment given, forbidden churches in that state from meeting because of the covid-19. The real issue Is the treaty that came from the judgment that if anyone went to church, he could be given a jail term of one year or more. That should say something. If the governor and those with him are  thinking about jailing someone for going to church I.e Post covid-19, meaning in their minds, they &#x27;re thinking of stopping bringing back church gatherings. I understand the games of Satan. I can tell you that that case wasn&#x27;t necessary but they wanted a place to start the trouble. That judgment will become a reference for other states but as I stand here, I declare in the name of Jesus, that it will not survive. Let us not sleep as do others. These &#x27;re the thoughts in my mind. I&#x27;m thinking about the ignorant of many Christians, the deception among many Christians. It&#x27;s times like these, that you discover the true church. Who think that this is good and who&#x27;s seeing with the eyes of the Spirit. Those without the true spirit of Christ are never persecuted, often they will be on the same side with the perpetrators and become collaborators. That phase of the fasting ends today but I still have something in my heart for the pastors and ministers of the gospel around the world. Isaiah 62:1-7.  Years ago, as a young man, I would pray with these scriptures for christians that re persecuted around the world. From this Wednesday, pastors and ministers around world, let&#x27;s us pray for the churches and God&#x27;s people around the world. Let us pray for God&#x27;s people and God&#x27;s churches around the world.</p>
<p>The most important is what time is it in the kingdom of God? Where &#x27;re we right now? I was surprised when some of you said you &#x27;ve never heard of the rapture.</p>
<p>You &#x27;re not going to find rapture in any verse in the bible using the search engine. 1Corinthians 15:51-52. Mysteries are divine revelations, esoteric revelations. In the days of Jesus in the earth, they knew nothing about the Gentiles receiving salvation. They couldn&#x27;t find anything that gave them a clear understanding that the Gentiles would be brought into this salvation. Jesus said I got a lot to tell you but you can&#x27;t receive them until the Spirit of truth comes. When Peter went to the house of Cornelius, the Jews were angry with him but he had to explain to them and James opened the scriptures and read to them. But this message was only given to Paul. As important as that was, they didn&#x27;t know anything about it, until later on. Same thing with the rapture. verse. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. Aperso in the Greek means to snatch, snatch away, to take up, caught up. We would meet him in the air, so shall we ever be with the Lord. When is it going to take place? Any time soon. It&#x27;s closer than it&#x27;s ever been. The church of Jesus Christ is given two days meaning two thousand years. The information from the scriptures is so abundantly clear. Here&#x27;s something that&#x27;s very important. When we &#x27;re caught up, who will be taken away? All those who are in Christ Jesus who are alive and remain. 1 Thessalonians 4:17. John15:1-8. God&#x27;s word is a cleanser. To be in Christ, you abide in him, you bring forth fruits. So, in your Christian life, bring forth fruits. Make up your mind you would be a fruit bearing branch. Now, the marriage supper of the Lamb. Revelation 4:1. The book of revelation opened up with the dialogue or discussion between Jesus and John. He goes on to tell him about the church. All the way From this Chapter 4</p>

<p>Pastor Chris:</p>
<p>Today&#x27;s program is a very special one.
For Pastors and Ministers of the gospel, we began another phase of fasting and praying for 7 days from today.</p>
<p>We would pray specially for saints of God all around the world
The first responsibility is given to us as ministers.
It is not an unusual call. Its a demand from the Lord.
Samuel said &#x27;God forbid that I should sin against the Lord by not praying for you&#x27;</p>
<p>What&#x27;s happening around the world is of top significance. We have to pray for Gods people. Jesus said to Simon Peter &quot;Satan has desired to have you that he might sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for you that&#x27;s your faith fail not...and when you are converted, strengthen your brethren&quot;.
Very moving words from Jesus.
This is how we have to pray for Gods children. That&#x27;s their faith fail not. In times like these, there are Christians who could be deceived or swept away by the current..some because of ignorance, could get confused. Some don&#x27;t know who they should be listening to.... So we have to pray for them that their faith be strengthened.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why we do these programs; to help build your faith; to encourage you.</p>
<p>Remember. The lord never asked us to pray in vain. He asked us to pray because he planned to answer....and we are making REMARKABLE IMPACT.
There are many things to talk about but we have  matters to settle in the spirit. We have something in front of us. We may agree on something or disagree on something. Some opinion or the other... But THIS IS NOT THE TIME FOR THE DETAILS. LET&#x27;S DEAL WITH WHAT&#x27;S IN FRONT OF US. Let&#x27;s put things in the right perspective.
Remember, Gods word is the final arbiter. It doesn&#x27;t matter what we think..what matters is... WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY?
Many ministers and saints around the world are praying.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t listen to those who tell you &#x27;there&#x27;s nothing to bother about&#x27;.. They are ignorant.
Didn&#x27;t Jesus have the power? Then Why would he pray for Peter?
People out of ignorance say a lot of things but don&#x27;t be moved by their ignorance. Look at the bible for yourself. Study the scripture for yourself.</p>
<p>We were taught on the inmprtance of prayer. Fasting, intercession...Jesus told us &#x27;watch and pray&#x27;. He told us about the things that would happen in the last days, and he said to PRAY THAT WE BE COUNTED WORTHY TO ESCAPE THESE THINGS.
For Jesus to tell us that, it means it is possible to escape them.
It means your eyes will not see or experience those things.
The Bible says in those days, men will seek death and not be able to find it.</p>
<p>For those who want to argue and have worldliness on their minds... Ask yourself &#x27;how spiritually minded is this person? Is he preparing for the coming of the Lord&#x27;. A deluded person would want to deceive others but don&#x27;t let anyone deceive you.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s pray for Gods people, the churches s of Christ, the ministers of the gospel around the world. That at this Time their faith would be strengthened by the spirit. They will not be deceived or lukewarm. They will be hot and burning for the Lord.</p>
<p>Today, we will try to look through some questions sent in from around the world.</p>
<p>Q: according to Romans 8:9, the scripture says &#x27;if any man hath not the spirit of Christ is none of his&#x27;. Does this mean every Christian has the Holy ghost? Does this mean every Christian with the spirit will get raptured?</p>
<p>A: 1 Cor 3:12- No one can say JESUS IS LORD without the spirit..by one spirit have been been baptized. He that is joined with the spirit is one spirit with him. Everyone who is born again has the spirit, but there is also the infilling of the spirit. Its very important so a Christian fulfils his ministry.
Once you hear about the infilling of the spirit, you should desire to receive him and receive him.
A lot of times, people get born again and filled the same day.
There are others to whom the matter is never addressed and they don&#x27;t get filled.
The Christian life is not possible without the Holy spirit.
Once you declare consciously that JESUS CHRIST IS THE LORD</p>

<p>“BUT WITHOUT FAITH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLEASE HIM: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him”(Hebrews 11:6).</p>
<p>The Bible unequivocally states that “without faith it is impossible to please him (God).” It didn’t say “without love” or “without prayer” or “without holiness;” neither did it say “without righteousness.” I’m not saying these aren’t important, for the Word of God lets us know they all are. What I’m saying is, it’ll take faith to activate and appropriate these and many more blessings that are in the Word of God to your life.</p>
<p>Some have tried religiously all their lives to be holy, to walk in love or to pray, yet they couldn’t please God because they haven’t learnt to walk by faith. It’s impossible to walk in any of these successfully without faith. You’re not expected to pray yourself into faith. How else would you be able to pray to the God you don’t see? How do you know He’s really up there listening to you? It’s got to be by faith! So, you see, you do have faith. But now you have to learn how to make it work.</p>
<p>“For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith” (Romans 12:3).</p>
<p>You believe the Bible is the Word of God and you study it, but you weren’t there when it was written. You simply have faith that it’s really God’s Word. That’s where it all begins. Faith is fundamental; it’s the foundation, for without faith you can’t even be born again. It takes faith to come to God; “for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him”(Hebrews 11:6).</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:2 lets us know that by faith the elders obtained a good report. This is referring to men who have gone before us as examples, the patriarchs of faith such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Samuel, David, Elijah and Elisha. The Contemporary English Version says, “It was their faith that made our ancestors pleasing to God” (Hebrews 11:2).</p>
<p>Hebrews 11 is popularly referred to as faith’s hall of fame. It’s a rich, inspiring and challenging catalogue of men and women who had fantastic testimonies of how they pleased God and did exploits in their generations because they walked by faith. They obtained a good report from God. He scored them highly for their faith, by the things they did and said, Hallelujah!</p>

<p>(Learn To Depend On God) ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome~1884</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t approach God with a heart filled with doubt. You can always depend on His Word. Don&#x27;t be frantic; do what He says in His Word and expect a miracle.</p>
<p>&quot;But what the scripture says about being put right with God through faith is this: &quot;You are not to ask yourself, Who will go up into heaven?&quot; (that is, to bring Christ down). &quot;Nor are you to ask, Who will go down into the world below?&quot; (that is, to bring Christ up from the death)&quot; (Romans 10:6-7 GNB).</p>
<p>When you need God&#x27;s assistance in matters that concern you, don&#x27;t ask Him how the miracle you&#x27;re expecting will happen. Don&#x27;t get frantic when it seems like there&#x27;s no answer from heaven yet. Don&#x27;t try to figure out how your faith will work and produce what you need. Don&#x27;t ask God how you will pass that exam! Don&#x27;t ask Him how the healing you want will take place.</p>
<p>All you need do is keep walking by God&#x27;s Word, and do whatever He tells you. How He chooses to help you is up to Him. The challenge you&#x27;re facing might be tough, but be assured that God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all you can ever ask, think or imagine. So, don&#x27;t worry or bother how the miracle you desire will happen. Relax and let Him do His thing.</p>
<p>Jesus told Jairus in Luke 8:50, &quot;Do not be afraid; only believe&quot; That&#x27;s all it takes! Just believe anything He tells you. When God told Abraham to offer his only son Isaac as a sacrifice, he promptly obeyed. He didn&#x27;t ask, &quot;O God, how am I going to become the father of many nations if I offer my only son as a sacrifice?&#x27; He left that to God! That&#x27;s faith! It accepts, believes and acts on God&#x27;s Word as the truth; the only truth to live by.</p>

<p>(Please note, on earth they won&#x27;t see him on a white horse)</p>
<p>Rev 6:3- 4
This is terrible.</p>
<p>A man on a red horse who takes peace from the earth.
Once the church is gone, no more peace on earth. There will be Mass killings and murders.
Matt 24:7, 10.
Neighbors will betray one another. Report each other to the police.
Rev 13:15. Life will become so cheap at that time.</p>
<p>The signing of the peace treaty with  Israel begins the 7 year period (Daniels 70th week)</p>
<p>Rev 6:5-6
3rd Seal: A period of Inflation and Famine.
Lamentations 4:4-9 This is a description of famine and hunger at that period
Ezek 4:10-11, 17AMP.
No Government can solve this level of famine and hunger and drought coming. Even the Antichrist will make promises but won&#x27;t be able to solve it.</p>
<p>Rev 6:7-8.
The 4th Seal (this will happen in the 2nd three and half years):
Death for 25% of the earth&#x27;s population. There will be war. (Killing with the sword)
Matt 24:21</p>
<p>The Antichrist comes.
Signs the peace treaty.
Rebuilds the temple (demolishes the mosque).
Israel will love him because he will seem as a man of peace.</p>
<p>Ezekiel 38&amp;39- Russia and Allies will invade Israel when they are at rest. (Other nations will stand by)
But they will be defeated by Israel.
The Antichrist at this time wouldn&#x27;t be controlling the world. The UN will like him because he is solving the worlds problem</p>
<p>(Seals 1-3 are broken).
The Antichrist and his European allies will become the sole world power. .
The Antichrist, being angry with Israel, will then break the treaty.
Dan 9:7. As at this Time, the temple had already been built and is worshipping God... But when the Antichrist is angry, he breaks the treaty and moves his headquarters to Israel/Jerusalem... And he moves into the Temple (afterall, he helped them to build it)

Now what happens from here is terrible.   Its called the Time of Jacobs trouble.
Dan 9:27, Matt 24: 15,2 Thess 2:3-4</p>
<p>There have been &#x27;types&#x27; of the Antichrist spirit. 150 years before Jesus came, one Attipus came into the temple and offered pigs.
Matt 24:16-22
Fierce persecution begins.
God raises 144,000 Jews to preach the gospel.. And the 2 witnesses.
Rev 14:1-5. Once the 144k men complete their work, they are raptured.</p>
<p>Rev 6:9-11
The 5th Seal:
When a man dies, he goes to Heaven, and his soul is without a body. God clothes him with a spiritual garment until the resurrection. At the resurrection, you get a body.
These souls here were slain during the tribulation. They are like sacrifices offered to God at the altar because they refuses to worship the beast and were killed for it. They come to heaven as souls with no bodies.
They will cry out for vengeance to the Lord.
God tells them to rest for a while until the others are killed too.</p>
<p>Rev 14:6,14-16
the gospel message intensifies. More people will believe in Jesus at this time. There will be a great harvest. The tribulation saints are ready to be raptured.</p>
<p>6th Seal
This seal closes the tribulation.
Rev 6:12-17. Acts 2:17-20. Matt 24:29
An earthquake that will shake the world.</p>
<p>What the bible tells us is TRUTH. The signs given for the entry of these things are all around us. The only thing we are waiting for is the rapture of the church.
If you have friends who are not born again, begin to intercede earnestly for them.
Get yourself ready.
If you&#x27;ve not been living right, its time to live for the Lord. There&#x27;s no other way. Jesus said Heaven and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away.</p>

<p>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men (1 Timothy 2:1)</p>
<p>There’s enough power in you to turn any situation around in your favour; you can change anything through prayer, because the divine power necessary to cause that change is already inside you (Acts 1:8)</p>
<p>I remember the testimony of a young girl who was slow and bedridden due to juvenile arthritis. She could only move around in a wheelchair, and the only part of her body that she could move was her neck, as the disease had stiffened her whole body.</p>
<p>She was taken to a miracle service, and while in that meeting, she wept and called on the Lord to help her. Some others saw her and began to pray for her too. As they interceded for her, she asked the lady beside her to help her up. Though her hands and legs felt heavy and painful, she managed to stand up. As others prayed for her, the lady encouraged her and said, “Don’t worry, go ahead and move your hands and legs. The Lord has healed you.”</p>
<p>Although it was difficult for her to move, she was encouraged by the faith of those who were praying for her and began to take her steps. They all erupted in praise to the Lord as she took another step, and then another one, and right before their eyes, she began to run around the room! That happened just because those believers around her were moved by compassion to pray for her.</p>
<p>There’s so much we can do and change in the lives of others if we’d intercede for them. There’re many who are going through a lot of hurt for whom we must pray. The Bible says of the Lord Jesus that He’s touched with the feeling of our infirmities (Hebrews 4:15). Be moved by the conditions of the sinners and others who are suffering around you. Let the plight of the poor, the sick, and the downtrodden stir compassion in you to intercede for them and cause a change in their lives today.</p>

<p>Phase 3, Monday Evening, Day 6~1902</p>
<p>Pastor Chris:</p>
<p>We are still in an attitude of prayer and deep meditation. And while we pray and talk to the Lord, we are listening for his guidance and everything he tells us or signals to us.
Jesus gave us power over all devils and he told us &quot;Cheer up! I have overcome the world&quot;. He overcame the world and its systems for us.
In this earth his name is the most powerful. It had all authority.
We are going to use everything that God has given us (knowledge, authority)... And Satan has no chance. He can&#x27;t win! We proclaim the name of the Lord Jesus!
At his name, every knee should bow of things in earth and under the earth and every tongue should confess the Lordship of Jesus to the glory of God the father.</p>
<p>We declare that the word of the Lord will have free course in every nation by the power of the Holy Ghost and every hindrance and barrier is destroyed in the name of Jesus.
The Lord has placed before us an open door and no man can shut it.
He already notified us when he said, we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities, powers. Rulers of darkness, spiritual wickedness in the heavenly realms. Therefore put on the whole armor of God so you can stand in the evil day.
This is one of such times that the word described as the evil day; the day which evil seeks the opportunity to create havoc, destroy lives and frustrate the work of the gospel</p>
<p>But he also told us to take unto us the sword of the spirit along with all the weapons he asked us to take with us. With the sword of the Spirit, we can cut the devil down.
We are using that sword (Gods word in our mouth), Satan cannot resist it.
We cut him off of our nations and government.
And nothing he throws at us can work, because with the shield of faith we neutralize everything that he throws at us.<br>
<!-- -->We are putting out his fiery darts. Everything he threw against the church is neutralized by the power of the Holy spirit.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A section.
Q: All of my Christian life, I have believed that we the church are the bride of Christ. Some days ago, you said we are NOT the bride of Christ, please explain.</p>
<p>A:  There is a city that was described as the bride of christ. In that city, we have different groups and the Church is PART of the Bride of Christ; The heavenly Jerusalem which has all saints of all ages in there. (Listen to the rebroadcast of the previous messages)</p>
<p>Q: Can the Mark of the Beast be given before rapture</p>
<p>A: Its not supposed to happen because the False prophet is revealed after the rapture. But Satan likes to do things before the right time that&#x27;s why we are praying.</p>
<p>Q: What will happen to the Kids whose parents are not born again?</p>
<p>A: The children of people who are born again are sanctified. Those whose parents are not born again are like their parents.. And only those who are in Christ will be raptured. So, According to the wisdom of God and not the feelings of men...this is so. Everyone is born of sin into the world but those born of Christians are sanctified.
If a child at the age of accountability decides to get born again, even if his  parents are not, is also sanctified (and vice versa). Romans 7:9. Sin revived (it did not just come. It is the consciousness of sin that brings death)</p>
<p>Q: If Gods only creation were Adam and Eve, where did the women who the children married come from?</p>
<p>A: Adam and Eve must have had more children because God told  multiply. So they intermarried and at that time it was not improper.</p>
<p>Q: Why is it that the man Child of Rev 12 is not part of the 144,000? In Rev 9:4, does it mean that there were some who had the seal on their heads?</p>
<p>A: when we read about the child, we noted that it was a SIGN. it was something that happened PRIOR TO the second half of the tribulation period. The 144k were there during the second half of the tribulation.
Rev 9:4- You would think that this means that there were others that had the seal of God... The emphasis is on those who DO NOT HAVE THE SEAL. It doesn&#x27;t mean that there are those</p>

<p>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2).</p>
<p>The Word of God gives you everything you need: health, joy, wealth, prosperity, grace, wisdom and all that the vicarious death of Christ and His triumphant resurrection delivered to us as Christians. That’s what salvation encapsulates. With the knowledge of God’s Word in your spirit, you have what it takes to create anything you want.</p>
<p>At the well of Samaria, Jesus encountered a woman and asked her for a drink of water. But noticing that He was a Jew, the woman told Him they had nothing in common, and for ethnic reasons declined. Then, Jesus replied, “Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:13- 14). The Master knew He could give her something to quench her thirst for ever—the Word. With the Word, she would be able to create anything she desired.</p>
<p>Often times, when people are facing difficult situations, what they need is a Word-therapy or what I may call a “Word-diet.” They’d have to listen to God’s Word and study the Scriptures over a period of time, until the Word gets rid of the wrong mind-set, and reprograms them aright for success. If that doesn’t happen, no matter what else you do for them, their situation wouldn’t change.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when people are sick in their bodies, the real problem is beyond the symptoms that are apparent in their physical bodies. Such pains might stem from their mind. There’s a difference between the sickness of the mind, and that of the body. So even when they’re healed in their bodies, the sickness continues, because it was really a problem of the mind. The solution is to reprogram their minds through the Word for total restoration.</p>

<p>Phase 3, Tuesday Evening, Day 7~1917</p>
<p>Pastor Chris:</p>
<p>We have the victory!!
Over the forces of darkness...
Over the demons of Hell
In every nation we have victory over them.
In every city, we have victory over them.</p>
<p>Our God hears and answers prayers. He is the only true God. The living God.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A segment
Q: Rev 20:10, Pastor Deola made mention of the false prophet, not false prophets.
If a man commits suicide trying to escape the mark of the beast, is he still going to hell?</p>
<p>A: There is definite person called the False Prophet. This is the spokesperson of the Antichrist and miracle worker. He is also the second beast, who makes others worship the beast.</p>
<p>During the tribulation period, some refused to take the Mark of the beast... So it is possible to refuse without committing suicide. Someone doesn&#x27;t need to take his own life..it&#x27;s like running away from persecution...and that&#x27;s unbelief&#x27; and that&#x27;s fear. The first set of people to get into hell are the unbelieving and the fearful. God doesn&#x27;t want his people afraid.</p>
<p>Q: is one&#x27;s salvation recognized by God if it is out of Fear of the great tribulation and not out of genuine belief</p>
<p>A: it would be genuine belief. It is the fear of God who is bringing judgement to the world. So it is correct because it is the fear of God. If that&#x27;s not enough to get you to receive salvation, what else is going to get your attention?
Jesus said &#x27;pray that you would be worthy to escape these things&#x27;.
The message of the tribulation is not from man but from God. Don&#x27;t let anyone deceive you that it isn&#x27;t genuine.</p>
<p>REVELATIONS CONT&#x27;D
(Recap of yesterday)
FOR CLARITY from yesterday... The woman riding the beast is EUROPA...not the great city.</p>
<p>Rev 17:1-
What the focus was, was the JUDGEMENT of the great Harlot that sat in many waters.
He was dealing with religion/spiritual harlotry.
V3-5 is a vision of the woman sitting on the BEAST, not the woman on many waters.</p>
<p>Remember the purpose of this vision: It&#x27;s about the JUDGEMENT of the great whore.</p>
<p>V9: He is talking about the beast and the woman that rides him.</p>
<p>Europa is Europe.
Remember Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dream. Because the feet of the image is a mixture of Iron and Clay, they can never be put together. (Dan 2:36 down)
In Dan 7:23, God showed Daniel his own interpretation. He saw 4 beasts.
The 4th beast would be a 4th kingdom on earth.
It was different from all the others (the leopard, bear and lion)
Dan 7:24- the 10 horns are 10 kings.
(Remember the Giants...they had 6 fingers and 6 toes on each)
This image doesn&#x27;t state whether the feet of iron and Clay had 10 toes.
It doesn&#x27;t show how many toes were iron or how many were Clay.
That&#x27;s not the message He tried to pass across.
Study Daniel&#x27;s language.
Dan 7:4-7. What does this mean that the 4th beast had 10 horns?
Remember, the interpretation is always what matters, not exactly what the man saw.
Back to v23-24: they were 10 kings that SHALL ARISE from this 4th and strongest kingdom (Rome).. not &#x27;that make up the 4th kingdom&#x27;.
Where did Rome cover? Europe. (There are parts of North Africa too, but the major area is Europe).
V25- another one Will arise... The metamorphosis of the ANTICHRIST.</p>
<p>There was something significant about Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dream
Daniel 2:41-43
This is about the last kingdom to come after Rome as a world power, (especially in dealing with Israel)
This kingdom would be partly strong and partly fragile.
V43
As you saw Iron mixed with Clay, They will mingle with the seed of men .... (God is giving us a clue). This book was written in Aramaic.... Let&#x27;s use the Jerusalem Bible or Complete Jewish Bible to check it out. (They will cement their alliances by intermarriages but they won&#x27;t stick together anymore)</p>
<p>Look at the history of Europe and the Monarchy of Europe. They were never United... they used intermarriages to try to get United (This is just an observation. It&#x27;s not the political leaders that are doing these intermarriages, it&#x27;s the monarchs). This has been going on for a long time. And now there are 10 Monarchies in Europe</p>

<p>The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life (John 6:63).</p>
<p>The words of the Master above let you understand the power, characteristics, and ability of God’s Word. Everything that proceeds from God, is “God”; that doesn’t mean His “Person,” but that it carries His life: His characteristics. It’s like the human DNA, which can be traced from something as little as a follicle of hair from your body. That tiny strand of hair has your unique identity in it. In the same way, everything that comes out of Jesus—His Word—has His identity, power, and life in it. His Word that comes to you carries His “DNA,” as it were.</p>
<p>This is the limitless power of God’s Word. Not every man’s words are life. But it’s remarkable to know that Jesus said His words are spirit and life. No wonder His Word never returns to Him void. See how beautiful the Message translation puts it: “So will the words that come out of my mouth not come back empty-handed. They’ll do the work I sent them to do, they’ll complete the assignment I gave them” (Isaiah 55:11).</p>
<p>If His Word to you is the Word of healing and health, it’ll work in you and complete its assignment of perfecting your health. If it’s about your finances, it’ll do the same. His Word of righteousness perfects the righteousness of God in you when you receive it. When the Apostle Paul received the words of Jesus, the life of the Word permeated His entire being, so much so that when handkerchiefs and aprons taken from his body were placed on the sick, miracles took place (Acts 19:11-12).</p>
<p>You’ve been born again by the same Word that carries the divine life (1 Peter 1:23); therefore, not only are you indestructible, everything about you is also blessed. Everything that emanates from you carries the life of God in it. Everything about you has been touched by divine energy, and preserved by the life and power of God that’s at work in you. Be conscious of this, and live the supernatural life every day.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dont-neglect-spiritual-details--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1926">DON’T NEGLECT SPIRITUAL DETAILS ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~1926<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DON’T NEGLECT SPIRITUAL DETAILS ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~1926" title="Direct link to DON’T NEGLECT SPIRITUAL DETAILS ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~1926" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#dont-neglect-spiritual-details--pastor-chris-oyakhilome1926">​</a></h2>
<p>Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life (Proverbs 4:13).</p>
<p>As you walk with the Lord, and carry out that which He instructs you to do, you must painstakingly pay attention to spiritual details because of their importance. Moses, for example, learnt this the hard way. In Numbers 20:8, God instructed him, “Take the rod, and speak ye unto the rock and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water”</p>
<p>Moses didn’t know how important it was when God told him to talk to the rock. The instruction to speak to the rock was of spiritual significance which he ignored and struck the rock instead. It was the mistake of his life. The instruction seemed so light to Moses, but the rest of his ministry was hinged on it; he didn’t know it. Moses, however, wouldn’t be the one to lead the children of Israel to the Promised Land, because of this error.</p>
<p>In serving the Lord, it’s very important that you always listen to the details of His instructions, however insignificant to the flesh they might sound. God’s Word is God’s instruction. Live your life, not according to man’s instructions, information or opinions, but according to the Word. God leads you in the path of greatness by giving you clear and specific instructions to follow. It’s not about what somebody advises or instructs you to do; the question is, “What is God’s instruction in His Word about it?”</p>
<p>This is why I love the Bible, because it’s God’s instruction manual for a glorious life. 2 Timothy 3:16 says, “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” Do you want to have an excellent life, full of glory and success? There’s a way: Follow God’s Word; don’t neglect the details in His instructions.</p>
<p>Always remember that His wisdom is greater than man’s wisdom; therefore, be sensitive to the guidance He gives you through the Word, and by the Holy Spirit, and you’ll have a beautiful and exceptional life, and gloriously fulfil His calling and destiny for your life.</p>

<p>And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire. Revelation 20:12, 15 NIV</p>
<p>Does it matter what people think about you on this earth? Does it matter what you possess on this earth? Does it matter the position you occupy? The scripture shows us how the dead, great, small…all stood before God. They were judge according to their works but that wasn’t the end.</p>
<p>At the end of everything, only one thing matters… Was your name in the book of life. That’s all that counts… at the end the day, their good works could not save them, at the end of the day their charity works could not save them. Their tears could not save them  The final question was; is your name in the book of life? That’s what counts! That’s what counts!! I’m asking you today, is your name in the book of life? Do you know that your name is there? If your name is there, will it always be there? Will it always be there? If you’ve not been born again, I ask you now to make the decision to receive this salvation in Jesus Christ. There’s no future in ANY religion. There’s no future in any religion… Jesus is not a religion but there’s a future in Jesus Christ. If you want to receive salvation… If you want to receive eternal life, say these words and mean them from the bottom of your heart and God will hear you.</p>

I confess with my mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day. Through Him and in His Name, I have eternal life; I’m born again. Thank you Lord, for saving my soul! I’m now a child of God. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Congratulations! You are now a child of God.</p>

<p>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12-13).</p>
<p>When Jesus walked the earth, He lived the Kingdom life. His life and ministry were miraculous and supernatural. He fed five thousand men with a little boy’s lunch (women and children not counted). He raised the dead, walked on water, etc. He did so many other supernatural things, which are recorded for us in the Bible.</p>
<p>But here’s the point: the miracles that Jesus performed weren’t miracles to Him. Rather, they were the expressions of His Kingdom life. The things He did, and the way He lived shows the way we ought to live and function today, for we’re in the Kingdom now. Being born again, we’ve been born into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son, where the supernatural is natural with us.</p>
<p>Therefore, like Jesus, your entire life, every day, should be an unending gusher of the miraculous and supernatural. Every move you make, every step you take, every word you speak, should be outflows of the supernatural! This is because the Word of God is clear: “as He (Jesus) is, so are we in this world” (1 John 4:17).</p>
<p>We have the same life He has. His power is in you, working all the time, because He lives in you. But you have to learn how to let it flow out to the world. Divinity is at work in you. It’s the reason you must inundate your mind with God’s Word and thoughts from the Spirit of God! Consciously practise the God-life by living out God’s Word.</p>
<p>Many live as ordinary men due to their ignorance of the Word (Psalm 82:5). Study and meditate on God’s Word continually, to appropriate the blessings of the supernatural life in Christ and live in that realm—EVERY DAY!</p>

<p>When it comes to your finances, you must see the Lord as your source; otherwise, you’ll struggle financially. You must understand that being an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ, you’re plugged to an unending supply; never think or talk lack. Be supply-conscious; not supply from men, your employer or the government, but from God. His supply system is nonstop. But if you focus on men or your salary, that’s a system that fails.</p>
<p>Many have gone into depressing situations because their “source” failed, and the supply stopped; but it’s not so with God’s supply system. Consider Elijah: God instructed Him to get away from Ahab and hide by the Brook Cherith, and commanded ravens to feed him every morning and evening. He also drank water from the brook.</p>
<p>However, after a while, the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land (1 Kings 17:7). Imagine if Elijah’s trust or focus was on the brook and the ravens, and not the Lord Himself. He probably would have gone into frustration when the brook dried up.</p>
<p>At that time, God prepared a widow at Zarephath to take care of him (1 Kings 17:9). This should tell you something: take your eyes away from men, your job or business; they’re channels. God is your source; focus on Him, because it’s up to Him to choose which channel to use.</p>
<p>If, for instance, your cable company or satellite TV service provider disconnects you, it doesn’t matter what channel you want to watch, it won’t work. But God is your “service provider,” therefore, focus on Him and not the channels. He’ll orchestrate things in your favour and see to it that you walk continually in abundance.</p>
<p>Use the Word for your finances. David said, “The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want” (Psalm 23:1). You have unlimited access to God’s inexhaustible riches. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works (John 14:10).</p>
<p>The above affirmation by Jesus dissolves any doubt as to His oneness with the Father. He’s in the Father, and the Father is in Him. When He walked the earth, He was the living tabernacle of Almighty God. Wherever Jesus went, the Father went, because the totality of the Godhead dwelt in Him (Colossians 2:9).</p>
<p>Now, think about the fact that as Jesus is, so are we in this world! Meaning that you’re God’s moving house; His living tabernacle; the fullness of the Godhead tabernacles in you. Someone asks, “How can that be?” It’s simple. Colossians 2:9 that we referenced earlier says, “For in him (Jesus Christ) dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” Then the next verse says, “And ye are complete in him (Jesus Christ) ,which is the head of all principality and power” (Colossians 2:10).</p>
<p>Again, someone might query, “If we’re already full of God, why then did Paul pray in Ephesians 3:19 for the Christians at Ephesus to be filled with all the fullness of God?” First, understand that Paul didn’t include himself in the prayer. If it was so needed for everyone, he’d have said, “that WE ALL might be filled with all the fullness of God.” But He understood the Word; he knew he was already filled with God and wanted to bring the saints in Ephesus to the same consciousness.</p>
<p>Read his inspiring submission in Galatians 2:20: “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me” In Colossians 1:27, he affirms, “CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of glory.” Christ in you is the fullness of God in you. You’re a God-conveyor; a God-carrying vessel. In the Old Testament, the Ark of the Covenant symbolised the presence and glory of God. Everywhere the Ark was, the glory was present; miracles and blessings manifested.</p>
<p>Today, God’s presence is no longer in the Ark, but in your spirit; you’re the living, moving Ark of God today. Walk in this consciousness, and nothing shall be impossible to you.</p>

<p>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace (Ephesians 1:7).</p>
<p>“Redemption” in the verse above, is the Greek word, “apolutrosis” and it means riddance. In Christ, we have our riddance. He rids or plucks you out of trouble, and rids your life of anything that’s wrong. So, you can say, “I have my riddance in Christ, no matter what!” That’s redemption. It doesn’t matter what mess you may think you’re in, you can trust Him to get you out.</p>
<p>In Christ Jesus, we also have remission of sins. The King James translation uses the word “Forgiveness” of sins, but the Greek word is “aphesis” and it means remission; the total removal or blotting away of sins. God did much more than forgive us; He blotted out our sins. There’s no trace or record of your sins; it’s as though you never sinned.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s wrong for a Christian to keep a consciousness of sin. Some are forever praying and asking God for forgiveness, because they’re always overwhelmed by the burden of sin-consciousness. The truth is that the Bible never tells us to ask God for forgiveness. God never made provision for your “forgiveness.” This might upend some people’s theology, but it’s a present truth.</p>
<p>To forgive means to pardon, in which case the record of wrong remains, though you’ll not be punished. But that’s not the case with God and us. The actual Greek rendering is “to take away completely, to put away, blot out, separate from.” You might want to ask, “How about 1 John 1:9 that says, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness?”</p>
<p>What that simply means is that if we acknowledge (confess) our sins, God is faithful and just to put them away, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. There’s an automatic cleansing going on. That’s what it says in the seventh verse: “But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin” (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>God wants you to walk free of guilt or condemnation! He wants you to walk in the light of your riddance, your righteousness, your justification, your holiness, and your sanctification in Christ Jesus, not snowed-under by guilt or sin-consciousness.</p>

<p>For with the heart man believeth… (Romans 10:10)</p>
<p>Being born again, you received the life and nature of God into your heart, that is, your spirit. The eventual transformation and glory evident in your soul and body are the result of the impact and influence of the life and nature of God in your spirit. This is why God wants you to nurture and develop your spirit.</p>
<p>Your spirit is God’s temple; His dwelling place: that’s where the Kingdom of God is (Luke 17:20-21). No wonder we’re counselled to guard our hearts with all diligence: “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life” (Proverbs 4:23). Everything you require for your life is in your heart. The house you’ll live in is in your heart; the money you require is in your heart; the health of your body is in your heart! Life in its fullness is in your heart; therefore, learn to live from your heart.</p>
<p>When you live from your heart, that is, from the inside out, you wouldn’t be bothered about the happenings outside; your experiences wouldn’t determine your response to situations. The economy of the world or of the country where you live may be in shambles, but you’re unmoved, because you’ve learnt how to enjoy your prosperity and turn it on from within you.</p>
<p>Learn to see from your heart. What you see with your heart is more real than what you see with your physical eyes. 2 Corinthians 4:18 says, “While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.” Seeing with your heart means envisioning and apprehending the realities of the Gospel and of our Kingdom-life with your spirit.</p>
<p>The more important things of life—the eternal things—are all in your heart; therefore, look inwards, and live from there. Isaiah 12:3 says, “Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation”; where are these wells? They’re in the deep recesses of your heart!</p>

<p>And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise (Galatians 3:29)</p>
<p>If as a Christian you’ve been praying, “O God, prosper me,” then you’ve been praying amiss, because our prosperity, as far as God is concerned, is a settled fact. In Christ Jesus, we’re heirs of prosperity. It’s like praying that God should make you a human being. That’s not going to work! In the same way that the righteousness of God was imparted to your spirit when you were born again, prosperity and greatness have been imparted to your spirit.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 8:9 says, “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.” What does this mean? First, understand that Jesus never became poor spiritually. So, the scripture above is talking about physical, material, and financial blessings. Jesus became poor for your sake, so that from what He gave up, you might inherit abundance.</p>
<p>Think about this: God laid our sins on Jesus on the cross, and conferred His righteousness on us at His resurrection. In Christ, you’re born His heir. All of God’s wealth and resources belong to you because you’re His heir. The Bible says the silver, gold, precious stones and the whole world belong to Him: “The silver is mine,and the goldsmith, saith the Lord of hosts” (Haggai 2:8). “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine…for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof” (Psalm 50:10-12)</p>
<p>So, as an heir of God, and joint heir with Christ, the silver, the gold, the cattle upon a thousand hills, the world and the fullness thereof, belong to you as much as they belong to Him. No wonder the Bible says, “all things are yours” (1 Corinthians 3:21). See yourself in this light, for this is the truth about your prosperity.</p>
<p>Don’t see your job or business as your source of income, but as a medium to bless others. Reject poverty, sickness, and everything that’s inconsistent with the realities of the God-life, and live a joyful, prosperous life every day.</p>

<p>Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones (Proverbs 16:24)</p>
<p>The right words are better than gifts of money, and all earthly gifts. Read our opening verse again; it talks about kind words, gracious and pleasant words: they cheer you up, and bring out the best in you. They bring health.</p>
<p>You may give someone nice gifts, but if the words you give to that one aren’t as nice, then your gifts are worthless. The wars in our world are caused by words, and peace comes by words. When Jacob sent gifts ahead of him to his brother, Esau, who had sworn to kill him because of his (Jacob’s) deception, the gifts didn’t mean much to him. It didn’t stop him from advancing towards Jacob to attack him, even after he had seen the gifts.</p>
<p>However, the moment he heard the voice of Jacob, as Jacob addressed him and spoke to him peaceably and lovingly from his heart, it disarmed Esau; his heart melted. Isn’t that what the Bible says? “A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger” (Proverbs 15:1). A kind word will bring healing and work wonders.</p>
<p>Don’t speak grievous, hurtful or hateful words; speak kindly always, from your heart. Use kind words, not flattery. Flattery comes from the lips, and they have no life, no matter how sweet they sound. Flattery is deceptive; don’t flatter with your words. Don’t be like the one David described in Psalm 55:21. He said, “The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.&quot;</p>
<p>Words come from the heart; they reveal your personality and you can’t hide them. Therefore, fill your heart with God’s Words, for out of that abundance, you’ll speak words that heal, lift, encourage, bless and comfort others.</p>
<p>CONFESSION
My thoughts, words, and actions in my daily walk and relationship with others are guided by God’s Word. I’m completely yielded to the Holy Spirit who causes my speech at all times to be gracious, pleasant and winsome, seasoned with salt, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:29 MSG; Watch the way you talk. Let nothing foul or dirty come out of your mouth. Say only what helps, each word a gift.</p>
<p>Colossians 4:6; Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.</p>

<p>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:25).</p>
<p>As Christians, we don’t go in and out of the Spirit; we live in the Spirit. There’re two expressions for being in the Spirit: one is to be in a trance or in a vision. In that sense, your physical senses are more or less suspended, and that’s a temporal experience.</p>
<p>The other and more important expression of being in the Spirit is being born into the Spirit. This is when you become aware and alive to the spirit-realm through the Word and the Holy Ghost, and live in that consciousness even though you’re in this world and your physical senses are conscious of your natural environment. Howbeit, you’re living with the mindset and consciousness of the heavenly being that you are. You see the same things with other people, but you have a different interpretation and a different understanding.</p>
<p>Our theme scripture admonishes that if we live in the Spirit, we should also walk in the Spirit. In other words, since you’re born into the realm of the Spirit, since you live in the Spirit, act accordingly. Act with the consciousness that you’re in the Spirit and let that consciousness dictate your physical condition.</p>
<p>For example, when the children of Israel left Egypt, the Bible tells us that they carried their own atmosphere with them: “And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night” (Exodus 13:21). They had the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. The biting cold at night, and scorching heat by day, didn’t affect them because they were in the Holy Ghost atmosphere.</p>
<p>Today, we live in the same Holy Ghost atmosphere, in Christ. The Holy Ghost lives in you, and you carry Him everywhere. Therefore, you have His atmosphere, which makes you different. That’s why you can come into a place, where everybody is sad and depressed, and things change; because you came in with the atmosphere of joy. People are under the spell of darkness and failure, and you come in there with brightness and victory, because you’re the light of the world. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Dominate your environment with the atmosphere of the Spirit. Walk in the Spirit, for that’s the realm from which, and into which, you’re born of God.</p>
<p>PRAYER</p>
<p>Thank you precious Holy Spirit for being my peculiar atmosphere and advantage in life; you’ve made my life very different and beautiful. I rule and dominate my world with the atmosphere of joy, peace, success and victory, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth (Mark 9:23)</p>
<p>Many years ago, malaria and tuberculosis were said to be medically incurable, until medical research developed a cure for them. Presently, H.I.V/AIDS is considered incurable because medical science is yet to come up with a proven cure. This goes to show that the tag of incurability is another term for the limitation of human knowledge and understanding. Never accept from anyone that your condition is hopeless or incurable. Refuse to have your life limited by the limited understanding of others.</p>
<p>For the Christian, there’s no such thing as a hopeless situation, neither is there any problem that’s insurmountable.­ No sickness can be said to be incurable; not when you have your switch of faith turned on. Consider for example, the story of the woman with the issue of blood.</p>
<p>She suffered hemorrhage for twelve years and was given up to die. Her condition was certified medically incurable. Being a wealthy woman, she spent all her livelihood on medical bills until she became impoverished, and instead of getting better, her condition grew worse.</p>
<p>Such was the “hopelessness” of her situation until she heard about Jesus. Hope rose up in her and she said, “if I may but touch his clothes, I shall be whole” (Mark 5:28)</p>
<p>She proceeded, against the odds, to touch the hem of Jesus’ garment and instantly, “the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague” (Mark 5:29). The Master took note of this and commended her faith, saying, “Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague” (Mark 5:34)</p>
<p>This clearly demonstrates the overcoming power of faith. No wonder Jesus said, “all things are possible to him that believeth” (Mark 9:23)</p>
<p>If you’ve found yourself in a dire situation which man’s wisdom or scientific knowledge has termed hopeless or incurable, refuse to be daunted. Trouble may come, but you must refuse to faint in the day of adversity (Proverbs 24:10). Never accept any situation as impossible. You can change anything by putting your faith to work.</p>

<p>Be sensible and don’t tell everything you know (Proverbs 12:23 CEV)</p>
<p>When you walk with the Lord, He gives you visions for your future; visions about your life, the things He wants to accomplish with you and through you. He causes you to see into the future so you can head for that future. Everybody may not see what you see, or know the future God is guiding you into. But some people try to tell everybody what God is showing them about their future. That’ll be a mistake, except if He’s the one leading you to talk about it.</p>
<p>Understand that Satan doesn’t know what you see, until you tell him; he doesn’t know everything. When he hears about what you see, then he starts scheming how to work out a plan to try to stop you. There’re people who, because they couldn’t keep certain things to themselves, lost the beautiful idea they received from the Spirit. Once they got the idea for something, they started telling people about it, and Satan got wind of it and devised means to stop the idea from materializing. Don’t give him that chance.</p>
<p>Our theme verse says, “Be sensible and don’t tell everything you know” Don’t always tell your plans to non-Christians. Whatever idea God gives you, get started with it first before talking about it; or else you may never start. It’s not because the people that know about your vision or even the devil can stop you; no. It’s because there’s a spirit that works with them; they may exude a certain kind of negativism that could dampen your zeal for what God wants you to do, if you’re not careful. So, be spiritually smart. The Bible says, “Watch your words and hold your tongue; you’ll save yourself a lot of grief” (Proverbs 21:23 MSG)</p>

<p>Author: Rev Dr Chris Oyakhilome. DSc, DD, PhD.~2132</p>
<p>Scripture Reference: “And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature”(Mark 16:15).</p>
<p>Shortly before He ascended, the Lord commissioned the Church to take His gospel to all men and bring them to eternal life. This is the standing order to the Church we’ve all been enlisted into the ministry of reconciliation: “And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation” (2 Corinthians 5:18) We have a divine mandate to reach out to lost souls and bring them into the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>This is something you must take very seriously this year; you must be effective in soul winning. Every month, have your target, and a clear cut plan of how you’re going to effectively lead people to Christ.</p>
<p>There’s no better way to experience the excitement of Christianity and live for the Lord than to be a soul winner.</p>
<p>So get busy for the Lord; be passionate about His work. Make soul winning your lifestyle.</p>
<p>You’re a missionary here on earth, an ambassador for Christ, commissioned to take the message of salvation to everyone in your world; therefore, this year, more than you’ve ever done, get yourself occupied with physical and digital evangelism and soul winning.</p>
<p>Help someone else receive salvation; help those around you learn the Word; show them the path of life! Teach them how to live.
This is your calling as a Christian.</p>
<p>The Bible didn’t say “God has given to the pastors and evangelists the ministry of reconciliation,” rather it says He has given to us everyone who’s born again the ministry of reconciliation.</p>
<p>It’s our call to be effective soul winners. God’s highest blessings are for soul winners; never forget that.</p>
<p>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! 1 Corinthians 9:16 KJV.</p>
<p>Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us, but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God. [It is He] Who has qualified us [making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient] as ministers and dispensers of a new covenant [of salvation through Christ], not [ministers] of the letter (of legally written code) but of the Spirit; for the code [of the Law] kills, but the [Holy] Spirit makes alive. [Jer. 31:31.] 2 Corinthians 3:5 - 6 AMPC.</p>
<p>As you win souls, you’re promoted in the spirit, and the Spirit of God increases His grace and glory upon your life to do more.</p>
<p>So let’s do the work of the Father- Soul Winning, while it is day.</p>
<p>Glory To God.</p>
<p>Lift up your hands and speak in other tongues and praise Him.</p>
<p>Hallelujah!</p>
<p>God Bless You!</p>

<p>But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness (1 Timothy 4:7).</p>
<p>The word “godliness” above actually means piety towards God, piety to spiritual or godly activities. It means devotion. It doesn’t refer to inner righteousness or inherent holiness. It’s about the things you do, how you respond to God, and to the things of God. For instance, there’s a way you ought to behave when you come into the house of God, because church isn’t like everywhere else. It’s a place of worship. There’s an attitude of reverence you ought to have when you come to church.</p>
<p>Godliness is about your demeanour. Your dressing matters; some piety is necessary in your dressing. There’s a decency that goes with the Spirit of God, and that decency must be in your life. There’re outward things that people should see in you, and say, “Yes, this is a Christian.” They can’t see it in your heart, but can see it in your character. That’s what godliness is about.</p>
<p>There’re movies you shouldn’t watch. There’re books or magazines you shouldn’t read. There’re places you just shouldn’t be found in, because you’re different. And if for any reason you find yourself in such places, you ought to go in there with godly piety. Yes, that’s the life you’ve been called to live. Your presence in a place should exude and transmit the righteousness of God, for you’re a tree of righteousness, producing fruits of righteousness.</p>
<p>Never lose sight of who you are; you’re different. You’re the symbol and embodiment of God’s glory, perfection, beauty, and righteousness. See and carry yourself as such: “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9 AMP).</p>

<p>&quot;And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit&quot; (Ephesians 5:18).</p>
<p>Our opening verse gives us the secret to living the transcendent life: it&#x27;s being filled with the Spirit. This isn&#x27;t an option for you as a Christian, if you&#x27;re going to be effective in your Christian walk. You must be filled with the Spirit always. You might ask, &quot;Is that really possible? Can we always be perpetually &#x27;high&#x27; on the Holy Ghost?&quot;</p>
<p>Emphatically yes! The Word says we can, and shows us how in the ensuing verses 19-21 of our opening scripture. It reads, &quot;Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.&quot;</p>
<p>Every day, practise being filled with the Spirit. Before you leave home, get full of the Holy Ghost! Before you lead in worship, before you go out for evangelism, before you go to work, be filled with the Spirit. When you&#x27;re full of the Spirit, the words that come out of you aren&#x27;t your words but God&#x27;s. Therefore, everything you say will come forth with power and surely come to pass.</p>
<p>When you&#x27;re full of the Holy Ghost, no matter what happens to you or around you, you&#x27;re unflustered. Like Paul, you&#x27;d say, &quot;None of these things move me.&quot; This is life beyond the ordinary plane of perception; life beyond the comprehension and ability of the human mind; life beyond the world!</p>
<p>This super life is what Jesus brought to us. He said, &quot;The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows)&quot; (John 10:10 AMPC). You&#x27;re not an ordinary person. Many Christians live ordinary lives, because they don&#x27;t get themselves filled with the Spirit often. If you&#x27;re continually filled with the Spirit, your life will be an unending stream of the supernatural.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been called into a life of unending success. The secret is being filled with the Spirit: You&#x27;d be enabled supernaturally to see things at a higher plane and live the higher life in Christ.</p>

<p>&quot;And seek the peace of the city...and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace&quot; (Jeremiah 29:7).</p>
<p>Edmund Burke once said the only ingredient required for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing. The reality of this is more compelling in our world today. Most Christians assume someone else is praying for the country, whereas nobody is. They look around and see many great ministers of the gospel, and unconsciously leave all the praying to them. Never put the fate of your country in the hands of others, bear the responsibility as well. If anybody will pray for it, then it should be you because your prosperity is hinged on the prosperity of your country.</p>
<p>This is the thought God communicated to Prophet Jeremiah in the Scripture above. The same thought was reiterated by the Apostle Paul in his letter to Timothy in 1 Timothy 2:1-2: &quot;I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; THAT WE MAY LEAD A QUIET AND PEACEABLE LIFE IN ALL GODLINESS AND HONESTY.&quot;</p>
<p>Take interest in the affairs of your country. I don&#x27;t mean that your life should be dictated by them, but be a watchman as Ezekiel was to Israel (Ezekiel 3:17): &quot;Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.&quot; Set some time aside to pray for your nation today.</p>

<p>Durable riches and wealth are mine because I am the seed of Abraham. Through my giving and financial participation in the gospel, my finances are sanctified unto the Lord and my prosperity is guaranteed. The adversary is rebuked for my sake and I function in increased grace.</p>
<p>I just can’t accept poverty, nobody is going to hand poverty over to me. I refuse to be described as poor because I am not. I am the rich, discovering my inheritance.</p>
<p>There is a place for me in God; it’s a place of wealth, where lack, want and poverty are aliens. That’s where I live.</p>
<p>I am rich; I have all the resources I need because God has made all favour and earthly blessing abound towards me in abundance. I am always and under all circumstances self-sufficient.</p>
<p>I possess enough and require no aid or support. I am financially furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation.</p>
<p>I am connected to an eternal source of wealth because I am the seed of Abraham. God has the right people in the right place to help me at the right time.</p>
<p>The Holy Ghost is my helper. When He needs to use somebody to help me, he’ll get anybody to do it. There are people who will help me even when they don’t want to because the Holy Ghost will compel them.</p>
<p>I refuse to lack or beg for money for God has liberally supplied my every need. There is a wealth transfer and the wealth of this world is mine.</p>
<p>I lay up gold as dust. Doors of opportunities and blessing that cannot be humanly explained are open to me by the Spirit of God. I am marvellously helped of the Lord for I am His most prized and treasured possession.</p>

<p>J-E-S-U-S!!!</p>
<p>Ezra 6:14
Preaching, teaching and prophesying... Quarterly global prayers... 5th of July starts season two of this. Inspire, guide, pray for and with them and the church of Jesus will be built. We will have an extraordinary thanksgiving by the end of the year. Global celebration.</p>
<p>We wrestle not against flesh and blood. Do you know how many world leaders regret misleading their countries. Some of them were mislead by others or evil inspiration from evil spirits. How important for Gods people to pray. These laws and bills that were sent to many countries. Same templates. They passed the laws. Most of you didn&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on. Some journalist never read these documents same as some politicians.</p>
<p>If you read the details... It reminds me of what happened in the US when they passed the Obama care. Madam speaker said let&#x27;s pass the bills and read it later. So big a bill that they just trust their writers... President widow Wilson regretted selling his country to the FED.</p>
<p>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. It&#x27;s a huge problem. Terrible problem in life.</p>
<p>Thinking about a couple of things...</p>
<p>Why are nations going... Let me help you... You&#x27;re not looking far. The trust of the matter is, most of the global organizations we thing are helping... Look at what they&#x27;re doing and analyze what they said. Search and analyze. Paul told us to study. Do the study. Don&#x27;t be ignorant. Do your own research. Who are behind these.</p>
<p>The Y2K, find out who benefitted. It was a hoax. Nobody asked questions and nobody apologized. We just continued. There are a lot things people do. I don&#x27;t pray ignorant and religious prayers. I want us to pray in a definite direction. The purpose of the prayer and what we are praying about.</p>
<p>When it&#x27;s time to pray for your country, have some information. Don&#x27;t have wrong assumptions. God is not the cause of the present problem. I told you it came from a lab. It&#x27;s not natural. Later on, you found it is what hoappened. China was a scape goat.</p>
<p>I told you the truth. It was released in China. I knew by revelation. Nations have to think differently and quickly, leaders of the nations should start thinking in the interest of their nations. The non-state actors. Trying to destroy nation states. The prince of Assyria and his modus operandi.</p>
<p>Where are these bills and guidelines coming from. If these continue, you become oligarchy... Your nation will not be what it ought to. The Davos conference. These are not experts. Their dream will not come to pass. The future of the world as told by the scriptures. They won&#x27;t have a chance. The evil one will take over state powers and destroy all that will stand against him including the deep state. That&#x27;s the antichrist. They won&#x27;t be the ones in charge of the one world government.</p>
<p>The deep church.</p>
<p>See. This is no game. It&#x27;s time for leaders to start thinking what&#x27;s best for their countries. The non-state actors will be call to account. Mark my word. Leadership is accountable or it&#x27;s not leadership. If you&#x27;re not accountable, you&#x27;re not a leader. The deep state is not accountable but pushes accountable leaders to do these terrible things.</p>
<p>Your people trust you. Strong leaders are not scared. What are you telling your kids why they are at home? Scared of virus?</p>
<p>The invincible enemy. It&#x27;s not the virus. It&#x27;s a euphemism for the deep state. So it&#x27;s time to get rid of the stupidity. It&#x27;s quite interesting that the number of infection is increasing while the deaths and dying are reducing. It&#x27;s a fallacy. If more people are affected... Tanzania where pawpaw and goats tested positive... How can they be sure of a virus that&#x27;s not studied.... If you have flu or malaria, you will most likely test positive.</p>
<p>The problem is about the treatment. Most people that test positive don&#x27;t get sick or die. Halt the roll out of the 5G. Where there was no 5G, people weren&#x27;t dying. I didn&#x27;t say that the 5G created it. There&#x27;s a relationship. I proved it. People were falling and dying...  They acted SARS and were c</p>

<p>Day 2~2247</p>
<p>A lot of the media practitioner never read the documents that were passed into bills. A lot of the politicians never read them including those who made the law.
If you lack knowledge you&#x27;ll be a victim without even knowing you are a victim.</p>
<p>Most officials are not looking far; the truth of the matter is most of the global organization that are there to help have to be analysed. Question, who is behind it? Have have they been doing? Paul told us to study the word. Do your own research.</p>
<p>So when I tell you let&#x27;s us pray we are not praying ignorant prayers. I wants us to pray in a definite direction. Before you pray for your country, you have to know something about what&#x27;s happening.
How are viruses produced? Because they don&#x27;t exist in nature. It was produced in the lab. How do I know? By revelation.</p>
<p>Leadership is accountable or it&#x27;s not leadership. As a leader you must be accountable if not you are an imposter.
Strong leaders are not scared. The virus is not the invisible enemy, it&#x27;s the uniformism for the deep state.</p>
<p>The fatality rate they were talking to us about was a falacy.  If more ppl are infected and the dying ppl are not dying.
They told us they are still studying the virus then how r they able to test accuracy. If you ever had, the flu or malaria, you are most likely to test positive for the virus. The testing itself is a hoax.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why I said halt the 5G . Because where there was no 5G the virus was not killing a lot of the people. There&#x27;s a relationship between the 5G and the virus.</p>

<p>The church is not the bride of Christ. The church is a special class. She&#x27;s given authority over all things. Jesus told us about the dispensation. And he gave this authority to the church in a peculiar way in a peculiar time.</p>
<p>Revelation 13:8 King James Version (KJV)</p>
<p>8 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s a lot of people</p>
<p>9 If any man have an ear, let him hear.</p>
<p>10 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</p>
<p>11 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.</p>
<p>12 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s three of them; we got the dragon and the dragon gives authority to the beast.
False prophets desseminate false information. That will be the work of the media in the last days. The work media isn&#x27;t synonymous with falsehood. If you&#x27;ll work with the media, get ur facts, examine the truth than join the bandwagon of falsity.</p>
<p>The deep state got into it and invest in the media. When you are working in an organization you have to know whats behind it.</p>

<p>Q&amp;A SEGMENT</p>
<p>In one of your teachings, you said The church wasn&#x27;t delivered from the hand of the devil, we were not redeemed from the hands of the devil but Ephesians 1:7 says we were redeem, we were not redeemed as the church, which to know more.
Answer- Ephesians 1:1-8
Here Paul was addressing the saints at Ephesus. He&#x27;s talking about us the saints. This scripture says nothing about being redeemed from the devil of sin.
The word redemption means a ransom and a general term for salvation. Specifically it refers to riddance. Christ is my redemption. To pay a ransom or delivered with a price. We were not delivered from the devil, neither from sin. Jesus didn&#x27;t pay a ransom to the devil on our behalf.</p>
<p>2 Peter 1:4
He bought the field. Here redemption is the complete removal, the blotting away of sin. The church is a new creation, Jesus paid the price for the salvation of the whole world. The church is a new creation, He came out after the price was paid.
Had Jesus never resurrected, salvation for the world would have been accomplished, but that wasn&#x27;t enough because that&#x27;s not all what God wanted. After He died ,things were atoned for but by the resurrection of Christ,that&#x27;s where the church came in ,that&#x27;s the mystery we&#x27;re talking about. That&#x27;s the reason we say the church wasn&#x27;t redeemed from the devil or sin. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re above sins and the devil. Hallelujah. That&#x27;s why we cast out demons etc. Glorrryyyy.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>During the millennial reign will the ones who died not yet born again,will they have the opportunity to get born again there? Who will be in the new heaven and earth? They&#x27;ll be nation&#x27;s and these nation&#x27;s will inhabit the differentThe church, the bride of Christ will be in the new heaven and earth.
The new heaven and will be conditioning the new earth and in the new earth the saints  will live in the new city and the others in the new earth.</li>
</ol>
<p>What&#x27;s your opinion in ministers being for the one world religion. ? Christianity is not a religion, it&#x27;s absolute nonsense,when leaders think they can bring religious leaders together for peace. That&#x27;s why the Antichrist will tell the world,that religion is the  problem in the world,so let them destroy the other religions and make one new religion. Just like the Assyrian who destroyed the other gods because there were not the way but Jesus said ,He&#x27;s the way , the truth and the life and that&#x27;s what the Christians hold unto. Jesus proofed it, by dying, resurrecting and ascending to heaven and they saw him. Jesus proofed it and no other did.
Ephesians 4:4-6
There&#x27;s only one Lord,one faith the Bible doesn&#x27;t recognize other faith, because you can&#x27;t believe in something that&#x27;s dead.<br>
<!-- -->Acts 4:12
This is not Pastor Chris ideas, it&#x27;s the word that says so. If you can&#x27;t have salvation in any other then there&#x27;s no peace in any other. If you&#x27;re working for peace true religion,then you&#x27;ve denied the faith. If you need true peace, it&#x27;s found in Christ Jesus alone. There&#x27;s none anywhere. You can&#x27;t use religion to bring peace. It will never and Christianity is not one of the religions of the world. Those who call Christianity religion, they don&#x27;t know what religion really is. In Christianity when we Believe in Jesus,we were born in Christ and we became  a new man. Christianity It&#x27;s not the outward work, why religion is. There&#x27;s a religion in Christianity, helping the fatherless,widows etc but that&#x27;s not going to take you to heaven. Doing this is not enough. It&#x27;s in Christ Jesus that you can find rest. He&#x27;s the only one who can give rest. It&#x27;s our peace. As a Christian for you to work with other religions you must drop the Bible because no other religion will ever save you. That&#x27;s  Terrible.</p>

<p>As a member of this family, you&#x27;re in a divine community. It&#x27;s like being in a secure online community, where members are given passcodes for access. All non-members are restricted, until they register and are given access codes. It&#x27;s the same in our community; through the Holy Ghost, we have access to the Father, and all the glories of His presence. The Bible says, &quot;For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father&quot; (Ephesians 2:18).</p>
<p>God is always happy with us. The Bible says He rejoices over us with singing (Zephaniah 3:17). Many don&#x27;t really know Him, that&#x27;s why they think He&#x27;s mad at them for the wrong things they&#x27;ve done, and tend to run from Him. But He&#x27;s love, and loves you passionately, in spite of your actions. Romans 5:8 tells us, &quot;But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:19 says, &quot;Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God.&quot; Quit begging or acting like a stranger and foreigner; you&#x27;re a member of God&#x27;s family, and have unrestricted access to Him through Jesus Christ. Hallelujah! O, the glory you&#x27;d experience, communicate, and disseminate if this truth dawns on your heart! It&#x27;ll beautify your life, and cause you to live closer to your full potential.</p>

<p>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? (1 Corinthians 6:19).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the children of Israel transported the presence of God from place to place every time they carried the Tabernacle of Witness, which contained the Ark of the Covenant. In 1 Kings 8:9, the Bible tells us specifically that “There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.” The only thing in the ark was God’s commandments.</p>
<p>Today, your heart is  the ark of God; that’s where the Word is. Remember what the Lord said in Jeremiah 31:33: “But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.” This was fulfilled in us when we were born again.</p>
<p>We were born again by the Word of God, and have become one with the Word; we’re living epistles, “written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God—not in tables of stone—but in fleshy tables of the heart” (2 Corinthians 3:3). Blessed be God!</p>
<p>You’re now the living ark of testimony and the tabernacle of His presence: “for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people” (2 Corinthians 6:16). He dwells in you now. His hands are in your hands, and His legs are in your legs. He walks in you and talks through you. Where you go, God goes. You’re in Him and He’s in you!</p>
<p>Not only are you now in the presence of God, you carry the presence of God. Every time you show up, you come with the presence of God: Christ in you, the hope of glory!</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I thank you for your presence, glory, beauty, aura and perfections in my life. The Holy Spirit, who is your glory, lives in, and operates from the quarters of my heart. Therefore, sickness, disease, and darkness have no place in me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (John 7:38).</p>
<p>Out of ignorance, many people think that what they need to fulfil the will of God and produce lasting results is more anointing. So they pray, “Lord, I need a double portion of the anointing.” But there’s nowhere in the Scriptures where God promised to give us more anointing. Many have misunderstood the anointing to mean something totally different from what the Bible actually teaches.</p>
<p>First, the anointing is the symbolic consecration. When someone is anointed with oil like it was in the Old Testament, that’s the symbolic consecration. But more importantly, the anointing is the effect of the power and presence of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, for the Christian who already has the Holy Spirit to ask for “more anointing” is a contradiction. Why ask for the effect when you have the real thing? The Holy Spirit is the real deal. He’s the power of God, the power giver, and He lives in you in His fullness.</p>
<p>You received the Holy Spirit, not as a fluid; water, smoke, cloud or gas, but as a person. When He took up His abode in you, it was with the totality of His being. Therefore, the anointing, which is the effect or result of His presence in you, should be oozing out of you. In John 7:38, when Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit, He didn’t say, “Upon you shall flow rivers of living water”; rather, He said out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
<p>Don’t ask or pray for more anointing to fall on you; what you need is the flow of the Spirit. That is, how to let what’s inside you flow out! You can stir up that power to flow through you more by speaking in tongues and meditating on the Word.</p>
<p>CONFESSION
Dear Father, thank you for your Spirit who has taken up His abode in the quarters of my heart. I’m imbued with supernatural powers, graces and glory, which overflow from within me to my world. Righteousness, peace, joy, and excellence exude from me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>But ye shall receive Power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be Witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8).</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about the fact that God chose you before you were born, to be His Witness? He knew you and foreordained you to live for His glory. The Bible says, “For whom He did foreknow, He also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of His Son” (Romans 8:29).</p>
<p>God foreordained and planned that through you, He’ll bless and transform the lives of those in your world and in regions beyond. He set you apart to do His will, and to be His Witness.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, understanding this, echoed the same message in Galatians 1:15-16: “But when it pleased God, Who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the heathen” Paul’s passion and unrivalled commitment to the Gospel resulted from his knowledge and understanding that he was chosen and sent of God to turn the Gentiles from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God.</p>
<p>Recall his profound statement of commitment to the Gospel in 1 Corinthians 9:16: “For though I preach the Gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the Gospel!” Become aware, convinced, and challenged by the divine mandate and obligation to preach the Gospel.</p>
<p>As in our opening Verse, the Power of the Holy Spirit in your life is to make you an effective Witness of Jesus Christ; a Minister of Reconciliation. You’ve been given the mandate to preach the Gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15), and make disciples and pupils of the nations (Matthew 28:19). Make this your focus, and experience true fulfillment in your life.</p>
<p>PRAYER</p>
<p>Thank You, blessed Lord, for the Power of the Holy Spirit working in, and through me to bring salvation to others. Preaching the Gospel to those in my world and in the regions beyond is my passion and purpose for living. Today, as the Gospel is preached and taught around the world, many come to the knowledge of Christ, and into their inheritance in Him, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:17).</p>
<p>The new creation didn&#x27;t come from the cross, but from the resurrection of Jesus Christ; we&#x27;re the fruits of His resurrection. When Jesus died, you died with Him. When He was buried, you were buried with Him. When He resurrected, you also arose with Him as a new man, a new species.</p>
<p>Romans 6:4 says, &quot;Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.&quot; Your new life started with the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The old life has been supplanted by this new life, the divine life.</p>
<p>Understand that there&#x27;s no connection between the new creation and your past. In fact, the so-called past doesn&#x27;t exist. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, &quot;Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&quot; Quit judging or appraising yourself on the basis of your past. Your past was nailed to the cross.</p>
<p>In Romans 7:6, the Apostle Paul, stressing our disconnection from the past and old nature, admonished that we serve God in the newness of spirit: &quot;But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not the oldness of the letter.&quot; He also said in Colossians 3:10, &quot;put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, what counts with God is that you&#x27;re born again and are a new creature in Christ Jesus (Galatians 6:15). You&#x27;re now in His class of being; an associate of the God-kind; a partaker of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4). You&#x27;ve been made alive in Christ. All these are as a result of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel (1 Kings 18:46)</p>
<p>There’s such a thing as the speed of the Holy Ghost, where you achieve and accomplish things supernaturally. It’s part of the ministry of the Holy Ghost in our lives: He causes us to accomplish feats that are beyond human comprehension, and in record time.</p>
<p>For example, after the Holy Ghost came on the Apostles, on their first day of evangelism, three thousand souls were won and added to the Church (Acts 2:41)! During their next outreach, five thousand men (women and children not counted) were added to the Church (Acts 4:4). These were supernatural achievements; divine speed in operation.</p>
<p>Today, it’s even greater, because the Bible says the glory of this latter house shall surpass the former (Haggai 2:9). We’re moving with the speed of the Holy Ghost to accomplish extraordinary results for the Kingdom. The Bible says, “For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness” (Romans 9:28)</p>
<p>If you have a project to accomplish, do it with God’s power and speed. You say, “Father, I have this project; I’m going to do it by the power of the Holy Ghost; it’ll be excellent, it’ll be on time, and it’ll create more opportunities for me and others to accomplish greater things for the Kingdom, in the mighty Name of Jesus!”</p>
<p>It’s a new day; it’s the day of the Lord’s power, and great things are happening with us, to us, and through us. We read in our opening verse that Elijah outran Ahab’s chariot. Those horses were the most sophisticated, the best and fastest horses in Israel, because they were the King’s at a time in which horses were required for war.</p>
<p>The glory of the Lord is in your spirit, placing you far ahead of your detractors, competitors, and adversaries. Blessed be God!</p>

<p>If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be (Ecclesiastes 11:3).</p>
<p>As a Christian, you’re a king-priest; the Bible says where the word of a king is, there’s power (Ecclesiastes 8:4). Therefore, keep talking; I don’t mean be loquacious; I mean keep affirming the Word. Jesus said you shall have what you say (Mark 11:23). Therefore, have what I call, “Talking sessions,” where all you do is get into your closet, affirming God’s Word about your life, your future and destiny. Learn to talk your money up; talk your family up; talk your business up; talk your health up</p>
<p>If you don’t know what to say, write out a portion of Scripture on who you are or what belongs to you in Christ, and begin to affirm them. You can also visit Pastor Chris Digital Library to watch and listen to faith building messages; before long, the right words will form in your spirit and proceed from your mouth. Take this seriously, and you’d be amazed at the changes that’ll happen in your life within a short time. That’s because words are things; they have divine potency; they possess spiritual energy.</p>
<p>When you talk, you release energy in the realm of the spirit, in the direction of the substance of the message, because words are vector quantities. I said, “Have talking sessions”; at such times, you’re not merely talking into the air; you’re addressing circumstances and situations, effecting positive changes in your life and future.</p>
<p>From this beginning days of this month, and all through, practise this. Shape and frame the future you want with your words. Store words in the spirit that would produce for you the right harvest at the appointed time. Recall what we read in our theme verse. So, now is the time to saturate your cloud with the right words and rule your world. Amen.</p>
<p>CONFESSION</p>
<p>The Word of God is in my heart and in my mouth; the Word of faith which I’ve received, and it’s producing results in me and in my circumstances. I know who I am, for greater is He that’s in me, than he that’s in the world. I’m an associate of the God-kind; I reign as a king in life. Glory to God!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="obtain-forgiveness--">OBTAIN FORGIVENESS -<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to OBTAIN FORGIVENESS -" title="Direct link to OBTAIN FORGIVENESS -" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#obtain-forgiveness--">​</a></h2>
<p>Pastor Chris~2484</p>
<p>If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>The Bible tells us in Ephesians 1:3 that God has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. Forgiveness is one of these blessings that we&#x27;ve been given in Christ Jesus. God already made forgiveness available to you; what He wants you to do is to obtain forgiveness when you need it; just receive it. This is different from asking God for forgiveness of sin. You don&#x27;t need to keep asking for forgiveness over and again for the same offence; receive His forgiveness as an act of your faith.</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &quot;forgiveness&quot; is &quot;Aphiemi&quot;, which means to let go or have freedom. So, the Father&#x27;s focus is your freedom from sin. By that, I don&#x27;t mean freedom from the bondage of sin, but freedom from sinning. You were already removed from under the bondage of sin and darkness into the Kingdom of God&#x27;s Son when you were born again. You&#x27;ve been declared not guilty, acquitted, and free.</p>
<p>Acts 26:17-18 gives us further insight into God&#x27;s idea about forgiveness. There, the Lord gave Apostle Paul a message for the Gentiles, to open their eyes, &quot;and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me&quot;. Notice the underlined word, &quot;receive&quot;; it derives from the Greek word, &quot;lambano&quot;, which means, &quot;to take possession of&quot;; to take something and make it yours.</p>
<p>Just as you don&#x27;t need to ask for your inheritance in Christ, because it&#x27;s already yours, forgiveness has also been provided for you in the Gospel. The same way you receive an inheritance is how you receive forgiveness, because the verse we read says, &quot;that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.&quot;</p>
<p>If you did something wrong, instead of wondering what to do and thinking whether or not God has forgiven you, receive (&quot;lambano&quot;) forgiveness. Say, &quot;Father I acknowledge that what I did is wrong, and I receive forgiveness in the Name of Jesus&quot; and walk like the Lord&#x27;s free man.</p>

<p>The founder of Loveworld Ministries a.k.a Christ Embassy, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome has blasted Africans who call themselves black. He also condemned the Black Lives Matter movement, IgbereTV reports.</p>
<p>Pastor Chris during a telecast to his members, stated that black means absence of colour and is not associated with any good thing.</p>
<p>He also wondered why Africans who rejected the negro and nigga tag will accept being black when they all mean the same thing.</p>
<p>Pastor Chris said:</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I should tell you something those of you that say black lives matter, I feel sorry for you, do you really believe you have a black life? Do you want me to tell to you the meaning of black? Who called you black? Shouldn&#x27;t you have rejected that from the beginning, a contradiction, a bundle of contradiction, you refused negro and nigga but that&#x27;s what black is, so you took the English version negro means black, do you know what black is?</p>
<p>Tell me, have you ever seen black, do you know the meaning of black? Black means the absence of colour, absence of good, absence of light, absence of direction, that&#x27;s the meaning of black, black is not a colour, is the absence of colour, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re sick don&#x27;t you understand it? So now you call yourself black lives, it&#x27;s about time Africans say to themselves, we&#x27;re not black, because we&#x27;re not black, what is black in your skin?</p>
<p>How black are you? Really? They keep laughing at you as you call yourself black, they keep laughing at you, open any dictionary find out the meaning of black and tell me if you find anything good associated with the word black. Find out, you&#x27;re not black you&#x27;ve got to change it, the same way negro, nigga became a racial slur, black should be labelled a racial slur because it&#x27;s used in connection with your colour because you&#x27;re not black, black is not a colour it&#x27;s the absence of colour, better if you&#x27;re called people of colour it&#x27;s okay, colour is nice, that&#x27;s not a bad one, people of colour but let no one call you black, because black is not good and you&#x27;re not black, compare your skin colour to black your skin colour is not black, the definition of black is not good it&#x27;s been used in destroying you and you&#x27;re using it, it&#x27;s a constant confession.</p>
<p>Listen names matter, if names didn&#x27;t matter God will not change the names of certain people in the Bible, names matter, so when you keep calling yourself black, you&#x27;re calling yourself absence, light is absent, colour is absent, Good is absent, then how would you ever come to a place of brightness, you&#x27;ll always be under, you&#x27;ll always be under. Refuse to be black, you&#x27;re a man of colour a woman of colour that&#x27;s fine not black. Black is not a colour I remind you.&quot;</p>

<p>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned (Matthew 12:37).</p>
<p>Words possess creative energy. Words are things; they have substance and never die. Jesus showed us how to use words. In every miracle He did, in every blessing He imparted, He used words. He spoke, and whatever He said came into existence.</p>
<p>He taught that the most powerful force in life is the force of words and cautioned us not to speak empty, inoperative words (Matthew 12:36). He said in John 6:63, “the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” The same goes for your words; they’re eternal.</p>
<p>Read Romans 10:9 and see the power of words with respect to salvation: “if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” A man will only go to hell or to heaven on the basis of his words. If he spoke the words that God said we should speak for salvation, he’d be saved. But if he didn’t, he’d be damned. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>There’re blessings untold for the one who’s born again, but to enjoy them, you must acknowledge and speak them forth. 1 Peter 3:10 says anyone who wants to enjoy life and see good days must speak wholesomely. Where you are today in life is a reflection of what you’ve been saying all your life.</p>
<p>Therefore, build your life with the right words. Speak words that are consistent with the glorious life of righteousness, peace, health, wealth and joy that you have in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>PRAYER</p>
<p>Thank you, Father, for giving me an extraordinary life of righteousness, peace, success and dominion. I’m indestructible, and in the ageless zone by virtue of your life and glory in me. Your graces, wisdom, and righteousness are revealed in me today, in all I do, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore. (1Kings 4:29).</p>
<p>The word translated “wisdom” above is the Hebrew “Phronesis” and it’s a force that controls you.</p>
<p>It’s a spiritual elixir that locates you within the framework of God’s will, beyond your natural understanding, causing you to do God’s things God’s way, in God’s time for God’s purpose! It’s also a mind-set; an excellent mind-set that causes you to think in a certain way and to say the right things in the right way at the right time for the right purpose in the right place.</p>
<p>This was the wisdom Solomon received from the Lord that caused him to excel in good judgment, so much so that the Bible says, &quot;there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom” (1 Kings 4:34). God gave Solomon an extraordinary amplitude of comprehension; he had practical wisdom.</p>
<p>“Phronesis” propels you to make accurate choices, sound judgments and decisions, and to do things right the first time. You can develop “Phronesis” through studying and meditating on the Word of God and through praying in the Holy Ghost – speaking in tongues.” O, but I thought the Word says Christ has been made unto us wisdom from God?” you might ask.</p>
<p>Yes. But that wisdom is “Sophia” (Greek) which means theoretical wisdom, or insight into reality; it means all the collective understanding of all things. There’s also a third kind of wisdom called “sunesis”; this is critical wisdom; the ability to understand concepts and see relationships between them. It suggests a quickness of apprehension; the penetrating consideration which precedes actions. Whereas, “Phronesis” is practical wisdom; it’s a force that makes you do and say the right things before you even think. God gives you “Sophia” – insight into reality, so that you can have “sunesis” – an understanding, for the purpose of developing in you “Phronesis”; a mind-set for a successful and extraordinary life.</p>

<p>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned (Matthew 12:37).</p>
<p>Words possess creative energy. Words are things; they have substance and never die. Jesus showed us how to use words. In every miracle He did, in every blessing He imparted, He used words. He spoke, and whatever He said came into existence.</p>
<p>He taught that the most powerful force in life is the force of words and cautioned us not to speak empty, inoperative words (Matthew 12:36). He said in John 6:63, “the Words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” The same goes for your words; they’re eternal.</p>
<p>Read Romans 10:9 and see the power of words with respect to salvation: “if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” A man will only go to hell or to heaven on the basis of his words. If he spoke the words that God said we should speak for salvation, he’d be saved. But if he didn’t, he’d be damned. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>There’re blessings untold for the one who’s born again, but to enjoy them, you must acknowledge and speak them forth. 1 Peter 3:10 says anyone who wants to enjoy life and see good days must speak wholesomely. Where you are today in life is a reflection of what you’ve been saying all your life.</p>
<p>Therefore, build your life with the right words. Speak words that are consistent with the glorious life of righteousness, peace, health, wealth and joy that you have in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>PRAYER</p>
<p>Thank You, Father, for giving me an extraordinary life of righteousness, peace, success and dominion. I’m indestructible, and in the ageless zone by virtue of Your life and glory in me. Your graces, wisdom, and righteousness are revealed in me today, in all I do, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed (1 Peter 2:24).</p>
<p>Some Christians find themselves having a conflict between what the Word says and their actual experience. For example, they’ve read and believed our opening verse, yet they’ve battled one ailment after the other and now they’re asking, “What am I supposed to do that I’m not doing?”</p>
<p>A dear lady asked me a similar question, drawing attention to 2 Corinthians 8:9 that says Jesus was made poor that we might be made rich. Then she asked, “If this is true, how come so many Christians are still poor?” She wanted to know what could be done to make that scripture real in their lives.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know: When you were born again, you were brought into a life of absolute prosperity, absolute health, strength and victory; it’s been done already. Whether or not you’re enjoying it is your responsibility.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “work out your own salvation” (Philippians 2:12); meaning that you must live the Word of salvation. Act according to the Word. In Christianity, we do the Word; we’re Word practitioners. You must personalise the Word for yourself and act accordingly.
You’re the one to make the Word real in your life. You’re the one to subdue the circumstances around you. You’re the one to subdue the forces that come against you and the symptoms that try to attack you. You’re the one to use the Word to effect changes.</p>
<p>Things won’t change by themselves; they won’t change because you believe. Believing isn’t enough; to effect the change you need in any area of your life, you must go from believing to faith! You must fight the good fight of faith. The fight of faith is when you consciously live according to the Word of God, irrespective of the circumstances around you and what your senses tell you. It’s when you insist on the Word and hold on to it as the only reality.</p>
<p>CONFESSION
I experience the reality of the Word of God as I meditate on, and live in, the Word! I’m making progress, and circumstances are subdued to conform to the reality of God’s Word for my good. The Word of God has the pre-eminence in my life, and it continually produces in me what it talks about, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge (2 Peter 1:5).</p>
<p>Knowledge in our opening verse is the Greek word, “gnosis,” which is scientific knowledge; knowledge based on science or intellectual activity. God wants you to have, not only revelation knowledge, but also knowledge about life and natural things of arts and science. He wants you to be versatile and open to knowledge. He wants you to be well informed.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean having a penchant for worldly information; rather, it means improving yourself, acquiring the right information that’ll build your personality. Most importantly, He wants you to build your knowledge of His Word. Anyone who ignores knowledge is setting up himself for the hard life. Hosea 4:6 says, “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge” (Hosea 4:6). The knowledge of God’s Word is what puts you over in life. Invest in it.</p>
<p>Be sure to have a good study Bible, and other faith-building teachings in books and digital formats. Avail yourself the opportunity to learn something definite every day—something that’ll challenge, inspire, and cause you to be the best of you. Even now, in studying this devotional, knowledge is coming to you; open your mind to receive the teachings and instructions coming from the Spirit.</p>
<p>Opening your mind to knowledge isn’t just about reading up every available topic in an unguarded manner; no! In reality, the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is the embodiment of all wisdom and knowledge (Colossians 2:3). If you open your heart to Him (the Word) in meditation, you’d be amazed how much knowledge would come to you. Also, having received the Holy Spirit, there’s a wealth of knowledge and wisdom in the recesses of your spirit, and all you have to do is activate them through meditation. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>CONFESSION
Christ is the embodiment of all wisdom and knowledge, and He lives in me. Therefore, there’s no limit to my knowledge. Through meditation, I dig deep into the recesses of my spirit, activating the wisdom and knowledge in me, for witty inventions, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24).</p>
<p>We all have friends, relatives and loved ones—people we relate with, talk with, share with, pray with and whose company we enjoy. Whereas it’s possible for your friends or loved ones to disappoint you or let you down in your hour of need, there’s ONE who never gives up on you. He never fails or disappoints those who trust in Him; His Name is Jesus! What you need is to develop a personal relationship with Him—an intimacy.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that you don’t need to look for Him; He lives in you through the Holy Spirit! Before He ascended, He said, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). In the preceding verses 16 and 17, He said, “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.” So today, you fellowship with Jesus by fellowshipping with the Holy Spirit and with the Word.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit takes the place of the absent Jesus and fosters the extraordinary oneness and communion we have with divinity. You can talk with Him, and He’ll talk to you. He can talk to you inside you, and also talk to you from the outside! He’s the dearest friend you could ever have, and He has the wisdom and ability to guide and lead you triumphantly every day.</p>
<p>He’ll go any length to help you. He already proved it through His death for you on the cross. He never condemns you. Rather, He plucks you out of trouble without laying blames on you, irrespective of the cause. He said, “I am with you always, even unto the end of the world” (Matthew 28:20). What a friend we have in Him! I love Him so much!</p>

<p>Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm (1 Chronicles 16:22)</p>
<p>In the scripture above, God wasn’t just referring to anointed prophets as Moses, Elijah, and Elisha; He was referring to all His kids. We’re His anointed ones! Anyone that dares to touch or harm you will automatically incur God’s wrath, for His watchful eyes of protection are forever upon you. That’s why He admonishes us repeatedly in scripture not to fear.</p>
<p>You’re divinely protected from the peril and evil in the world. The Bible says “A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee (Psalm 91:7). Jesus also said in Luke 10:19“ and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</p>
<p>Understand that your life is hid with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3); therefore, you’re divinely protected. It’s impossible for the enemy to get to you and harm you, for he’ll have to get to God first. God never allows the enemy the opportunity to harm or take advantage of His kids: “He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes” (1 Chronicles 16:21).</p>
<p>For example, God had to rebuke King Abimelech for the sake of His prophet Abraham.</p>
<p>Abimelech had taken Sarah, Abraham’s wife, for himself. But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream and urged him to restore Abraham’s wife, or face the death penalty (Genesis 20:2-3). This shows how much the Father watches over us with holy jealousy.</p>
<p>The Bible says you’re the apple of God’s eye: “For thus saith the Lord of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye (Zechariah 2:8). Since God will not allow anyone poke Him in the eye, it therefore means He won’t allow anyone hurt or harm you. No wonder he says `no weapon formed against you shall prosper’ (Isaiah 54:17).</p>

<p>We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak (2 Corinthians 4:13).</p>
<p>Proclaiming what you already believe in your heart strengthens your spirit and causes the Word to be active in your life. Our confessions of faith change and transform us, causing us to experience the realities of the Gospel in our lives. Therefore, always boldly proclaim the Word in Faith.</p>
<p>Believing what God says and confessing the same will change your life. This is because there’s power in the Word, which gives it the ability to change hopeless situations and cause circumstances to conform to God’s plans and purpose when applied.</p>
<p>God created the world by His spoken word. He said “let there be” (Genesis 1:3, 6, 14), and there was! In other words, whatever He spoke came into being. Hebrews 13:5-6 says, “for he hath said, …So that we may boldly say” He taught us to boldly make our faith proclamations. Jesus taught us the same when He said in Mark 11:23 ‘you shall have whatever you say’</p>
<p>So we learn from Scripture that God talks faith, therefore we ought to be that way for  “as He is, so are we in this world” (1 John 4:17). When you speak God’s Word in faith, the Spirit of God causes it to come to pass. So today, proclaim the Word boldly in faith concerning any challenging situation you may be facing. Remember, what you say is what you get, so speak the Word boldly and create the realities you want to see in your life.</p>

<p>Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them (Romans 16:17).</p>
<p>As a Christian, it’s so important that you avoid wrong associations. Keep away from people that try to corrupt your spirit with negativism, because it’s poisonous to your spirit. The Bible says, “evil communications corrupt good manners” (1 Corinthians 15:33).</p>
<p>Oftentimes, your association could determine whether you’ll be productive or unproductive. You’d consciously have to put away those things or people causing you distractions, to make much progress in life. If you keep company with murmurers and complainers, you’re going to be where they are. So, don’t “sit where they sit”; be different. Be positive and excited about life.</p>
<p>There’re different ways Satan can come into people’s lives to mess things up; he can come through distractions, wrong influences, or wrong associations. It’s therefore important that you protect your spirit from corrupt influences.</p>
<p>Avoid people who peddle rumours, bad news, and only see the negative side of everything. When you separate yourself from distractions, you’re more focused and your fellowship with the Holy Spirit will be enriched. It’s like “refining gold”; removing the leftover impurities after the smelting process, so as to unveil the beauty of the pure gold.</p>
<p>As you identify and eliminate the sources of distractions in your life, your life becomes more inspiring. You become a source of progress and prosperity to others. Praise God!</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear heavenly Father, thank you for the correction and guidance I receive from your Word. By the help of your Spirit, I identify any association that could impede my growth in the things of the Spirit, and I thank you for granting me the courage and confidence to eliminate them, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them (Romans 16:17).</p>
<p>The scripture above admonishes us to mark and avoid those who cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine of Christ. You’ve been taught the love of Christ; you’ve been indoctrinated with the Word of God in a certain direction; continue in the Word. Mark and avoid those who live contrary to the truth of the Gospel; the truth that you’ve been taught. This is God’s instruction. It’s the same warning He gave through the Apostle Paul to the Philippian church; he said, “Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision” (Philippians 3:2).</p>
<p>Now, this admonition is primarily for us to stay away from those in the church who don’t follow the truth, who cause dissension and strife. When you see a sign in a building that says, “Beware of dogs,” the sign isn’t telling you about the dogs outside that building, but the ones inside that particular house. So, when the Apostle Paul said, “Beware of dogs; beware of evil workers; beware of the concision,” he was referring to mischief makers in the Church.</p>
<p>These could be people in the same local church, same cell group, same estate, neighbourhood, office, etc., and they’re Christians. He wouldn’t warn you about them if He didn’t think your association with them would be inimical to your Christian walk. Many have found themselves in serious trouble for fraternizing with the wrong people. The Lord’s admonition is clear: you’re to “mark” and “avoid” mischief makers, not try to change them. Don’t keep company with people who deliberately don’t walk in love, people who engender disunity in the Church; divisive elements who mislead others.</p>
<p>People get messed up when they get involved with a messed up person. 1 Corinthians 15:33 says, “Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.” If you’ve had, or have friends with whom you’re not experiencing any meaningful spiritual progress, or whose friendship hinders your effectiveness in the Gospel, it’s high time you gave up such friendships. Don’t negotiate; just end it, so your participation in the faith—your Christian life—would be effectual as it should be. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Say these words after me, &#x27;Dear Father, thank you, for your Word is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. Through the Word, I’m trained and cultured in the godly life and ways of doing things. I’m filled with thoughts of righteousness, and walk in the path of righteousness, which you prearranged for me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>
<p>Romans 16:17-18 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. 18 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.</p>

Having a strong desire a catalyst for continuous growth and development~2634</p>
<p>Strong desire is necessary in life, its necessary for continuous growth. Strong desire is the response of  human soul to God. If you want immediate response from God, let your desire be strong. One word from God is what you need to take out of this conference.
Isaiah 65:24
That desire for mega church, contact blessing and contact grace have to happen first in the spirit.
1 Samuel 13:14
Psalms 63:1-2
If we thirst after righteousness we will be filled. Its a new phase.
Everyone should be excited about about Christ when you&#x27;re done ministering. You need to put in some effort.
Psalms 63:6
What do you go to bed with? Thoughts of peace or thought of war? When you meditate things happen faster. You can either nurse your desire or quench your desire. Deliberately and consciously nurse your desire for the Lord.
7 things you can do to help you grow in the Lord</p>
<ol>
<li>Desire and study the word; create an appetite for it. 1 Peter 2:2 (AMP)</li>
<li>Walk with those who love the Lord; don&#x27;t associate with worldly friends.
2Timothy 2:2 (TLB)</li>
<li>Be filled constantly with the spirit; also teach our brethren to be filled with the spirit. Our desire will be glory to glory.
You&#x27;re strong for yourself cause you can&#x27;t afford to reach the mark. You&#x27;re strong for others.
Romans 12:11
1 Thessalonians 5:19-24 (AMP)</li>
<li>Reaching out by winning souls; Cultivating habitual prayer life
Isaiah 64:7
You want to multiply churches you can. Is it an assignment you&#x27;re given you can. You can be counted upon. When they try to stop you press through in prayer. If you raise a church that prays... What kinda church are you raise? We&#x27;re raising a praying church.
Saturate the clouds with your prayer. Through prayer we cause the changes that must be seen. You can&#x27;t be a pastor and your brethren can&#x27;t be inspired in prayer.</li>

<p>Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth (John 17:17).</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways a Christian can yield to demonic influences is by believing and acting upon lies. For instance, you received the Holy Spirit by receiving the truth of the Gospel of Christ. You received Christ when you believed God&#x27;s Word; He didn&#x27;t come into you because you ate or swallowed anything; it happened through words. You believed and accepted the words of the Gospel, and Christ took up His abode in your heart. Similarly, demons take up their abode in people when such people accept and believe lies.</p>
<p>When Satan entices people with lies, he comes through those lies into their lives and continues influencing them. That&#x27;s the reason when someone believes a lie, he starts behaving abnormally; be it at home, in church, among his friends or at work. And it all depends on the lie he may have believed and the particular spirit that&#x27;s peddling that lie. When that spirit gets uncomfortable in such a person, he brings in other demons, and then that person&#x27;s condition worsens.</p>
<p>The worst part is, someone who&#x27;s been so deceived, even when presented with evidence of truth, still doesn&#x27;t believe or accept the truth. That&#x27;s an evidence of its demonic nature. Then others would wonder at his behaviour, and the reason he&#x27;s become so twisted. It&#x27;s because an evil spirit has taken over his mind.</p>
<p>But as you learn, and live by the Word, you&#x27;re able to take your stand against satanic influences and manipulations. You&#x27;re able to judge everything with the truth of God&#x27;s Word. Don&#x27;t accept lies. Believe only in the truth. But how can you identify truth?</p>
<p>Truth blesses and uplifts. Truth makes you grow, fills you with love, and makes you walk and talk like Christ! Truth promotes you and promotes those who are with you; it doesn&#x27;t bring confusion, and it carries no hate or bitterness with it. Truth is light. Glory to God!</p>

<p>Yesterday we talked about the righteousness of God.</p>
<p>The righteousness of God as taught in the scriptures is in 3 parts. The less of the understanding of the doctrine of righteousness you have, the less of the manifestation and effective of your God Life.
God doesn’t just want us to have some experiences of the divine life.</p>
<p>He wants us to live the divine life. Just like you were born into this world, you didn’t just have bits of experiences of the human life. You live the human life. It’s not something you get into from time to time.</p>
<p>You’re born into it and live in it. Now that you’re born again, you were born into this life and you have to live it and not just experience of it.
Heb 5:13(KJV, AMP)
Milk is the food for beginners in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>When you hear people say they prayed to God and ask for things, and base it on the words of Jesus when He asked us to ask. That’s for babes. But the babe is unskillful to use the word of righteousness for war.</p>
<p>We can locate your spiritual state with your talking irrespective of how long you’ve been in Church or been a minister.</p>
<p>Divine Acquittal: is the legal part of righteousness. If you don’t understand this legal part, the devil could destroy your life. People have lost so much because of their ignorance or unskillfulness in the doctrine of righteousness.</p>
<p>There is a training in the life of righteousness.
Most Churches never knew the doctrine of righteousness cause they never knew. The scriptures has a perspective of Righteousness
Rom 5:1, Rom 4:20-</p>
<p>If you believe in Jesus Christ, Righteousness will be credited to your account.</p>
<p>You didn’t have to do anything special. This is legal righto. Divine Acquittal.
In the mind of Divine Justice, in the mind of God, as Jesus was on the cross, He was seeing the sins of the whole world.</p>
<p>The woman provides the body, the seed from the man gives life to that body.</p>
<p>A woman never produce seed. Jesus received His body from the woman, but His life came from a different seed.</p>
<p>Gen 3:14–15 however, in this book Genesis, God announced that a woman is going to produce seed. That was the first announcement that a virgin was going to have a seed. And that seed of the woman will be the one to bruise the head of the serpent.</p>
<p>The most significant thing for the body of Christ is the resurrection but the biggest proof of Christ is His ascension.</p>
<p>The most extraordinary thing that happened in the world is the ascension yet the most ignored. The resurrection without the ascension is a problem. Jesus was not the first to be resurrected. It was His final proof.</p>
<p>At His ascension, even His siblings were there. They didn’t believe in Him before now. Even His resurrection didn’t move them.</p>
<p>Jesus proved Himself to be the son of God who came from heaven... you’ve got to tell everybody... because this Jesus who ascended will one day very soon return again. He’s the only one who ever ascended in His body.</p>
<p>Still on Rom 4:25-
Justification is that big word- it means to be declared NOT QUILTY!</p>
<p>This is big news.
Rom 5:1,17
NOTE: The 3 cardinal gifts of God- Eternal Life, Righteousness, The Holy Ghost are not for the Church but the World of men. In the gospel, the call is to everyone. He said go into the high ways and get everyone.</p>
<p>The three cardinal gifts are the major gifts of God, the rest are hinged on these three.</p>
<p>God says, I don’t need you to be so good before you come to be, come as you are and I will clean you all up! 2 Cor 8:9
Jesus took our place. His righteousness was transferred to man, and man’s sins were transferred to Him.
Rom 1:16-17
NOW THAT YOU ARE STANDING IN HIS PLACE, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH IT.</p>
<p>AN understanding of the gospel is important in understanding the doctrine of righteousness because in the gospel is the Righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith.</p>
<p>The gospel is so huge, it’s filled with rooms that filled with so much glory. That’s why prayer is sweet, cause in prayer, you’re translated by faith through the spirit from glor</p>

<p>&quot;The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion&quot; (Proverbs 28:1).</p>
<p>Boldness is a character of the recreated human spirit. It&#x27;s the result of the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in a man. In other words, you can&#x27;t be bold without the Holy Spirit. The Bible says, &quot;For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind&quot; (2 Timothy 1:7). We have the spirit of boldness. Of course you shouldn&#x27;t confuse boldness with foolishness. You shouldn&#x27;t stand in front of a moving vehicle because God says you won&#x27;t die. That&#x27;s not boldness; it&#x27;s foolishness! You don&#x27;t have to prove to anyone that you&#x27;re bold or that God is with you. Rather the Spirit of boldness will rise up in you exactly when you need Him to.</p>
<p>I remember the testimony of a lady&#x27;s encounter with an armed robber who wanted to steal her car. This armed bandit ordered her to stop and get out of her car. Suddenly, boldness welled up from within her and instead of obeying the man, she looked at him eyeball-to-eyeball and said, &quot;You can&#x27;t take my car. In the Name of Jesus Christ, I command you to leave this place!&quot; The man threatened to shoot her if she didn&#x27;t comply with his demands. Again, she repeated the same thing. Then the man squeezed the trigger of his gun, but nothing happened. He tried it again, still nothing happened and he became afraid. The lady quickly raised an alarm and the man was arrested by the police. Glory to God!</p>
<p>God has given you the boldness to walk in knowledge, wisdom and understanding. In Acts 4:13, the Bible records that the apostles Peter and John were associated with Jesus for their boldness. This is the reason I always say that boldness is an evidence of the sons of God!</p>

<p>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified (Romans 8:30).</p>
<p>There’re two destinies for every man. There’s the natural destiny and there’s the divine destiny. Natural destiny is controlled by such factors as the family in which you were born, your country of birth, the people you’re associated with, the information you’ve received or education, etc. All of these have an impact on your natural destiny.</p>
<p>For example, there’re some who are rich, not by virtue of any achievement of their own, but because of the family to which they were born. That’s their natural destiny.</p>
<p>Natural destiny, however, does not exclude the divine mighty hand of God; He has the generic involvement in the world. The world belongs to Him. But some in the world are His creatures, while some others are His children. He has a good will for all His creatures—everyone in the world—but more specifically, He has a divine destiny for His children—everyone who’s born again.</p>
<p>The divine destiny for any man only begins when he’s born again. That’s when God becomes your Father and starts leading you. That’s when He sends His Holy Spirit to live in you and to guide you. The Holy Spirit then takes residence in the quarters of your heart.</p>
<p>You’re thus different from the world. Like Jesus said in John 15:19, &quot;…I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.&quot; Everyone that’s born again is not of this world. You’ve been chosen out of this world by Jesus. He’s got His mark on you.</p>
<p>How can you tell whether a man is fulfilling natural destiny or fulfilling divine destiny? It’s simple: who gets the glory in his life? In the things he does, who gets to be honoured? Who receives the praise? Whose power is behind what he does? For whom does he live? If all the answers turn out to be the Lord, then that’s divine destiny, according to the Bible.</p>

<p>and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever. (Isaiah 32:17).</p>
<p>Our opening verse reminds of the true definition of faith in Hebrews 11:1 which says, “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Faith is the quiet, confident assurance of what we hope for and the reality of things yet unseen. That’s the reason Jesus said, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you” (Matthew 17:20).</p>
<p>The effect of righteousness is faith; mountain-moving faith; with which you affirm that all things are possible unto you, living without fears, worries, conflicts, and agitations. Isaiah 54:14 says, “In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; FOR THOU SHALT NOT FEAR: AND FROM TERROR; FOR IT SHALL NOT COME NEAR THEE.” When you’re established by God in righteousness, you become unshakeable and immovable (1 Corinthians 15:58).</p>
<p>In the underlined portion of the verse above, the word “for” means because or whenever. In other words, you shall be far from oppression because you shall not fear. Why will you not fear? Because the effect of righteousness has produced quietness, assurance, and confidence in you forever; it has secured you in Christ. You’re no longer in the arena of those who’re oppressed by circumstances, situations of life, demon spirits, etc.; you’re not under the oppression of the enemy. Rather, you’re in charge and in control. To walk in the consciousness of God’s righteousness is to walk in glory, dominion, and the strength of God. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>PRAYER</p>
<p>Dear Father, I thank you for the effect of righteousness in my spirit. I’m established in righteousness, therefore, I’m far from oppression and from terror. Nothing is impossible to me, for I walk in the might, dominion and liberty of the Spirit, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;We are the temple of the living God, as God himself says, &quot;I will live with these people and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people&quot; (2 Corinthians 6:16 CEV).</p>
<p>God vacated the temple in Jerusalem when Jesus was crucified. While He was on the cross, the Bible says there was darkness over the earth from noon till three o&#x27;clock; the rocks began to split, and the earth began to quake (Matthew 27:45-51 AMPC). The presence of God had been in the Holy of Holies in the temple, separated from the Holy Place with a thick curtain: 40 feet long, 20 feet high, 4 inches thick! But when Jesus said on the Cross, &quot;It is finished&quot; (John 19:30); the Bible says, that thick curtain was cut from the top to the bottom, and the Holy of Holies was open, and God&#x27;s presence left the building.</p>
<p>Before that day, only the High Priest could enter the presence of God. But when the divine presence returned through the Holy Spirit, the Church was born, the human body became the living tabernacle of God. Now, He lives in us. Glory to God! You&#x27;re the temple of the living God. Every day you walk in this earth, have the consciousness that you&#x27;re God&#x27;s mobile headquarters. With this consciousness, you can never be defeated, because you understand that greater is He that&#x27;s in you than he that&#x27;s in the world. You&#x27;re full of life, from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet. Blessed be God!</p>
<p>Being the temple of God means your lungs, kidneys, heart, and all other organs and systems of your body are filled with the Spirit of God. You&#x27;ve been perfected in Him. This is the consciousness you must have every time, no matter the challenges that come your way. 1 John 4:4 says, &quot;You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.&quot; Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid&quot; (Matthew 5:14).</p>
<p>As a Child of God, you ought to always think of what you can do to make the world a better place. Success is making the world around you better than you met it.</p>
<p>The world needs visionaries: men and women who will step out from the crowd, find a need, and reach out to meet that need. One of the principles of success is to be challenged to make things better than the way you met them. Instead of being the one asking for help and waiting for others to give to you, you should become the helper! Become the one to meet other people&#x27;s needs. Be the blesser and the giver, for that&#x27;s your calling. Always ask yourself, &quot;What can I do to help?&quot; &quot;How can I contribute to the development of my world?&quot; That&#x27;s the mentality of a champion!</p>
<p>The Bible shows us that Joseph stood out in his day and saved the entire nation of Egypt from starvation during a time of famine (Genesis 41:55-57). He didn&#x27;t complain about the famine; he did something about it. This is your season; this is your hour; this is your set time to make a difference in your world. The world ought to be a better place because you came.</p>
<p>Thus, beginning with your sphere of contact, do something to improve your world. It begins with being passionate for a God-idea and having the courage to implement that idea once you receive it. It doesn&#x27;t matter how small the idea may seem, once you have it, run with it. Before long, God will expand your vision and increase your inspiration! He will grant you the motivation and ability to conceive and execute more ideas that&#x27;ll impact the world and make it a better place.</p>
<p>God brought you into this world so that through you, He&#x27;ll touch others with His love and power.</p>

<p>&quot;I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in me&quot; (John 14:30).</p>
<p>The Bible teaches that demon spirits are real, and they can influence, torment and even possess anyone who gives them a chance. That&#x27;s the reason you must not give the devil room or opportunity in your life (Ephesians 4:27), and the way to ensure that is living in the light of God&#x27;s Word. It doesn&#x27;t matter that you&#x27;re a church member or teen leader; there&#x27;re no &quot;no-go&quot; areas for demons. They only bow to God&#x27;s Word. If the Word isn&#x27;t in you, that&#x27;s a slippery slope. God&#x27;s Word is light, and light repels darkness. The Bible admonishes that we walk in the light, as He is in the light.</p>
<p>When you walk in the light of Christ, Satan has nothing in you. In our theme verse, Jesus said, &quot;the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.&quot; It&#x27;s important that you check your life---you look into the mirror of God (His Word)---to examine yourself. Anger, malice, bitterness, etc., are all from Satan, and if you have them in you, you&#x27;re giving him a chance in your life:
&quot;When angry, do not sin, do not ever let your wrath (your exasperation, your fury or indignation) last until the sun goes down. Leave no [such] room or foothold for the devil [give no opportunity to him]&quot; (Ephesians 4:26-27 AMPC).</p>
<p>Anger is a spirit, bitterness is a spirit, hatred is a spirit. These aren&#x27;t just emotions. Just as every part of God has His personality, every part of Satan has his personality. So, refuse to accommodate anything from the devil; rather, walk in the love of Christ; be gracious and kind. Yield your faculties---your entire being---to the Word, and to the Holy Spirit for the glory of God and life of righteousness to be seen and revealed in you.</p>

<p>In line with understanding the message of the Year of PERFECTION, you must understand and put these 4 factors into consideration, in perfecting your life.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ALIGNMENT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COMPLETNESS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EXCELLENCE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FRUITION</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Romans 6:1, 16,  OUR SALVATION.</p>
<p>It is important to study the WORD of God between the lines so that you will understand what the WORD of God says about the main subject matter .</p>
<p>When you are meant to define salvation ,you have to define it in its context.</p>
<p>That is why it&#x27;s important to attend foundation school.</p>
<p>📌 In Christianity you don&#x27;t understand with your mind but you understand with your Spirit.</p>
<p>Christianity is a Spiritual life.</p>
<p>Without the Holy Spirit we can&#x27;t live a Christian life.</p>
<p>As Jesus came out of grave with a new kind of life, we also came out with Him.</p>
<p>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more.</p>
<p>Death has no more dominion over Him , if death has no more dominion Him, therefore it has no dominion over every other part of the body</p>
<p>Mark 15:28 Jesus was numbered with the transgressors.</p>
<p>Therefore reckon, consider, reason, likewise think like this that you are same with Jesus .</p>
<p>Think like God.</p>
<p>God think you are dead to sin and alive unto God. So think the same way.</p>
<p>Romans 6:1 KJV: What shall we say then?</p>
<p>Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? (2) God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p>
<p>There&#x27;s so much in this verses alone.</p>
<p>He asked the question above because he explained the power of grace over works.</p>
<p>Some people study to pass exams in school and that is not enough.</p>
<p>📌 It&#x27;s the same with Christianity, you need to really know it.</p>
<p>For example, what is salvation?</p>
<p>📌 What is redemption?</p>
<p>📌 What is the doctrine of baptism ?</p>
<p>These things are vital.</p>
<p>There are structures put in school to help you grow up fine.</p>
<p>Those who didn&#x27;t really go to school have a way they think.</p>
<p>📌This is the same reason we must go to church and also attend Foundation school .</p>
<p>These structures are very vital.</p>
<p>3 KJV: Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</p>
<p>4 KJV<!-- -->:Therefore<!-- --> we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>
<p>Whenever you see the Word: &#x27;Christ&#x27; used as it is above, it refers to Jesus and his body (the church)</p>
<p>The Word newness of life means a new state of life.</p>
<p>When you got born again, you received a new kind of life and we must walk in it.</p>
<p>When Jesus was on that cross, in the mind of God, we were on that cross. Man was on that cross.</p>
<p>9 KJV<!-- -->:Knowing<!-- --> that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. (10) <!-- -->:For<!-- --> in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. 11 KJV: Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p>Reckon: account, add, log, think.</p>
<p>Mark 15:28</p>
<p>12 KJV<!-- -->:Let<!-- --> not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof 13 KJV<!-- -->:Neither<!-- --> yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let the members of your body be used as instruments of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>Say &#x27;I am alive from the dead.&#x27;</p>
<p>Say &#x27;the members of my body, the parts of my body are instruments of righteousness unto God.</p>
<p>Verse 18. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servant of righteousness.</p>
<p>Halleluiah...</p>

<p>&quot;Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly---mere infants in Christ&quot; (1 Corinthians 3:1 NIV).</p>
<p>&quot;Lazarus has fallen asleep. I&#x27;m going to wake him up&quot; Jesus said to His disciples, two days after Martha, Lazarus&#x27; sister visited.</p>
<p>&quot;Master, if he&#x27;s gone to sleep, he&#x27;ll get a good rest and wake up feeling fine.&quot; His disciples replied, thinking He was talking about taking a nap.</p>
<p>&quot;Then Jesus became explicit: &quot;Lazarus died. And I am glad for your sakes that I wasn&#x27;t there. You&#x27;re about to be given new grounds for believing. Now let&#x27;s go to him&quot; (read John 11:11-14 MSG). Jesus was trying to communicate spiritual truth to His disciples here, but their minds were not yet trained to comprehend such truth, and so Jesus had to plainly tell them, &quot;Lazarus is dead.&quot;</p>
<p>In our opening verse above, Paul reprimanded the Corinthians for being carnal in their communication and understanding. On another occasion, he said to the Christians in Rome, &quot;I have to communicate with you at your level because you&#x27;re yet to come to a higher level of maturity.&quot; He said, &quot;I speak this way, using the illustration of slaves and masters, because it&#x27;s easy to understand&quot; (Romans 6:19 TLB). If the Holy Spirit through Apostle Paul reprimanded them for being spiritually immature, that means His will for us is to be spiritually mature, and one way to know a spiritually mature Christian is through his communication, how he talks.</p>
<p>For instance, you can&#x27;t say &quot;I have a headache&quot; just because you felt one. No! When you come of age, you ONLY ENDORSE AND SAY WHAT YOU HAVE THAT GOD GAVE TO YOU, ACCEPTING NOTHING THAT&#x27;S FROM THE DEVIL! Don&#x27;t talk sickness, even when you feel the symptoms of disease in your body. Use the Word against any pain or anomaly in your body; command it to cease, and it&#x27;ll pass out of your body. Hebrews 13:5-6 says, &quot;for he himself (God) has said...so we may boldly say&quot; Talk only spiritual truth. Speak the Word only, and always.</p>

<p>And the Word (Christ) became flesh (human, incarnate) and tabernacled (fixed His tent of flesh, lived awhile) among us; and we [actually] saw His glory (His honor, His majesty), such glory as an only begotten son receives from his father, full of grace (favor, loving-kindness) and truth (John 1:14 AMPC).</p>
<p>How awesome this is! Jesus, the Word, the ancient of days, became flesh and dwelt among us; that’s Christmas! I can imagine how awe-stricken the people were to see Jesus walk the streets in Bible days, full of grace and truth! The Bible says the disciples beheld His glory; He was resplendent in honour and majesty. The Word, which was, in the beginning of the ages now abides, not just with us but also in us.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us” (Matthew 1:23). He was born “Emmanuel,” but today, He’s the Word alive in us: “Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints…which is Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:26-27). Wow!</p>
<p>Christmas means the abiding Word in you! Now, like Him, you’re the Word in flesh, because you’re born of the Word: “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever” (1 Peter 1:23). James 1:18 declares, “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.” Blessed be God!</p>
<p>The Word became flesh and walked the streets; they beheld His glory, until He was slain. But God raised Him up and showed Him openly with many infallible proofs. Now, He abides in you. He lives in you, and you live through Him! This is the true definition and essence of Christmas: The Word has come. Christ is born. He lived and died, to be born in our hearts. Now He abides in you forever!</p>
<p>The One whose glory and light the Prophets spoke of; the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world; the very essence of life—Christ Jesus—is born in our hearts and He’s alive in you today. Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>&quot;For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end&quot; (Jeremiah 29:11).</p>
<p>God has a plan for your life, an excellent one at that! Remember, He&#x27;s gracious and of loving kindness. Some people keep pets such as dogs, cats, etc. They didn&#x27;t create or give birth to the pets, but they do everything to give them the best of life.</p>
<p>Now, if men would be thoughtful enough to plan a good life and future for their pets, not to mention their biological children, why then should anyone wonder that the Almighty God, who created us, would have a glorious plan for our lives? Ephesians 2:10 (AMPC) says, &quot;For we are God&#x27;s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].&quot;</p>
<p>God&#x27;s plan is the best; your role is to discover that plan and walk in the light of it. As you study and meditate on the Word, you become more and more acquainted with His plan for your life.</p>
<p>Also, you must yield yourself to the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He&#x27;s the One who helps you understand the Scriptures. He grants you insight into the mysteries and realities of the Kingdom. He&#x27;s in you to help you fulfil God&#x27;s plan for your life.</p>

<p>(Be Thankful Always!)</p>
<p>EPHESIANS 5:20 AMP
“At all times and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father.”</p>
<p>Danny had a scowl on his face because he had scored B’s in Economics and Math. “What’s there to be thankful for, when I didn’t get what I wanted?” he fumed. His sense of fulfilment was hinged entirely on getting straight A’s; nothing less could satisfy him or make him happy. He failed to realise there were so many others, just as smart as himself, who didn’t even have the opportunity to study in such a good school as his.</p>
<p>People like Danny fail to appreciate the progress they’ve made, or the blessings of God in their lives. They’re constantly troubled by and fixated on their self-perceived flaws and inadequacies. They’re quick to complain, “I haven’t got what I want yet!” Truth is, there’re always things to be grateful for, and you’ve got to identify them and be thankful for them.</p>
<p>The air you breathe and the life you live today are enough reason for you to be thankful. Think about the knowledge you’ve acquired so far. Haven’t you learnt something new? Hasn’t your prayer life become richer? What about those times the Lord saved you from trouble, and the times He guided you on how to handle a difficult situation? You’ve got to consider all these as blessings and improvements the Spirit of God has brought into your life, centre your mind on them and be excited about what He has accomplished in you!</p>
<p>Learn to be content with what the Lord has blessed you with, and please Him in all things. Serve Him joyfully, irrespective and independent of circumstances. Put Him first in your life and be thankful and excited about your life, and how He’s leading you.</p>
<p>PRAYER FOR YOU
Dear Lord, I acknowledge your faithfulness towards me! You’ve qualified me to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. Thank you for making my life the effulgence of your righteousness, beauty, wisdom, and grace, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly (Joel 2:15).</p>
<p>People fast for different reasons. Some fast because they want to get an answer from God, thinking their fasting would compel Him to answer them. They see fasting as a means of getting God to do something He ordinarily wouldn’t have done, had they not fasted. That’s the wrong idea about fasting. I do fast, but I don’t fast to get God to do something for me.</p>
<p>If you’re fasting so that God will do something for you, then you’re doing it for the wrong reason, because He’s done everything for you already. He already said, “All things are yours” (1 Corinthians 3:21); so what then is the purpose of fasting? You should fast, primarily, because its good spiritual exercise designed to bring the flesh under subjection of the spirit.</p>
<p>Fasting gets you attuned to the Spirit to hear what God is saying, and be guided to do His will and follow His purpose for your life. Fasting helps you to align with God’s will and purpose, and positions you rightly for God’s Word to come to you. God may have been speaking to you and you may have not been picking His signals. However, through fasting you become sensitive and ready to receive the guidance and direction He’s giving you.</p>
<p>Secondly, and very importantly, you should fast as an act of worship to the Lord. You can decide you just want to give the Lord a lot of attention, to love and cherish Him for some number of days or over a period. At such times you stay away from everything else, especially food, and just focus on Him, fellowshiping with Him.</p>
<p>As you prepare for the coming year, take time to fast and pray; but let it be an opportunity to love and appreciate the Lord. Let it be a time to celebrate the Word and make your faith effectual by acknowledging the good things the Lord has done in you, and for you, in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>“Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled” (MATTHEW 5:6)</p>
<p>Years ago, I attended ministers’ meetings to hear God’s Word. I was a young lad then and most probably the youngest in those meetings, but I was so hungry for the Word. There were times I would pray to God, “Please, don’t let them send me out!” Thank God He answered my prayers because those meetings inspired me a great deal and motivated me for what I’m doing today.</p>
<p>It’s our responsibility to nurture our desire for God’s Word. The apostle Peter said, “Like new born babies you should crave (thirst for, earnestly desire) spiritual milk”  (1 Peter 2:2 AMP). The milk is the Word of God (Hebrews 5:13). When you were born again you were born with a strong desire for God and His Word, but this desire can either be quenched or nurtured depending on what you feed your mind on.</p>
<p>You have to put a priority on the Word of God above every other thing. The first Christian leaders’ conference I attended was over twenty years ago. I remember I earnestly prayed after every session, going over what was shared because I wanted those truths to be deeply rooted in my heart. I don’t remember any of my roommates because my priority was God and His Word. There were times I missed meals in order to get in early for the meetings. Those meetings changed my life forever because several questions in my mind were answered with a lot of revelations.</p>
<p>The Word can yield the same result in your life when your desire is strong enough. Desire is the longing of the soul. Whatever you sow into your mind is what your soul will long for. So you see, your mind can be trained with the Word of God and that’s what the Spirit of God wants us to do.

<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1)</p>
<p>One of the extraordinary ways the Lord manifests Himself is in and through the Word. The Word of God created the universe. The Word of God is life. The Word of God is power. The Word of God is light. The Word of God is truth. The Word of God is God. Where the Word of God is, God is!</p>
<p>The Word of God isn’t like the word of a man. Centering your mind on the Word is centering your mind on God. The Bible says He keeps in perfect peace—peace of prosperity—the one whose mind is stayed on Him (Isaiah 26:3). The way to stay your mind on Him is meditating on the Word.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit never does anything without the Word. For example, in Genesis chapter one, we read that in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. But the earth was without form and was empty and covered with darkness. Then the Spirit of God moved over the face of the waters, but nothing changed. The earth was still a chaotic mass until God said, “Let there be light” and light became. The Spirit of God caused the light to manifest. He acted on the Word. Until the Word is given, the Spirit does nothing.</p>
<p>Don’t ignore the Word; some Christians ignore the Word, and that’s so unwise. What you need for your next level or that miracle and promotion you so desire; what you need to prevail in any crisis and live victoriously every day, is the Word.</p>
<p>When you face challenges, when things get tough and rough, keep your confidence in the Word. Refuse to compromise. Get radical with your faith-affirmation and confession of the Word. As you speak, the Spirit will cause things to happen in accordance with your words, because the Word of God in your mouth is God talking! It’ll always prevail. Glory to God</p>

<p>&quot;If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be&quot; (Ecclesiastes 11:3).</p>
<p>As a Christian, you&#x27;re a king-priest; the Bible says where the word of a king is, there&#x27;s power (Ecclesiastes 8:4).</p>
<p>Therefore, keep talking; I loquacious; I mean keep affirming the Word. Jesus said you shall have what you say (Mark 11:23). Therefore, have what I call, &quot;Talking sessions,&quot; where all you do is get into your closet, affirming God&#x27;s Word about your life, your future and destiny. Learn to talk your money up; talk your family up; talk your business up; talk your health up.</p>
<p>If you don&#x27;t know what to say, write out a portion of Scripture on who you are or what belongs to you in Christ, and begin to affirm them. You can also visit Pastor Chris Digital Library to watch and listen to faith-building messages; before long, the right words will form in your spirit and proceed from your mouth. Take this seriously, and you&#x27;d be amazed at the changes that&#x27;ll happen in your life within a short time. That&#x27;s because words are things; they have divine potency; they possess spiritual energy.</p>
<p>When you talk, you release energy in the realm of the spirit, in the direction of the substance of the message, because words are vector quantities. I said, &quot;Have talking sessions&quot;; at such times, you&#x27;re not merely talking into the air; you&#x27;re addressing circumstances and situations, effecting positive changes in your life and future.</p>
<p>From the beginning days of the New Year, and all through, practise this. Shape and frame the future you want with your words. Store words in the spirit that will produce for you the right harvest at the appointed time. Recall what we read in our theme verse. So, now is the time to saturate your cloud with the right words and rule the world. Amen.</p>

<p>Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord (1 THESSALONIANS 4:17).</p>
<p>By the Spirit, the Apostle Paul got the revelation of the rapture of the Church and said, “Behold, I shew you a mystery” (1 Corinthians 15:51). This is why many don’t understand the Rapture; it’s a mystery; divine revelation. He said, “We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, IN A MOMENT, IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed” (1 Corinthians 15:51-52).</p>
<p>The underlined portion shows how fast the Rapture will happen; it’ll be so fast there’d be no time for those who weren’t prepared, because it’s something for which you should have been prepared all your life.</p>
<p>In our theme verse, we find an expression that’s synonymous with the term, “Rapture”; it’s the phrase, “caught up” which is from the Greek word, “harpazo.” ̄It means to seize, catch (away, up), pluck, pull, take by force.</p>
<p>At the Rapture, it makes no difference where you are, the power of God will snatch you away from this world. Christians who had died will be resurrected, and together with them, we’ll be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord. What a day that will be!</p>
<p>When is this going to take place? It’s closer than ever; it’s going to be anytime soon. Your responsibility is to be prepared by living your life for the Lord, every day. Keep walking in love, and your faith activated to be caught up to be with the Lord at His appearing.</p>
<p>The Bible says He’s coming for a Church without spot, wrinkle, blemish or any such thing (Ephesians 5:27). Live every day, every moment of your life in His righteousness, producing works and fruits of righteousness</p>
<p>CONFESSION
The Lord Jesus is coming for a Church without spot, wrinkle, blemish or any such thing, and I’m ready. My faith is activated to be caught up to be with the Lord forever!

<p>&quot;But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble&quot; (JAMES 4:6)</p>
<p>When God promotes you, He increases His grace on your life. With that increased grace, you&#x27;re able to accomplish much more. Grace gives you greater ability and opens doors for you. But something very important about grace that you must be conscious of is that it craves recognition.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the name, &quot;Grace&quot; is most commonly answered by ladies. It sort of explains something about grace: it&#x27;s ladylike; something alluring. A beautiful lady likes to be recognized; she dresses adorably because she likes to be acknowledged. That&#x27;s really how grace is. If you fail to recognize grace, it&#x27;ll cringe; it&#x27;ll withdraw and cease to function.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s part of the reason some Christians aren&#x27;t seeing the manifestation of grace in their lives as they should. Learn to celebrate grace. Consciously acknowledge that you&#x27;re full of grace, surrounded with divine favour everywhere, and every day. You&#x27;ll be amazed at the increased blessings and manifestations of the Spirit you&#x27;ll experience in your life.</p>
<p>Remember, the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of grace; so, in celebrating grace, you&#x27;re celebrating Him. Therefore, He&#x27;ll keep manifesting Himself---His beauty and glory---in your life. Suddenly, you find that you&#x27;re being called and chosen for jobs, blessings, promotions and positions you didn&#x27;t even qualify for. Even people who profess not to like you will be doing good things for you. That&#x27;s the power of grace.</p>
<p>Even now, God&#x27;s grace is increased in your life, causing His glory to be revealed in all that you do, ushering you into your next level of greatness and promotion. Receive it. Celebrate it. Affirm it. Glory to God!</p>

<p>&quot;But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me&quot;(JOHN 15:26).</p>
<p>In the scripture above, the Lord Jesus gives us a beautiful description of who the Holy Spirit is. He calls Him the Spirit of truth &quot;which proceeds from the Father!&quot; That&#x27;s the description of an unlimited personality. In other words, whenever the Father needs to move from point A to point B, His Spirit proceeds from out of Him. The Father never leaves His throne; He doesn&#x27;t ever have to get up from there to get somewhere! That&#x27;s why He can be at different places at the same time, doing different things and yet be one and the same God.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit is at point A, He&#x27;s there as though He&#x27;s nowhere else; meanwhile He&#x27;s at point B at the same time, doing something completely different from what He&#x27;s doing at point A. While He&#x27;s at point B, He&#x27;s fully there as though He&#x27;s not anywhere else. He&#x27;s such an unlimited personality; He&#x27;s infinite!
If while at point B, He ever wanted to do something else at point C, He wouldn&#x27;t have to move away from point A or B; He simply proceeds from Himself to point C while still at points A and B. While at point C, there may be some fellow who wants to receive the Holy Ghost at point D. Again, He wouldn&#x27;t have to stop what He&#x27;s doing at points A, B, and C to attend to that fellow. He simply proceeds there, while remaining at points A, B, and C, doing what He was doing as though He wasn&#x27;t anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>This is the reason He can be in me, in you, and in every one of God&#x27;s children. He&#x27;s such an awesome personality. He can be everywhere at the same time. When He&#x27;s with you, it&#x27;s as though that&#x27;s the only place He is in the whole world. He relates with you as though you&#x27;re His only child. He&#x27;s never in a hurry when He&#x27;s with you! He never says &quot;Hold on, I&#x27;ve got to attend quickly to something else over there.&quot; No, He never leaves! When He needs to be anywhere else, He proceeds over there and remains with you fully, carrying out His ministry in your life. While He&#x27;s working in you, He&#x27;s working in every believer all over the world at the same time because His reach is infinite, His power immeasurable and His personality unlimited. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth&quot; (LUKE 15:10)</p>
<p>Our purpose for remaining on earth today is to win souls unto the Lord and mature in Christ. We’re not here just to accumulate wealth and riches that’ll perish with this world, these aren’t of any eternal value. When you study the earthly ministry of the Lord Jesus, you’ll observe that reaching the people was the focus of His ministry. An example was when He took time to preach to the woman at the well, even though He was very tired and hungry (JOHN 4:5-26).</p>
<p>When the disciples saw the way His face lit up as He spoke to the woman, they were convinced He had eaten something. When they asked Him about it, His response was, “My meat (food) is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work” (John 4:34); put differently, “My nourishment is to win souls.” Just like Jesus, I love to win souls; I love to tell people about His love for mankind. This is the reason we’re reaching people through every available means with this gospel of the grace of God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, “I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth” (Luke 15:10), and He used the parable of the prodigal son to elucidate on this statement. This parable is of utmost importance. Consider the father’s response to his son’s return and the ensuing homecoming celebration. You see, every time you win a soul to the Lord, you’re creating much celebration in heaven. Just as the Lord Jesus said, there’s much rejoicing in heaven when a soul converts to the Lord. The angels celebrate so much over one sinner that repents because that’s the purpose for the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The Bible says the Lord is unwilling that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9), and for this reason He patiently waits for us to win them. Make soulwinning your utmost priority today; let your mind be preoccupied with it. Begin to come up with effective strategies to win more and more people to the Lord. Let’s make it an endless celebration for the angels, and the hosts of heaven.</p>

<p>&quot;For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the  world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith:&quot; (1 JOHN 5:4)</p>
<p>Faith is the victory that has overcome the world! There’s no battle left for any of God’s children to fight. Every battle has been fought and won by Jesus. All He expects today is for us to live in the realm of the finished works by maintaining the victory He obtained for us through His death, burial, and resurrection. We maintain that victory by consistently taking our stand in faith against sickness, disease, poverty, death and every other manipulation of the devil.</p>
<p>You must completely reject anything that hurts or binds because you’ve been delivered from all the oppression of the enemy. Life in Christ is a super-life; it’s a daily expression of victorious and triumphant living! 2 Corinthians 2:14 says, “Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ” (NKJV). Notice it doesn’t say we’re triumphant sometimes, but always, glory to God!</p>
<p>There’s no defeat for the Christian. A true Christian doesn’t fail in life; he’s an allround success. When you come to that level where faith becomes your conscious lifestyle, you’ll never have cause to despair or give room to despondency in your life. You will not blame anybody for whatever problems you find yourself facing, because you’ll discover that you’re responsible for whatever happens to you. Nobody can make you poor, sick, or subject to the low life of a victim as you operate daily by faith! Faith—your faith—is the victory that overcomes the world and it’s systems, Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Set your AFFECTION on things above, not on things on the earth&quot; (COLOSSIANS 3:2).</p>
<p>Even though &quot;affection&quot; is quite a good and strong rendering in the verse above, the Greek word, &quot;phroneo&quot; is a little more practical. It means to set your mind or your thinking; an activity of the mind; how your mind works. It originates from two words; one meaning, &quot;To reign in,&quot; like you say, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to reign this fellow in&quot;; that is, to bring him under control. The second word means, &quot;To block in or fence in.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus, the admonition to set your affection on things above means to have control on your mind and consciously set your thinking on spiritual things. Remember that the things you think about are the things that will control your actions.</p>
<p>For example, you may have been wrestling with certain habits; habits that affect the way you serve and live for the Lord; habits that reduce your effectiveness and efficiency. You might have prayed about it, yet, nothing seemed to have changed. It&#x27;s not so much about prayer as it&#x27;s about the use of your mind! Your mind is a very powerful machine; you can twist or control it any way you choose. So, what you must do is to first, consciously refuse to think on those things you know aren&#x27;t wholesome, and deliberately focus your mind on the Word.</p>
<p>Practise exercising your mind through conscious thought. If, for whatever reason, an unwholesome thought comes to you, say, &quot;No,&quot; and then, switch your mind to something excellent; to the Word. Don&#x27;t be surprised if such thoughts creep in again; resist it and repeat the process. James 4:7 says &quot;Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&quot; God knows what&#x27;s in the devil, and He tells us if we resist him, he&#x27;ll flee; that&#x27;s got to be the necessary result!</p>
<p>Exercise your mind to develop a liking for spiritual things; exercise your interests in the things of God. Attend church services. Study and meditate on the Word. Maintain a robust prayer schedule. Win souls. These are spiritual activities to consciously engage in, in training yourself to &quot;reign-in&quot; your outward man! Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;By the God of your father, Who will help you, and by the Almighty, Who will bless you with blessings of the heaven above, blessings lying in the deep beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb&quot; (GENESIS 49:25 AMP).</p>
<p>When you set your attention on the Holy Spirit, you open yourself to the anointing of God&#x27;s Spirit for God&#x27;s greater blessings. The anointing of the Holy Spirit is not just for healing the sick and casting out devil. Those are just the outward signs of an inner life. The anointing of the Holy Spirit is to help you do what ordinary men can&#x27;t do and see what they can&#x27;t see. This is called the grace of God, which is the beauty and glory of God. This grace comes over your life and separates you from the general class.</p>
<p>Remember, the Bible says Joseph was separated from his brothers by grace (Genesis 49:26). Grace found him, nominated him, and separated him for victory and the greater blessing. When you&#x27;re thus separated, located, and nominated by grace, it doesn&#x27;t matter who your adversaries are, you&#x27;ll always prevail. God, by choice, called Abraham. Referring to him, He said, &quot;Abraham, My friend.&quot; In the same way, He chose David by grace to be king over Israel. David had nothing to do with this nomination as king; grace located him in the field as he kept his father&#x27;s sheep, separated him from his brothers, and made him king.</p>
<p>When you study about David, you&#x27;d discover that he was the first king in Israel to recognize the anointing. Saul, his predecessor, didn&#x27;t recognize the anointing but David did; he danced under it, sang under it and prophesied with it. Just as these men were separated by grace, you also were set apart from the rest of the world by grace. You&#x27;re ordained to live in all the blessings of the Lord. You didn&#x27;t ask for it but it was made available to you by the anointing of God&#x27;s Spirit. This was God&#x27;s plan when He said to the children of Israel, &quot;I&#x27;m taking you to houses that you didn&#x27;t build; I&#x27;ll give you wells you didn&#x27;t dig.&quot;</p>
<p>All you need to do is set your attention on the Holy Spirit and get acquainted with Him through the Word and fellowship, and He&#x27;ll bring you to that place of rest in Christ where you function by grace.</p>

<p>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him (1 JOHN 2:15).</p>
<p>There’s a type of spirit that many Christians are oblivious of, and the Bible talks about it in 1 Corinthians 2:12; it’s “the spirit of the world”: “Now we have received, not THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.” This spirit is responsible for worldliness amongst Christians. That’s the spirit that tries to set trends—the trends of the world.</p>
<p>When Christians aren’t careful, they find themselves moving with those trends of the world; what the world says, how things are done, not realising they’re being swayed by the spirit of the world into worldliness. We can use certain things in the world without following what the Bible calls, “The fashion of this world” that passes away (1 Corinthians 7:31).</p>
<p>The fashion of this world refers to the trend of this world, and it’s under the spirit of the world. Remember that Satan is the god of this world’s system. So, when our theme verse says, “Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world,” that’s what it’s talking about. Refuse to be controlled or influenced by the systems of this present world. Jesus said you’re in the world, but not of the world. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Some people today are drifting; they’re born again, but they’ve been conquered by the world. They don’t have the Gospel-motive. Your motivation in life should and must be Christ Jesus and the purpose for which He died. Don’t let your focus be on the transient things of this failing world, for none of its so-called “trends” can give you true joy.</p>
<p>Paul said in Galatians 6:14, “But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.” This is the attitude that you must have.</p>
<p>PRAYER FOR YOU
Dear Father, I thank you for the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, by whom I navigate my way through life. I refuse to be swayed by the spirit of the world, for I’m not enticed by the fashion or trends of this world. I’m from above, and my mind is set on things above, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>[And it is indeed, a source of immense profit, for] godliness accompanied with contentment (that contentment which is a sense of inward sufficiency) is great and abundant gain (1 TIMOTHY 6:6 AMPC).</p>
<p>The Bible defines contentment for us in our opening verse as “a sense of inward sufficiency”; then it says that “godliness accompanied with contentment is great and abundant gain.” Paul, by the Spirit, further writes, “For we brought nothing into the world, and obviously we cannot take anything out of the world; But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content (satisfied). But those who crave to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish (useless, godless) and hurtful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction and miserable perishing” (1 Timothy 6:7-9 AMPC).</p>
<p>This is the ordeal of those who struggle to be rich. But you shouldn’t get into that dilemma as a child of God, because being born again, you’ve entered into a life of contentment. You’ve ceased from your struggles and the glory of God now works within you.</p>
<p>The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 8:9, “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.” And in Proverbs 10:22, it says, “The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.” This is your life as a child of God! God’s inherent blessing in your life is the basis for your riches.</p>
<p>Your prosperity is inherited through the Spirit, because you’re the seed of Abraham. In Christ, you have entered into God’s rest. You no longer worry over your rent and other bills. As Abraham’s seed, you’re ever aglow, full of praise and giving glory to God.</p>
<p>Function from a place of inward sufficiency, and operate from a vantage position of rest and satisfaction, irrespective of circumstances. No matter the situation, be full of joy; continue to praise, serve the Lord, and delight yourself in Him. He’ll create the opportunities for you to keep making progress from glory to glory.</p>
<p>CONFESSION FOR YOU
Dear Lord Jesus, I acknowledge you as the Lord of my life; you’re the Lord over my choices, desires, plans, and purposes. Always and at all times, I function from a place of inward sufficiency, and operate from a vantage position of rest and satisfaction, irrespective of circumstances. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain&quot; (Psalm 127:1).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, it doesn&#x27;t matter what your efforts are, they are in vain without the Lord. That means you can&#x27;t do anything of eternal worth without the help of the Holy Spirit. This truth is also reiterated in John 15:5 when the Lord Jesus said, &quot;I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: FOR WITHOUT ME YE CAN DO NOTHING.&quot;</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t go through life struggling on your own. Let God&#x27;s Spirit touch your life with His power; let Him fill you with His glory. He knows about your job, business or academics more than you could ever imagine. He&#x27;s not averse to science or technology. Truth is, He originated them, and He can give you wisdom to &quot;find out knowledge of witty inventions&quot; (Proverbs 8:12). Jesus said, &quot;If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth&quot; (Mark 9:23).</p>
<p>If you can only trust the Holy Spirit, there&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t do; His power will work through your life in a tremendous way and you both will form an unbeatable team! Therefore, don&#x27;t leave Him out of anything you&#x27;re doing. He was sent as your Helper, Strengthener, Guide, Instructor, Teacher and so much more. Let Him carry out His ministry in your life today. He&#x27;s the healing power and the lifting power that you need. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts (ZECHARIAH 4:6).</p>
<p>True success is spiritual, and based on spiritual principles. If you’re going to be successful in anything, you must learn to take charge from the realm of the spirit, and the primary way to do that is through prayer. When you learn to bow your knees and discipline yourself to pray, there’ll be nothing you can’t change or achieve.</p>
<p>Some Christians think life is a joke; they pray three minutes and they’re done. Even while they’re praying, they’re distracted by everything else; then at the end of the day, they wonder why certain things happened that has made them victims in life. Discipline yourself to pray; make it a conscious part of your routine. Your nightmares will be over once you discover the efficacy of prayer. When you take charge and change things in the realm of the spirit, they’ll manifest in the earth-realm. When Deborah and Barak fought against Sisera and his armies, the Bible says, “They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20).</p>
<p>The spirit realm is where you set the circumstances of your life to control whatever happens in the natural world, and laugh your way through. You become like David—a mystery and a wonder to your world! Glory to God!</p>
<p>PRAYER FOR YOU
Precious Father, I thank you for the opportunity to receive the ministration of your Spirit through prayer. As I give attention to commune with you, my eyes are open to spiritual realities, and your thoughts are unveiled to my spirit, causing me to walk in dominion, victory and ever-increasing glory, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance and in everything, by prayer and petition (definite requests), with thanksgiving, continue to make your wants known to God (Philippians 4:6 AMPC).</p>
<p>Around the world today, many are terrified, not just about the future, but even about the present. There’s fear and terror, but the word “terror” isn’t new. If you study the Bible, you’d be amazed at how many times it talks about terror. Nevertheless, Jesus assured us of victory over all crises. He said in John 16:33, “In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”</p>
<p>There’s no need for you to have anxiety or panic-bouts over anything; you’ve already overcome Satan, the world and every crisis: “Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world” (1 John 4:4). Therefore, stop the fear. Stop the anxiety. Anxiety refers to worry; it’s a state of nervousness. But our theme verse says, “Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything”</p>
<p>If you say, “But I can’t help being worried,” then you’re accusing God of lying to you. You’re accusing Him of asking you to do something you couldn’t do. The fact that He says, “Don’t be anxious,” means you can live without anxiety. Your response, therefore, should be, “Blessed be God! I live in the peace and provisions of Christ; I do not fret! He has perfected all that concerns me. Hallelujah!” That’s how you respond to God.</p>
<p>Refuse to have anxiety about your son, your daughter, your husband, your wife, your brother, your sister, your house rent, your health, your job, business, education, or about anything! When you do, the Bible says the peace of God that’s beyond human comprehension will garrison your heart and mind in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:7). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>PRAYER FOR YOU
Dear Father, thank you for your Word that stirs faith in my heart and dispels fear and anxiety. I reject every thought of fear, for I’m shielded from the pain and darkness in the world. Greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world. I’m full of might by the Spirit of the Lord, for the peace of God which passes all understanding mantles my heart and mind, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said: I will dwell in them And walk among them. I will be their God, And they shall be My people&quot; (2 CORINTHIANS 6:16 NKJV).</p>
<p>The real essence of Christianity is the fact that Christ literally lives in you by the Holy Spirit. That&#x27;s the reason Jesus came, to make fellowship and oneness with God possible. Through that fellowship, we were given eternal life---the life and nature of God. Therefore, you&#x27;re by no means an ordinary person. You&#x27;re full of God; full of His love, His grace and His wisdom.</p>
<p>This has to become a reality in your spirit; otherwise, you won&#x27;t be living the true Christian life. You have to be Christ-in-me conscious. I&#x27;m referring to a consciousness about life where all you know is Christ; everything you see is Christ.</p>
<p>The Bible says Christ is your life (Colossians 3:4). Christ is everything. Functioning with this mindset will literally transport you to the realm where you have no consciousness of need, failure or fear; you&#x27;re on top and in victory every day, every hour, every minute and every second, because you carry God in you! You and God are the eternal winning team. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>But because many aren&#x27;t &quot;Christ-in-me&quot; minded, they struggle through life, &quot;looking&quot; for God; &quot;going&quot; to Him, and reaching out to Him for help. Whereas the Bible says, &quot;Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world&quot; (1 John 4:4). Everything and anything you could ever need is inside the greater One that lives in you. What you need is to become conscious of His indwelling presence and the wisdom He pilots you with for success and greatness.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t ask Him for wisdom; He&#x27;s your wisdom (1 Corinthians 1:30). Don&#x27;t ask Him for help; He&#x27;s your Help and Helper. Don&#x27;t ask Him for strength; He&#x27;s your strength. Don&#x27;t go anywhere without the consciousness that you&#x27;re a God-carrying vessel. You&#x27;ll be amazed at the sudden transformation: the grace, divine aura, influence and power that you&#x27;ll exude. Why? In the spiritual realm, the first principle is knowledge; the second is consciousness, and the third is speaking, voicing. That&#x27;s the reason this knowledge is coming to you today, for you to have the consciousness that you carry God in you, and then declare accordingly.</p>

<p>&quot;if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness...Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever&quot; (1 KINGS 9:4-5)</p>
<p>God spoke to Solomon as he was building the temple. He promised to establish his kingdom over Israel forever and all Solomon needed do was to walk before God as David, his  father did (1 Kings 9:4). How did David walk? He walked in integrity of heart!</p>
<p>David was a man of his words. He walked with God with a perfect and upright heart, and also fulfilled every vow he made. Integrity is not in your dressing or physical gait, it is bringing out the glory of God that’s in you; that is, in your human spirit. How? It is by upholding God’s Word; living out the Word in your heart!</p>
<p>Job is another man who walked in integrity of heart toward God. He trusted God and refused to speak ill in spite of the calamity that befell him. He was the richest man in his region, but he lost all his wealth and his children in one day. Nevertheless, he said, “My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me” (Job 27:4-5).</p>
<p>Some put their trust in horses and some in princes but those that put their trust in the living God shall never be put to shame. Don’t ever put your trust or confidence in man, rather put your confidence in God. He’s the only one that can build up your life and move you to another realm, a higher level. Wake up every morning confident of His love for you and walk with Him in the integrity of heart.</p>

<p>&quot;And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, FEAR NOT; I AM THE FIRST AND THE LAST&quot; (REVELATION 1:17)</p>
<p>When you study the Scriptures, you find that always, God tells us, &quot;Fear not&quot;; be it morning, noon or night; irrespective of what you hear or the symptoms you might be feeling, He doesn&#x27;t want fear in your heart. That&#x27;s because He knows all things; He knows the future and can see that nothing is set against you or could harm you. He&#x27;s the eternal God and lives in eternity. He sees the end from the beginning.</p>
<p>Therefore, even when you seem troubled about something and want Him act right away, He&#x27;s unruffled and never in a hurry, because He already saw that you prevailed. Your future is history to Him. When you study the story of Abraham, you&#x27;d observe the Lord giving him the history of his future; He said to him, &quot;a father of many nations have I made thee&quot; (Genesis 17:5). At this time, Abraham had no child; but in the mind of God, it was already a settled fact. His future was history to God.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the same with you today. Have no fears, because He&#x27;s seen everything and knows there&#x27;s nothing in front of you that&#x27;s capable of defeating or destroying you. Nothing! It makes no difference where you are or where you live in this world; there&#x27;re no limitations on your path. All God wants is that you follow His Word. His Word guarantees your victory, prosperity and success.</p>
<p>His Word is your weapon against all adversary and adversity. His Word is the sword of the Spirit. If you&#x27;d live by His Word, and keep it in your mouth, nothing can stop you. Therefore, take away the limits. Say to yourself, &quot;All limitations are gone from my mind! I can, and would be all that God wants me to be. I&#x27;M A SUCCESS!&quot; Glory to God!</p>

<p>&quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen&quot; (2 Corinthians 13:14)</p>
<p>Every relationship without communication suffers; be it relationship with your children, your spouse, your co-workers, or with God.</p>
<p>Communication---good and frequent communication---helps or enhances relationships. If you have a relationship with someone you don&#x27;t talk with, that relationship will suffer setbacks. No matter how proximate you may be to that person, without continually exchanging thoughts by talking to each other, your relationship won&#x27;t grow.</p>
<p>This is the reason we&#x27;re to constantly fellowship with the Lord through prayer. Our opening scripture says, &quot;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and THE COMMUNION OF THE HOLY GHOST, BE WITH YOU ALL.&quot; This is an indication of the kind of relationship we&#x27;re to cultivate with the Holy Spirit; a communion; a sharing together. The Father and the Son are in heaven, but the Holy Spirit is here with us. Hence, He&#x27;s the God we know and relate with in the earth today, and He lives in us, fostering this extraordinary communion with divinity.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no other way to develop an intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit aside communing with Him constantly in prayer, and through meditation on the Word. Consciously create time to talk to and with Him the same way you&#x27;ll perhaps schedule to talk to a friend, colleague or loved one.</p>
<p>Remember, the Holy Spirit is a Person with emotions, will and intellect; therefore relate with Him as such. The highest means of communication with Him is by speaking in tongues; and as you do, He&#x27;ll make the presence of God real to you and the miraculous your constant experience.</p>

<p>&quot;Never lag in zeal and in earnest endeavor; be aglow and burning with the Spirit, serving the Lord&quot; (ROMANS 12:11 AMP)</p>
<p>The heart desire of any Christian should be to please the Lord by doing His will and fulfilling His call. Many sincerely want to do this but don&#x27;t know how. So you hear them say, &quot;I want to serve God with all my heart; I want to be on fire for Him, but I don&#x27;t know how to stay consistent in the things of the Spirit.&quot;</p>
<p>What such folks need first and foremost is to be continually filled with the Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit, you can&#x27;t do anything for the Lord that will be acceptable to Him or that&#x27;ll make any impact in the world. That&#x27;s why Ephesians 5:18 says, &quot;And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.&quot; The next verse tells us how to do this: &quot;Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord&quot; (Ephesians 5:19).</p>
<p>Secondly, be careful not to listen to your feelings or emotions for they&#x27;ll lie to you. That you &quot;felt&quot; close to God on a certain day doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re spiritual; and that you sometimes &quot;feel&quot; far from God doesn&#x27;t mean God has left you or is far from you. Our closeness to God has nothing to do with how we feel on a certain day.</p>
<p>Thirdly, learn to speak in tongues fervently and lavishly. This is one of those blessings the Holy Spirit has brought into our lives. Speaking in other tongues regularly will activate your spirit until you&#x27;re filled to overflowing. &quot;stir up (rekindle the embers of, fan the flame of, and keep burning) the [gracious] gift of God, [the inner fire] that is in you&quot; (2 Timothy 1:6 AMP). If you would consciously take advantage of the aforementioned by giving attention to them, your life will constantly be aglow and you&#x27;ll know no downtime in your walk with the Lord.</p>

<p>&quot;And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil&quot; (2 KINGS 4:2)</p>
<p>There&#x27;re those who have become despondent because they lost their job or because their business took a tailspin. Being born again, such thing shouldn&#x27;t affect you. That you lost your job doesn&#x27;t mean anything, and the reason you lost your job isn&#x27;t so important either. What should matter to you is what we call, &quot;divine positioning.&quot;</p>
<p>Recall what we read about Joseph in our preceding study; he was a slave. He wasn&#x27;t receiving a salary, because slaves aren&#x27;t paid a salary. But the Bible says, &quot;Joseph was a prosperous man,&quot; even as a slave (Genesis 39:2). He didn&#x27;t have to have a salary to be prosperous. He was the seed of Abraham, and that was all that was necessary. He had his dream in front of him, and he knew who he was. He functioned in divine grace. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no disadvantage for you as a child of God. You&#x27;ve been divinely positioned for greatness in life. Romans 8:28 declares, &quot;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose.&quot; Nothing happens to you or with you by chance. Where you are right now; that situation in which you find yourself, is where the answer is. Don&#x27;t wish you had the capital or anything else.</p>
<p>In our theme verse, Elisha asked the widow, &quot;what hast thou in the house?&quot; With the little pot of oil she had, she became an oil distributor overnight. Praise God! All the capital you need is Christ in you. Therefore, look to the Holy Spirit in you; trust Him for guidance and direction and do whatever He tells you. He&#x27;ll cause His blessing to come on it, and it&#x27;ll blossom beyond your dreams. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil&quot; (Ephesians 5:15-16).</p>
<p>Did you ever meet someone who had no regard for your time? I&#x27;m sure you didn&#x27;t enjoy it. Now, if you didn&#x27;t enjoy it, then you ought to always regard the time and schedule of others in your dealings with people. If you could take time to plan your day and prioritize your activities, you ought to expect that those you meet would have done the same.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t shift or postpone appointments haphazardly; it could mess things up for someone else. There&#x27;re certain things in life that aren&#x27;t in unending supply; they&#x27;re limited; one of them is time. There&#x27;s joy and fulfilment you get when you respond to people promptly and see the look of gratitude on their faces for saving their time. When people meet you, they ought to be glad they did; they ought to leave you happier, and one sure way of ensuring this is by valuing their precious time.</p>
<p>If you were to schedule an appointment at work, for example, try as much as possible not to make open-ended appointments.
It&#x27;s better to say, &quot;See me at 5:15pm&quot; and be ready at that time, than to say, &quot;See me between 5 and 5:30pm,&quot; and keep the person guessing when exactly to show up. And if for any reason, you know you wouldn&#x27;t be ready at the time you planned, reach out ahead of the agreed time to cancel or reschedule, tendering your apologies.</p>
<p>Do your best not to destabilize other people&#x27;s day. Of course, there&#x27;s the flip side to this; you could be the one who&#x27;s supposed to see someone, but you&#x27;ve fixed the same time to see five other people across the city! You&#x27;re definitely going to keep at least one or more of them waiting for you, and that&#x27;s not okay. Even as the boss in the office, be sensitive to the schedules of your subordinates. Successful people are time-conscious.</p>

<p>&quot;And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord&quot; (EPHESIANS 5:18-19)</p>
<p>Having received the Holy Spirit after you&#x27;re born again, there&#x27;s a day-to-day infilling of the Spirit that you must experience in order to live the higher life of glory to which you&#x27;ve been called. &quot;But Pastor Chris, I thought I already received the Holy Spirit, why again do I need to be filled with the Spirit?&quot; You might want to ask.</p>
<p>That you&#x27;ve received the Holy Spirit doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll always be full of Him. The expression &quot;be filled with the Spirit&quot; doesn&#x27;t refer to the baptism of the Holy Spirit which you received at the new birth. Rather, it refers to being loaded, fully imbued or abundantly fortified, satisfied and complete with the power of the Spirit----everyday!</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll have to speak to yourself in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs! And consciously talk, sing, and make melody of the Word, in your heart, to the Lord! You&#x27;ll have to give thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Making this a conscious and consistent practice is how to get full of the Spirit all the time.</p>
<p>When you let the Holy Spirit work through you and you&#x27;re overflowing with His fullness, you won&#x27;t need to try to muster boldness to say or do things. You won&#x27;t need to try to stir up some power or remember some scriptures in the face of adversity. No! Whenever you open your mouth to speak, you&#x27;ll speak the wisdom of God; words that are divinely inspired, because you&#x27;re full of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>If you want to walk in dominion over the devil, sickness, disease, infirmities and death, then you must consciously and consistently practise being filled with the Spirit. You&#x27;ll be able to change hopeless situations because you&#x27;re full of the Holy Ghost and power.</p>

<p>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever&quot; (1 PETER 1:23)</p>
<p>When we say the Christian is born of God, we&#x27;re actually saying he&#x27;s born of the Word; he&#x27;s the Word&#x27;s offspring. That&#x27;s what we read in our opening verse. The Apostle James stated the same truth in James 1:18, saying, &quot;Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Paul took it to a climax and calls us the epistle (Word) of Christ: &quot;Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart&quot; (2 Corinthians 3:3). What does that mean? It means you don&#x27;t have a life that&#x27;s separate from the Word. This is so because the Word of God is your source, and every living thing must be connected to its source to live.</p>
<p>Man&#x27;s body was made from the dust of the ground; so, man has to feed on cultivations from the ground to survive. Man, however, is a spirit, and the spirit of man came from God&#x27;s Spirit, and was created with the Word of God. Therefore, you must continually feed on God&#x27;s Word to truly live. The Lord Jesus said in Luke 4:4, &quot;It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.&quot; Acts 20:32 says, &quot;And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.&quot;</p>
<p>Through the Word, you condition your life for victory every day, such that no matter the circumstances, you&#x27;re always triumphant. In Isaiah 55:11, the Lord said, &quot;So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.&quot; Culture and regulate your life with the Word and keep growing from glory to glory.</p>

<p>&quot;For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries&quot; (1 CORINTHIANS 14:2)</p>
<p>Satan and the cohorts of darkness are confounded when we speak in other tongues, for it&#x27;s a coded language of the spirit reserved only for the initiated for direct communication with God. Sometimes folks who are unlearned   in spiritual things mock when we speak in tongues, dismissing it as unintelligent communication. Well, the reason it makes no sense to the natural mind is that it&#x27;s a coded spiritual language.</p>
<p>How exciting to know that we can commune with the Lord in esoteric language! How inspiring to know that we speak forth divine mysteries and secrets from the realm of the Spirit as we pray in other tongues! Sometimes, as we speak in other tongues, not only are we magnifying the Lord and revealing His many-sided wisdom, we&#x27;re also revealing to the angels how to destroy the works of the enemy. The angels don&#x27;t know everything there is to know about God and His glorious Kingdom and so they listen to us.</p>
<p>Likewise, the demons don&#x27;t know everything (they actually know far less than the angels) and so as we speak in other tongues, they&#x27;re completely perplexed, while the angels are educated. No wonder the Bible says &quot;unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God&quot; (Ephesians 3:10).</p>
<p>We speak mysteries when we speak in other tongues; &quot;For one who speaks in an [unknown] tongue speaks not to men but to God, for no one understands {or} catches his meaning, because in the Spirit he utters  secret truths {and} hidden things [not obvious to the understanding]&quot; (1 Corinthians 14:2 AMP).</p>
<p>You might not know what steps to take regarding certain things about your life, but as you speak in other tongues, illumination will come to your spirit. Suddenly, you&#x27;ll know what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. Take advantage of this great blessing for yourself today.</p>

<p>&quot;When the Holy Spirit, who is truth, comes, he shall guide you into all truth. He will tell you about the future&quot; (JOHN 16:13 TLB)</p>
<p>No one can live the authentic Christian life without the Holy Spirit. Many haven&#x27;t taken advantage of His presence in their lives, so they walk on in confusion; beaten down by the challenges of life. Some even live their lives in &quot;trial and error,&quot; not knowing what the future holds. But Jesus who knew before time told His disciples He would send them another comforter who would help them navigate their way through life victoriously.</p>
<p>During the sojourn of God&#x27;s people out of Egypt, the Bible records that &quot;GOD went ahead of them in a Pillar of Cloud during the day to guide them on the way, and at night in a Pillar of Fire to give them light; thus they could travel both day and night&quot; (Exodus 13:21 MSG). That was the Holy Spirit! He was their sure guide at every instance, and He does the same for us today. He knows how to take you through life&#x27;s journey and make you a success.</p>
<p>So refuse to be anxious about the future. The man without the Holy Spirit is the one who should be uncertain about his future; such a person is walking in darkness, without a sense of direction: &quot;They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course&quot; (Psalm 82:5-6) But yours is as the Psalmist declared: &quot;Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore&quot; (Psalm 16:11).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit has come to lead you into the path of life. He is your guide, who directs you in the path of God&#x27;s destiny for your life. Don&#x27;t grope in uncertainties about your life and the future; the Holy Spirit, your sure guide, is in you, and He shows you things to come. Submit to His ministry today and develop an intimacy with Him through fellowship.</p>

<p>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come (1 Timothy 4:8)</p>
<p>Some people claim to be making progress spiritually, yet their lives are full of ups and downs. “My spiritual life is okay, but I have problems in my business,” some may say. This ought not to be. God expects us to make spiritual progress always. He expects us to grow. If you can make spiritual progress, progress in every other area of your life is absolutely assured, because the spiritual controls the physical. Your spiritual life means much more than prayer, Bible study, winning souls, or going to church. Galatians 5:25 says, “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.” To walk in the Spirit means that everything you do: thinking, talking, seeing, eating and so on, must be from the light of His Word. As you continually place your health, family, business, and finances under the light of God, God’s Word will give you total balance, and your life will be a declaration of the whole counsel of God. Ensure to always give your spiritual life the priority it deserves. If your physical life is wonderful and you’ve achieved material and emotional success without giving attention to your spiritual walk, it won’t take too long before those areas are jeopardized. Remember, you’re not a physical being, but primarily a spirit being. Therefore, if your spiritual life isn’t together, you’ll have problems in all other areas sooner or later. But once it is working out well, it will produce the life that’s needed in every other thing about you.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I thank you, for as I meditate on the Word, I’m changed, from glory to glory. I make progress in every area of my life: in my health, finances, business and academics; I make progress spiritually, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p>James 4:6
&quot;But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.&quot; (also see NIV &amp; AMPC)</p>
<p>Jesus had a spirituality that was unmistakable. He was very spiritual. Look at how He addressed an issue in Matthew 16:16,18.</p>
<p>He dealt with the spiritual nature of what Peter said. He was spiritually minded and was quick to let Peter know the origin of his thoughts. He directed Peters mind to the spirituality of the matter.</p>
<p>Look how He prayed, &quot;Our Father&quot;</p>
<p>Luke 2:25
&quot;And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.&quot;</p>
<p>He dealt with the spirituality of every subject.</p>
<p>What life do you want to live?
Do you think that being spiritual is wrong or excessive?
Do you realize that understanding the spirituality of life is where life&#x27;s purpose truly resides?
Do you connect your life with that which is spiritual?</p>
<p>Whether or not you agree, you came from that which is spiritual. God is a Spirit.</p>
<p>Romans 8:5-6
&quot;For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.&quot;</p>
<p>To be minded on earthy things is death. Jesus was spiritually minded. How are you? Are you spiritually minded? Are you being motivated by the flesh or even satan? God wants us to be spiritually minded.</p>
<p>This is where success and your victory is going to be. You&#x27;ve to become spiritually minded. Walk wisely, walk in the Spirit. We being born of the Spirit of God into the Spirit.</p>
<p>There are too many who are earthly minded, even in their prayers. God wants us to be spiritually minded. Think like Jesus, talk like Him.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t do that except you work in and study the scriptures.</p>
<p>THIS MONTH OF FEBRUARY IS THE MONTH OF GRACE!</p>
<p>God is saying... More grace is being released. He gives more grace.</p>
<p>There are those who say they need more anointing but there&#x27;s no place in the scriptures that supports that rather, He gives more grace. The life God has brought us into is grace upon grace.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s amazing how we work most times ignoring the grace that we have. God&#x27;s throne is a throne of grace</p>
<p>Hebrews 4:16
&quot;Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.&quot;</p>
<p>We can get whatever grace we require. In God&#x27;s presence, He&#x27;s releasing more grace. Take advantage of this release. Obtain this grace. Increased grace for your work, finances, family!</p>
<p>Do you realize there are situations you need more grace to handle? The Lord is sure leading us to another level and it&#x27;s more grace for the new level. He gives more grace.</p>
<p>And so, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, I receive more grace! I receive more grace for these times! And in this abundance of grace, I walk in victory!</p>

<p>The Grace of God can be seen in what it produces; as much as Grace is a divine working on the inside of a man, it manifests itself on the outside of a man in diverse ways: below are seven outworkings of grace in a man’s life.</p>
<ol>
<li>Acceptability.</li>
</ol>
<p>There always is something about a man/woman with Grace that attracts people to him/her. Grace singles you out; they just don’t know why they are attracted to you. Grace has got nothing to do with one’s status, profession, or gender.</p>
<p>You can turn on grace in your life; God gives you more Grace as you put to use the Grace He already made available to you. Grace causes nature to respond to you and there are levels of Grace at which different Christians function.</p>
<p>It should be your desire to function at the highest level of Grace possible.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Advantage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grace brings and gives you the Advantage. As a Christian, you need to ALWAYS be conscious of the Grace of God upon your life, this is what makes it work and you need to recognize that you have got grace working for you.</p>
<p>You do not need to struggle for/with anything in your life, if you put the Grace to work, it will deliver them to you, on a platter. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Grace is the glory of God working in a man’s spirit and it beautifies. Only the man with Grace recognizes Grace.</p>
<p>Never try to work against Grace in a man’s life; one who does it fights against the Source of Grace; Deity.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Favour.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grace brings you FAVOUR. Good is turned towards the man with Grace and forgiveness always knocks at his door. Even when he seems to have made great mistakes, the Grace of God speaks for him.</p>
<p>To walk in Grace means to walk in and with divine influence. It makes you have the mentality of “if I want anything, I will get it!”</p>
<p>You are God’s trophy, and He wants everyone in the world to know how much he loves you. He is the ‘I am’ and you are the ‘in Him’. There is no need for the struggles and the worry wrinkles.</p>
<p>Grace is available to deliver favour to you. Favour that comes by Grace comes by divine influence. Hallelujah! All He says is “yield to my Word”</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Joy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grace brings about Joy; joy indescribable and unspeakable. As a Christian walking in grace, let Joy work out through your life.</p>
<p>When you take advantage of grace, the world will not be able to explain how you are always up there.</p>
<p>Where they let worries and the cares of this life control them, they do not understand how you have become a distributor of joy.</p>
<p>With grace in your life, you become dauntless even in seemingly difficult situations. When challenges come to you look inwards for the solution, because you know that:</p>
<p>THE BIGGER THE PROBLEM, THE BIGGER THE TESTIMONY.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Liberality.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grace brings LIBERALITY into your life. You have got to recognize that Grace opens a two-way channel; it is called giving and a receiving channel. Recognize that giving is a Grace.</p>
<p>When Grace opens up that passion to give; it also opens up your CAPACITY to receive.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Pleasure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grace brings about PLEASURE. Do you know that Pleasure comes spiritually and that you can take pleasure in all that God has created? Your life is for Him; recognizing this makes everything in your life pleasurable and yet pleasing to God.</p>
<p>Now, Grace brings about a kind and happy pleasure that should make you appreciate the people and the things in your life.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Gift.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grace brings GIFTs into your life. Grace brings about an uncanny ability to do what others cannot do. This can manifest itself in the form of a skill, quality, and understanding of certain areas.</p>
<p>It’s important that you recognize the gift of God upon you and put it to use, it makes God’s power to come upon it.</p>

<p>Our opening verse clearly shows that we’re not in contention with human enemies, but with spiritual forces. Human beings aren’t your enemies. Whatever wickedness you might observe in human beings is actually perpetrated by the spirit-forces of darkness listed in our opening verse: principalities, powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, spiritual wickedness in high places. They’re the ones responsible for the varying degrees of evil and devilry that we see and experience around us.</p>
<p>Man in himself isn’t as wicked as you see, for God made man in His image and in His likeness. He made man to look like Him, and to function like Him (Genesis 1:26); but there’s something that remotely controls the unregenerate man and causes him to think, talk, and act wickedly (Ephesians 2:2).</p>
<p>But thanks be to God; we aren’t left hamstrung. When pressures from these wicked spirits come charging at you, be unruffled! As long as you’re fully girt with the full armour of God, you’ll be able to resist and extinguish the cruel and fiendish onslaught and oppositions from the evil one, and remain standing in the evil day.</p>
<p>Satan and his demons are no threat for the Christian. You have the dominion and authority over principalities, powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. God has given you the spiritual weapons with which to keep them at bay (Read Ephesians 6:13-19).</p>
<p>Act on the Word. Get on the offensive against the enemy by keeping the whole armour of God on you all of the time, not some of the time: Stand firm and be unshakable, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the Gospel of peace. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. And pray in the Spirit on all occasion with all kinds of prayers and requests. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>CONFESSION
I’m fully equipped and fortified with the whole armour of God, strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. My faith is a weapon of defence against the fiery darts of the wicked, and an instrument of victory over and against the adversities. adversary I’m and eternally triumphant in Christ. Blessed be God!</p>

<p>&quot;I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me&quot;
(PHILIPPIANS 4:13)</p>
<p>In Matthew 17:20, Jesus said, &quot;nothing shall be impossible unto you&quot;; in other words, you can do anything. The Apostle Paul lends credence to this in our opening verse. Also, in 2 Corinthians 3:5, he takes it a step further, saying, &quot;Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.&quot; This isn&#x27;t talking about your human sufficiency or ability, but of God&#x27;s ability in you; you&#x27;re to look beyond yourself.</p>
<p>When you were born again, you received the very life and nature of God, meaning you have, and are to function with divine abilities. This is what gave Paul the boldness to say, &quot;I can do all things through Christ!&quot; It&#x27;s the same with every one of us. But many haven&#x27;t been able to look beyond themselves and their seeming inadequacies; hence, they concede to failure and to defeat. But not so with you; you&#x27;re born of God and therefore up to the task.</p>
<p>Read 2 Corinthians 3:5 in the Amplified Classic translation; it puts it in a better light: &quot;Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgements or to claim or count anything as coming from us, but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God.&quot; You&#x27;re to look beyond what your physical ability can do, now that Christ is in you. Your sufficiency is a God-sufficiency. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This was David&#x27;s mentality when he confronted Goliath. He eye-balled the giant and said, &quot;I&#x27;ll cut your head off your shoulders today and feed your carcass to the birds of the air&quot; (1 Samuel 17:46). How could David, a mere stripling, make such a boast? He had learnt to look beyond himself, unto the Lord. He said to Goliath, &quot;I come against you in the Name of the Lord of host, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defiled.&quot; (1 Samuel 17:45). David was saying, &quot;I may be the one standing before you, but God is actually the One standing against you, because I&#x27;m standing in His Name, not in my name. I&#x27;m functioning in His might, not mine!&quot; Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Have the same consciousness, because even better than that what David had, the greater One lives in you today. He speaks through you, heals the sick through you and blesses through you. You have all His power and limitless resources domiciled in your spirit. Glory to His Name forever!</p>

<p>&quot;But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking&quot; (MATTHEW 6:7)</p>
<p>Some people believe what they need when they&#x27;re in a dire situation is a powerful prayer, but what exactly is a powerful prayer? To some, it has to do with the multiplicity of words or how loud they&#x27;re able to shout when they pray. But really, what produces result isn&#x27;t the intensity of your shout or multiplicity of your words; rather, it&#x27;s your faith in the Lord and His Word---your confidence in the One to whom you pray.</p>
<p>This makes prayer not only exciting, but also something to keep simple. That&#x27;s the essence of the Master&#x27;s admonition in our theme verse. He said, &quot;Don&#x27;t pray like the heathen, who erroneously think they&#x27;ll be heard for using vain repetitions.&quot; God isn&#x27;t hard of hearing. The Bible says He already knows what you need before you ask Him (Matthew 6:8). Therefore, learn to pray like Jesus. He prayed and acted simply. Recall the simple way He prayed at the tomb of Lazarus. The Bible says, &quot;And he lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth&quot; (John 11:41-43).</p>
<p>Jesus said in Mark 11:23-24, &quot;For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.&quot; That&#x27;s it! So, make your prayers simple. Pray with faith, confident of the Father&#x27;s love for you and the guarantee of hearing that you have in His presence.</p>

<p>For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come (1 TIMOTHY 4:8)</p>
<p>Some people claim to be making progress spiritually, yet their lives are full of ups and downs. “My spiritual life is okay, but I have problems in my business,” some may say. This ought not to be. God expects us to make spiritual progress always. He expects us to grow. If you can make spiritual progress, progress in every other area of your life is absolutely assured, because the spiritual controls the physical. Your spiritual life means much more than prayer, Bible study, winning souls, or going to church. Galatians 5:25 says, “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.” To walk in the Spirit means that everything you do: thinking, talking, seeing, eating and so on, must be from the light of His Word.</p>
<p>As you continually place your health, family, business, and finances under the light of God, God’s Word will give you total balance, and your life will be a declaration of the whole counsel of God. Ensure to always give your spiritual life the priority it deserves. If your physical life is wonderful and you’ve achieved material and emotional success without giving attention to your spiritual walk, it won’t take too long before those areas are jeopardized.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re not a physical being, but primarily a spirit being. Therefore, if your spiritual life isn’t together, you’ll have problems in all other areas sooner or later. But once it is working out well, it will produce the life that’s needed in every other thing about you.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I thank you, for as I meditate on the Word, I’m changed, from glory to glory. I make progress in every area of my life: in my health, finances, business and academics; I make progress spiritually, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Amen</p>

<p>&quot;And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord&quot; (EPHESIANS 5:18-19)</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a constant infilling of God&#x27;s Spirit that you ought to be experiencing everyday of your life. God says, &quot;be filled with the Spirit&quot; meaning it&#x27;s your responsibility to be filled. He also lets you know how to do it -- He says, &quot;speaking to yourselves,&quot; this doesn&#x27;t mean speaking to one another; it means I&#x27;m talking to me and you&#x27;re talking to you, Hallelujah!</p>
<p>How important words are in the Kingdom of God! God wants you to always speak to yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. That&#x27;s another way of telling you to speak His Word always. As you do, you&#x27;re constantly being filled with the Spirit, and when you&#x27;re filled with the Spirit, it becomes impossible for you to despair, be frustrated or despondent in life.</p>
<p>But do you know that you can quench the power of God&#x27;s Spirit in your life by speaking negatively? Yes you can! When you say things like, &quot;Life is hard; things are bad; I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening to me; I&#x27;m so frustrated; I&#x27;m so confused; I don&#x27;t have anybody to help me&quot; you&#x27;re actually quenching the fire of God&#x27;s Spirit in your life. Rather than talk yourself down, there&#x27;s something good you can say to you! You can begin by speaking to yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. You can also sing and make melody in your heart to the Lord.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t talk your frustrations; you&#x27;re the King&#x27;s kid. The Bible says, &quot;count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations&quot; (James 1:2) because you&#x27;re more than a conqueror. Never talk failure; talk success and it will be impossible for you to go down!</p>

<p>“That you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind.” (Ephesians 4:22-23)</p>
<p>Christianity isn’t about the impartation of another spirit to you; it’s actually a rebirth or recreation of your human spirit. When you were born again, your spirit was recreated by God. The human life with which you were born of your mother was supplanted with the life of God.</p>
<p>Some Christians are ruled by their senses more than they’re ruled by their recreated spirit. Your spirit came alive to God when you were born again, and has exactly the same nature as your heavenly Father’s; you’re one with Him now. It’s a new life altogether. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.”</p>
<p>Yet, sometimes people wonder why they still do some of the wrong things they used to before they were born  again. Really, those things don’t come from their recreated spirits, but from their “unrenewed” minds. Your mind has to be renewed with the Word of God. The Bible says, “do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind” (Romans 12:2). So, it’s possible to be born again and live as though you’re not. This is the reason it’s so vital that you develop your human spirit by learning, meditating, and acting on the Word. That way, you’ll train your spirit to rule over your mind and your senses. It’s your responsibility.</p>

<p>&quot;God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord&quot; (1 CORINTHIANS 1:9)</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been called into a companionship, a partnership and participation with our Lord Jesus by the Holy Spirit. This is the same way God wants to be part of everything you&#x27;re involved in. Make God your partner in your family and your business, and see what happens to your life. When God is your partner, you&#x27;ll show up in places you didn&#x27;t go; not for evil but for good.</p>
<p>This reminds me of one of Dr. Yongi Cho&#x27;s stories. He was a missionary in a little town that was wholly given to the worship of a guardian god. The priest of the god resisted his work in their town but later told him that if his God would heal a woman who was known throughout the village to be very sick, they would leave him to continue preaching and believe in his message. When he went to minister to the woman, she refused God&#x27;s Word and said she&#x27;d rather die than accept Jesus. Even when he called some brethren to clean up the woman&#x27;s house and make food for her, she was still uncooperative. So Dr. Cho and his team turned to their Senior Partner and prayed to God fervently. Then, one night he had a vision that he fought and destroyed the guardian god, who came to him in the form of a big serpent with a human head. The next day he woke up to find the woman completely healed. Jumping and rejoicing, she shouted, &quot;Pastor, thank you for coming to my room in the night to pray for me and lay your hands on me.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Cho was shocked because that was about the same time he had been praying in his own room and had that vision. So he said, &quot;No, I wasn&#x27;t in your room yesternight!&quot; But the woman insisted, &quot;It was you; I saw you and you told me to rise up in Jesus&#x27; Name. I rose up and was healed instantly!&quot;</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit can take on your form and go places in order to bless and help you. Let Him be part of everything you do. Consult with Him daily about your family, business, academics --- everything. You&#x27;ll be the better off for it!</p>

<p>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men&quot; (JOHN 1:1-4)</p>
<p>As you study the Bible, you&#x27;ll be enthused to discover who Jesus truly is. When He walked the earth, He looked as ordinary as everybody else, yet He was Himself God. Jesus was the God that spoke to Moses in the burning bush. He was the One that called Abraham out of Haran and said, &quot;Walk before me, and be thou perfect; I am the Almighty God&quot; (Genesis 17:1). He was the One that stood before Moses and said, &quot;Take your shoes off your feet for where you are standing is holy&quot; (Exodus 3:5).</p>
<p>Jesus was God in a human body, but the people didn&#x27;t know. You might then ask, &quot;Why is He called the Son of God if He&#x27;s Himself, God?&quot; Many ask that question because they don&#x27;t understand the true meaning of the expression, &quot;Son of God.&quot; &quot;Son of God&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean one that&#x27;s born of God; rather, it means God in a human body. Jesus is Adonai; the Lord, God.</p>
<p>He was the One that said to Moses, &quot;Your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob knew me as El Shaddai, but I&#x27;m Jehovah&quot; (Exodus 6:3). Jehovah is Yahweh. This is why the Jewish people had difficulty accepting Jesus Christ ordinarily, because everything written about Jesus in the Scriptures and the things He said of Himself, show that He is Adonai. Now you can understand why His Name has all power.</p>
<p>Think about it: that seemingly ordinary man of Galilee was actually God Almighty, walking the streets of Israel, but they didn&#x27;t know it, to the point they even killed Him. John says, &quot;He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own; and his own received him not&quot; (John 1:10-11). Who is he talking about here? Jesus, the incarnate Word! The Apostle Paul tells us that in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead, bodily (Colossians 2:9). Hallelujah!</p>

<p>And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name (LUKE 10:17)</p>
<p>In the Book of Jude, verse 9, there&#x27;s something very instructive for our learning. It says, &quot;Yet Michael the Archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.&quot; This was after Moses died. Michael, the Archangel, came to take his body. However, when he got there, the devil also wanted Moses&#x27; body, because he had a right over everyone who died in this world, until Jesus came.</p>
<p>Satan had adamic authority, which he got from Adam in the Garden of Eden; thus, he was higher than Michael at the time. So, what did Michael do? He said, &quot;The Lord rebuke thee.&quot; He had to speak to Satan in the Name of the Lord, to be able to get the body of Moses. Now, in Matthew 16:19, Jesus said, &quot;And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot; This is a present-hour truth! Satan has been stripped of all power.</p>
<p>Jesus said, &quot;I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven&quot; (Luke 10:18). Then in Luke 10:19, He said, &quot;Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.&quot; We have authority over Satan and the cohorts of darkness. They&#x27;ve all been thoroughly and totally defeated, and we&#x27;re charged to execute judgment against them: &quot;To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD&quot; (Psalm 149:9).</p>
<p>Satan has lost his right to this world! You never have to fight or struggle with him! When he shows up, or you perceive that he&#x27;s stirring trouble around you, cast him out! James 4:7 says, &quot;Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.&quot; How do you resist him? It&#x27;s with the Word. When you speak the Word, Satan bows: &quot;And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God&quot; (Ephesians 6:17).</p>
<p>CONFESSION
The Lord has granted me authority to thread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the ability of the devil! At the Name of Jesus, every knee bows, and every tongue confesses that Jesus is Lord! I reign over the devil, through my faith-filled declarations!Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts&quot; (ZECHARIAH 4:6)</p>
<p>If you believe in Jesus Christ, some people would be against you, but when you preach Him openly, there&#x27;ll be more who would be against you. Even some of those who accepted you formerly would start saying, &quot;Why do you have to preach Him so openly. Believe in Him and be quiet about it.&quot; Then when you begin to have signs and wonders and miracles, your friends would be even fewer! Some of those who accepted you and your preaching Jesus openly would start speaking against you. The truth is that even though those who support you may be fewer, you would have more admirers, because everybody wants to see the power of God. Everybody wants to see miracles; even those who criticize miracles secretly desire to see them.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the reason for our ministry&#x27;s TV programs; they&#x27;re to let people know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever, and that He&#x27;s still performing miracles today through His Church. The large crowds and the miracles that we show are not computer-generated or stage-managed.</p>
<p>You know, Jesus said it is the Spirit that makes alive, the flesh profits nothing (John 6:63). Human charisma can never bring the crowds, neither can it produce the miracles; it takes the Spirit of God. Zechariah 4:6 tells us that it&#x27;s not by might nor by power, but by the Spirit of the Lord. Miracles are done by the power of the Holy Spirit. If you have received the Holy Spirit, then learn to yield to Him. That&#x27;s what it takes. When you yield yourself to the Holy Spirit, the power of God can be manifested, the Spirit of God can work through you and people can receive a miracle when you minister to them by faith in the Name of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>The Bible says, &quot;And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him&quot; (Genesis 5:24). That tells you the kind of man he was. He was a prophet of God; he was the prophet that saw the vision of the Lord’s coming with ten thousands of His saints: &quot;And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him&quot; (Jude 14-15).</p>
<p>How could someone have such a vision? We read in our theme verse that before his translation into heaven, he had the testimony that he pleased God. In other words, Enoch knew that he pleased God with his life. That lets you know that when you’re pleasing God with your life, you can know it; it’s not a guess work. It takes faith to please Him: &quot;But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him&quot; (Hebrews 11:6).</p>
<p>When someone says, &quot;O, God, I don’t know whether you’re pleased with me or not; please have mercy on me and be pleased with me,&quot; that person is walking in ignorance; that’s not the way. Are you walking in love, and living by faith? If you are, then rest assured that you’re pleasing the Father. Faith walks by love (Galatians 5:6). Moreover, Romans 14:23 tells us that whatsoever is not of faith is sin. In other words, God isn’t pleased with anything done outside of faith.</p>
<p>When you’re walking by faith, and manifesting the love of God, you’ll know it in your spirit that your life is pleasing to Him. The Holy Spirit will bear witness with your spirit that you’re pleasing the Father; you’ll know! Halleluiah. Learn to walk with God by walking in love and faith in His Word!</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear heavenly Father, I thank you for you’re working in me, to will and to do of your good pleasure. My life is a reflection of your love, and the manifestation of your glory! Your wisdom functions mightily in me today, as I take your Gospel to my world, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption&quot; (EPHESIANS 4:30)</p>
<p>The Spirit of God is a Person and He has a mind, a will and emotions. That&#x27;s why He can be grieved, wounded or quenched. The children of Israel rebelled against the Holy Spirit as they journeyed through the wilderness to the Promised Land. The Bible says the Holy Spirit was vexed and therefore fought against them. And for as long as He was turned against them they couldn&#x27;t be successful.</p>
<p>Sometimes we think nobody can resist God because He&#x27;s so powerful. God&#x27;s Word shows us this isn&#x27;t true. In Mark 7:13 the Lord Jesus revealed that the Word of God can become ineffective in a man&#x27;s life because of his own adherence to his tradition. The Holy Spirit can be resisted in the same way. That&#x27;s why Stephen while addressing the council, rebuked them saying, &quot;Ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did, so do ye&quot; (Acts 7:51). So, the Holy Ghost can be resisted and hindered from doing something good in your life, family or business.</p>
<p>Imagine that someone you loved so much and hadn&#x27;t seen in a while suddenly showed up, and out of excitement you ran towards her to give her a big welcome. Then she said or did something that hurt you and that just got you calm and quiet; you were quenched and your excitement gradually faded. Have you ever had such an experience? That&#x27;s what the Bible is talking about in 1 Thessalonians 5:19 where it says, &quot;Quench not the Spirit.&quot; If the Holy Spirit can be vexed, grieved or quenched, it means He can also be happy with you. The Holy Spirit loves you and He&#x27;s zealous of doing good things in your life today. So don&#x27;t quench His zeal!</p>

<p>And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house... And it came to pass from the time [that] he had made him overseer in his house... that the LORD blessed the Egyptian&#x27;s house for Joseph&#x27;s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field (GENESIS 39:4-5).</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve heard of people who went for job interviews and were turned down because the panelists disliked them. I also know that they&#x27;re people who have endless lists of sour relationships they&#x27;ve developed over the years. These experiences are absolutely unnecessary for the child of God who understands the working and power of God&#x27;s grace; for grace brings acceptability.</p>
<p>The Bible lets us know that God has made His grace available to everyone of us (Ephesians 4:7). Grace is the lifting power of God which makes you accepted, preferred and celebrated everywhere you go; people just love and choose to favour you. Some people don&#x27;t know this, that&#x27;s why they whallow in self-pity when they think people around them don&#x27;t like them. No! That&#x27;s when to put the grace of God in you to work.</p>
<p>The grace of God will attract the right people, materials and resources you need to function in God&#x27;s destiny for your life. This doesn&#x27;t mean everyone will like you, but every well-meaning person will. Look at Jesus, the Bible says multitudes came to Him and heard Him gladly. Even the little children came to Him and heard Him gladly. Even the little children came to Him and He never turned them back. If graces is at work in you, you&#x27;ll never have stories of depression or disappointment; rather, you&#x27;ll have a divine aura surrounding you that&#x27;ll attract the right people and situations to you. With this grace, you&#x27;ll always rise above those who dispise you.</p>
<p>Never struggle to be accepted at work, in school, at home or anywhere! All you need is recognize that the grace of God is upon your life. Instead of saying &quot;Nobody likes me in this place,&quot; change your confession to &quot;Everyone I meet likes me because God&#x27;s grace is at work in me.&quot;</p>
<p>When God&#x27;s grace is at work in your life and you&#x27;re conscious of it, even your detractors would notice and not be able to ignore or deny that there&#x27;s just something excellent and beautiful about you.</p>

<p>And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest. And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger… (Leviticus 19:9-10).</p>
<p>In the above scripture, God was giving some instructions to the children of Israel on what they should do when they harvest their grains. He said to them, “Thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.” In other words, “Don’t harvest everything; don’t gather the gleanings.” He didn’t want them scratching for the leftovers; and it was a law. They were to leave some in the field, for the poor, the fatherless, and the widows.</p>
<p>There’re people who don’t know why they haven’t made much progress in their lives. Some of them have prayed and prayed, yet no change. But you see, God doesn’t fellowship with a man who has a mentality of poverty. There’s a mentality of prosperity and there’s a mentality of poverty. For instance, some people would use their clothes until those clothes are torn to tatters. How sad! It could be any personal belonging; they use it until it’s not good enough to be given to someone else. Such a mentality attracts poverty, and it has kept many in a despicable state for a long time.</p>
<p>Whatever God blesses you with, no matter how small or big it is, when you use it, let it be good enough for someone else. When you give such things to others, be sure they’re in an excellent state to be used with dignity. That’s the way to live. There should never be anything that you own that you can’t give out.</p>
<p>God wants you to always be a blessing to others who aren’t as blessed as you are. There’re things you haven’t used in a long while, yet you’re keeping them. That’s not a prosperity attitude. Do the Word; get into your closet and search out belongings you’ve piled up and probably wouldn’t even use for another one or two years. Give them out, and watch your life take an upward dive.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed me with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ! I have received of His fullness, grace heaped upon grace. I’m a blessing to those around me, and as a result, I grow bigger and stronger in prosperity, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>There’s a popular saying that “Laughter  is the best medicine.” It’s a manifestation of joy; an expression of mirth. It’s making  sounds and movements with the face and body that show joy, amusement and  contentment.</p>
<p>Laughter causes the release of endorphins, which are the human body’s natural pain relief hormones. It relieves tension, anxiety, shame and guilt, and helps one maintain a  positive attitude even in negative situations. Moreover, it is able to raise energy levels, thereby completely getting rid of depression. It helps reduce stress that comes in the course of your daily activities. It also improves your emotional and mental health, and ultimately  creates a sense of well-being within you.</p>
<p>People laugh for various reasons, but the Word of God gives us insight into the spiritual benefits of laughter. Proverbs 17:22 says, “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine” In other words, wonderful healing power is unleashed every time you laugh! Although laughter is a psychological  response to humour, it doesn’t always have to be initiated by an external influence or condition. It can spring up from inside you and burst forth on the outside. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is make great, and to give strength unto all&quot; (1 CHRONICLES 29:12)</p>
<p>I read and meditated a lot on the verse of scripture above in my teenage years. I thought, &quot;If it&#x27;s with God to do all these wonderful things, then they shall be fulfilled in my life!&quot; I had no doubt it, and it&#x27;s been so. Riches and honour come from God; it&#x27;s with Him to make great and to give strength. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Without Abraham asking, God said to him, &quot;I&#x27;ll make you great&quot; (Genesis 12:2) and He did. He&#x27;s the One that makes great. This is why I tell Christians and ministers of the Gospel to not be afraid of criticism and persecution, for they&#x27;re springboards for promotion. It makes no difference what is said or published about you or against you; be unperturbed. The Bible says, &quot;No weapon fashioned against you shall prosper&quot; (Isaiah 54:17). Nothing, and no one can dishonour you.</p>
<p>They may try to dishonour you by saying and writing unwholesome things about you, but how could they take from you the honour they didn&#x27;t confer on you? It&#x27;s not possible. The Lord glorified you with Himself! He has made you great and no one can undo it. There&#x27;s no institution or government in the world, powerful enough to disrepute you, because your reputation is Christ.</p>
<p>Every so often, affirm that your life is excellent and full of glory, crowned with honour and greatness, and the pleasure of the Lord is prospering through you. Give no room to distractions and detractors. Let all that matters to you be to please the Lord. All majesty, dominion, greatness, power, honour and glory belong to Him, and you&#x27;re the focus of His love, and a joint-heir with Him. Praise God!</p>

<p>&quot;And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest&quot; (EZEKIEL 37:3)</p>
<p>In your journey of faith, there could be times of difficulties, when you face serious challenges. But at such times, don&#x27;t loathe yourself or gripe that you&#x27;re going through such tough times; refuse to be discouraged. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of running helter-skelter, seeking help from man, no; talk your way out of it.</p>
<p>This was what the Lord told Ezekiel to do in the valley of dry bones (Ezekiel 37:4). Ezekiel found himself in a valley full of dry bones and the Lord asked him, &quot;Can these bones live?&quot; That was an impossible situation, but God told Ezekiel to &quot;prophesy to the bones.&quot; As he prophesied, a great miracle took place: &quot;there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone&quot; (Ezekiel 37:7).</p>
<p>If you&#x27;ve found yourself in a situation where everything around you seems &quot;dry,&quot; there can be a change, and you&#x27;re the one to effect that change with your words. Remember, words are &quot;things,&quot; they have energy and spiritual tangibility. What you say, becomes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenges you face are your opportunities to demonstrate your faith in the Lord, and prove His Word. Rather than being overwhelmed in the hour of crisis, declare your health, success, prosperity, and victory in Christ Jesus. The Word in your mouth is a creative force; it&#x27;ll bring forth miracles. God&#x27;s Word created everything, and as such can create anything. Use faith-filled words to frame your world, and programme your spirit for success and victory.</p>

<p>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. (1 JOHN 5:4)</p>
<p>There’s so much negative information in the world today, and this has instilled fear in the hearts of those who aren’t rooted and grounded in the Word. The Lord Jesus referred to this in Luke 21:25-26 when He described some of the signs of the end of the age. He said, “there shall be …distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth” In Luke 18:8, He asked, “when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?”</p>
<p>You’re to stand your ground in faith, irrespective of the challenges and hardships in today’s world. Train your faith with the Word to prevail against the odds and adversities of life. Refuse to give up or give in to the pressures around you. Ephesians 6:13-16 says, &quot;having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.”</p>
<p>Keep your switch of faith turned on, by staying your mind on the Word. When Satan throws the dart of fear at you, refuse it, because the greater One lives in you!</p>
<p>It makes no difference that the world is experiencing severe economic slump as a result of the recent global crisis; you’re the seed of Abraham! You’re a joint-heir with Christ; never talk or live as one who’s disadvantaged; affirm God’s truth! The creative power of His Word becomes effective once ignited by the faith-response from your spirit, bringing about a transformation in your life and situation from glory to glory. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>If you’re born again and filled with the Holy Spirit, you ought to live a life of endless joy and rest, where you heap success upon success through the power of the Holy Spirit. But if you don’t understand how to appropriate and enjoy your divine inheritance in Christ, you’ll likely live “a life of ceaseless battles,” like the one we just described. Refuse that kind of life.</p>
<p>Embrace the stress-free or struggle-free life in Christ. He said in Matthew 11:28, “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” You already came to Him at salvation and He’s already given you rest: “For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his” (Hebrews 4:10). This is the reality of your life.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus didn’t whip the devil to leave us still “fighting” and struggling our way through life. His vicarious sacrifice in our behalf, and His work to give us the victory were complete. So, change your way of thinking where necessary and accept His Word today. Accept the life of joy, peace and glory that He’s given you. Always bear in mind that you can never be disadvantaged, Glory to God!</p>

<p>&quot;For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek&quot; (ROMANS 1:16)</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve received the mandate to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth; it&#x27;s a calling for all who are in Christ, and it&#x27;s something you&#x27;re to do with courage, conviction and faith. Only the Gospel can catapult the sinner into salvation and righteousness. It&#x27;s only through the preaching of the Gospel that the righteousness of God can be unveiled and embraced.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the only message that when received, makes sinners sons of God in a moment of time. Therefore, be ever so passionate about leading others to salvation. The Bible says those that turn many to righteousness shall shine as stars forever (Daniel 12:3). Light up your world with the Gospel. Let it be what you live for.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:15 says, &quot;And he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.&quot; If you truly believe that Jesus died to save you, then you must continually live for His glory and lead others to salvation. We&#x27;re in the last days, and the time is short. This isn&#x27;t a matter of convenience. There may be peculiar times, occasions, and places where you may need to be tactful in preaching the Gospel, but your focus must always be to lead people everywhere into salvation in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re His co-labourers and partners, working together with Him to reach the lost and bring salvation in Christ to every man. In your sphere of contact, be a burning and a shining light. Devote your life to reaching others with the Gospel. Keep influencing and impacting your world positively through the power of God that works in you. He&#x27;s counting on you for the salvation of many in your world. Therefore, be faithful in leading others to Christ and bringing them to church.</p>

<p>You&#x27;re made in God&#x27;s image and likeness; don&#x27;t look down on yourself. &quot;But you are God&#x27;s chosen and special people. You are a group of royal priests and a holy nation. God has brought you out of darkness into his marvelous light&quot; (1 PETER 2:9 CEV)</p>
<p>When some people pray, they say things like: &quot;We&#x27;re nothing in thy sight, O God&quot; or &quot;We&#x27;re but trash before thee, O Lord.&quot; They think it&#x27;s a show of humility and respect for God when they talk this way. They don&#x27;t realise they&#x27;re devaluing themselves. The reason they talk this way is because they&#x27;re ignorant of what the scriptures say about them. I would to God they knew just how special and precious they are to God.</p>
<p>You shouldn&#x27;t make the mistake of thinking or talking like them, because as a Christian, you&#x27;re born of God (John 1:12). Besides, God created you in His image and likeness (Genesis 1:27). This means you look exactly like Him and you have His nature in you. When a dog gives birth, it reproduces a dog and not a monkey. It&#x27;s the same way with God; He only gives birth to His kind, and you&#x27;re His kind because He gave birth to you!</p>
<p>So, refuse to think like those who believe it&#x27;s proud to call yourself a child of God. Be bold to declare that you&#x27;re God&#x27;s special possession, for indeed you are! You&#x27;re His specially-crafted masterpiece, called by His Name, and created in His image and likeness. You&#x27;re a peculiar treasure and precious to God. Be conscious of this truth and walk in the light of it.</p>

<p>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal (2 Corinthians 4:17-18).</p>
<p>Why should a Christian read the Scriptures, like our theme verse above and still gripe and moan about challenges? It makes no difference the pressure you face from the adversary; refuse to budge, because the greater One lives in you. Never find yourself wearing a sad look, frustrated, because of the challenges you might be facing. That’s what Satan wants; he likes to see that you’re under the pressure; but don’t give him that luxury.</p>
<p>Christ lives in you. Therefore, when you face crises declare, “Greater is He that’s in me than all the pressures and challenges that could ever come against me!” Whatever you may be going through is a light affliction; always remember that. Learn to laugh no matter the pressure, because every adversity you face will produce for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. The Word says so; hence, it’s the only outcome to expect. That’s why you must rejoice in the face of adversity. The Bible says, “the joy of the LORD is your strength” (Nehemiah 8:10).</p>
<p>Learn to celebrate, and rejoice in the Lord, especially when the squeeze is on. Refuse to focus on the problem. Fix your gaze on God’s eternal Word. The Holy Spirit who lives in you will make you triumphant always, and in every situation.</p>

<p>&quot;But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them&quot; (2 CORINTHIANS 4:3-4)</p>
<p>Our theme scripture is quite instructive; it reveals the reason certain people find it difficult to give their hearts to Jesus Christ; Satan is behind it. Once, I ministered to someone who was willing to give his life to Christ, but he was reluctant to confess the Lordship of Jesus. I knew what the problem was. So, I said, &quot;In the Name of Jesus, you lying devil, come out of him!&quot; Instantly, he opened his mouth and made the confession of the Lordship of Jesus Christ, and he was born again. Glory to God!</p>
<p>There&#x27;re people who won&#x27;t give their lives to Jesus Christ because demon spirits wouldn&#x27;t let them. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to intercede  for the lost, rebuking the devil and the darkness in their hearts, so they&#x27;d receive the glorious light of the Gospel of Christ. Think about the fact that a fellow left his house, willing to go to church, but as soon as he approached the entrance of the church, he wouldn&#x27;t go in. The brethren tried every way to persuade him to enter the church, but he wouldn&#x27;t budge. An evil spirit that had followed him all his life would let him go anywhere else, but church.</p>
<p>However, while he was at the door, the Word of God was being taught inside the church. And suddenly, he became calm, and entered for the service. As those who had tried to persuade him began to wonder at the sudden change of mind, he said to them, &quot;A spirit walked out of me.&quot;</p>
<p>Imagine how many people want to come to church or give their lives to Christ, but are being hindered by the devil. But that&#x27;s where we come in. Jesus gave us the authority to cast out devils (Mark 16:17); it&#x27;s one of the signs of our divinity. So, in preaching the Gospel, when you find people who seem to be resisting the message, intercede for them, that the devil would lose his grip on them. Don&#x27;t give up on anyone, for anyone can accept the Gospel of Christ and be saved.</p>
<p>And if you’ve never been born again, if you haven’t yet made Jesus the Lord of your life, say this prayer and mean it with all your heart:</p>
<p>“O Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ, Son of the living God. I believe He died for me and God raised Him from the dead. I confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of my life. Through Him and in His Name, I have eternal life; I’m born again. Thank you Lord, for saving my soul! I’m now a child of God. Hallelujah!”</p>

<p>&quot;They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera&quot; (Judges 5:20)</p>
<p>A certain Pastor was posted to a church for a new assignment; the church hadn&#x27;t grown for many years. So, when he resumed, he decided to fast and pray. One day, while he was praying in the church building, he saw a huge animal, a beast, and as he turned to it, the beast said, &quot;I will not allow you to take my people from me. I&#x27;ve been in charge of this church for many years.&quot; In response, the Pastor said, &quot;They&#x27;re God&#x27;s people; they&#x27;re not your people and you will leave this church today, and never return.&quot;</p>
<p>The animal got infuriated and charged toward him; but unafraid, the Pastor declared, &quot;In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, get out NOW!&quot; The beast fell down, and scampered out of the church, to never return. The very next service, when the people came to church, they worshipped and praised God like they&#x27;d never done. It was obvious that there was a new move of the Spirit, and the church began to experience unprecedented growth. The devil had been taken out.</p>
<p>Members of the church didn&#x27;t know there was an evil force affecting the people inside the church. But thanks be unto God that the Pastor knew exactly what to do. We&#x27;re not to negotiate with the &quot;adversary&quot; that&#x27;s one of Satan&#x27;s names (1 Peter 5:8). It tells you something; he is one who withstands you in anything. Don&#x27;t tolerate or accommodate him around you; get on the offensive.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:12 says, &quot;For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.&quot; Notice that it says, &quot;We wrestle not against,&quot; not &quot;We wrestle not at all.&quot; Many struggle in life, unable to actualize their dreams, not realizing they&#x27;re in a warfare. When the forces are against you, there&#x27;s something behind it. Therefore, use what you have; use the Name of Jesus. Don&#x27;t fold your arms and watch things go wrong; operate in the spirit; rebuke the adversary and maintain that which the Lord has given you.</p>

<p>Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard (DANIEL 10:12)</p>
<p>Sometimes, you just know in your spirit that something needs to change in your life, and if you don’t take advantage of that intuition, you could lose the moment. When you know inside you that the time has come for a change or for something to happen, don’t take it lightly; start praying about it, and if, after sometime, you still haven’t seen the desired results, you add fasting to it. If the change still doesn’t occur after a while, keep praying and fasting about it, because the delay could be by Satan.</p>
<p>This was what happened to Daniel as he prayed for the deliverance of God’s people. He had read in the Book of Jeremiah that the deliverance of Israel would come after seventy years in exile, so he knew the time had come and thus began to pray. But the prince of the kingdom of Persia detained the angel that was to bring Daniel the message. Daniel, nonetheless, was faithful and kept praying.</p>
<p>After twenty-one days, the angel of the Lord finally came with the answer and explained what had happened (Read Daniel 10:13-14). The angel that God sent to Daniel was delayed in the spirit realm, until Michael, one of the chief angels, came to help him. Daniel 9:3-4 AMP.</p>
<p>Perhaps you perceive that it’s time for a transformation in your family, business, academics, finances, health, or ministry. Take it up; fast, and pray! On the other hand, maybe you sense that there’s a certain level of operation of God’s Spirit that should be at work in your life, but you’re not experiencing it; give it attention. Fast and pray about it, because if you don’t, you may lose the timing, as well as the opportunity. So, like Daniel, set your face “to the Lord God to seek Him by prayer and supplications, with fasting” Always bear in mind that you can never be disadvantaged! Glory to God!</p>

<p>&quot;But just as you excel in everything - in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us - see that you also excel in the grace of giving&quot; (2 CORINTHIANS 8:7 NIV)</p>
<p>Every Christian is supposed to be passionate about God&#x27;s work, and put their resources into the push and spread the Gospel around the world. But there&#x27;re usually those who are more passionate than others. They&#x27;re the ones Paul referred to in our theme scripture: they excel in the grace of giving.</p>
<p>Giving is a grace; it&#x27;s one of the spiritual gifts in the Bible. What makes it spiritual is that it&#x27;s God who gives the ability. Romans 12:6-8 says, &quot;Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith...he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity&quot; Remember, He already said that upon receiving the Holy Spirit, we would all prophesy: &quot;And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters shall prophesy&quot; (Acts 2:17). However, the Word also says, &quot;to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom&quot; (1 Corinthians 12:8), even though the Holy Ghost enables everyone to prophesy and to see visions.</p>
<p>In the same way, everyone is enabled to give, but the grace of giving is also a gift. And the Bible says, &quot;earnestly covet the best gifts&quot; (1 Corinthians 12:31). So, it&#x27;s okay to covet and desire to excel in the grace of giving. In every gift of God, you get better by practice. So, practise giving your best; it comes with its myriads of blessings and promotions of the Spirit. Praise God!</p>

<p>“Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go and pray over there.&quot; (MATTHEW 26:36)</p>
<p>Have you ever thought what you would be doing after high school? What course would you study in the university? Or what career would you take up when you graduate from college?</p>
<p>These and other questions about key decisions in your life are to be answered, not casually, but with the guidance of the Holy Spirit. In John 16:13 (CEV), Jesus said, “The Spirit shows what is true and will come and guide you into the full truth. The Spirit doesn’t speak on his own. He will tell you only what he has heard from me, and he will let you know what is going to happen.” It’s important for you, as a child of God, spend time praying in the spirit, that is, praying in tongues. That’s how you prepare yourself for what’s ahead.</p>
<p>Part of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life is to show you the future, and lead you into that glorious future that’s been preordained for you by God. The Bible says, “For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God” (Romans 8:14 AMPC). Every child of God ought to live perpetually by the leading of the Spirit. You should never be in the dark about the future. When you pray in tongues, it’s an opportune moment for you to receive divine guidance and direction concerning your life.</p>
<p>Your life will not be full of negative surprises if you’re given to prayer. Prayerful preparation precedes glorious manifestations. So, before you make that choice or take that decision, take out some time to pray in the Holy Ghost, until you get the go-ahead in your spirit to proceed in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Never be too busy or lazy to prepare yourself prayerfully before embarking on any project. That’s one of the secrets of a stress-free life of consistent victory and progress. Talk to the Holy Spirit in tongues and ask  for His guidance and direction, always bear in mind that with Him on your side, you can never be disadvantaged! Glory to God!</p>

<p>Fear not for I am with you! I am your strength; the rock on which you stand, the rock on which you are founded. Fear not; saith the Lord, for I made the heavens and the earth, and everything that has been made. The world is mine, and I have given it to you. I have given you my Word and I am your Strength.</p>
<p>I am your life; HAVE NO FEAR, for I am with you. Fear not the night, or the darkness… for the darkness has no power over you. The wicked shall not overcome you, for you are mine saith the Lord. The evil shall bow before the good, and the wicked at the gates of the righteous. I am your strength, saith the Lord; I have enabled and empowered you.</p>
<p>Fear not, for my hand is upon you! I have exalted you with my hand of righteousness; for thou art mine saith the Lord. I have given you an understanding heart and my wisdom is perfected in you. Walk in the light of my Word. I have made you victorious in all things; therefore, walk in victory. Walk in the consciousness of your victory. Do not look at the shadows for I have laughed at the enemy.</p>
<p>I have laughed at the adversary; therefore consider him not. Consider not your adversaries, for they are fallen before you. I have exalted you, saith the Lord. I will demonstrate my glory before you and men shall know that you are mine. For you shall show forth my praise, saith the Lord, and your mouth shall be filled with testimonies of my goodness.” Glory to God. Hallelujah! Hallelujah!!</p>

<p>Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert (ISAIAH 43:18-19).</p>
<p>From time to time, it’s important to review the way things have been going with you and determine the areas in which you’ve got to do things differently. You can’t do the same things you’ve been doing, in the same ways you’ve been doing them and expect different results. Even God at some point, said “I will do a new thing” (Isaiah 43:19). He gave the Israelites strict laws to follow, which they couldn’t. He thundered at Mount Sinai and they ran away from Him in fear!</p>
<p>Finally, He changed the order, and won us over with love: “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life” (John 3:16). So, get this straight today, if you want something different from what you’re experiencing now, you’ve go to take some radical steps and do things differently. You’ve got to change the old way of thinking and employ new ideas. Perhaps at work you’ve been noted as being the tardy employee, and now you’re expecting to have sterling recommendations and promotions from your bosses.</p>
<p>First, you’d have to change the old order. Start practising getting to work early; learn to sit down and finish your work in time, and be excellent at your job. Or maybe you don’t pray and study your Bible regularly as you should, yet you’re expecting to come out victoriously in life – that won’t happen, until you change things.</p>
<p>Right now, list out those areas where you need to make a change, and consciously write out the new steps your going to take to effect the change you desire, and then go for it! Don’t leave those things merely on paper; make them part of your personal development project and before long, your situation would have changed for the best.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I ask that you help me identify those areas where I must make definite changes, so I might chart a new course of success for my life. I commit myself to diligently following through with the decisions and plans you inspire me to make today, in Jesus’ Name Amen.</p>

<p>“Be strong, courageous, and firm; fear not nor be in terror before them, for it is the Lord your God Who goes with you; He will not fail you or forsake you.” (DEUTERONOMY 31:6 AMPC)</p>
<p>“Hey, what was that sound?!” Kelly quivered as her eyes widened in fright. She was scared to stay in her room all alone, especially when it was dark. She was a Christian but didn’t know she had authority over the devil in Jesus’ Name. That’s just like some people: they’re afraid of dark places, and they nurse different phobias in their minds. The reason many live in fear of the devil is their ignorance of the scriptures, hence they arrogate too much power to the devil. As God’s child, it’s wrong for you to be afraid of anything. Throughout the scriptures, God repeatedly admonishes us not to fear. There is no reason whatsoever for any Christian to be afraid of the devil, for he’s already defeated!</p>
<p>In Matthew 28:18, Jesus said, “I have been given all authority in heaven and earth” (TLB). Notice He said “all authority,” not “some authority,” meaning there’s none left for the devil. Satan has been completely paralysed and rendered helpless by Jesus! The Lord has dislodged and dispossessed him and all his cohorts of their powers! He stripped them of everything that’s of value, leaving satan and his cohorts helpless.</p>
<p>Having done that, He then paraded satan and his demons as prisoners of war—beaten, battered and disgraced! “[God] disarmed the principalities and powers that were ranged against us and made a bold display and public example of them, in triumphing over them in Him and in it [the cross]” (Colossians 2:15 AMPC). Then He gave you authority over them (Luke 10:19)!</p>
<p>Do you now see why you must refuse to be harassed or tormented by fear of any kind? You ought to live in faith—faith in God and in His Word, faith in the victory of Jesus over satan and the cohorts of darkness. That victory was for you! Glory to God!
Declare to yourself throughout today: “I have been given all authority in Jesus’ Name, and I use it today to reign in my world.”</p>

<p>&quot;And have clothed yourselves with the new [spiritual self], which is [ever in the process of being] renewed and remolded into [fuller and more perfect knowledge upon] knowledge after the image (the likeness) of Him Who created it&quot; (COLOSSIANS 3:10 AMPC)</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &quot;renewed&quot; above is the verb &quot;Anakainoo,&quot; and it means a qualitative difference, in terms of newness and quality. It&#x27;s a word that describes a keyword in 2 Corinthians 3:18: &quot;But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are CHANGED into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.&quot;</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &quot;Changed&quot; is &quot;metamorphoo&quot;; a change in state, form, kind, quality or glory; a continuous transformation. But how is it done? It&#x27;s through knowledge, full and exact knowledge (Greek: &quot;epignosis&quot;). This isn&#x27;t just the knowledge of mere or distant acquaintance, but one that relates with that which is known. You&#x27;re being renewed in this full knowledge of God which you gain through meditation and revelation.</p>
<p>In &quot;Epignosis,&quot; you become what you know; the knowledge that&#x27;s granted you transforms your life. As you receive God&#x27;s Word into you, your spirit is renewed, refreshed, polished anew; you glow more and more! It&#x27;s the reason you must let the Word of God dwell in you richly, because the more you know Him, the more the glory, grace, wisdom and effectiveness of the Spirit are manifested and increased in your life.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63, &quot;It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.&quot; It&#x27;s only God&#x27;s Word that can impact, transform, brighten and glorify the human spirit.</p>

<p>&quot;Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once d take possession, for we are well able to overcome it&quot; (NUMBERS 13:30 NKJV).</p>
<p>Numbers 13 tells the story of God, instructing Moses to send a man out of every tribe to spy out the land of Canaan. These twelve men were to infiltrate Canaan and report back to Moses. However, when they returned to the camp with the feedback of their surveillance, they all confirmed the land of Canaan to be a magnificent country---a land flowing with milk and honey---and even presented some of its fruits as proof.</p>
<p>But quite sadly, ten of the twelve spies bewailed their weakness and how the inhabitants of Canaan were fierce, and how huge and well fortified their cities were. Worse yet, they lamented how fear gripped their hearts on sighting the descendants of the giant, Anak in the land. (Read their distressing report in Numbers 13:31, 33).</p>
<p>This news of gloom of how the land devours its inhabitants aroused discouragement in the hearts of the Israelites. But two of these spies---Caleb and Joshua---spoke differently. They saw victories and possibilities; therefore, they interrupted the people saying, &quot;Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it&quot; (Numbers 13:30 NKJV). They further charged the assembly, &quot;Just don&#x27;t rebel against GOD! And don&#x27;t be afraid of those people. Why, we&#x27;ll have them for lunch! They have no protection and GOD is on our side. Don&#x27;t be afraid of them!&quot; (Numbers 14:9 MSG).</p>
<p>Never be intimidated by your detractors and adversaries. If you&#x27;re a business person for example, don&#x27;t wallow in deep thoughts about how influential your competitors are or get intimidated by the high-rise conglomerates close to you. Don&#x27;t become unsettled at the many blue-chip multinationals you have to contend with. You&#x27;re the seed of Abraham; therefore, you have the advantage.</p>

<p>&quot;For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak&quot; (JOHN 12:49-50)</p>
<p>Jesus tells us in the verse above that His words are the Father&#x27;s commandments; everything He said came from the Father. In other words, the Father gave Him a commandment of what He should say or what He should speak. What He said in the next verse is even more inspiring. He said, &quot;And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak&quot; (John 12:50). Amazing!</p>
<p>In John 20:21, Jesus said, &quot;peace be unto you. As my Father had sent me even so send I you.&quot; Notice that He wasn&#x27;t only talking to James, John, Peter or other Apostles, but to us today. Thus, the same way He spoke the Father&#x27;s words, we&#x27;re to speak heavenly words; divine words. We&#x27;ve been given a commandment of what we should say, and what we should speak.</p>
<p>In Christianity, we don&#x27;t live for ourselves; we live for Him. We don&#x27;t speak for ourselves or from ourselves; we speak for Him, and from Him, just like Jesus. We have words given to us to speak. Hebrews 13:5-6 says, &quot;for he hath said...So that we may boldly say&quot; Speak heavenly words like Jesus, and live the life of heaven on earth.</p>
<p>God designed divinity to be released through words! Words are unlimited and eternal; they go into the realm of the spirit. You can speak from your closet and it will have impact anywhere in the world. Therefore, when you have a situation to deal with, meditate on the Word; soak your spirit in the Word until only the Word comes out of your mouth; divine words from heaven. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world (1 JOHN 4:4)</p>
<p>The Christian is the God-man; one in whom Christ literally dwells. Knowing this therefore, you must be God-inside minded; the greater One lives in you, meaning that you have nothing to fear in life. This was the Apostle John’s mentality, and it should be your mindset as well. In 1 John 5:4, he said, “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world”</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what’s out there in the world; you’ve overcome them all, because you’re born of God, and Christ lives in you. You’ve overcome every force, every power everything that’s against you.</p>
<p>In John 16:33, Jesus said, “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” God’s Word is spiritual law. If He says you’ve overcome the world, with its troubles, failures, and darkness, then you have.</p>
<p>Acknowledge and walk in the reality of your divine life in Christ; who He’s made you, and all that He’s bequeathed to you. Reign and rule over circumstances. Refuse and reject anything that’s inconsistent with the life of Christ in you.</p>
<p>Let the evidence of the indwelling Christ be seen in the quality of life you live. Let it be a testimony to those around you that indeed, there’s a higher life in Christ, and you’re living and enjoying that life. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one (JOB 5:2).</p>
<p>Often times, people get critical and envious of others instead of seeing the good done by them; it’s an ugly spirit! Never allow it in your life. This ugly attitude was what moved Saul to try to kill David after David killed Goliath: “And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall” (1 SAMUEL 19:10).</p>
<p>Saul was envious of David’s success, because of how others praised him: “And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands” (1 Samuel 18:7). I’ve often said that the fact that someone else is succeeding doesn’t mean you’re failing; you measure your success by what God has called you to do. So when you see those who are doing well, and are being praised for their work, rejoice with them! Be genuinely excited for them! Rather than become bitter or critical, look out for what you can learn from them!</p>
<p>People become jealous and envious only when they are inordinately desirous of another’s advantages. If you walk in love, you’ll never be jealous of anyone, for you know you couldn’t ever be disadvantaged in any way!</p>
<p>As members of the same body of Christ, the success of one is the success of all; when one wins, he wins for us all! That’s because God’s desire is for every one of us to prosper and excel! Thus, instead of being threatened by the prosperity of others, be happy for them, and never criticize them for it. God&#x27;s grace is sufficient for us all!</p>

<p>&quot;They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course&quot; (Psalm 82:5)</p>
<p>Many who are victims in life are actually not the victims of the devil but of ignorance. In Hosea 4:6, God said, &quot;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge&quot; He didn&#x27;t say His people are destroyed by the devil.</p>
<p>Think about it: what would you do or how would you live if you discovered that no sickness could actually fasten itself to your body? If you found out that you have a life that&#x27;s incapable of failure, a life that can&#x27;t be defeated or destroyed; how would that affect your mentality? It&#x27;ll most certainly change your appreciation of yourself. These were my discoveries in the Word of God many years ago. But many aren&#x27;t acquainted with these truths, and as a result, they measure their lives on the basis of the flesh; what they perceive with their natural senses.</p>
<p>Your life is based on the information that you have. Your standard of life is limited to your knowledge. No one ever lived beyond the level of his knowledge. If you have the knowledge of God&#x27;s Word, it&#x27;ll make the difference in your life. Our theme verse says, &quot;They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness&quot; This is the reason some of God&#x27;s children are suffering and struggling in life. They don&#x27;t know who the new creation is.</p>
<p>When the reality of the Word and who you are in Christ dawns on you, you suddenly come to a place of absolute confidence and independence, where you realize that the world doesn&#x27;t determine what happens with you. You become like Jesus, who had no sense of need. That&#x27;s the life He came to give us; and as you study and meditate on the Word, not only do you discover your inheritance in Christ, you also receive the faith to relate with, and enjoy all that God has made available to you in Him. Glory to His Name forever!</p>

<p>&quot;And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in his Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it&quot; (JOHN 14:13-14)</p>
<p>Prior to His ascension, the Lord Jesus said, &quot;All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost&quot; (Matthew 28:18-19). All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Jesus. Everything that exists in this world and beyond is subject to the Name of Jesus. What does this mean? It means everything is subject to you, because you live in His Name. His Name belongs to you.</p>
<p>When you speak in His Name, your words carry the same power and authority as though Jesus Himself were the one speaking. His Name has power everywhere. It has power over governments, devils, principalities and powers. Hallelujah! Use that Name.</p>
<p>Read our opening verse again. This is talking about making demands in the Name of Jesus and bringing all things into subjection to you. Peter acted on this when he said to a man who was crippled from birth, &quot;In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.&quot; He then got the crippled man by the right hand, pulled him up, and his ankle bones received strength; healed by the power of God (Acts 3:6-8).</p>
<p>You have the greatest blessing and gift of all times; the Name of Jesus; use it every day, and everywhere. When you make a demand or decree a thing in His Name, He sees to it that it happens. His Name is the solution to every problem. It makes no difference the predicament you&#x27;re in; declare, &quot;In the Name of the Lord Jesus, I&#x27;m more than a conqueror. Everything is subject to me. Blessed be God!&quot; With His Name, you can never be defeated; you have dominion over Satan and the powers of darkness. Hallelujah!</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="youve-crucified-the-flesh---pastor-chris-oyakhilome4165">YOU’VE CRUCIFIED THE FLESH - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~4165<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to YOU’VE CRUCIFIED THE FLESH - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~4165" title="Direct link to YOU’VE CRUCIFIED THE FLESH - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~4165" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#youve-crucified-the-flesh---pastor-chris-oyakhilome4165">​</a></h2>
<p>And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts (GALATIANS 5:24).</p>
<p>There’re Christians who are enslaved by certain habits, which they keep praying to God to help them overcome. Unfortunately, for most of them, the more they pray, the more they find themselves controlled and dominated by those habits.</p>
<p>This has left them confused, and thinking their situation is beyond remedy. Some have even backslidden, because they thought they couldn’t be free.
But in studying the Scriptures, we find that it says in Romans 6:14, “For Sin shall not have dominion over you” Our opening verse is also unequivocal: “they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts”; meaning that if you’re in Christ, you can’t be bound by any habit. So, what then is the problem of those who seem to be in bondage to certain habits? It’s simply their lack of knowledge.
God never asked us to fight the flesh or struggle with sin and habits; we’ve crucified the flesh; we’ve overcome the world; we have dominion over Satan and sin. So, when some Christians or even preachers counsel others to “crucify the flesh,” it’s a contradiction.</p>
<p>It’s fruitless to try to be who you already are or get what you already have. If God says you’ve crucified the flesh, then that’s it! Your role is to respond and say, “I don’t get, and can never be, dominated by sin or the flesh, because I am Christ’s. Therefore, I’ve crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts.”</p>
<p>Galatians 5:25 says, “If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.” Since we were born into the spirit and we live in the spirit, we’re to walk in the spirit. So, simply, if you’ve not been walking in the spirit, start walking in the spirit; that is, in the light of God’s Word. Declare, “From this day, my flesh won’t control me; my mind won’t dictate to me; I refuse to be sense-ruled, for the Word of God has become my compass, and I live the Word.”</p>
<p>Galatians 5:16 says, “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.” How do you walk in the Spirit? It’s by walking in the light of God’s Word. It’s by walking in the truth in Christ; in the light of your righteousness and glory in Him. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>There’s a definite act required for salvation; it’s the confession of the lordship of Jesus. You can do so right away by praying the prayer below with faith in your heart:</p>
<p>“O Lord God, I believe with all my heart in Jesus Christ,Son of the living God. I believe He died for me and God raised Him from the dead. I believe He’s alive today. I confess with my mouth  that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day.Through Him and in His Name, I have eternal life; I’m born again.Thank you Lord, for saving my soul!</p>
<p>I’m now a child of God. I now have Christ dwelling in me and greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4)! I now walk in the consciousness of my new life in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>&quot;CONGRATULATIONS&quot;, you are now born into the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>If you said the Prayer of Salvation, Type &quot;I RECEIVE&quot;</p>
<p>CONFESSION FOR YOU
Sin has no dominion over me. I live in the spirit, having crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts. I’ve overcome the world; I’m superior to Satan; I’m washed, sanctified, and justified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus! Hallelujah!</p>

<p>If you walk in the light of God&#x27;s word,it doesn&#x27;t matter how you look physically, God looks at the heart.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 6:9 KJV<!-- -->:Know<!-- --> ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
10
KJV<!-- -->:Nor<!-- --> thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>God wants everyone who&#x27;s living according to the above to turn from their ways.</p>
<p>Romans 1:27 KJV<!-- -->:And<!-- --> likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>
<p>According to the bible no one was born a thief, a cheat etc or any of the above characteristics, you have to acquire them. In the same way no one was born a homosexual. So let no one deceive you. The want to get rid of the bible. Don&#x27;t deceive yourself.</p>
<p>About the vaccine: when there&#x27;s trouble, God tells us to pray and it&#x27;s because He plans to answer you. God will respond. Hallelujah. The reason we are praying is because like i told you all what they&#x27;re doing is to persecute the church. It was an ultimate persecution to the church. Study the church history, if you don&#x27;t you can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t imagine the kind of persecution the church went through. They were forced to worship the emperor as God, some had their skins tore up etc and you need to know what others went through. So if you&#x27;re facing challenges, understand you have to pray. Participate in the pray-a-thon, if these shakes you, what will be your next temptation. I&#x27;ve told you that the idea they want us to believe science,is actually to lure men to believe religion.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m being the word of God to you. This is very important. All these things I&#x27;m telling you,it&#x27;s not by the mind of a professor, noooooooo, i speak to you from the spirit. The word of God is a complete package. It&#x27;s speak to us of the past, present and future.</p>
<p>The word easter is a ridiculous translation of the greek word pascal, why is translated easter meanwhile it&#x27;s actually passover.</p>
<p>Be sober, be vigilant, be watchful. Don&#x27;t be like anybody else. God said His people are destroyed for the lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>When it&#x27;s said we&#x27;re made in the image of God, it means, we look like Him, we&#x27;re just like Him, we&#x27;re his icon. It&#x27;s also a expression of character.
Romans 8:23</p>
<p>When you talk about the image , we&#x27;re talking about the outward representation,</p>
<p>God said He made us in His image and likeness, so it&#x27;s not only the physical (outline) but His characteristics, function etc so the word image goes beyond just outline, (complexion, hair, etc) they&#x27;re things that change as we grow and all these things that change can&#x27;t be used to describe God. Permanent things like our hands, eyes , nose etc doesn&#x27;t change, these things look like God,</p>
<p>Jude 1:6</p>
<p>When a Christian dies, his spirit goes directly to God.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:6-8
When the christian is absent from the body, he&#x27;s present with the lord. When a man&#x27;s spirit goes to God, he&#x27;s present with the lord, but not yet having a celestial body, but has a certain level of functioning.</p>
<p>Thank you Lord for dying for me. I&#x27;m alive in Christ. Glorrrryyyyyyyyyyyy.</p>
<p>When you pray for soul winning, be specific. Give yourself a target. We have to do even more. The whole world must be reached for the Gospel. We have to do it. The whole world must hear the gospel</p>
<p>Everything that&#x27;s of substance must have foundation.</p>
<p>In these end times, satan will be allow by God to run this world because men love darkness than light, that&#x27;s why he&#x27;ll run this world by the antichrist for a certain period of time with another called the false prophets. Satan will give to the man of sin ,his power. Those days will be terrible days of darkness. Etc. When you understand this you can know what&#x27;s happening around the world.</p>

<p>And…I will bless thee…and thou shalt be a blessing (GENESIS 12:2)</p>
<p>There’re lots of beautiful definitions for the word “blessing” or the infinitive, “bless”; one of them is the invocation of the ability, favour, and direction to prosper. When you’re blessed, the ability to prosper is invoked in your life; it’s inherent in you and works all the time. You have the ability to succeed, such that anything that concerns you turns out excellently.</p>
<p>The invocation of favour means divine favour works in your life in a way that even your detractors are compelled to favour you. Even when you’re not interested in certain privileges that are yours, or don’t have enough information to desire them, that divine favour causes them to come to you. How important it is for you to recognise, and walk in this consciousness!</p>
<p>The third element in our definition of blessing is the direction to prosper. That’s equally so powerful because when that’s invoked in your life, you find that you’re always at the centre of God’s perfect will; you go in the right direction, for the right purpose, and at the right time. Even when you don’t have a clue, that divine power of blessing causes you or literally places you in the centre of God’s will.</p>
<p>There’re people who always get into trouble; there seems to be something working in them to get them into trouble; but not you! You’re the blessed of the Lord. There’s a divine elixir working in you, that steers you away from trouble and keeps you on the path of life; on the path of divine destiny.</p>
<p>When you’re blessed, your steps are always ordered of the Lord. You become a problem solver. Blessings begin to flow as soon as you enter a place! You’re always just on time to be favoured and directed in the way of prosperity. These elements of blessing don’t work sometimes only; they work continuously, without fail. Become conscious that in you are the ability, favour, and direction to prosper, because you’re the blessed of the Lord. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>But one of the soldiers, at this point, this was when Jesus, was on the cross been crucified, he was not the first person to be crucified in those days, but something happens here that is significant, and you going to take notice of it, Jesus was already dead on the cross and just to find out whether or not he was dead, the soldier comes with a spear, and pierces him, through his side and the Bible says forthwith came there out blood and water. (JOHN 19:33 -34)</p>
<p>John 19:35, means there is something about this water and blood that came out of Jesus that was so important to the writer that made him say it was a sign. And on this occasion, he lets us know a sign has just taken place, blood and water just came out of the body of Jesus and he says the one who saw it bore record.</p>
<p>We know that his record is true and he has written it that you meant to believe, what does he want you to believe, turn to John 2:19-21, John said Jesus was talking about the temple of his body, John understood he was talking about his body. Jesus Christ was the Passover lamb, on that great day. That night, that lamb was killed, and John already alluded to that, he already said it.</p>
<p>Jesus was our Passover lamb. When Jesus died, he died when that Passover lamb was supposed to be slathered. And now John is standing and he remembers going to the temple seeing blood flowing asks and he was told a soldier pierced the side of the mater and blood and water poured out, but the man is already dead, he says forthwith came out, that means immediately, as though there were still pressure, ordinarily it shouldn’t come out like that; he bore witness, he said that’s blood and water coming out John 2:19-21, he was talking about the temple of his body, Halleluiah!!</p>
<p>So who is Jesus? He is our lamb sacrificed, the new temple, the new and living way when he died, he tore the old temple in two opening and the new and living way, that old temple is gone, the new and living temple is here. Jesus Christ is our temple. The lamb was slain once, you never have to come to the temple again and see the blood, and he was slain once and for all. Glory to God!</p>

<p>If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it (John 14:14)</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to believe in God and not believe in miracles. A Christian who doesn&#x27;t believe in miracles doesn&#x27;t know who God is. A miracle is the supernatural intervention of God in the natural affairs of men, an intervention that transcends human reasoning, ability, science, and logic.</p>
<p>Therefore, to believe in God and not expect miracles is a contradiction. So, believe and expect miracles. The Christian life is a day-to-day experience of, and journey in the supernatural. When you speak, your words aren&#x27;t ordinary, for they contain power, the miracle element to affect and influence your world and cause a change. In Mark 11:23, Jesus said, &quot;You shall have what you say.&quot; In our opening verse, He said, &quot;If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.&quot;</p>
<p>The underlined word is the Greek, &quot;Poieo,&quot; and it means, “make”; Jesus is saying, “I&#x27;ll make it in my Name; even if that thing doesn&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;ll make it happen.” See how He loves us! It delights the Lord to bless you and do good things for you. It&#x27;s His joy to answer your prayers and grant your heart&#x27;s desires. He said in Luke 12:32, “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father&#x27;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”</p>
<p>He can, and will do anything for you, because you believe. If there&#x27;s a tumour in your body, for instance, declare, “Tumour, in the Name of Jesus, you can&#x27;t stay in this body; I cut you out!” If there&#x27;s been a problem with your heart, command it to function normally, in the Name of Jesus. If it&#x27;s about your finances, command a change, and it&#x27;ll be so. Declare what you want. Voice your miracle. Create and sustain your victorious life with your faith-filled words.</p>

<p>&quot;And I say unto thee.... I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH; AND THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST IT&quot; (Matthew 16:18)</p>
<p>These words above came from the very lips of the Master; He&#x27;s personally responsible for building His Church. But how&#x27;s He doing it? We know that the Lord Jesus is in heaven, but the Holy Spirit is with us, and in us, continuing His ministry here in the earth. So, He builds His Church through the ministry or instrumentality of God&#x27;s Word.</p>
<p>The Word of God is everything; that&#x27;s what gave birth to you, and therefore it&#x27;s what will sustain you. 1 Peter 1:23 says, &quot;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.&quot; James tells us the same thing: &quot;Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures&quot; (James 1:18). The Word is your life, therefore you must yield yourself to the Word to build and nourish you. Study the Word voraciously. Meditate on the Scriptures. That way, you&#x27;re submitting yourself to the Lordship of the Word.</p>
<p>The Word is the only ingredient that can transform and build our lives on all three levels: spirit, soul and body. When the Word of God gets into your spirit, it produces in you what it talks about. For example, the Word of salvation, which is the next step. Romans 1:16 says, &quot;For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth&quot; That means God&#x27;s power to save anyone is in the Gospel of Christ---His Word of salvation.</p>
<p>In Acts 20:32, Paul writes, &quot;And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.&quot; Make the important decision to keep improving your life by being a student of the Word. It&#x27;ll cause you to have an effectual life of success and constant victories. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 5:21).</p>
<p>Righteousness is the nature of God in you that produces the ability to stand before God without guilt, inferiority, or condemnation. Righteousness is the outworking of divine grace, granting acceptance, liberty, and rights to the human spirit in the presence of God. So, the grace of God has given us this righteousness; that’s what we read in our opening verse.</p>
<p>Our righteousness is God’s gift to us in Christ Jesus, because of His grace. By grace, we received God’s nature of righteousness and were translated into the Kingdom of His Love-Son, where we reign and rule with Him. John 1:17 says, “For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.” Romans 5:17 says, “they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Not only do we have dominion over the devil and circumstances, we live in the righteousness of God, and live as the righteousness of God. Nothing, and no one, can condemn us anymore, because God has justified us; He’s acquitted us, and it was righteous for Him to do this for us: “To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus” (Romans 3:26).</p>
<p>It’s your responsibility to take a hold of your righteousness; that is, to become righteousness-conscious and exercise dominion over Satan, the world, and all circumstances. Righteousness-consciousness gives you that boldness and confidence to pray and expect answers. It gives you mastery over demons and their manipulations. It makes you a champion in life!</p>
<p>It really doesn’t matter where you’ve been, what you’ve done, or who you’ve been; you’re now accepted in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:6). Now, in His presence, you’re at liberty; you don’t have to be afraid anymore; you’re free to express yourself and to be yourself, unashamed before Him. You’re free to live joyfully, and to worship Him, because you have right-standing with Him; you’re His righteousness. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus (PHILEMON 1:6)</p>
<p>As a new creation in Christ Jesus, you’re peculiar. There’re so many good things inside you, and there’s so much that the Lord has ordained your life for. He didn’t create you for nothing; you’re valuable to Him. Therefore, you must love and value yourself, because you exude the glory of God.</p>
<p>God reigns, establishes, and spreads His righteousness on earth today through you. Revelation 5:10 says Christ has made us “kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.” In 1 Corinthians 15:25, we read that “he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.” Jesus isn’t physically present on earth today, yet He’s reigning through you. In Christ, you’ve been made a king-priest unto God (Revelation 1:6). The glorious Gospel of the blessed God has been committed to your trust.</p>
<p>Now, if the Lord would rely on you this much, reigning through you, and committing such glorious Gospel to your trust, then you’re truly valuable to Him. Therefore, accord yourself the same value. Think, talk, walk, and live as someone special, for indeed you are. You’re a custodian of divine knowledge and of Kingdom realities; how big that is!</p>
<p>The Bible says God spreads the beautiful and pleasant fragrance of His knowledge through you in every place: “Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place” (2 Corinthians 2:14). It’s your ministry, calling, and responsibility to make the Word known to the world. Therefore, love Him, and love what He made—YOU!</p>
<p>Enjoy every moment of your life. Appreciate you and appreciate others around you. Challenge your mind in the positive direction of life and you’ll be amazed at the results. You’re God’s best.</p>
<p>Never judge yourself by what people say about you; what matters is what God thinks of you. And you know what? He thinks highly of you, which is why He invested so much in you. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made&quot; (JOHN 1:1-3)</p>
<p>Just as no other apostle gave us the revelation of the Church like Paul, no one gave the Church the revelation of the Person of Jesus, the incarnate Word, like John. He tells us the story of the Word, and starts from the beginning. In John 1:10-14 he says, &quot;He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not....And the Word was made (became) flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.&quot; Hallelujah!</p>
<p>He was in the world, but the world knew Him not; who was that? The Word! We read in verse 14, &quot;And the Word was made (became) flesh, and dwelt among us&quot;; John is letting you know the origin of Jesus. While the other Gospel writings (Matthew and Luke) began their account by tracing the earthly genealogy of Jesus, John&#x27;s Gospel declares His divinity, giving us the actual origin of the Man Jesus---who He really is.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the Word that pre-existed creation and by whom all things were created (John 1:1-3). He was &quot;the Voice of the Lord God that Adam and Eve heard walking in the garden&quot; (Genesis 3:8). He is the Wisdom that David and Solomon wrote so passionately about. His birth was such a marvel to the hosts of heaven; it was a miracle beyond what they had ever seen (Luke 2:13-14).</p>
<p>Suddenly, they were looking at the Creator of the universe, the Ancient of days, wrapped in swaddling clothes; the Word in heaven had visited men in the flesh! Every step Jesus took was the Word of God in motion. He was the Word personified. Glory to His Name forever!</p>

<p>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life (1 JOHN 5:13 ESV)</p>
<p>Being born again, you have the life and nature of God in you; therefore, you’re not an ordinary person. 2 Peter 1:4 says, “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature”</p>
<p>Some Christians refer to themselves as “ordinary human beings,” feigning some kind of humility, but that’s sad. As long as you believe, confess, and act on that statement, you’re conforming to the human nature. Whereas, your human nature was supplanted by God’s divine nature the moment you were born again.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 says, “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” You’re a new creature, with a new life—the divine life—not the human life. The life in you now is no longer by blood, but by the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible says the life of the flesh is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11). But Romans 8:8-9 says, “So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.” But read the concluding part; it says, “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit”</p>
<p>Being born of the Spirit, you’re sustained by the Spirit; He’s the life of your physical body. Romans 8:11 says, “But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”</p>
<p>Now you can further understand when the Bible says in John 1:12-13, “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.” Become more conscious of the God-life in you, and give expression to your divine nature in Christ.</p>

<p>&quot;The LORD will perfect that which concerneth you.&quot; (PSALM 138:8)</p>
<p>The scripture above should give you absolute confidence in life, because it shows that your future is secure. Think about the fact that the Lord Himself is the One who perfects all that concerns you! That means you have nothing to worry about. I was so delighted to make this discovery as a young lad many years ago. It made me know that my future was secure. He that owns tomorrow perfects my life and all that concerns me. Hallelujah! Make that your daily confession.</p>
<p>Acts 14:17 AMPC declares that the Lord gives you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons; He satisfies your heart with nourishment and happiness. Blessed be His Name forever! Trust the Lord with your life. Don&#x27;t say, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t know what tomorrow holds; life is full of ups and downs.&quot; Don&#x27;t talk like that! Your tomorrow is settled.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah 29:11, He said, &quot;For I the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end.&quot; There&#x27;s an expected end; the script has been written: you&#x27;ll forever be a victor! You already won, because everything in life has been programmed for your advantage (Romans 8:28).</p>
<p>Read Isaiah 54:17 and notice how the Lord brags about your invincibility and the fact that you have nothing to fear. He said, &quot;No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgement thou shalt condemn&quot;</p>
<p>Your life is for the glory of God. Nothing in this world can defeat you or put you under. There&#x27;s nothing to struggle with or try to overcome, because you have triumphed already in Christ; refuse to think otherwise. Don&#x27;t allow the circumstances rob you of your joy, fulfilment and peace.</p>
<p>Peace is a consequence of trust, and trust is a product of knowledge. This is why you must get to know the Lord for yourself in such a personal way, through study and meditation on the Word. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works (JOHN 14:10).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the active agent of the Godhead; He’s the power of God; He carries out the acts of God. Man was created and formed by the Holy Spirit; everything God does outside of His throne is through the Holy Spirit. It’s important to understand that nothing works without the Holy Spirit; there’s no life without Him.</p>
<p>If you were tasked with an evangelical assignment in your local church, for example, until and unless, you execute it by the power of the Spirit; except He’s the one working in, and through you, it’ll be a fruitless expedition. The Bible says, “For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure” (Philippians 2:13); that’s referring to the Holy Spirit. No one can do God’s work without Him. The Bible says, “Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts” (Zechariah 4:6).</p>
<p>Not even the Lord Jesus could do without the Holy Spirit. All the great works He did were done through the power of the Holy Spirit. We read what He said in our opening verse: “the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.” If Jesus needed the Holy Spirit, it then means you can do nothing without Him.</p>
<p>No wonder God wants us to be filled with the Spirit always (Ephesians 5:18). The Holy Spirit is God at work in us, building His Church through us. Recognise Him as your helper, and you’ll function always with His ability and strength; He’ll make you a success in life and in all that you do.</p>

<p>Don’t get tired of helping others. You will be rewarded when the time is right, if you don’t give up (GALATIANS 6:9 CEV).</p>
<p>Being prosperous means a lot more than amassing wealth for yourself; rather, it involves being able to help others. The reason God has blessed us is so we can serve Him and bless others. This is very clear when you read 2 Corinthians 9:8-9 (AMP). It says, “And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation]. As it is written, He [the benevolent person] scatters abroad; He gives to the poor; His deeds of justice and goodness and kindness and benevolence will go on and endure forever.”</p>
<p>True prosperity is looking out for opportunities to be a blessing to others. It’s finding joy and excitement in helping and extending love to others. A truly prosperous person is of a benevolent spirit; he’s quick to give, and derives joy in helping others become prosperous.</p>
<p>Let’s reach more with the Gospel by becoming a part of translating Pastor Chris’ Messages in several languages.</p>
<p>It makes no difference if you’ve had unpleasant experiences in trying to help others. Perhaps you’ve helped someone become successful who eventually turned against you; don’t become bitter. Keep up the good work, knowing that the Lord will reward your labour of love. Hebrews 6:10 says, “For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name” Moreover, Jesus said, “But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil” (Luke 6:35).</p>
<p>Remain the helper and the giver. Remember, helping others is a gift; it’s a unique ability from God. And the Bible says, “If you have the gift of helping others, do it with the strength that God supplies” (1 Peter 4:11 CEV). As you help others, the Lord will keep increasing His grace on your life, for greater victories and successes.</p>

<p>God placed parents and guardians in the world for a reason, and He expects young people to pay them respect and honour. To “honour” means to “recognise, esteem or consider someone with great value.” Thus, honouring your parents or guardians means you recognise their role and value their contributions in your life. You do this by greeting them properly, talking and listening to them respectfully. Don’t be rude to them, and if you disagree with their point of view at any time, don’t react in anger. Rather, express yourself with humility and thank them for their corrections.</p>
<p>For some, the ones who gave birth to them may not be the ones who brought them up. Still, you have to honour both of them: those who gave birth to you and those who brought you up. The Bible says your days will be long in the earth when you do so.</p>
<p>GO DEEPER</p>
<p>Exodus 20:12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 5:16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
<p>Mark 7:10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</p>
<p>Colossians 3:20 Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</p>

Dear Father, I thank you for teaching me today to honour my parents and guardians. I make up my mind to always love, recognise and respect them at all times in all things, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it (JOHN 14:14)</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t make sense to believe in God and not believe in miracles. A Christian who doesn&#x27;t believe in miracles doesn&#x27;t know who God is. A miracle is the supernatural intervention of God in the natural affairs of men, an intervention that transcends human reasoning, ability, science, and logic.</p>
<p>Therefore, to believe in God and not expect miracles is a contradiction. So, believe and expect miracles. The Christian life is a day-to-day experience of, and journey in the supernatural. When you speak, your words aren&#x27;t ordinary, for they contain power, the miracle element to affect and influence your world and cause a change. In Mark 11:23, Jesus said, &quot;You shall have what you say.&quot; In our opening verse, He said, &quot;If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.&quot;</p>
<p>The underlined word is the Greek, &quot;Poieo,&quot; and it means, “make”; Jesus is saying, “I&#x27;ll make it in my Name; even if that thing doesn&#x27;t exist, I&#x27;ll make it happen.” See how He loves us! It delights the Lord to bless you and do good things for you. It&#x27;s His joy to answer your prayers and grant your heart&#x27;s desires. He said in Luke 12:32, “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father&#x27;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”</p>
<p>He can, and will do anything for you, because you believe. If there&#x27;s a tumour in your body, for instance, declare, “Tumour, in the Name of Jesus, you can&#x27;t stay in this body; I cut you out!” If there&#x27;s been a problem with your heart, command it to function normally, in the Name of Jesus. If it&#x27;s about your finances, command a change, and it&#x27;ll be so. Declare what you want. Voice your miracle. Create and sustain your victorious life with your faith-filled words.</p>

<p>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone (EZEKIEL 37:7)</p>
<p>To prophesy means to speak words of divine revelation and potency; words that have and give life. Ezekiel understood that it wasn’t just about releasing words, but releasing words with the right sound code; words of the Spirit. He said, “I prophesied as I was commanded.”</p>
<p>As he prophesied, the Bible records that there was a noise and the bones came together, bone to his bone. That’s quite profound, for it means every bone had a code, and the moment the word was given, they knew where to fit into, without any mistake.</p>
<p>God designed energy to be released through words, but you must have the right words. This is why the ministry of the Spirit, fellowshipping with Him, is indispensable in our lives, because it’s the Spirit that actually knows the codes. We listen to the Holy Spirit to receive guidance from Him. He tells us exactly what to say. He could show you in pictures, but you must say it as He said to say it; otherwise, it’ll not work.</p>
<p>Let the Spirit guide you. When there’re crises or daunting challenges, you say, “Holy Spirit, use me to pray accurately, because I know not what to pray for as I ought.” Then start praying in tongues. Sing and worship the Lord in tongues. Do this intensely, and while at it, channel your mind to your purpose, the issue at hand.</p>
<p>As you continue in tongues, soon enough, the gift of prophecy will be stirred from within you to prophesy and make declarations like Ezekiel, and you’ll utter the right sound codes. This is how to effect the changes you want in your finances, job, business, family, and anything that’s of a concern to you. Get the accurate sound code from the Spirit and utter it. You can change hopeless situations and effect positive changes in your life through the creative power of God’s Word in your mouth.</p>

<p>PRAYER FOR THE LEADERS OF NATIONS AND AGAINST THE SATANIC PLAN AND AGENDA TO CREATE A TRIBE OF VACCINATED PEOPLE AGAINST THE UNVACCINATED</p>
<p>1st TIMOTHY 2:1-4 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>ISAIAH 44 : 25 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish.</p>
<p>PRAYER POINT
Pray specially for the leaders of nations, that they will lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p>
<p>Pray for the nations of the world and take authority over every satanic plan and agenda to create a tribe of vaccinated people against the unvaccinated, declare that all their plans are frustrated.</p>
<p>Pray against the plan of the antichrist to execute his agenda ahead of time; put a stop to this and declare that it is not the time of the antichrist; this is the time of the Church; therefore, the Gospel is moving forward by free course unhindered.</p>
<p>Declare in the Name of Jesus that the forces of darkness causing leaders and men in authority to carry out the agenda of the evil one are completely defeated and their defenses are departed from them. We put a stop to all satanic operations and maneuvers and we declare that they proceed no further. PROCLAMATIONS</p>
<p>I PROCLAIM that the leaders of nations are submitted to the will of God for their lives and nations, and many of them are coming to salvation. I take authority and abolish the evil plans and agenda of the adversary to create a global tribe of vaccinated people and to persecute the unvaccinated. I declare that the time of the antichrist is not now, therefore he has no authority over the nations. I PROCLAIM that the nations belong to God and souls are being won in their billions to the Lord.</p>

<p>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed (1 CORINTHIANS 15:52)</p>
<p>At the Rapture, not everyone will hear the sound of the trumpet. It’ll be audible only to the Christians who died in Christ already and those alive at the time. Everybody else won’t hear it, because the sound of the trumpet would only be heard by faith. It’s not something you’re going to make an effort to hear, because as a Christian, you already live by faith. Everything about your life and your relationship with God is by faith; therefore, you’re going to hear it.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found.” (Hebrews 11:5). He was raptured by faith. So, with your faith in Jesus Christ, you have nothing to worry about; trust that when the trumpet sounds, you’re going to hear it.</p>
<p>As read in our theme verse, the sound of the trumpet will happen faster than the snap of your finger. In a twinkling of an eye, we’re out of here, and suddenly, we’re in heaven. Every Christian ought to go at the rapture. It therefore means that anyone who doesn’t make the “first flight” hasn’t been living for the Lord.</p>
<p>Keep your faith alive, and live for the Master every day. Walk in love and in righteousness. Focus on getting others ready for the Rapture and into the Kingdom of God .</p>
<p>DECLARATION
Oh, what a day of rejoicing it’ll be when the Master shows up! Today, I walk in the light of His Word and of my salvation, engrossed in the pursuit of the expansion of His Kingdom, seeking, above all, the rule and reign of His Kingdom in the earth and in the hearts of men. Amen.</p>

<p>A man’s wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offense (PROVERBS 19:11 NIV)</p>
<p>Every day, we’re presented with opportunities to be offended. Offences will come, according to the Bible. People will do things that may hurt or offend you, but it’s entirely up to you to decide whether or not to be offended..</p>
<p>In Mark 7, the Syrophenician woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit could have been offended at Jesus’ statement. She had cried after the Master for help, and in their ensuing dialogue, Jesus said, “Woman, it’s not right for us to give the children’s bread to dogs” (Mark 7:27).</p>
<p>The woman could have said, “How could He call me a dog, just because I’m asking him for help? Is this how He talks to people?” But no; she was smarter than that. In a remarkable display of humility, she replied, “Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children&#x27;s crumbs” (Mark 7:28). Consequently, she got her miracle!</p>
<p>Why wasn’t she offended by the Master’s statement? She had the heart of a true worshipper! As a true worshipper, you don’t care what anyone calls you, says to you or about you; you don’t care how anyone treats you. All that matters to you is your love for the Lord and your desire to please Him.</p>
<p>Always remember that it’s to your glory to overlook an offence. Don’t say, “I can’t take that insult for any reason!” You’ve been decorated with honour and kingdom dignity; no one, and nothing, can dishonour you.</p>
<p>This was the Apostle Paul&#x27;s understanding when he said, “For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities” (2 Corinthians 12:10 ESV). Glory to God!</p>

<p>There’s no reason for you to be afraid of the devil, because Jesus defeated and paralyzed him, and gave you the victory. So, you’ve triumphed over Satan already; never be afraid of him! Jesus has the keys of hell and of death, which means you don’t even have to be afraid of death. Death has also been defeated; it’s last enemy that shall be destroyed (1 Corinthians 15:26). So, why would you accommodate fear?</p>
<p>Jesus said, “the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me” (John 14:30). This was the testimony of the Son of God. This should be your testimony as well. Every now and then, you should declare: “Satan has nothing in me! He doesn’t have his doubts in me! He doesn’t have his fears in me!” Thoughts of fear will cripple your faith, and stop the power of God from flowing in your direction. So, when negative thoughts – thoughts of fear, defeat and frustration – come to you, eliminate them speedily.</p>
<p>Fear is a tormenting spirit that creates the perfect environment for Satan to intimidate and dominate people’s lives. However, the Holy Spirit in you helps you deal with fear; He’s the One that invigorates you with miracle-working ability in your inner man. He emboldens and strengthens you on the inside, dispelling fear of every kind.</p>
<p>Perhaps, you’ve been having fears in your life – fear of terror, fear that something terrible might happen to you, stop the fear! The Bible says, “He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler&quot; (Psalm 91:4). Wow! This is the Lord talking here, assuring you that there’s nothing to fear, because He’s with you always (Hebrews 13:5). Whether in the nighttime or daytime, He protects you and takes care of you. Therefore, rid your heart of fear!</p>
<p>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you (Luke 10:19)</p>

<p>Perseverance is such an important virtue for every Christian to have. The Bible admonishes us to add it to our faith: “Also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance” (2 PETER 1:5-6).</p>
<p>The key word that describes what the Apostle Peter is talking about is perseverance—‘ stickability!’</p>
<p>It refers to staying power; the ability to “keep keeping on” in the face of opposition! No matter what happens, refuse to buckle under any pressure; endure with hope. Things may look hard and very challenging; if you ever find yourself in such a situation, endure; go through it! Stick with what you believe! Don’t give up. In your life, learn to endure hardship with hope.</p>
<p>Some people endure without hope, but perseverance without hope is useless. Your perseverance must be in expectation of a positive outcome; you’re hopeful of a better and brighter day ahead, and you create the picture in your mind.</p>
<p>Tough situations are for tough minds; those who faint or cower in the day of adversity are of little strength (Proverbs 24:10). Therefore, endure hardness with hope, joy, and gladness, knowing that in all things, you’re more than a conqueror.</p>

<p>Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God (PHILIPPIANS 4:6).</p>
<p>The Amplified Classic Version of the opening scripture says, “Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance and in everything, by prayer and petition (definite requests), with thanksgiving, continue to make your wants known to God.” The Lord expects us to make definite requests of Him. Say exactly what you want!</p>
<p>There’s no need for vain repetitions or superfluity of words. Some people are that way when they pray, but Jesus said, “When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking” (Matthew 6:7). Some make vague requests. For instance, someone might say, “Help me Lord; I can’t continue like this,” and thinks he or she has prayed, but that’s not a definite request.</p>
<p>You have to state precisely what help you want. Is it help with your finances, your health, job, or your family? Whatever it is, be specific and act on the Word. Our opening verse gives us two key elements of effectual prayers: definite requests and thanksgiving. In Mark 11:23, the Lord Jesus said, “For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.”</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t tell us to speak to “mountains,” but to “this mountain,” teaching us to be definite in acting our faith. When you have a strong and definite desire for a change, make your faith proclamations accordingly, and begin to glorify God for the answers. Only when you’re specific in your requests are you able to effectively give thanks to God, because you know when they’re met.</p>
<p>It makes no difference what challenges you’re faced with; refuse to fret or doubt! Tell the Father what you want, and praise Him for the answer. He said ask and receive that your joy may be full (John 16:24).</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I thank you for the power in the Name of Jesus, and the authority I have to use that Name to effect specific changes as I may desire. I’m sustained by the power and authority of that Name, living the higher life of glory that you prearranged for me. I walk in divine wisdom, in dealing with the circumstances and affairs of life, today and always, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God (MATTHEW 4:4).</p>
<p>In today’s world, people are more particular about what they eat. While some eat the right foods to stay healthy, there’re those who, from eating all the wrong things, have put their health in jeopardy. It’s the same thing spiritually. As a Christian, you must feed on the right information. You must feed your faith with the Word of God. Some Christians would rather feed their fears than feed their faith. You feed your fears when you give attention to wrong or noxious information.</p>
<p>The food for the human spirit is God’s Word. Jesus said, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4). Whilst God’s Word makes the human spirit come alive—buoyant with faith, hope and love—unwholesome words poison and destroy the human spirit.</p>
<p>The effect of feeding on wrong information in the life of a Christian may not be seen overnight; but with time, such a person gets weaker and weaker spiritually. Before long, he’s no longer as fervent in spiritual things as he used to be. Then, his life takes a completely different turn from God’s original plan.</p>
<p>Give attention to the right information. Fortify and energize your spirit for success with God’s Word. The forces of life are domiciled in your spirit; as you feed your spirit with the Word, you’ll be able to produce every good thing you want in life from within you. Jesus said, “A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things” (Matthew 12:35).</p>

<p>&quot;For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure&quot; (PHILIPPIANS 2:13).</p>
<p>Many people have great ideas, be it about their jobs, finances, business, ministry or career; but sadly, not many are able to fulfil or bring those ideas to fruition. Yes, they have this very inspiring idea of what they&#x27;d do or could do, but they procrastinate; before long, discouraging thoughts and seeming &quot;valid reasons&quot; not to act will come up, until the inspiration wanes and the dream dies.</p>
<p>Success comes from &quot;doing&quot;; that is, acting; not from seeing only. That&#x27;s why we have lots of people with great ideas---in business, politics or ministry---whose ideas never amounted to a hill of beans; they never took action. In fact, if you&#x27;d listen to them speak, you&#x27;d be awed at their lofty ideas, but they lack the drive and motivation to act.</p>
<p>If the foregoing describes you, the solution is simple: you need to meditate on the Word. God&#x27;s Word is a propelling force.
That&#x27;s why beyond &quot;sophia&quot; and &quot;sunesis&quot; which are two different kinds of wisdom (remember, the Word of God is the wisdom of God), you must walk in &quot;Phronesis&quot;; (these are three kinds of wisdom in the Greek New Testament).</p>
<p>&quot;Sophia&quot; is theoretical wisdom and insight into reality; it&#x27;s the collective understanding of things. &quot;Sunesis&quot; is critical wisdom; that is, mental or analytical knowledge; the ability to understand concepts and see relationships between them. But &quot;Phronesis&quot; is practical wisdom; it&#x27;s a force that makes you do and say the right things before you even think.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you&#x27;re in this situation of &quot;conceptualizing&quot; and not &quot;acting,&quot; begin to have daily sessions of meditating on the Word. Begin with Philippians 2:13; several times every day, you say it loud, &quot;For it is God who works in me, both to will and to do of His good pleasure. He&#x27;s effectively at work in me, strengthening and energizing me, not just to think or know what to do, but actually do them.&quot; Practise this long enough and you&#x27;ll never have dreams or goals that didn&#x27;t materialize.</p>
<p>&quot;Doing&quot; people are successful people, because many people see but they don&#x27;t act! But when you see and act, it sets you apart for greatness. So, by the Spirit, go all out to pursue your dream and achieve your goals this year.</p>

<p>And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint (LUKE 18:1).</p>
<p>Why does God want us to always pray? It’s because it’s His intention to always answer our prayers. This should excite you to always pray; to take advantage of the privilege and opportunity of prayer, which, essentially, is a Spirit-to-spirit communication in divine fellowship.</p>
<p>Sadly, what many know about prayer is asking God for things. They see prayer as an avenue to beg or “force” God to do something for them, as though He’s unwilling. But that’s not the purpose of prayer. God isn’t against us; so, when we pray, we’re not trying to convince Him to do something He’s not inclined to do. Rather, we’re siding with Him in bringing His will to pass.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bible shows that there’re different kinds of prayer, with different rules governing each kind. Most Christians are acquainted with the prayer of faith. The prayer of faith is quick; it’s the kind of prayer you can pray on the go. But there’re lots of issues and challenges in this world that won’t go away by the prayer of faith. Such situations or issues require some passionate supplication for the desired change to take place. We read about this kind of prayer in James 5:16-18 (AMPC); it’s heartfelt and continued.</p>
<p>You may say, “But prayer is prayer”; no, prayer isn’t just prayer. You can’t apply the rules for the prayer of faith for the prayer of intercession; it won’t work. It’s one of the reasons people don’t have answers to their prayers; they’re praying the wrong way about their situation.</p>
<p>If, for example, any football player other than the team’s goalkeeper, within his own penalty area, deliberately handles the ball when in play, such a player will be penalized. The referee won’t overlook the infringement, because you can’t apply handball or basketball rules to football.</p>
<p>Study the Word to know, and apply the right rules for the different kinds of prayers and you’ll surely have results. Get our books titled, “How To Pray Effectively” and “Praying The Right Way” to learn more about the different kinds of prayer and their corresponding rules. They’ll enrich your prayer life.</p>

<p>May The Month Of ILLUMINATION.</p>
<p>THE HEAVENS declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows and proclaims His handiwork. [Rom. 1:20, 21.] Day after day pours forth speech, and night after night shows forth knowledge. There is no speech nor spoken word [from the stars]; their voice is not heard. Yet their voice [in evidence] goes out through all the earth, their sayings to the end of the world. Of the heavens has God made a tent for the sun, [Rom. 10:18.] Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; and it rejoices as a strong man to run his course. Its going forth is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the ends of it; and nothing [yes, no one] is hidden from the heat of it. The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the [whole] person; the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the Lord is pure and bright, enlightening the eyes. The [reverent] fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever; the ordinances of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, even than much fine gold; they are sweeter also than honey and drippings from the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is Your servant warned (reminded, illuminated, and instructed); and in keeping them there is great reward. Who can discern his lapses and errors? Clear me from hidden [and unconscious] faults. Keep back Your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then shall I be blameless, and I shall be innocent and clear of great transgression. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my [firm, impenetrable] Rock and my Redeemer - Psalm 19:1 - 14 AMPC.</p>
<p>Through God&#x27;s word, we are warned.</p>
<p>This month of May is the month of illumination. As you study, meditate, pray, your Heart is illuminated. Get ready as your heart will be illuminated. We just came from the month of truth. Some may hold truth and still walk in darkness.</p>
<p>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness - Romans 1:18 KJV</p>
<p>Truth can be held in unrighteousness. Without the right heart. It produces no results. If you open your heart, it will produce illumination. Something will happen in you and I&#x27;m excited about it. Thank the Lord for this message He has given us. Our hearts are flooded with lights. Thank you Lord Jesus. I like this. The eyes of your hearts are flooded with lights... Illuminated...</p>
<p>Hallelujah... Thank you Lord Jesus...</p>
<p>Song... Hallelujah... Hallelujah... Hallelujah... Hallelujah...</p>

<p>&quot;To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation&quot; (2 CORINTHIANS 5:19)</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no better way to express your love for Jesus Christ than to win souls for Him; the souls for whom He died. He gave His life for all men, and if you were the only one that needed salvation, He would still have come to die for you. He didn&#x27;t do it because we were many; He did it because we were valuable to God. Therefore, soul winning is worth everything. Practise it. It&#x27;s the most important thing on earth. It&#x27;s something for which you must express your faith.</p>
<p>You can say, &quot;In the Name of Jesus, I claim ten souls for Jesus Christ today, by the power of the Holy Spirit!&quot; And after making that declaration of faith, you go out for evangelism. Faith isn&#x27;t all about getting something for yourself. Let your faith work in reaching people for Christ; the growth you&#x27;d experience, both in your personal life and in the harvest of souls, will be astounding.</p>
<p>In John 5:19, Jesus said, &quot;I do what I see my Father do.&quot; Copy the Master. He was the greatest soul winner; the master soul winner. As you win souls, you&#x27;re carrying out His passion, and the glory of His Kingdom is manifested in your life in an extraordinary way. This is how you shine in the Kingdom. Recall what Jesus said about John the Baptist: &quot;He was a burning and a shining light&quot; (John 5:35). What a testimony!</p>
<p>You have to be a burning and a shining light, and there&#x27;s no other way than soul winning, impacting lives with the Gospel: &quot;And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever&quot; (Daniel 12:3). This is what you&#x27;ve to do, because it&#x27;s your life, your calling and responsibility. 2 Corinthians 5:19 says, &quot;To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.&quot;</p>

<p>Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all (1 Timothy 4:15 NKJV)</p>
<p>One of the problems that some Christians have bemoaned is the disparity between their personal experiences and the message of the Gospel that they “believe” and even preach. How do you preach healings and miracles as the works of God, and then get sick; or preach about financial prosperity, and are in deep financial difficulties? It shows that there’s a missing link.</p>
<p>Some may think the solution to this is intense prayer and fasting so they can “clean” up their lives and get rid of whatever may be hindering their “blessing.” “Perhaps, if I try to be a better Christian, things might change for good,” they’d say. But that’s not it; the Lord never asked us to try to be good or better; He already made us His righteousness.</p>
<p>It’s not about what you’ve done or didn’t do; it’s about Christ and your understanding, and appropriation of His substitutionary work to, and in your personal life. You can live your whole life preaching the Gospel, without really knowing what it is. For example, as popular as John 3:16 is, a scripture many people quote by heart, they’ve never had a grasp of the power and reality of those words. It says, “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>
<p>Many see this scripture as a promise, but it’s a law; a sovereign declaration of the Almighty God, that anybody who believes in Jesus Christ, is separated, or severed from perishing; from suffering. It doesn’t end at that: such a person has everlasting life. Everlasting means imperishable, indestructible and incorruptible. That’s the life you’ve received.</p>
<p>How can anyone understand, and be aware of this kind of truth and live an ordinary life? You couldn’t know this and be a victim in life; it’s impossible! Meditate on the realities of the Gospel. It’ll make you think, talk and walk differently; your life will be an expression and manifestation of the message and blessings of the Gospel. Glory to God!</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="divine-wisdom-versus-intelligence--pastor-chris-oyakhilome4656">DIVINE WISDOM VERSUS INTELLIGENCE ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~4656<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DIVINE WISDOM VERSUS INTELLIGENCE ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~4656" title="Direct link to DIVINE WISDOM VERSUS INTELLIGENCE ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~4656" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#divine-wisdom-versus-intelligence--pastor-chris-oyakhilome4656">​</a></h2>
<p>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory (1 Corinthians 2:6-7).</p>
<p>There’s a difference between intelligence and wisdom. There’re lots of people who are living by intelligence, and despite their “intelligence,” life defeats them. Intelligence is part of our animal characteristics. Humans are only given the highest intelligence, but when you’re born again, you’re translated from human intelligence to divine wisdom.</p>
<p>Wisdom is what gives you divine interpretations; it gives you insight into reality. For example, in Luke 8:51-56, a child was sick, and the father invited Jesus. But before Jesus arrived, the child died. So, they informed Him that the child had died, but He went anyway. The Bible says, “The house was filled with people weeping and wailing.” Jesus said to them, “Stop the weeping! She isn’t dead; she is only asleep” (Luke 8:52 NLT). That was wisdom talking. But they thought He was insane, because according to their “intelligence” (biological understanding), the little girl was dead; her heart had stopped.</p>
<p>But life is spiritual, and Jesus understood this. He was wisdom personified. Wisdom knew that the child was sleeping. All He said was, “Little girl, get up”; and the Bible says the girl came to life! This is what God is bringing you into: a perfection of His wisdom in you that brings you into alignment with His thoughts and ways of doing things. Then you see as God sees; you understand from His perspective.</p>
<p>The only way you can see how God sees is by using the spectacles of His Word. Suddenly, your thinking process will be elevated; your mindset will be renewed. Even your perception of yourself and your interpretation of life’s circumstances would all change, because of the ministry of divine wisdom in your life.</p>
<p>CONFESSION
Christ is made unto me wisdom! I live victoriously, taking advantage of God’s Word and His grace available to me. I have light, understanding and excellent wisdom. I walk in victory in my job, business, family, finances and everything about my life. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s another way to put it: You&#x27;re here to be light, bringing out the God-colors in the world. God is not a secret to be kept. We&#x27;re going public with this, as public as a city on a hill&quot; (MATTHEW 5:14 MSG)</p>
<p>We read in the Book of Acts that God wrought many unusual miracles through the hands of Paul. Handkerchiefs and aprons were taken from his body, and when these materials were brought in contact with sick people, they were healed and those oppressed of demons were set free.</p>
<p>But something interesting to note is that the handkerchiefs and aprons didn&#x27;t do anything; they had no intelligence or mind of their own. However, they had become impacted with the Spirit to become a conduit for God&#x27;s power. Nonetheless, even though the power of God was in them, they couldn&#x27;t do anything until someone transported them from Paul to where there was a need---to the sick and the oppressed.</p>
<p>This is what happens with you that are born again and filled with the Spirit. Until and unless you take or channel the power in you to where there&#x27;s a need, there&#x27;ll be no manifestation of the power in you. A Christian can be a &quot;lifeless&quot; as the handkerchiefs and aprons from Paul, until he or she comes in contact with the need in men&#x27;s lives. That&#x27;s why you must be about God&#x27;s business of soul-winning.</p>
<p>Out in the world is where the need is; that&#x27;s where you find the rendezvous of broken humanity. You may never impact with the power in you until you leave your comfort zone, and make contact with those in need. You were born as an agent of change; an influence and an answer to the cry of the needy in your world. Therefore, put the glory in you to work; manifest the virtues and perfections of Christ which are in your spirit.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be a great waste to have the Holy Spirit and live an ordinary life. If you were the only one that&#x27;s filled with the Holy Spirit in your own town, city or country, there should still be a remarkable impact with the Gospel. Make the choice to rule your world; impact lives with the Gospel, for that&#x27;s the desire of the Spirit and His will for your life.</p>

<p>&quot;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever&quot; (1 PETER 1:23).</p>
<p>When we talk about excellence, it simply means to excel, to go above and beyond; to be exceptional. But then, it&#x27;s a relative concept, meaning it can be measured at different levels of your life. Excellence, therefore, gives us the idea of growth, because of its relativeness. Thus, God wants you to be awakened to who really are; a perfect and excellent person by nature.</p>
<p>This is why, as you study the Scriptures, you find that He always guides our minds into the idea and reality that He&#x27;s made us perfect beings after Him. That&#x27;s the nature He&#x27;s given us. Once you&#x27;re taught and awakened to this reality, you&#x27;ll walk in the light of it. This is the reason we don&#x27;t strive for excellence; we exude it; it&#x27;s in the fabric of our very existence; the core of our nature. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>When people say they&#x27;re striving for excellence, they&#x27;ll never attain it, because they&#x27;re trying to be who they already are. A dog never strives to be a dog, neither does a cat strives to be a cat. You have an excellent spirit and mind because you were born that way. You&#x27;re the perfect and excellent being of a perfect God. Therefore, let your nature, which is the nature of God, produce works of righteousness, for excellence is walking in righteousness.</p>

<p>Love bears up under anything and everything that comes, is ever ready to believe the best of every person, its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances, and it endures everything [without weakening] (1 CORINTHIANS 13:7 AMPC).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit helps you control your emotions and attitude, and build an excellent character. Through fellowship with the Holy Spirit, you’ll not be given to sudden or choleric temper; rather, you’d be love-controlled.</p>
<p>Never let anger dominate you. Even when you feel you’ve been mistreated, don’t react in a negative way. Rather, say to yourself, “I’ll let it go for the sake of Jesus.” That’s the way His love controls us. Our theme verse says, “Love bears up under anything” This is the triumph of love.</p>
<p>Did you know this wasn’t possible under the Law? They just couldn’t walk in love. But now that we’re born again, it’s our daily walk in Christ. We can walk in love; talk in love, and think lovingly about others. Letting yourself love people is letting God rule and work through you.</p>
<p>Loving others doesn’t make you a weak person; rather, it’s a demonstration of your God-nature. Therefore, wherever you are, create an atmosphere of love, kindness, and grace. Let the liquid love of Jesus flow through you to others. They’ll see it in your eyes; you may not have to say or do anything before it pulls people to you. His love is that strong.</p>
<p>Consciously overlook the wrongs done to you. That someone doesn’t know enough to treat you right shouldn’t stop you from always responding in love. Make up your mind to always respond with love. Love is ever ready to believe the best of others and give selflessly too.</p>

<p>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith (ROMANS 12:6)</p>
<p>Sometimes, some Christians wonder how come they prophesied that something was going to happen and it didn’t happen, and then they concluded that maybe it was a false prophecy after all. Not necessarily. Let’s learn from the Prophet Elijah: there had been no rain for three and a half years, then suddenly he prophesied to King Ahab ;get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain (1 Kings 18:41).</p>
<p>After giving the word of prophecy, the Bible didn’t tell us that immediately, the rains started pouring down. Rather we read in the next verse what Elijah did; he went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees (1 Kings 18:42). He went to pray. Elijah followed up his prophecy with prayer. He didn’t idle away, waiting for the abundance of rain, despite having prophesied by the Spirit that God would send rain. After praying for a while, he said to his servant, Go up now and look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, there is nothing, and he said, Go again seven times (1Kings 18:43-44).</p>
<p>This had to have gone on for several hours if not days. Each time Elijah’s servant went out to check if there was rain and came back, he met Elijah still praying. By the seventh time, the Bible says, it came to pass in the meanwhile, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain (1 Kings 18:45). Elijah didn’t stop at the prophecy, and this is what a lot of Christians haven’t learnt to do. They make the mistake of stopping at the prophecy, and when the rain as it were, don’t come, they wonder why. It’s because you stopped at the prophecy; you didn’t follow up the prophecy with prayer. Get smart and get praying; and you’ll see those prophecies come to pass in your life. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world (1 JOHN 4:4 NKJV)</p>
<p>This natural world is under a curse, and has all the negativities of the evil one infested in it. So, being born again, the world will come at you, mentally, physically, emotionally, and even spiritually. But what did Jesus say? “These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world” (John 16:33).</p>
<p>The Master overcame the world on your behalf, which means you’ve overcome the world. And the Apostle Paul says, “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places…Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked” (Ephesians 6:12-16).</p>
<p>Therefore, irrespective of the evil, darkness, and negativism in this world, you must think differently. Be unperturbed, because you’re in Christ, and in Him you always win. Nothing can be set against you. In your journey of faith, and in fulfilling God’s plan for your life, don’t entertain thoughts of fear, lack or unbelief. Put away anger, bitterness and unforgiveness. These are the things that can hinder your spiritual progress and the call of God on your life.</p>
<p>Keep your heart in God’s Word. 1 Timothy 4:15-16 says to meditate on, and give yourself wholly to the Word, and your victories and success in every endeavour will be inevitable.</p>

<p>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more (Genesis 37:5)</p>
<p>There&#x27;re no laws in heaven or on earth against dreaming big. So, as a Christian, you&#x27;re at liberty to dream, and dream big. Let your dream of success be big enough for God to get involve with it. Let your dreams be such that&#x27;ll require the power of God to accomplish. That&#x27;s why I love the man Joseph in the Bible. As a young lad, his dreams were out of this world! Though his brothers hated him for all his extraordinary dreams of greatness, he kept on dreaming and telling them about his dreams.</p>
<p>A man with a big dream can attract God&#x27;s attention. That&#x27;s why even in prison, Joseph kept rising to the top. He eventually became the prime minister of Egypt and preserved both Egypt and several other nations from famine. It&#x27;s time for you to dream and dream big. It&#x27;s a decision you must make. Dream big for your finances, family, job or business.</p>
<p>Think Big! Believe Big! Live Big!</p>
<p>Shape your future with God&#x27;s word Today!</p>
<p>Make sure your vision for success is big enough to require the supernatural element! Stretch your vision. If you were planning to start out of a small shop, go ahead, but begin to dream of owning a mall. Refuse to put your mind to sleep; keep dreaming! See yourself doing big things. Have a different way of thinking. Your heavenly Father is big, and his resources are limitless. Not only is He able to cause your visions of success to come to pass, He&#x27;s more willing and enthusiastic about your success than you could ever be.</p>
<p>God bless you richly.</p>

<p>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh (GALATIANS 5:16)</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:25 says, “Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.” This scripture isn’t telling you to struggle to put away lying; rather, it’s letting you know that now that you’re in Christ, truth has become natural to you. It’s now natural for you to live the Christ-life; the life of righteousness.</p>
<p>1 John 3:9 says, “Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.” Some theologians have wrestled with this verse, because it’s different from their experiences. But what it says is very clear: anybody who’s born of God doesn’t sin! But many still wonder, “How could this be true when I find myself sinning again and again, despite all my efforts to not sin?” So, they think that Apostle Paul’s writing in Romans 7:15 ”For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I” —seems to be more consistent with their lives. But they forget he was talking about the man under the law, the unregenerate man.</p>
<p>Paul went on to say, “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?” (Romans 7:24); and he gave the answer. He said, “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit” (Romans 8:1). What you need is to walk in the Spirit. Our theme verse says, “Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.”</p>
<p>Become conscious of who you are in Christ—the righteousness of God—and walk accordingly. As you do, you’d discover that living the true Christian life is natural to your spirit, because your spirit, which is the real you, is created by God in righteousness and true holiness. Therefore, you’re not supposed to struggle to do right or live right. That’s why He gave us His righteousness. His righteousness in you gives you the ability to live above sin and without sin-consciousness.</p>

<p>&quot;And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness&quot; (ACTS 4:31).</p>
<p>The only serious evidence that shows anyone has genuinely received the Holy Spirit is soul winning; dynamic evangelism. Everyone who is filled with the Holy Spirit speaks the Word with boldness. The Word enjoins us not only to receive the Holy Spirit, but to be filled with Him continually (Ephesians 5:18 AMPC)</p>
<p>Jesus said, &quot;If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink&quot; (John 7:37). Having drunk of Him, what should follow? He gave the answer in the very next verse: &quot;out of his (your) belly shall flow rivers (gushers) living water&quot; (John 7:38). The evidence that you&#x27;ve drunk of the Spirit is the gushers---the fountain of words of life that flow from you to the world.</p>
<p>Read the Bible! The most consistent thing that happened after men were filled with the Holy Spirit in the Bible days was that they spoke the Word of God with boldness. When the apostles had prayed and got filled with the Holy Spirit, as read in our theme verse, the result was that they spoke the Word with boldness. Their lives manifested that glory to win souls.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit came into your life to make you a witness. Jesus said, &quot;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me&quot; (Acts 1:8). If you&#x27;re timid about preaching the Gospel, it means you haven&#x27;t recognized the Holy Spirit in your life, because the Holy Spirit grants you boldness to stand up for Christ.</p>
<p>You can&#x27;t have the Holy Spirit and not know how to win souls. All it takes is for you to take the step: decide to speak to someone about Jesus, and as you open your mouth, the Holy Spirit will put words in your mouth that they can&#x27;t resist or gainsay. The boldness of the Holy Spirit will be stirred within you. There&#x27;s a depth in God you&#x27;ll never know until you begin to win souls; therefore, be excited to do it. As you do, you&#x27;d enjoy the glory and blessedness of Christianity, beyond what you ever thought possible. Praise God!</p>

<p>For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed (ISAIAH 50:7).</p>
<p>God wants us to set our hearts on His Word and not be distracted by circumstances, experiences, or adversity. It brings to mind the words of the Psalmist in Psalm 119:69 (MSG): “The godless spread lies about me, but I focus my attention on what you are saying.” Also, Romans 4:19 (MSG) says, “Abraham didn’t focus on his own impotence and say, ‘It’s hopeless. This hundred-year-old body could never father a child.’ Nor did he survey Sarah’s decades of infertility and give up.”</p>
<p>In the New Testament, the Bible talks about Jesus in Luke 9:51: “And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.” Why was His face set steadfastly on His destination? He knew that was His last visit to Jerusalem, and this time, it was for His life; He was going to the Cross to die for the sins of the world, and He wasn’t going to let anyone distract Him from it.</p>
<p>In our world today, there’re so many distractions, but you must remain focused on the dream, the vision, that the Lord has put in your heart. Have a tunnel-vision towards God’s agenda. It’s the way to win. Many years ago, the Lord said to me, “Son, don’t look around. Be focused; refuse to be distracted.”</p>
<p>Some Christians have found themselves being distracted by too many things. They’re distracted by the state of the economy and several other happenings around them. They can’t accomplish much in life that way. When you’re a man or woman of purpose and vision, you’re not perturbed about the economics or economies of this world, because you know that you’re not of this world.</p>
<p>Nothing in, and of this world can place a limit on you or cause you to be disadvantaged, because you won before you came. You were already a success before you started. Therefore, set your sail and rule your world.</p>

<p>&quot;Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?&quot; (1 CORINTHIANS 3:16)</p>
<p>The scripture above is so profound. It shows that the throne of God is in your heart, since He lives in you in His fullness. The same thought is expressed in 2 Corinthians 6:15-17. It says, &quot;for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.&quot; What a blessing this is!</p>
<p>The word translated &quot;temple&quot; is the Greek word, &quot;naos.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t refer to the ordinary everyday temple, but to an inner shrine; the shrine that houses the image of &quot;god&quot;; the inner sanctuary where the image of the god is kept. For the Jews, it was the Holy of Holies; that&#x27;s where the presence of God was. They didn&#x27;t have an image inside, but the presence of God was there.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit took up His abode in the quarters of your heart, you became that &quot;shrine&quot;; the place of His presence. Think about that! It means you carry heaven in you. When Jesus came to this world, He came with heaven to bless the world with. He brought it in His heart, because the Holy Spirit lived inside Him. He came with the throne of God in His heart. No wonder He was such a blessing to the world!</p>
<p>The same applies to you. You&#x27;re much more than a religious person; by reason of the New Birth, you&#x27;ve been translated into the Kingdom of God, and now carry His throne in your heart. You&#x27;re heaven&#x27;s ambassador to this world. In reality, everywhere you go, God goes, because you&#x27;re His house. He talks in you, and He looks through your eyes. Therefore, preach the Gospel; cast out devils; heal the sick; cleanse the lepers; raise the dead. Bless the world with the grace and glory of heaven that&#x27;s in you. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals (1 CORINTHIANS 6:9 NASB).</p>
<p>When you study the synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke, you’d observe that Jesus extensively taught on the principles of our heavenly Kingdom. For example, in Matthew 19:5 and Mark 10:7-8, He acknowledged the union of one man and one woman as the standard expression of human sexuality in a marriage relationship.</p>
<p>The apostles built on the same foundation. In Romans 1:27 (NKJV), the Apostle Paul reiterated the Master’s words, denouncing those who engage in same-sex practice. It says, “Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.”</p>
<p>Jesus said in John 15:19, “ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.” Refuse to be influenced by the system of this world, which is run by Satan. Don’t let your actions, reactions, thoughts, words, and responses be like those of the people of the world. Uphold our Kingdom ideals.</p>
<p>In our Kingdom, God’s Word is the final arbiter; we’re cultured and governed by the Word. Therefore, refuse to compromise the standards, values and principles of our heavenly Kingdom. Walk in the light of God’s Word and His righteousness.</p>

<p>&quot;Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory&quot; (1 CORINTHIANS 2:6-7)</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a difference between intelligence and wisdom. There&#x27;re lots of people who are living by intelligence, and despite their &quot;intelligence,&quot; life defeats them. Intelligence is part of our animal characteristics. Humans are only given the highest intelligence, but when you&#x27;re born again, you&#x27;re translated from human intelligence to divine wisdom.</p>
<p>Wisdom is what gives you divine interpretation; it gives insight into reality. For example, in Luke 8:51-56, a child was sick, and the father invited Jesus. But before Jesus arrived, the child died. So, they informed Him that the child had died, but He went anyway. The Bible says, &quot;The house was filled with people weeping and wailing.&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;Stop the weeping! She isn&#x27;t dead; she is only asleep&quot; (Luke 8:52 NLT). That was wisdom talking. But they thought He was insane, because according to their &quot;intelligence&quot; (biological understanding), the little girl was dead; her heart had stopped.</p>
<p>But life is spiritual, and Jesus understood this. He was wisdom personified. Wisdom knew that the child was sleeping. All He said was, &quot;Little girl! Get up!&quot;; and the Bible says the girl came to life! This is what God is building you into; a perfection of His wisdom in you that brings you into alignment with His thoughts and ways of doing things. Then you see as God sees; you understand from His perspective.</p>
<p>The only way you can see how God sees is by using the spectacles of His Word. Suddenly, your thinking process will be elevated; your mindset will be renewed. Even the perception of yourself and your interpretation of life&#x27;s circumstances would all change, because of the ministry of divine wisdom in your life.</p>

<li>THE SPIRITUALITY OF LIFE AND MINISTRY
1 Thessalonians 5:23</li>
</ol>
<p>THE SPIRITUALITY OF LIFE.
Romans 2:29
The outward man - the body and its senses
The inward man - the spirit and its soul</p>
<p>When you&#x27;re born again your human spirit is born into an environment. 1 Corinthians 12:13. Colossians 2:6. When you&#x27;re born again, the spirit world is your new environment.</p>
<p>The Difference between TRUTH &amp; FACTS
Truth is spiritual. Facts are worldly
Fact is a piece of information about circumstances that exists or events that are or have occurred.
Truth is conformity to reality. How truthful a statement is is how close it is to reality. That is the measure of truthfulness. Question then is, WHAT IS REALITY?
John 14:6 John 17:17
God&#x27;s word is truth. Anything can be true. Its truthfulness is as far as it can conform to the word or God.
Truth supercedes facts. Truth is spiritual, fact is carnal, earthly and worldly. The word of God is the true light.
You wanna know the quality of your life? Use the word of God.
Hebrews 4:12-13 (ESV) John 1:1</p>
<p>You cannot walk with God working by facts. You gotta walk with God working with truth. As a minister of the gospel, what you&#x27;re bearing is spiritual, what you&#x27;re carrying is spiritual.</p>
<p>Romans 8:9
In the spirit realm it is truth that matters. Facts don&#x27;t mean anything in the spirit realm. Ordinary men walk by facts.
Don&#x27;t live by facts. Live by truth. Truth is conformity to reality and reality is the word of God. And truth is measured by how far whatever is being measured come close to reality.</p>
<p>John 15:26 - the holy spirit is called the spirit of truth.</p>

<p>Q&amp;A:

The spoken word - was delivered to the prophets
The written word -
The living word - is Jesus</p>
<p>THE SPIRITUALITY OF MINISTRY.
The ministry which we are a part of is a spiritual ministry and our sacrifices are spiritual.
1 Peter 2:5 - we are called to offer sacrifice.
The spiritual realm is the real realm of life. In fact it is more tangible than the physical. The spiritual preexisted the physical.</p>
<p>God&#x27;s and heaven&#x27;s interpretation of our sacrifices is spiritual.</p>
<p>2 Timothy 3:16.
Righteousness has to be understood in a bigger picture. It&#x27;s not just a behaviour, it&#x27;s a life.</p>

Revelation 5:8.

When you pray, especially a prayer of worship, they come to God as incense.
Revelation 8:3
We must see life and understand our environment, and everything spiritually, and we can only do so by the insights given to us by the holy spirit through the word.
John 8:37. John 8:51-59</p>
<p>Luke 22:52-53
&quot;this is your hour and the power of darkness&quot;. As a minister of the gospel, you&#x27;ve got to know truth, you&#x27;ve got to walk and live in truth.</p>
<p>2 John 1:1-4
No matter what happens in life, you&#x27;ve got to know God&#x27;s truth. When you know truth, you&#x27;ve got to superimpose truth over whatever fact there is. When you walk in truth you follow instructions and principles, when you join those two together you get one thing called faith. When we walk in truth we follow instructions and principles.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 10:1-5
It&#x27;s not about whether that thing worked. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it was right in the eyes of men. But Is the Lord pleased?</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 10:11 Romans 15:4
Practice thinking spiritually
Practice spiritual understanding
Practise walking in the spirit</p>

We must see life and understand our environment, and everything spiritually, and we can only do so by the insights given to us by the holy spirit through the word.
John 8:37. John 8:51-59</p>
<p>Luke 22:52-53
&quot;this is your hour and the power of darkness&quot;. As a minister of the gospel, you&#x27;ve got to know truth, you&#x27;ve got to walk and live in truth.</p>
<p>2 John 1:1-4
No matter what happens in life, you&#x27;ve got to know God&#x27;s truth. When you know truth, you&#x27;ve got to superimpose truth over whatever fact there is. When you walk in truth you follow instructions and principles, when you join those two together you get one thing called faith. When we walk in truth we follow instructions and principles.</p>
<p>1Corinthians 10:1-5
It&#x27;s not about whether that thing worked. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it was right in the eyes of men. But Is the Lord pleased?</p>
<p>1Corinthians 10:11 Romans 15:4
Practice thinking spiritually
Practice spiritual understanding
Practise walking in the spirit</p>

<p>Don’t be quick-tempered, for anger is the friend of fools (ECCLESIASTES 7:9 NLT)</p>
<p>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai and saw the people worshipping a golden calf, which they had constructed by themselves, he was enraged. Right there, he smashed to pieces the tablets of the law engraved by the finger of God (Exodus 32:19). Moses had to engrave another one all by himself, as a punishment.</p>
<p>On another occasion, as the children of Israel sojourned in the wilderness, they suddenly ganged up against Moses and Aaron because there was no water for them to drink. The Lord then instructed Moses to assemble the congregation, and tell the rock before their eyes to bring forth water for them to drink.</p>
<p>Moses, obviously angry at the people’s outburst, charged and rebuked them, tagging them rebels! In a fit of rage, he turned and struck the rock instead of speaking to it as the Lord had instructed; in fact, he struck it twice (Numbers 20:11). Water came out for the people to drink, but Moses’ action displeased the Lord.</p>
<p>In as much as Moses was referred to as “very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth” (Numbers 12:3), he allowed anger affect his ministry and walk with God, such that he wasn’t allowed to lead the children of Israel into the Promised Land as the Lord had intended. He certainly was faithful in the administration of all God’s house (Hebrews 3:5), but anger was his undoing.</p>
<p>Anger is a quick destroyer. Don’t even try to “tame” it; eschew it. If you’ve been termed or described as someone who’s quick to get angry, get before the Lord in prayer, and give yourself to the Word in meditation.</p>
<p>There’re people who won’t fulfil their calling, as it has happened in history, because of anger. And in such cases, what God does is to have another plan. Don’t let it happen to you. Why should anyone miss out with God, and fail in their divine destiny, because of a negative attitude that could easily be controlled and overturned with God’s Word? Psalm 37:8 (NIV) says, “Refrain from anger and turn from wrath” Act on God’s Word. Refuse to let anger rule you.</p>

<p>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me. (ACTS 1:8)</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of language, many have found it difficult to understand who the &quot;Spirit of God&quot; is. The phrase &quot;the Spirit of God&quot; has a totally different connotation from the phrase a &quot;man of God!&quot; The latter means a man who works, talks and does things for God; a man sent by God. When we say the &quot;Spirit of God&quot;, we don&#x27;t mean a Spirit that is from God, sent by God and does things for God; no, that&#x27;s not the description. The Holy Spirit is God. The Father never leaves His throne; He&#x27;s always on His throne. When the Father does anything outside His throne, He does it through His Spirit who proceeds from Him. So, the Holy Spirit isn&#x27;t another Spirit that God delegates to do something; the Holy Spirit is God Himself.</p>
<p>When we talk about your spirit, for example, your spirit isn&#x27;t another spirit that serves you. Your spirit is you, the real you! Now imagine this: Acts 1:8 says, &quot;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.&quot; So, we received that Holy Spirit who Himself is God, to live in us. If we take that lightly, our lives will be ordinary. However, when you understand the power and import of having the Spirit of God live in you, you&#x27;ll live supernaturally every day.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Godhead, not because He&#x27;s number three, but because He&#x27;s the third to be revealed to the Church. But the manifestation of the Holy Spirit came first; He&#x27;s the first to actually be revealed in the Word of God, but He wasn&#x27;t understood.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 reveals the Spirit to us when the earth was a chaotic mass: &quot;And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters&quot; (Genesis 1:2). So, the Holy Spirit is first revealed to us. In verse 1, the Hebrew word for God is &quot;Elohim&quot; - a plural word for God. So, you see, the Holy Spirit made the world, and created all things.</p>

<p>And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness (Romans 8:10).</p>
<p>Being born again, you have nothing to fear, because the Holy Spirit lives in you. There’s a divine impact of His divine presence and power on your physical body that keeps it immune to sickness, diseases, and infirmities. Even at the worst case scenario: if your physical body has already been so ravaged, battered and bruised by sickness and disease, the Holy Spirit will revitalise and restore life back to it. That’s what we read in our opening verse. A better rendering is, “But if Christ lives in you, though your body be dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.”</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit raised the dead body of Jesus back to life; that same Spirit lives in you today. Romans 8:11 says, “And if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead, lives in you, that same Spirit shall give life to your mortal body.” This isn’t something futuristic; it’s something that happened at the instant the Holy Spirit took up His abode in you; He gave life to your hitherto mortal body. Your physical body is actually not mortal—death-doomed—anymore.</p>
<p>Therefore, if today you’re suffering terribly with sickness and disease, act on the Word. The power to make you whole isn’t coming from heaven; it’s in you. Declare, “The Holy Spirit lives in me and has given life to my physical body. My whole being is vitalised and energised by the divine power of the One who perambulates in me!” It makes no difference what the case is; if the health condition is so bad that you can’t declare it out loud, whisper it! If it’s so serious that you can’t even whisper, think it in your mind! When you whisper or contemplate it long enough, the Holy Spirit will overshadow you as He did the dead body of Jesus, and revitalise your entire being.</p>
<p>Understand something: the Holy Spirit is God, and He actually lives in you. That means the Healer, not just the healing power, lives in you! That settles the issue of sickness and disease forever. Therefore, if death has attacked your body through sickness, disease or infirmity, you have nothing to fear or worry about; trust the Healer in you to take care of it. He’ll restore you back to life! Glory to God!</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, thank you for the divine impact of your Spirit—the Healer—on my physical body. I refuse to fear, for His presence in me paralyses, destroys, eliminates and dispels every form of sickness, disease or infirmity. Therefore, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, I’m whole, sound, and excellent, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-you-a-minus-or-a-plus--pastor-chris-oyakhilome4900">ARE YOU A MINUS OR A PLUS? ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~4900<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ARE YOU A MINUS OR A PLUS? ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~4900" title="Direct link to ARE YOU A MINUS OR A PLUS? ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~4900" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#are-you-a-minus-or-a-plus--pastor-chris-oyakhilome4900">​</a></h2>
<p>&quot;The liberal person shall be enriched, and he who waters shall himself be watered&quot; (Proverbs 11:25 AMP).</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people; minus-people and plus-people. A minus person is the kind of person you leave in an office only to come back and find the chair or some other thing broken. When you take him to your house, he just turns everything upside down; he breaks furniture and your household appliances start having faults. But a plus person treats everything good and you would almost not want him to go. The house is always clean when he’s around and he never uses bad language. Such a person is a plus to your home.</p>
<p>A minus person has a critical spirit; for example, he would always criticize the choir ministrations in church, but a plus person wouldn’t think like that. Rather he decides to join the choir and add fresh ideas to what they are doing; he’s a plus, you see! Always, he’s thinking about increase. He’s the kind of fellow who’s always looking out for someone to help, he’s always doing something new and different for people, and the Kingdom of God is always uppermost on his mind. That’s unlike the minus person who’s ever in a hurry and wouldn’t see the need around him.</p>
<p>The man that’s a plus is the man with an excellent spirit. The Bible described Daniel as a man with an excellent spirit, and because of this, he  “was preferred above the presidents and princes …the king thought to set him over the whole realm” (Daniel 6:3). He became a leader of leaders. When you study his life, you’ll observe that many others plotted against him but they failed. A man that’s a plus will always excel above his colleagues, and he would certainly have critics. All those other leaders plotted against Daniel because they were all minuses. Instead of channelling their talents and strengths into doing great things for their kingdom, they busied themselves with plotting to destroy a man that meant them no harm. That’s how minus people are; they are spiritually myopic!</p>
<p>If you’re a Christian then you’re a plus in your home and in your office; you’re a plus wherever you go. Why? It is because God has increased you and you’re not working with your ability, you’re working with His ability. The Bible says, “For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God” (Romans 8:19), therefore, men will see you excel and give glory to God.</p>

<p>&quot;When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up.&quot; (JOB 22:29).</p>
<p>Several years ago in austere times, I exhorted some of my friends not to be perturbed by inflation. &quot;When prices go up, don&#x27;t cry; don&#x27;t feel bad&quot; I&#x27;d say, &quot;It&#x27;s for your good!&quot; Of course some of them didn&#x27;t understand what I was talking about. They wondered how inflation or economic recession could be to their advantage.</p>
<p>But here&#x27;s an important ministry you need to learn that&#x27;ll help you grow bigger financially: Let your mind soar beyond the prevailing economic situation around you. Think how big God is. Think about the whole world as yours, for it&#x27;s indeed yours: &quot;For all things are yours.&quot; (1 Corinthians 3:21).</p>
<p>Learn the value of meditation on the Word of God. The Word has the ability to create or produce in you what it says, and to create and produce opportunities and guidance for you. The Word enlarges your vision.</p>
<p>Refuse to see lack and want. Look beyond the horizon and let the Word propel you to prosperity. There&#x27;s so much treasure around you; and like Isaac, amidst the seeming hardship, you can prosper, wax great, make progress and grow, until you become very great.</p>
<p>If you build your faith strong in God&#x27;s Word, you&#x27;ll neither cry nor be cast down in austere times. Isaac prospered in the midst of harsh economic conditions. In a time of famine, the Bible says he prospered, waxed great, made progress, and grew until he became very great (Genesis 26). Your prosperity should be born of the Word in spite of circumstances.</p>

<p>&quot;But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble&quot; (JAMES 4:6)</p>
<p>When Jesus walked the earth, He demonstrated humility. When it was time for Him to be baptized, He didn&#x27;t feel superior to John the Baptist, even though He was the Son of God. Rather, He allowed the Scriptures to be fulfilled (Read Matthew 3:13-15 NKJV). That&#x27;s because truly great people are humble and motivated by one thing only; fulfilling God&#x27;s Word; doing things God&#x27;s way. They&#x27;re also inspired to serve.</p>
<p>Jesus said to His disciples, &quot;Whoever must be great amongst you, must have the heart of a servant&quot; (Matthew 20:26). Not only did He say this to them, He acted it by washing the feet of His disciples. Then He explained His action, saying, &quot;You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash another&#x27;s feet. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them&quot; (John 13:13-17 NKJV).</p>
<p>In Philippians 2, we read again about His unparalleled humility. Though He was Himself God, He humbled Himself and died a criminal&#x27;s death in our behalf. But see the result of His humility: &quot;Therefore God has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father&quot; (Philippians 2:9-11 NKJV). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Philippians 2:5 says, &quot;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus&quot;; meaning, emulate His humility. It&#x27;s the pathway to greatness; there&#x27;re no shortcuts. Pride goes before a fall, but humility promotes.</p>

<p>And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian (Genesis 39:2)</p>
<p>As a Christian, no matter what happens around you, refuse to fret, fear or be discouraged, because you’re the seed of Abraham. Always choose to see things from that perspective. You might say, “But I’m going through difficult times right now; I even just lost my job.” Still, refuse to be discouraged or dismayed. In fact, if you’d only see from the perspective of who you really are in Christ, you’d realise that you didn’t lose your job; the organisation probably lost you!</p>
<p>You’re a treasure, a gem, a star, and a champion! Your presence anywhere means blessings, because you’re the blessed of the Lord! You own the world. Your potentials, abilities, and wisdom are limitless! Your presence in an organisation means blessings for the organisation and everyone in that organisation.</p>
<p>Now, this isn’t for the guy who’s ineffective at work and gets laid-off; no; I’m talking about Abraham’s seed! Abraham’s seed is effective; he’s fruitful and productive in every good work. Whatever he does prospers; that’s his heritage. This is how you must think. Consider Joseph, even though he had been sold into slavery, falsely accused and imprisoned, he was still a blessing, so much so that he was placed in charge of all the other prisoners. Prior to that, as a slave in Potiphar’s house, Potiphar recognised that God blessed him because of Joseph, and made Joseph the overseer of his entire estate.</p>
<p>You’re blessed and you carry the blessing. Where you go, God goes; what and whom you bless, is blessed. Because of you, your school, neighbourhood, city or country is blessed. Recall God’s Word to Abraham, “and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed” (Genesis 26:4). That’s exactly what we do; we convey and distribute blessings. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I thank you for blessing me and making me a blessing. You’ve made me prosperous and effective; a blessing to this world, and a dispenser and distributor of your righteousness, love, kindness and goodness, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, &quot;Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you&quot; (HEBREWS 13:5)</p>
<p>God wants our lives to be void of covetousness; don&#x27;t lust after what belongs to others. Be content with what you have. That doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t dream or desire to attain greater levels of success; rather, it emphasizes being filled and understanding that what you have is enough to get whatever else you want. But the truth is that there isn&#x27;t really anything that you don&#x27;t have.</p>
<p>The Bible says all things are yours (1 Corinthians 3:21); better than that, Christ is in you, and Christ is everything. So, in Him you have all things. When the crippled beggar at the gate of the temple called &#x27;Beautiful&#x27; asked Peter and John for alms, Peter didn&#x27;t say, &quot;I don&#x27;t have what you&#x27;re asking for,&quot; and walked away; he knew he had something, and what He had was enough to produce whatever else may be required. He used what he had: the Name of Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit, to effect a cure and restore life to the man&#x27;s hitherto dead and crippled limbs.</p>
<p>Always be conscious of what you have: the power and glory in your spirit. Your house is the habitation of the Lord; do you know what that means? The ability of God is operational in you. How could anyone know this and ever be in lack or need or be envious of others? That&#x27;s why this knowledge is coming to you right now, so you&#x27;d be content and confident in who you are, and all that Christ is to you and in you, and has wrought in your spirit.</p>
<p>Never think, &quot;If I only had this or that&quot;; you have what&#x27;s most important: Christ; and it&#x27;s all that you need. Christ in you is the hope, the guarantee that everything else you could ever require is already in you. Glory to God!</p>

<p>&quot;Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you&quot; (LUKE 10:19)</p>
<p>One of the fundamental truths of the New Testament is that as one who&#x27;s born again, you&#x27;ve already conquered Satan and the demons of darkness. In Colossians 2:15, the Apostle Paul, by the Holy Spirit, gave a graphic description of what transpired in hell, after the death and burial of Jesus. That verse says, &quot;And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.&quot; The Greek version reads: &quot;putting off from Himself principalities and powers&quot;, suggesting that there was a combat in hell. The demons of hell were all over Jesus, grappling with Him, but He put them off from Himself and despoiled them, right there in hell. Jesus defeated Satan and the cohorts of darkness.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s important to note that the Holy Spirit didn&#x27;t go with Jesus to hell. He went to hell as a man, and defeated Satan, as a man. Being the representative of fallen man, all our sins were laid on Him while He hung on the cross. Therefore, the Holy Spirit had to leave Him. The Father also turned His back on Jesus because God is holy and does not behold iniquity (Habakkuk 1:13). This was the reason, as Jesus hung on the cross, He cried with a loud voice, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot; (Mark 15:34). He was forsaken on the cross and went to hell, but won the victory for us; He destroyed principalities and powers and took all the armour in which Satan trusted (Luke 11:22).</p>
<p>When Jesus defeated Satan in hell, you were in Him; in Christ, you defeated Satan and his cohorts. Now, you&#x27;re seated with Christ in the heavenly realms, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come (Ephesians 1:21). If Satan showed up in your room, you don&#x27;t have to be afraid of him; he&#x27;s not a factor. He and his agents of darkness are under your feet; you&#x27;re superior to them.</p>

<p>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work (2 CORINTHIANS 9:8)</p>
<p>This is the Lord’s desire for you. Whatever the need, irrespective of the circumstances, He wants you to be self-sufficient, so much so that you require no aid or support. But you see, He wants you to get big enough for others. The reason for being self-sufficient in all things is for you to abound in good works. That immediately brings something to mind: you really don’t live for yourself, but for other people.</p>

<p>&quot;For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith&quot; (1 John 5:4).</p>
<p>There&#x27;s so much negative information in the world today and this has instilled fear in the hearts of those who aren&#x27;t rooted and grounded in the Word. These may indeed be perilous times, but the Lord Jesus referred to this in Luke 21:25-26 in describing some of the signs of the end of the age. He said, &quot;There shall be...distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men&#x27;s hearts failing them for fear, and after looking for those things which are coming on the earth&quot;</p>
<p>In Luke 18:8, He asked a thought-provoking question: &quot;when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?&quot; You&#x27;re to stand your ground in faith, irrespective of the circumstances around you, and happenings in the world today.</p>
<p>The Word says in Ephesians 6:16, &quot;Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.&quot; With your shield of faith, you have the ability to neutralize ALL (not some) of the fiery darts of the enemy. The Lord Jesus already destroyed the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). He paralyzed Satan, demolished his works, and made an open spectacle of him and his demons in hell (Colossians 2:15).</p>
<p>Today, Satan and the powers of darkness are under your feet; therefore, you have nothing to fear. Irrespective of what happens around you, speak the Word in faith.</p>

<p>In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise (Ephesians 1:13).</p>
<p>Years ago, there were those who preached and taught that having been born again, you needed to be “sealed with the Holy Ghost.” Then they’d call people out in church, lay hands on them and say, “Be sealed in the Name of Jesus.” In their minds, they were “sealing” those Christians. One can’t but wonder where they got that from, because the Christian was already “sealed with the Holy Ghost” at the New Birth.</p>
<p>The underlined portion of our opening verse says, “ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.” When you received the Holy Ghost, you were sealed; it was done by the Holy Ghost; it’s not a special, or typical experience. What does it mean to be sealed, especially in the context of Scripture?</p>
<p>When a document is sealed, it means a mark or something is attached to it as a guarantee of authenticity and ownership. When you see the seal of the President on a document, for example, that means the document came from the President, and has the president’s authority. A seal also means that a particular transaction has been completed or consummated.</p>
<p>There’re three things that the sealing of the Holy Ghost is for: ownership, security, and authenticity. Now that you’re born again, and have been sealed with the Holy Ghost, Satan can’t touch you, because the mark of God is on you. The hand of God is resting upon you. Psalm 91:7 says, “A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.” And the tenth verse says, “There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.” Why? It’s because God’s seal is on you! That seal, that mark, separates you from danger.</p>
<p>As a child of God, you’re protected and preserved by the power of the Holy Spirit. His glory covers you. When you understand this, the devil will have no place in your life. Fear will have no place in you. If you’re attacked by sickness, disease or infirmity, you’ll command it to leave your body. You’ll live every day with the confident assurance that no plan of the adversary can work against you, because the seal of God is on you. Praise God!</p>

<p>&quot;none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.&quot; (ACTS 20:24)</p>
<p>Like the Apostle Paul, it makes no difference the adversities we face; we stand strong and tough in the Holy Ghost! We affirm, “None of these things move me.” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Occasionally, your commitment to Christ and convictions about the Gospel will be tested; as someone who lives by God’s Word, you’ll surely be persecuted. But be of good cheer, because greater is He that’s in you than all your adversaries and persecutors put together. They may come out against you one way, but they’ll flee before you seven ways.</p>

<p>Q and A With Pastor Chris</p>
<p>Question about Jesus being the messiah and the Antichrist...</p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 2:3</p>
<p>The Antichrist will be revealed... Revelations chapter13... he will come up amongst men and will be given power by the devil.</p>
<p>Question about out of body experiences... astral travel... can a Christian be involved.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 4:18-19</p>
<p>Don’t worship any of the heavenly things... Leviticus 19:31.... those things are things God doesn’t want us to be involved in... 1 Corinthians 6:17... he that’s joined to the Lord is one spirit and our bodies are temples of the Holy Ghost. We shouldn’t be involved with anything that doesn’t exalt Him. Astral travel is not part of our union in Christ. Recognize the kingdom way of living and relating with the Father. No man comes to the Father but by me. Jesus is the only way to God. Everything we do is in His name and by His spirit.</p>
<p>Acts is the compendium of the lives of the saints. See the way they lived. They heard and shared the word. They lived the word. The Holy Spirit by which the ministered and prayed. Astral projections are men taking themselves by their own medium. Everything we do must be done through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We don’t do anything by the spirit by our own power. Only things done through the Holy Spirit. Gods people are moved by the Holy Spirit. There are similar experiences similar like astral travel by the Holy Spirit. Caught up to a certain realms by the spirit.</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:14</p>
<p>Offered Himself through the Holy Spirit on basis of Gods word.</p>
<p>Question about being forced to take the vaccine...</p>
<p>No you can’t. You’re not forced. If you are not forced, why will you do that and claim spiritual protection. You can’t take poison and claim the scriptures. Don’t miss the Your Loveworld Specials starting from tomorrow....</p>
<p>2011 in Malawi people were forced to take vaccines.... several people were forced to take the vaccines at gun point.... the bills that have been passed into law... forced vaccinaction were passed. Health people allowed, permitted to go forcibly to take people and vac*inate them... orchestrated by these same arrogant people that trust so much in their money. Mark 6:18 won’t save you. It is better you quit. You’re a blessing to any organization. Get out if you need to. Let no man disperse you for working there. That job is not your survival ticket. You’re a child of God. Have no fear...</p>
<p>Question about the book of Romans 8:29.... Does it mean that God wants us to be the word in flesh...</p>
<p>Absolutely...</p>
<p>Question about persecution...</p>
<p>I expected it. You should expect it. We must suffer persecution. It’s not unusual at all. Jesus and the Apostles faced it. You will face it. You’ll be hated for it because you are not of the world. Don’t be surprised about that...</p>

<p>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh (GALATIANS 5:16)</p>
<p>Some people unwittingly allow every form of strife to take root in their hearts: bitterness, malice, anger, envy, hatred, and all forms of wickedness. But the Apostle Paul, in Ephesians 4:31-32, admonishes that we put away these things and walk in love: “Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.”</p>
<p>But the question is, “How do you consistently walk in love in a world where there’s so much hate?” Our opening text gives us the answer: “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh” (Galatians 5:16). When you walk in the Spirit, you see and walk differently; your perspective is different, and walking in love is natural to you. Being born again, you have the capacity to love even the most difficult or seemingly unlovable people.</p>

<p>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (JOHN 3:16)</p>
<p>Romans 6:23 says, “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Eternal life is God’s gift to the world, not to Christians. You become a Christian only after you’ve received eternal life, which is the life and nature of God. What Jesus came to do, the salvation He brought, was for the whole world. So, in the mind of justice, the whole world has been saved, because Jesus paid the price for every man’s sin. This is legal salvation. Vital salvation is only received by personal faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Unless one acknowledges and accepts His vicarious sacrifice, he won’t experience the vital reality of the finished works of salvation in his personal life. That’s where we come in; those of us who have become Christians have a responsibility to tell the world what Jesus did. Many don’t believe because they haven’t heard. Romans 10:14 sums it rightly: “How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?”</p>

<p>”Words make or mar. Our lives are influenced by words; the atmosphere in your home depends on the words that are spoken in it. Your relationships are built on words. Our lives are so dependent on words that, not only do they affect our attitudes, they also affect our health and living conditions. Whether or not you’re living in faith or in fear is a function of what you hear, for faith comes by hearing (God’s Word: positive information); while fears comes through negative information.”</p>

<p>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures (JAMES 1:18)</p>
<p>The New Living Translation of the scripture above says “He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word. And we, out of all creation, became his prized possession.” Of all the things in creation, we’re the first and the best; we’re the Father’s crown and beauty. This doesn’t describe everybody in the world, but we who are born again; those to whom He gave birth through His Word are His trophies; His excellent workmanship.</p>

<p>But you shall recieve power (ability, efficiency, and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you (Acts 1:8 AMP)</p>
<p>Often, people ask how they can become more effective in their work or in life generally; they want to know how to develop an effective personality. Well, irrespective of the job you do, God wants you to be an effective person, not just at your job, or in restricted areas of your life but all-round. If you&#x27;re an effective person, you&#x27;ll be effective in anything. That&#x27;s why you have to develop an effective personality.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit living in you already gives you the advantage, for we read in our opening verse that &quot;you shall recieve power(ability, efficiency(or effectiveness), and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you&quot; It is one thing to have or recieve something, but another thing to recognize, cultivate it and put it to work. So how then do you develop yourself into an effective personality, having received the Holy Spirit? Firstly, be focused. Maintain a clear focus on the goal, target or task at hand. If it&#x27;s your job, an assignment or a special project, whatever it is, have a clear focus.</p>
<p>Secondly, have a good understanding of the subject matter; understand the job definition and requirements for the project or task and everything that has to do with your expectations. In other words, know what needs to be done, and the results expected. Then thirdly, have a clear determination for real success-lasting success. You&#x27;ve got to be determined, motivated, challenged and driven by the joy of success.</p>
<p>Then, fourthly, corresponding action; you&#x27;ve got to act. You can&#x27;t lazy away and expect things to work; you must take the necessary action. Those who win in life in any field are those who take action, so take the necessary action. Then finally, be consistent and dilligent! Stick with the task at hand. Stay on the job till it&#x27;s done; don&#x27;t make or accept excuses for failure. Refuse mundanity and choose to be absolutely proficient. And then of course, recognize and take advantage of the wisdom of God that&#x27;s available to you in Christ Jesus. If you&#x27;d put all these to work, you&#x27;ll be effective and successful in what you do.</p>

<p>&quot;But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption&quot; (1 CORINTHIANS 1:30)</p>
<p>The word &quot;redemption&quot; in our opening verse means &quot;riddance.&quot; Riddance is translated from the Greek word &quot;apolutrosis,&quot; which refers to being brought out of trouble. Therefore, Christ being our redemption, actually means He&#x27;s our deliverance; just like He said in Psalms 50:15, &quot;call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.&quot;</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter the trouble you&#x27;ve gotten into, Christ is your riddance; He&#x27;ll rid you of your troubles. Proverbs 11:8 says, &quot;The righteous is delivered out of trouble&quot; Christ is your ransom. O, how wonderful this is! Read this comforting and assuring words from the Lord Himself in Isaiah 43:2-5: &quot;When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour:...Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. Fear not: for I am with thee&quot;</p>
<p>The Lord is obligated to save you. He&#x27;ll help you out of any quagmire, not because you prayed hard enough or were good enough, but because you have a ransom in Christ Jesus. He makes up for your errors. Every mistake, every sin, has been laid to His charge.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people look back at their lives and say, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s because I made a blunder that this calamity happened to me&quot;; no! You don&#x27;t have to wallow in regret any more about your sin, mistakes and errors; understand that Christ has been made your riddance. You don&#x27;t have to carry the weight of self-condemnation and guilt. You&#x27;ve paid in Christ for all your sins, mistakes, and errors.</p>
<p>Jesus didn&#x27;t just take care of your sins at Calvary, He also took care of every single mistake you&#x27;d make, including the ones on the job. So when you make a mistake, or get into trouble, be bold to call on Him; He&#x27;s not intimidated by your troubles. No wonder the Psalmist said, &quot;But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble&quot; (Psalm 59:16).</p>

<p>ICLC - Last Session~5184</p>
<p>Everything Jesus said was important but His last words are even more important. His last word has a way of connecting the dots of His life time...</p>
<p>Matthew 28:16-19</p>
<p>All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. He will never take away your doubt, you’re the one to stop your doubt. Romans 10:10. He didn’t take away the doubts of His disciples.</p>
<p>All power and authority in heaven and in earth is given unto me. Do you know anyone that ever have powers in heaven and on earth. Many may have authority on earth like the emperors and the likes. This is someone that says He has, you better believe Him.</p>
<p>Who gave it to Him. Whoever gave it to Him has to have it all. He has to have given Him all. That’s God Almighty. One more significant proof who Jesus is.</p>
<p>The meaning of Son of God. Never forget. Son of God means God in flesh. It made the Jews mad. God manifest in flesh. It doesn’t mean someone given birth by God. That’s why they said it was blasphemy. The were bad and picked up stone. Understand the significance of the words of Jesus.</p>
<p>If what He said is true, then, He’s truly God and can manifest Himself on earth from Heaven. If God gave Him all He had, then, He will have nothing left. Colossians 1:19.</p>
<p>This Jesus said that all authority is given to Him. He’s truly God. All authority in heaven and in earth....</p>
<p>Go ye therefore.... on the basis of this authority, go and teach all nations. Ethnos in Greek means all tribes, economic, industrial, social, all kinds of tribes, groups of people with some common type of relationship. Go and teach them. You can make students of these people. Teach them how to live. You will see what He wants you to teach....</p>
<p>Teach them in the name, not names.... the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit use the name of Jesus. That’s the Fathers choice...</p>
<p>Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. Remarkable. I’m with you always till the end of the age. What He told the apostle, they have passed to us, we are the custodians of those words.</p>
<p>I am with you always is an extraordinary statement. Did you understand what He just said? Assuredly, I am with you... I remember something interesting which.... errr... late Archbishop Benson Idahosa who said that lo.... even the short people, low.... I’m with you... be sure of this... look here, I’m with you, be sure of this, I’m with you. That’s not a promise. He didn’t say I’ll be with you. He said, I am with you. Don’t pray for Him to be with you. He said, I am with you...</p>
<p>His last words are so important. I am with you always. The integrity of His word. Can He be trusted. Really. Practice taking His words as simply as He said them. If Jesus appears to you and in front of you, your faith will not change.... go to the word and see what will happen... these disciples had been with Him and still doubted even after He resurrected. They doubted. Faith doesn’t come by experience but by hearing by the word of God.</p>
<p>Nobody in the Bible had their faith changed when they saw Jesus. Your faith wouldn’t change by experience. Some saw Jesus in dreams and still did some dumb things.</p>
<p>Matthew 28:20</p>
<p>Lord Jesus, you’re with me,that’s all I need. He’s with me in the darkest of nights. Morning, noon and night, He’s with me. Talk and think of Him and though He’s with you. He’s with you. It brings excitement. How could I ever be frustrated or discouraged when he’s with me. Many Christians find themselves unhappy because they don’t believe this. It means nothing to them. If they believe He’s with them, they don’t trust Him and try to package their own lives in case He fails.</p>
<p>In their hearts he could remember so and so that trusted Him and it didn’t quite work out for those fellows.... they didn’t know that those folks doubted Him...</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:7
Whose faith follow... considering the end of their conversation.... a whole lot of people have way of lives that are different...</p>

<p>&quot;If anyone can control his tongue, it proves that he has perfect control over himself in every other way&quot; (JAMES 3:2 TLB)</p>
<p>One of the two thieves that were crucified with Jesus said to Him, &quot;If truly you are the Son of God, do something about our situation; save yourself and us.&quot; Actually, this man really wanted help but in his desperation he asked for help the wrong way. Some Christians do talk like this when they are desperate for a change in their situation. Some would even pray, &quot;Oh God, do something. After all, the Bible declares that the Lord shall supply all of my needs according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus. So, please bring it fast.&quot; Some others unwittingly threaten God saying, &quot;If you don&#x27;t do it, it&#x27;s your shame.&quot;</p>
<p>The first man that spoke didn&#x27;t get anything but the other man rebuked the first man saying, &quot;Shut up! We&#x27;re criminals and we&#x27;re paying the price for our sins&quot; and he looked at Jesus and asked for forgiveness. Immediately, Jesus assured him that he would be with Him in Paradise. These two men were in the same situation, so the difference between them has nothing to do with the circumstance. The difference between them was their mouth. One couldn&#x27;t see beyond his precarious situation in this physical realm and spoke according to how he felt. The other man looked further from what he could feel or see and spoke accordingly.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s imperative that you carefully consider the words you speak. Don&#x27;t talk carelessly, learn to choose your words carefully before you speak. There are too many Christians who aren&#x27;t conscious of their words; they just say anything and everything they feel, see and think. Always remember that your words are powerful and God takes them seriously. He wants you to declare His Word always and fill the hearts of those listening to you with faith and hope in Christ.</p>

<p>Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place (2 Corinthians 2:14).</p>
<p>In Psalm 7:17, David said, “I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.” Looking back at the past 6 months, our hearts are filled with gratitude to the Lord for all the extraordinary accomplishments we had both as a ministry and in our individual lives.</p>
<p>Irrespective and independent of the situation or your immediate circumstances, you should give thanks to the Father. Worship and praise Him, no matter what! The Bible says, “In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you” (1 Thessalonians 5:18). “In everything” means “in every situation”; you’re to give Him thanks in, and for, all things.</p>
<p>When you look at the past 6 months in retrospect, be joyful and excited in your spirit, thankful to the Lord for all He’s done for you. Count your blessings. Don’t muse over the disappointments or things you wished you had accomplished but that you didn’t. Rather, rejoice over what He’s done for you and celebrate your accomplishments.</p>
<p>Remember, we walk by faith, and not by sight; joy is an expression of your faith. In rejoicing and giving thanks to the Lord, you’re getting His attention on your faith.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we give thanks in expectation. That’s why He tells us, “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6-7 NKJV).</p>

<p>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart (Hebrews 4:12).</p>
<p>Our opening scripture lets us know the power of God’s Word. Howbeit, the Word only produces results for you when you believe, and act upon it. Your faith-response is vital. For example, 2 Peter 1:3 says God has given you all things that pertain to life and godliness. This means everything you could ever want, that’s consistent with God’s perfect will for you, is already yours in Christ.</p>
<p>Your response, therefore, should be, “Blessed be God! Health, prosperity, success, victory, and other glorious provisions of the Gospel are my present-hour realities in Christ.” Responding to the Word is how you make the Word real in your personal life, and that’s what faith is: the response of the human spirit to the Word of God.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 2:12 says, “Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.” Faith is acting on these spiritual realities revealed to us by the Holy Spirit, accepting them as truth and living accordingly.</p>
<p>Consider 2 Corinthians 2:14; it says, “Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.” This means no matter what happens, you insist that you’re triumphant always, and in all things. You stand your ground and maintain that you’re a victor in Christ Jesus; you don’t just think it, you affirm it. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>God gave us His Word to live by, and to use in charting our course in victory. It’s your responsibility to use the Word; to work the Word. The change you desire in your finances, health, and family would only come as a result of your response to the Word. Hebrews 13:5-6 says, “for he hath said…So that we may boldly say” 2 Corinthians 4:13 says, “we also believe, and therefore speak.” It’s about your response to the Word: what you say, on the basis of what He has said!</p>

<p>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12).</p>
<p>There’re three kinds of sin. The first one is inherited sin. The Bible says, “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned” (Romans 5:12). The sin of Adam was passed to all men. Everyone that came from Adam became an heir of Adam’s transgression. How terrible! But that’s the reality.</p>
<p>The second one is “imputed sin.” Imputed sin is based on Law, and you may not be the guilty one. In Joshua 7, we read how the children of Israel paid dearly for the sin committed by just one man, Achan. Having recently conquered a greater nation, the children of Israel were preparing to go wipe out a smaller one. Before going to capture Jericho, God had instructed them, “When you get to that place, don’t keep anything that’s theirs; destroy everything” (Joshua 7:11 AMPC).</p>
<p>But Achan took a coat and other items, and hid them for himself (Joshua 7:20-21). And the result? The whole country (Israel) lost the battle. The man’s sin was imputed to the whole country. Aside the inheritance, Adam’s transgression was also imputed to all men. You didn’t have to be guilty personally; it’s a class sin; everybody becomes part of it. It’s like when the President of your country signs a bad deal or initiates a bad policy; it affects the entire nation.</p>
<p>The third class of sin is “personal sin.” This is the one that you committed by yourself. Clearly, everyone born into this world has the sin-nature and requires salvation. If a man says he’s free from personal sin, how about inherited sin, and or imputed sin? But thanks be unto God! Salvation—the deliverance of man from his fallen nature and the depravity of sin and its effects, the recreation of his spirit and the restoration of fellowship with God—is possible and available through Jesus Christ! He’s the only way out!</p>
<p>This is why we preach the Gospel; that all men may believe in Jesus Christ and receive remission of sins and the life and nature of God. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>GIVE YOURSELF TO THE WORD OF GOD THAT IS ABLE TO BUILD YOU UP AND GIVE YOU AN INHERITANCE AMONG THE SAINTS</p>
<p>SAY THIS WITH ME 🗣
Dear Lord, thank you for the privilege to receive the Gospel which is your power to save, heal and deliver. I pray for the unconverted in the world, that the scales would fall off their eyes to recognize their sins, and accept your provision for remission in Christ, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him (Romans 5:8-9).</p>
<p>The Bible speaks of the Father’s love poured out lavishly in Jesus Christ. Such extraordinary love did He express toward us, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. He didn’t die for us because we were living right; He did it while we were yet sinners. That’s indescribable love, but it describes our value.</p>
<p>When you know who Jesus is, and the fact that He actually gave His life to save you, you’ll understand what God thinks about you; how He values you. His vicarious death defines your value. He thought you were worth His life; therefore, He gave His life in your place. This shows that you’re as valuable to God as Jesus is. No wonder the Lord Jesus, pouring out His heart to the Father in prayer, wanted the world to know that the Father loved us even as He loved Him (John 17:23).</p>
<p>How inspiring it is to know that Jesus gave His life, so that you may have it. The life you ought to live now should be the life of the Son of God; live His dream. Paul boldly declared in Galatians 2:20: “I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”</p>
<p>Don’t live a lesser life. Live God’s dream. He considered you valuable, and gave Himself for you. 1 Peter 1:18-19 says, “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.”</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-greatest-honour-ever--pastor-chris-oyakhilome5443">THE GREATEST HONOUR EVER! ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~5443<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to THE GREATEST HONOUR EVER! ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~5443" title="Direct link to THE GREATEST HONOUR EVER! ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~5443" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#the-greatest-honour-ever--pastor-chris-oyakhilome5443">​</a></h2>
<p>“Now all things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation.”
(2 Corinthians 5:18)</p>
<p>2 Peter 3:9 tells us that God isn’t willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. He proved His commitment by sending Jesus to die for the salvation of all men (John 3:16). However, despite God’s commitment to saving the lost, He wills to do it through us—His saints—and has committed to us “the ministry of reconciliation.”</p>
<p>Jesus said in Mark 16:15 NIV, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.” We have the most incredible honour on earth: the opportunity to preach the Gospel. God gave us the rare privilege of being His partners in changing the world: His partners in transforming lives.</p>
<p>Think about the fact that God didn’t give the charge of soul-winning to angels, but to you and me. The glorious Gospel of the blessed God has been committed to our trust (1 Timothy 1:11); be faithful in it. Be on-the-go with the Gospel; don’t stop until the knowledge of the glory of God covers the earth as the waters cover the sea.</p>
<p>What a marvellous blessing, privilege and honour that the Lord would do all He did, and send us to herald the news around the world! Then to ensure you succeed at it, He gave you the Holy Spirit to be with you, and in you. The Holy Spirit makes you an able, competent, and effective minister of the Gospel (2 Corinthians 3:6). He gives you the ability to be a bold witness of the resurrected Christ and to fulfil your calling.</p>
<p>🗣 AFFIRM THIS WORDS
Taking the Gospel to the ends of the earth is my passion and high calling in Christ Jesus. I’m honoured, privileged and blessed to be entrusted with the glorious Gospel of Christ’s salvation, and today, more than ever, I preach it with power, bringing salvation to as many as hear and believe. Blessed be God!</p>

<p>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory (Colossians 3:3-4).</p>
<p>Being born again, your life is hid with Christ in God; Christ is your life. You received eternal life; a supplanting of your natural human life by His divine life when you were born again. What you have in you now is the Christ-life.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus took the depraved, defeated, destroyed and broken human life away from you. The life of sin, failure, defeat, rejection and shame was taken away from you, and in replacement, He gave you a life of righteousness, honour, peace and glory. You were dead, but now alive in Him.</p>
<p>Think about it: if Christ is your life, then everything about your life is Christ. How then could you be said to have cancer? How could you have a blood disease or sickness of any kind in your body? It’s not possible!</p>
<p>Satan has lied to many and deceived them into believing that nothing really has changed even though they’re now born again. No; the problems, the darkness, misery and pains that were associated with your natural human life; the infirmities that were there before you were born again, have all passed away.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 says, “Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” The word, “behold” means to see or reckon. God wants you to see that you’re now a new man; you’re now in Christ, and Christ is in you. Christ is your new environment and home. Therefore, it makes no difference the infirmity or deformity you might have been born with; you have a new life now.</p>
<p>Romans 8:10 says, “And if Christ is in you, though your body be dead because of sin, but the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.” It therefore doesn’t matter what happens or has happened to your body, Christ in you makes you whole, well, and sound. Have and walk in this consciousness. Walk bold and fearless, full of faith and confidence, because Christ is your life. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not&quot; (JOHN 1:4-5).</p>
<p>The Bible says in John 10:10, &quot;The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&quot; The Lord Jesus died, was buried, and raised back to life by the glory of the Father. When God raised Him from the dead and showed Him openly, He called all to life. So, Jesus made eternal life possible. John said, &quot;(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)&quot; (1 JOHN 1:2).</p>
<p>In John 17:3, the Bible says, &quot;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&quot; Jesus is the embodiment of eternal life. He said in John 14:6, &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life&quot; He said in John 6:47, &quot;Verily, verily,  I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.&quot; Everlasting life is eternal life. The one who believes in Jesus has it.</p>
<p>The question is, do you believe in Jesus Christ? If you do, then you have eternal life. You&#x27;re not going to get it when you get to heaven; you have it now; it&#x27;s your present-hour possession. Also, if you&#x27;re not sure that you have eternal life, perhaps, you&#x27;ve not been born again, this is your moment! You can receive that now by asking Jesus to come into your heart to be the Lord of your life.</p>
<p>When you receive Christ, you receive eternal life; you receive the divine life and nature of God. You&#x27;re awakened to the fatherhood of God; you become one with Him.</p>
<p>Something else that&#x27;s so sublime is that eternal life from Jesus Christ doesn&#x27;t come alone, it comes with &quot;Righteousness.&quot; The Bible says, &quot;For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation&quot; (Romans 10:10). Romans 5:17 says, &quot;For if by one man&#x27;s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.&quot; 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, &quot;For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.&quot;</p>

<p>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him (1 John 2:15).</p>
<p>Christ Jesus already provided everything you need to be triumphant, successful, and prosperous in life. Therefore, you have no reason to be distracted or to take your focus off fulfilling His call on your life.</p>
<p>Distractions can come in different ways to impede your passion, and stop you from being all that the Lord has destined for you to be. They can come in the form of needs; the things you want or things you want to do, whether or not they’re working out. Distractions can also come from people such as relatives, parents, friends, who try to shift your focus to something different from God’s calling on your life.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in whatever way or shade distractions come, refuse to allow them. Understand that as a Christian, especially when you’re making an impact with the Gospel, you’ll face persecutions; there’ll be those who’ll be against you, or even hate you, but that shouldn’t be a surprise to you at all. Jesus said, “If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you” (John 15:20). But guess what? It makes no difference who’s against you; you’re forever a victor; you’re more than a conqueror.</p>
<p>Distractions can come from the devil too. He can bring such thoughts to you as, “Do you think you’re supposed to be a Christian? What has this Christianity even done for you?” Never entertain such thoughts; when they come, refute them and say, “Get thee hence, Satan, for thou savoureth not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.”</p>
<p>Keep fueling your love for the Master, and refuse to allow anything dissipate your zeal; anything that’ll prevent you from putting your best in the Gospel. Once you’re able to eliminate distractions in your life, you’ll notice remarkable improvements in your personality, output and influence. Maintain your focus; be the best of you for the Lord and His eternal</p>

<p>And be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind [having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude], And put on the new nature (the regenerate self) created in God’s image, [Godlike] in true righteousness and holiness (EPHESIANS 4:23-24 AMPC)</p>
<p>Being born again, you have the life and nature of God. You were recreated in righteousness and true holiness, to express the will and nature of the Father. Your spirit was recreated in the image and likeness of God. In other words, you were created to be like Him, and to function like Him.</p>
<p>It’s thus possible for you to express His will and nature, His life and divine attributes that are in your spirit. The Spirit’s admonition in our opening verse to “Put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness” simply means to express His life of righteousness in you. In every matter, in every place, at every opportunity, let His righteousness be expressed through you. In anything that you’re involved in, you bear testimony by your life, actions and words to the character of God! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>You’re His expression and extension to your world; this has always been His dream: to express Himself fully in, and through you. Only through you can He show forth His goodness, grace, wisdom and excellence to the world. The natural or unregenerate man can’t know who God is until they meet you.</p>
<p>Make it your life’s work that through the Holy Spirit, everywhere you are, you’ll manifest Christ; you’ll manifest His glory; you&#x27;ll express the God-life, for that’s your calling.</p>

<p>Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness (Romans 6:18)</p>
<p>Paul had difficulty communicating the truth in the verse above due to the limitation of language. He said in the next verse, “I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh” (Romans 6:19). The Message translation says, “I’m using this freedom language because it’s easy to picture.” (Romans 6:19 MSG). He had to bring the discussion to a seeming mundane level that they could relate with.</p>
<p>The reality is that the new creation wasn’t “set free” from sin; rather, he was born sin-free; there’s a difference between the two. Born sin-free means you were born without sin. This is easy to understand when you realise that the new creation is the result of the resurrection (not the death) of Jesus Christ. Your new life started with the resurrection of Jesus Christ: “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:4).</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 says, “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature”; a new species or kind of man, born in righteousness with no past of sin to be set free from. In Christianity, we don’t get set free; we’re free-born! That’s the reality for the one who’s born again. You’re sin-free. No wonder Romans 6:14 says, “For sin shall not have dominion over you&quot;</p>
<p>The concept of sin can’t be properly understood until you have a good understanding of the doctrine of righteousness. So, when the Bible says, “For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness” (Romans 6:20), the expression “free from righteousness” actually means righteousness free or you were “righteousness-exempt.” In other words, you were a slave of sin, and couldn’t practise righteousness.</p>
<p>However, now that you’re born again, it’s the reverse; you can practise righteousness and produce fruits and works of righteousness because that’s your nature in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>CONFESSION
I’m a new creation, a new kind of man; old things are passed away and all things have become new. I walk in righteousness and produce works and fruits of righteousness. Glory to God!</p>

<p>&quot;He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself&quot; (1 CORINTHIANS 14:4)</p>
<p>One of the synonyms for the Greek word translated &quot;edify&quot; is to &quot;charge,&quot; like a battery. Jude 1:20 (AMPC) says, &quot;But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit.&quot; He&#x27;s telling you to get charged up in the Holy Ghost; embolden yourself in the Holy Ghost through speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>This is what you do when there&#x27;re matters arising: you charge yourself up in the Holy Ghost! Are there projects you want to undertake and you&#x27;re somewhat not sure what steps to take? Get charged up in the Holy Ghost! Activate the wisdom and power of God by praying in the Holy Ghost until you&#x27;re filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:18 says, &quot;And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.&quot; This is the secret to a day-to-day life of the supernatural: being filled with the Spirit. If someone was timid, and began the exercise of speaking in tongues consistently, soon enough, he&#x27;d become bold and sound.</p>
<p>When you speak in other tongues, and your spirit is charged, it takes over your mind; your spirit will rise like a giant from within and dominate the outward man. Paul said to Timothy, &quot;stir up the gift of God that is in you&quot; (2 Timothy 1:6). One of the ways to do this is through speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>The reason some Christians faint in the day of adversity is because their inner man is weak, and the reason for that weakness is that they don&#x27;t speak in tongues sufficiently. Speaking in tongues imparts courage to your spirit. It produces in you the sense of absolute dominion over adversities.</p>
<p>Refuse to live an ordinary life. There&#x27;s power in you; stir it up always. In your privacy, speak in tongues. When you&#x27;re on the go, speak in tongues. Keep yourself supercharged all the time. This isn&#x27;t for a particular Christian denomination; it&#x27;s for every child of God. Get yourself charged up in the Holy Ghost always.</p>

<p>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them (Acts 16:25).</p>
<p>Something remarkable about the way Paul and Silas praised the Lord in Acts 16 was that they were exuberant in their praise and worship of the Lord. It was supposed to be for them a moment of gloom, loneliness and despondency, but rather than be overwhelmed with despair, they sang praises unto God. They didn’t just mutter songs quietly, fearful of the prison guards, they sang as loud as they could such that the prisoners heard them.</p>
<p>This is one of the faith-ways to respond in the face of contrary situations; you praise and worship the Lord exuberantly, knowing that in Him you’re more than a conqueror. If it seems as though you’re in the “darkest hour” of your life, don’t despair! Don’t try to remind God of the problem, no; praise Him! You might say, “But if I don’t tell Him my problems, He won’t know what’s on my mind”; you’re wrong. He knows everything, because He’s God.</p>
<p>Take your mind off the challenges and with a grateful heart, worship and extol His majesty; praise His Name, for He’s the healer, the provider, the supplier of all good things, and He’s greater than all. Adore Him for He’s great and greatly to be praised. Even now, irrespective of the situation, praise Him! Think about everything He’s done in your life! Think about His love, mercies, and grace towards you; think about His wonderful, glorious blessings in your life, and worship Him lavishly from your spirit.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I rejoice in you, for you’re the only true and wise God; the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords! Thank you for your goodness, kindness, love, and mercies towards me today. I praise you now and forever, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>“By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name” (Hebrews 13:15)</p>
<p>I’ve seen people try to bring down the heavens with their praise. They praise God so loud with their voices until they shout themselves hoarse. Anybody can sing, dance and shout to praise God. Now, there’s nothing wrong with praising God with dancing and shouting and singing; the Word actually says to do that. However, there’s a kind of praise that gets God’s attention. I am talking about a kind of praise God cannot but respond to.</p>
<p>That was the kind of praise Solomon gave God. Indeed, Solomon praised God with his voice and danced, but he didn’t stop there. He thought much of this great God of glory and honored Him with his substance. He offered such sacrifices to God as no king ever had a thousand burnt offerings (1 Kings 3:3 – 4), and that got God’s attention.</p>
<p>Later that same night, God showed up in his bedroom and told him, Ask Me for anything. I mean, God gave him an open cheque. Solomon could draw anything he desired on God’s account because he praised God with his substance. This is the kind of praise I’m talking about. When you give yourself to God like this, He ministers to you personally. Little wonder the Apostle Paul had such wonderful visions of God. That’s the man who said, And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you… (2 Corinthians 12:15). The Lord appeared to him in visions and He had angels minister to him several times.</p>
<p>He enjoyed so much attention from God because he had given everything and was ever willing to give anything to God. Whatever came into his hands went to the gospel. You too can get God’s attention this way by becoming committed to Him with your substance. Position yourself in the way of God’s blessing; give Him sacrificial praise today.</p>

<p>Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s (2 Chronicles 20:15).</p>
<p>In 2 Chronicles 20, we read something inspiring that King Jehoshaphat did when Judah was besieged by enemy nations. He and the armies of Judah were completely out-numbered, and in his own words, he admitted Judah’s vulnerability, but not without seeking help from the Lord. He prayed, “O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee” (2 Chronicles 20:12).</p>
<p>Then, verses 14-17 tells us something beautiful; it says, “Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah…came the Spirit of the Lord…And he said, …Thus saith the Lord unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. Tomorrow go ye down against them….Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them: for the Lord will be with you.”</p>
<p>Those were the Lord’s comforting and assuring words to Jehoshaphat. But notice the next thing Jehoshaphat did, in readiness to confront the invading army: he appointed singers unto the Lord, to praise the beauty of Holiness, chanting, “Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever” (2 Chronicles 20:21). This was a song of victory.</p>
<p>As they went on singing and marching towards the enemy’s camp, the Bible declares that “the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten” (2 Chronicles 20:22). When Judah’s army came in from behind the singers, their entire assailants had perished, having destroyed one another. Jehoshaphat, with his army, simply took the spoil without a fight! This was an unusual strategy, and it’s for our learning.</p>
<p>Our songs of worship and praise, in the face of daunting circumstances, spell defeat for the adversary. It doesn’t matter how severe you think the challenge is; praise and worship the Lord from His Word of victory. Regardless of the might of the adversary and adversities, never give up! Sing songs of victory. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>PRAYER
Thank you Father, for you’ve made me an overcomer in this world and set me on a perpetual victory parade, with songs of victory in my mouth! I’m full of might and ability to face and surmount life’s challenges, to the glory and praise of your Name, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the LORD of hosts&quot; (ZECHARIAH 4:6)</p>
<p>In Ephesians 5:18-19, the Apostle Paul tells us, &quot;And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.&quot; Then, as you study the book of Acts, you&#x27;ll observe that the apostles ministered in the Name of Jesus, with the Word, and by the power of the Holy Spirit. That&#x27;s why they had such extraordinary results. It&#x27;s the same today. There&#x27;re people who try so hard to succeed through their own might and natural wisdom, yet true success eludes them. This is because they function from their mind---the sense-realm---which is grossly limited.</p>
<p>ACT Now and make a godly investment in their lives.</p>
<p>The success is by the Spirit. If you&#x27;ve been trying to succeed by your own power or ability, it&#x27;s time to quit the struggle and rely on the strategies of the Spirit and His wisdom to guide you. 2 Corinthians 3:5 says, &quot;Not that we are sufficient to think of anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.&quot;</p>
<p>Our competence; the ability, wisdom and grace by which we function are of the Spirit. Trust in Him. How do you intend to grow your Church, cell group, or fellowship? How do you intend to multiply your finances or grow your business? It&#x27;s got to be by the Spirit! He&#x27;ll make you a wonder as you walk with Him and allow Him to guide you in your affairs. He&#x27;ll unveil the realities of the Kingdom and the reality of the glory of God to you. He&#x27;s the key to a life of endless victories and extraordinary success.</p>

<p>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (COLOSSIANS 1:27)</p>
<p>Many think that Christianity restored us back to what Adam and Eve used to be or had in the Garden of Eden, but that’s not true. What we have is a far greater glory (2 Corinthians 3:10). Being born again, you’re not born after the first Adam but after the second and last Adam, Jesus Christ. The Scripture says, “The first man, Adam, became a living person. But the last Adam—that is, Christ—is a life-giving Spirit” (1 CORINTHIANS 15:45 NLT).</p>
<p>I want you to carefully note the tenses in Romans 8:30 as we read this time from the Weymouth New Testament: “and those whom He has pre-destined He also has called; and those whom He has called He has also declared free from guilt; and those whom He has declared free from guilt He has also crowned with glory.” Here, we identify vital realities concerning the new creation, which are the results of Christ’s redemptive work. One of them is that you’ve been crowned with glory. That means you’ve been brought into a life of beauty and excellence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in 1 Peter 5:10, we read that God has called you to His own eternal glory in Christ Jesus. The same truth is highlighted in 2 Peter 1:3: “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.” You’ve been glorified, not with any lesser glory, but with the same glory that is on Jesus. He said in John 17:22: “And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them”</p>
<p>“But doesn’t the Bible say in Romans 3:23 that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God?” someone may ask. That was before Jesus came. All men became separated from the glory of God because of sin, but Jesus, through His death, nailed sin to the Cross and brought us into glory; not the glory that Adam and Eve had, but His own glory. He glorified you with Himself.</p>
<p>Referring to Jesus, Hebrews 2:9 tells us that God crowned Him with glory and honour. Then in 1 John 4:17, we read that as He is, so are we in this world. Blessed be God! You’re crowned with glory and honour just like Jesus. Your life isn’t for reproach; it’s for glory, beauty, excellence and honour. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee&quot; (HEBREWS 13:5)</p>
<p>This is absolutely remarkable! The Lord says He&#x27;ll never, in any degree, leave you helpless nor forsake you. The Amplified Classic translation lets us know He repeated the clause &quot;I will not&quot; three times (for emphasis): &quot;I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support. [I will] not, [I will] not, [I will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let [you] down (relax my hold on you)! [Assuredly not!].&quot;</p>
<p>The very scripture brings to mind the words of Jesus in John 14:18, &quot;I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.&quot; Yes, Jesus is in heaven, but He didn&#x27;t leave us without support. He didn&#x27;t leave us desolate, bereaved, forlorn or stranded. He sent us the Holy Spirit, not only to be with us, but to live in us. That same Spirit has become your courage, your help, your sufficiency and your all.</p>
<p>Trust Him with your life. Fellowship with Him, and He&#x27;ll make you successful in all things. He says He won&#x27;t relax His hold on you; meaning He&#x27;s with all the way in your journey of life, seeing to it that you win always. He knows how to take care of you.</p>
<p>His help is something you shouldn&#x27;t doubt at all; it&#x27;s guaranteed. The Bible says He&#x27;s your &quot;very present help in times of trouble&quot; (Psalm 46:1). If you ever find yourself in trouble or a difficult situation, be assured you&#x27;re not alone; He&#x27;ll get you out or show you what to do to come out victoriously.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is your supreme advantage, refuge and strength. Acknowledge and appreciate His work in your life and love Him with all your heart.</p>

<p>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation (2 CORINTHIANS 5:18)</p>
<p>The underlined portion of the scripture above shows that it was God who took the responsibility of reconciling us to Himself. He was the one behind all that Jesus Christ accomplished for us. Actually, He was the one doing it. We see that in 2 Corinthians 5:19; it says, “To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself.” It isn’t just that God loved us so much and sent Jesus, but that He was actually doing everything that had to do with man’s salvation by Himself.</p>
<p>He was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>He took the responsibility, and paid the full penalty for all your sins; He’s not mad at you at all. Even if you got into trouble for something that you did wrong, He’s obligated to saving you, to helping you out of any trouble, for one reason: because you have a ransom in Christ Jesus!</p>
<p>Transform-a-Life-Today to a friend or loved one out there needing Salvation! This is why the birth of Jesus means so much to us; He was born to live, die, and give His life as a ransom for many: “For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45).</p>
<p>The Bible says He chose us in Him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blame before him in love (Ephesians 1:4). You’re holy and without blame before the Father, because Christ is your ransom! He took responsibility for your sins.</p>
<p>This is the message of the Gospel! No wonder He calls us His righteous ones; His justified ones; meaning that we can’t be charged with sin, because not only are we righteous, we have also become the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”</p>

<p>But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price (1PETER 3:4)</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:16, Paul clearly distinguishes between the outward man and the inward man when he said, “For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.” The one Peter calls the “hidden man of the heart” in our opening verse is the same the Apostle Paul calls the “inward man.”</p>
<p>The outward man is the physical body and its five senses of sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste. These senses are man’s medium for relating with his environment. The human body can only receive information from this world through its five senses. The inward man, however, is the human spirit and his soul; the seat of his mind, will, and emotions.</p>

<p>Scriptural Reference: And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted (Matthew 23:12).</p>
<p>A very striking quality of truly great people is their humility. It makes no difference where they are, they respect leadership; they honour structures, principles, and maintain order. It brings to mind something that Jesus did when He was to feed a crowd of five thousand men (women and children not counted). He said to His disciples, “Make them sit down by fifties in a company. And they did so, and made them all SIT DOWN” (Luke 9:14-15).</p>
<p>The instruction was simple: sit down in manageable groups, and the men did. Not to heed such a simple instruction would be to be out of order, which oftentimes is the result of pride. Don&#x27;t try to “rise,” when the instruction is for you to “sit.” Relax and calm down. Get in order.</p>
<p>1 Peter 5:5-6 says, “be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.” Those who are proud, despite their desire for expansion, progress or advancement, don&#x27;t experience much, because God resists the proud. He gives grace to the humble.</p>
<p>When you come for a Church meeting, for example, and you&#x27;re given an instruction as to where to park your vehicle or directed in the auditorium as to where to sit, don&#x27;t complain. Comply. Don&#x27;t shrug with contempt at the venue or facility managers; don&#x27;t disrespect the ushers.</p>
<p>Our opening verse in the Amplified Classic says, “whoever humbles himself [whoever has a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly] shall be raised to honor.” Humility is the speed for life, the catalyst for ever-increasing greatness and unlimited progress. It&#x27;s the way to experience quantum leap, and be elevated to honour in your life.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I’m submitted to the authority, influence and impact of your Word. Pride, arrogance, haughtiness, or egotism have no place in me. I walk in true humility and as a result, I experience ever-increasing greatness and unlimited progress in every area of my life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches (PROVERBS 24:3-4)</p>
<p>Our theme verse highlights three vital elements for building a successful life: wisdom, understanding, and knowledge. It says with wisdom, a “house” is built; house here could be likened to your life, business, career, family, or any enterprise. It goes further to say that the house, once built, is established by understanding; and then by knowledge, you bring riches into it.</p>
<p>Wisdom is the insight of knowledge, insight into the secrets and mysteries of life. The Bible says in Proverbs 4:7 that wisdom is the principal thing, the capital you need for whatever you want to achieve in life: “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.”</p>
<p>Your Prompt Action will help create a better world in Southern Africa with the Precious Gospel of our Lord Jesus .</p>
<p>Notice that it doesn’t stop at enjoining you to get wisdom; it goes further to say, “Along with wisdom, get understanding.” Spiritual understanding is just as important as wisdom in building a successful life. You may have the wisdom to start something, but you need understanding to establish it, and then knowledge of how to make consistent progress from glory to glory.</p>
<p>In Colossians 1:9, the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, prayed for us to be filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. Knowledge here is exact or full knowledge of God. Through this kind of knowledge, you make your life glorious: your life (the house) is filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>
<p>Wisdom, understanding, and knowledge go together. You need all three to be effective, and to live the extraordinary life of success, dominion, victory and excellence that God has ordained for you.</p>

<p>And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth (John 17:19).</p>
<p>There are Christians who don’t have the reverential fear of God; they think they’re at liberty to live the way they choose. But that’s dangerous. There’s a way of life that’s not right for a Christian, and if you’re going to fulfil the purpose of God for your life, then you’ve got to have purity of heart; you must live according to your nature of righteousness and true holiness in Christ</p>
<p>In Joshua 3:5, we read something striking that Joshua said to the children of Israel. He said, “Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.” Joshua understood the power of sanctification; the power of separating yourself from the wrong things; the power of purifying your mind and your life.</p>
<p>You’re God’s vessel, sanctified to be in fellowship with Him through the Holy Spirit. Don’t jeopardize that communion because of a bad attitude or worldly lifestyle. 2 Corinthians 13:5 says, “Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves” Use the Word to purge and examine yourself always. 2 Timothy 2:21 says, “If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.”</p>
<p>Do you want to continually experience the supernatural in your life? Then, keep yourself in the purity of the Spirit; don’t live the wrong life. Don’t get yourself entangled with the things of this world, for the Bible says, “No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life” (2 Timothy 2:4).</p>
<p>You were separated from the World through the Gospel, but you’ve got to take the world out of you, through the sanctification of your mind and soul. This happens as you yield to the authority and lordship of the Word, and guidance of the Holy Spirit in your life. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>CONFESSION
I’m sanctified, set apart, for God’s use. I’m continually transformed by the renewing of my mind, in the image of Christ. I stay on the path of purity, yielded to the Word, and the authority and guidance of the Holy Spirit, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="words-are-things--pastor-chris-oyakhilome6125">WORDS ARE “THINGS” ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~6125<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to WORDS ARE “THINGS” ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~6125" title="Direct link to WORDS ARE “THINGS” ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~6125" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#words-are-things--pastor-chris-oyakhilome6125">​</a></h2>
<p>But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God (ACTS 20:24)</p>
<p>&quot;Things” in the scripture above is translated from the Greek word “logos,” which is translated “word” in John 1:1: “In the beginning was the Word” In the verses preceding our theme verse, there had been prophetic “words” about the fierce persecutions the Apostle Paul would face in Jerusalem. In spite of everything that had been said, Paul submitted, “None of these things move me” He referred to the words that had been spoken as “things.&quot;</p>
<p>He could have as well said, “None of these words move me.” That’s because in the Kingdom of God, words are things; they’re like spiritual particles; spiritual substance, and have spiritual tangibility. Every word that comes out of your mouth is a “thing” that’ll never be destroyed, because it’s of spiritual origin. When it goes out of you, it represents you everywhere. The only thing that can destroy and render it powerless is another word from you.</p>
<p>Jesus said, “Any word that you speak that’s useless, you’ll give account of it in the day of judgement” (Matthew 12:36). That tells you the power and importance of words; they’re of spiritual value. How you form and use them is your responsibility for which you’ll give account.</p>
<p>So, as a child of God, your life is really up to you. You create your situation, either good or bad. If you know that the last ten years haven&#x27;t been as beautiful as God would have them, you can change things now, and recreate your next ten years to be what God has destined for you.</p>
<p>It makes no difference what your struggles in life have been; you can recreate your world, by your words. Jesus said you shall have what you say (Mark 11:23). That’s where your life, and the power to shape it aright is words! Speak the right words (God’s Word) about your life and situation.</p>

<p>3rd October 2021</p>
<p>The Seven Reigns of the Prophetic Timeline:</p>
<p>You need to know God&#x27;s plan; where we are at in God&#x27;s calendar;  then you know what to expect/what to do.</p>
<ol>
<li>The reign of Adam. genesis 1: 26-
V28 Notice the words. The terms that God used in commissioning.
God created man on the 6th day...
And the first day that man would see was the day of Rest</li>
</ol>
<p>Adam was given the power to subdue earth. To reign over all of God&#x27;s creation.
Adam was King....But for how long did He reign?</p>
<p>In Season 3, Phase 4, I showed you from the scripture that Adam lived for 33 years before the fall. He was 33 years old when Genesis 3:8 happened.</p>
<p>Remember Adam started out his life as an Adult. He was created an Adult.</p>
<p>Remember Jesus went to the House of Dates (in Bethany) 6 days before the passover.
That plant in science is called the tree of life. It is one of the most important trees on earth.</p>
<p>Dates are the reference point to the past and the future.
(Go and listen to the message in season 3, phase 4)</p>
<p>Adam lost his Reign to Death.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The reign of Death.
Satan became the god of this world because of Adam.
Romans 5:14. At the fall of Adam , death took over.
Spiritual death is the cause of physical death.
Death reigned from Adam to the Law (Moses)
Hebs 2:14</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice something interesting.
Death was not reigning at this time. But the FEAR OF DEATH kept the isrealites in Bondage.
Once the law was given on the basis of the covenant, death ceased to reign. But they didn&#x27;t know it.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ came to set men free from the FEAR OF DEATH.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The reign of the Law.
(From the law of Moses to the Cross of Jesus Christ)
Colossians 2:13-15.</li>
</ol>
<p>Satan took advantage of transgression and used death to deceive and destroy.
Same way, they used the law to scare men and used the law in a negative way, making them afraid of God instead of drawing them to God. .once the law came in, they didn&#x27;t have to die.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:13-14 NIV.
Ephesians 2:14-15
Deuteronomy 32:45-48
The devil was not a factor. If you kept the law, you prospered even if Satan hated you. You lived as long as you chose to, with the blessing of God working with the law. Satan was not a factor.
That was the power of the law.</p>
<p>Jesus nailed it to the cross...so that was the end of the dominion of the law.
This law went all the way until Jesus came. The demands of the law were difficult to bear. The law came with condemnation and with a curse.
Galatians 3:13, 4:5 (referring to the Jews, not everybody)
The very presence of the law was the condemnation of the gentiles, Because they were not God&#x27;s people.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Reign of Christ
The resurrection of Jesus Christ started. A new reign. A reign of Jesus Christ through his church.
Romans 5:17, Acts 13:38, Philippians 2:9
Jesus is raised from the dead and is given a name above every other name. His reign began.
Ephesians 1:19
Jesus gave us the power of attorney to exercise authority in his name. His name has power in all 3 domains. Hell death and earth</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as Jesus name is reigning, it&#x27;s impossible for the Antichrist to rule. You would have to revoke His authority for that to happen.</p>
<p>Christ reigns through the church from the resurrection till He return for the saints.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>The reign of the Trio (Satan, death and the Antichrist)
They have seven years in which to exercise this reign and that is After the fourth Reign.
They will particularly have the second part of the 7 years (three and half years)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reign of Christ.
Christ returns to reign for 1000 years by himself, together with his church
He begins from the Armageddon till the Judgement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>He leaves for the Judgement at the end of the 1000 years, and after the 1000 years, He reigns again
He reigns supreme in the New earth.
That&#x27;s the 7th Reign.</p>
<p>Serve the Lord with gladness with all your heart. And when you pray, cast out devils. Tell the devil &#x27;it is not your time&#x27;.</p>

<p>(Experience God’s Lifting And Promotion Daily)</p>
<p>“For not from the east nor from the west nor from the south come promotion and lifting up. But God is the Judge! He puts down one and lifts up another.” - Psalm 75:6-7 AMPC</p>
<p>The Lord delights in taking His children from one level to a higher level in every aspect of their lives. He detests unproductivity and retrogression; that’s why He always wants you to flourish, make progress and move forward in life. The Bible says, “The path of the just is like the shining sun, that shines ever brighter unto the perfect day” (Proverbs 4:18). The exciting thing about this promotion from the Lord is that it defies all human logic and awes the natural mind.</p>
<p>As a child of God, understand that God’s grace is upon you and that grace is your power for promotion. You’ve been born into the “forward and upward” life; you ought to keep experiencing supernatural promotions in every area of your life. Do you remember Joseph? Though he was sold into Egypt as a slave, lied against by Potiphar’s wife and eventually imprisoned in Pharaoh’s dungeon, yet that grace (the power of promotion) working in him moved him from the prison house to being the Prime Minister of Egypt (Genesis 41:39-40).</p>
<p>So you see, every day is an opportunity for you to experience promotion, and the Lord wants you to apprehend that new and higher level that He has prepared for you! There’s room for you at the top, so go for it! He can even use unfavourable situations, which ordinarily should have led to your disadvantage as the very means for your promotion because you’re His favoured child. Humble yourself; be diligent in all that you do, and by the Spirit of God, you’ll keep experiencing supernatural promotion.</p>
<p>Say these with me, &#x27;Dear Father, I thank you for the power of promotion that’s at work in me, which causes me to rise higher and higher every day in every area of my life. I experience only the “upward and forward” movement in my life, heaping success upon success, in the Name of Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p>There is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24).</p>
<p>We all have friends, relatives and loved ones—people we relate with, talk with, share with, pray with and whose company we enjoy. Whereas it’s possible for your friends or loved ones to disappoint you or let you down in your hour of need, there’s ONE who never gives up on you. He never fails or disappoints those who trust in Him; His Name is Jesus! What you need is to develop a personal relationship with Him—an intimacy.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that you don’t need to look for Him; He lives in you through the Holy Spirit! Before He ascended, He said, “I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you” (John 14:18). In the preceding verses 16 and 17, He said, “And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.” So today, you fellowship with Jesus by fellowshipping with the Holy Spirit and with the Word.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit takes the place of the absent Jesus and fosters the extraordinary oneness and communion we have with divinity. You can talk with Him, and He’ll talk to you. He can talk to you inside you, and also talk to you from the outside! He’s the dearest friend you could ever have, and He has the wisdom and ability to guide and lead you triumphantly every day.</p>
<p>He’ll go any length to help you. He already proved it through His death for you on the cross. He never condemns you. Rather, He plucks you out of trouble without laying blames on you, irrespective of the cause. He said, “I am with you always, even unto the end of the world” (Matthew 28:20). What a friend we have in Him! I love Him so much!</p>

<p>Thoughts are powerful, they are pictures of the mind that have constructive or destructive possibilities, they affect your emotions. Thoughts are sometimes imaginations, but they are more than imaginations, because imaginations are only pictures that come to you, but thoughts are created by you they are deliberate. They may be holding you in bondage or you may be experiencing glorious liberty as a result of your thoughts.</p>
<p>Until you change a man’s thinking you cannot change his state and therefore cannot change his estate. The quickest way to affect your thought is pictures, that is sight, that means you have to see something.</p>
<p>God said to Abraham you will have a son but he couldn’t believe God, neither did sarah. Then God asked Abraham to look at the stars if he can count them, he wanted to help him see, he wasn’t really concerned about the number of the stars, and for the first time Abraham believed, then God changed his name from Abram to Abraham. God had to change his thinking.</p>
<p>Abram meant exalted father or assumed father, one taken to be a father. Abraham means father of many.</p>
<p>Josh.6.2 – And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour. It’s whether you can see it, if he didn’t see, he wouldn’t have possessed it. You see with the power of your mind, your thoughts, your imagination. The extent of your vision is the boundary of your blessing, how far your vision can go is how much you can possess.</p>
<p>How far can you see? What are your thoughts saying? Maybe the doctor had said something about your health and all you see is death, what can you see? the Lord cant do nothing for you until you see it. That’s why he gave you a mind so you can think.</p>
<p>Everything here came from the minds of men, Thomas Edison tried many times until he succeeded. Every time he failed he said he found one more way in which it will not work, and one step closer to the one that will work.</p>
<p>Don’t let your mind go everywhere, you choose the thought you accept. when a farmer lets wheats grow with weeds, the weeds will destroy the corn, don ’t let every thought come in, you choose the thoughts to accept.</p>
<p>The thought you choose to allow are the thoughts that will affect you. Choose the way your thoughts must go. As a man thinks in his heart so is he, your life goes in the direction of your thoughts.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what comes your way, or how it happened, you can make a choice not to remain in that situation.
Refuse to be limited by the knowledge of others. Some years ago malaria was known as a killer disease until they found out there was a cure.</p>
<p>The question for you is, is there a cure for cancer? you are the one to decide, whether or not they have a cure. Saul had never heard anyone talk like David. David had a different kind of talk. David said you come against me with a sword but i come against you in the name of the lord.</p>
<p>When Goliath came towards David, David ran towards him. When david released the first blow Goliath was on the floor. That’s what can happen to that cancer. What do you see?</p>
<p>Sometimes you see what you don’t want to see, change your mind, change your thoughts. if you have to talk out, say I reject this thought in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>Can you see your situation changing? your thoughts can hold you in bondage. You keep asking how, that’s what your problem is. Do you think God doesn’t know how? You don’t know who he is. The struggle for faith.</p>
<p>That is the stage where your faith is trained, tested and strengthened. you are trying to believe, you are hoping it’s going to work. Often this is where believing and faith collides. But if it didn’t work it was not faith. Sometimes you think you had faith but it wasn’t faith.</p>
<p>Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Faith is the title deed, its proof. If I had faith for something it means i have proof for something.</p>

<p>And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever (Genesis 13:14-15).</p>
<p>When the Lord told Abraham to lift up his eyes and look, in the scripture above, He wasn’t referring to the man’s physical eyes, but to the eyes of his spirit. God told him all the land he could “see” was his; it was now up to Abraham to decide how far he wanted to see. Being a man of faith, he looked from his spirit and saw the whole world. The Bible says “For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith” (Romans 4:13). Abraham became the heir of the whole world by faith.</p>
<p>Now, that’s not the end of the story. The Bible says “SO THEN THEY WHICH BE OF FAITH ARE BLESSED WITH FAITHFUL ABRAHAM” (Galatians 3:9). You’re as much the heir of the world as Abraham: “And if ye be Christ’s then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise” (Galatians 3:29). No wonder the Bible declares that God has given you everything you require for life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3). However, it’s that which you’ve taken possession of by faith, that which your spirit has embraced, that you can enjoy. So it’s up to you! As far as your eyes can see, that’s what the Lord has given to you for an inheritance.</p>
<p>The question then is, “What do you see?” Concerning the remaining days of the year, for example, what do you see? Can you see yourself making progress? Can you see yourself walking in health, prosperity, joy and peace? You’ve got to see it, for that’s the key. See yourself walking in the wonderful blessings of God.</p>
<p>As you fellowship with the Spirit and the Word, see yourself making unprecedented progress in every area of your life. See God taking you from glory to glory. Perhaps you’ve been praying and asking the Lord for a child, see that child with your spirit first. Whatever you’ve taken possession of from within, will certainly manifest in the physical.</p>
<p>Start practising how to see from your spirit, for your spirit is where the light of God is. God doesn’t function in the realm of the mind or senses. If you’re going to enjoy all the wonderful benefits of salvation God has in store for you, then you’ve got to see with the eyes of faith and speak forth what you see.</p>
<p>Say these with me, &#x27;I declare that I’m living in divine health, absolute prosperity, unending success, abundant joy and indescribable peace today. As I look into the coming year with my eyes of faith, I see myself walking in the glory of God and experiencing unprecedented progress and success, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.&#x27;</p>

<p>Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee (Isaiah 60:1-2).</p>
<p>When, as a Christian, it seems like you’re under pressure at work, or there’s an unpleasant doctor’s report regarding your health, or your bank account is in red, don’t cry; don’t complain. Don’t fret or become despondent. Rather, get into your closet, and contemplate the glory of God. If it’s a financial challenge, declare that you’re the seed of Abraham. Abraham’s seed can’t be broke or poor! You’re the possessor of all things, because you’re an heir of God, and a joint-heir with Christ.</p>
<p>Times of challenges aren’t times for you to run helter-skelter, seeking help from man, no; trust in the Lord! He’s your help. If you have a financial need for example, declare, “I have all the money I require in the Name of Jesus; it comes to me by free course.” Make the declaration with faith, boldness and confidence, and it’ll be according to your word! Let nothing make you fret.</p>
<p>You’re called to manifest the glory of God. Despite the darkness and hardship in today’s world, you’re more than a conqueror. You’re a victor in Christ Jesus. You can never be disadvantaged. Christ in you is the hope of glory. Visualize yourself in the glory. Visualize yourself walking in the glory, carrying and manifesting the glory of God in your academics, in your job, health, family, finances, etc. Visualize the glory in your life.</p>
<p>The Bible talks about the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow (1 Peter 1:11). Right after the sufferings of Christ, a life of glory ensued! He suffered so that you’d live in the glory. Therefore, live and walk in the light of your righteousness, victory, success, dominion, health and prosperity in Christ Jesus, and say “no” to defeat, failure, weakness and the down-life.</p>

<p>Don’t be quick-tempered, for anger is the friend of fools (Ecclesiastes 7:9 NLT).</p>
<p>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai and saw the people worshipping a golden calf, which they had constructed by themselves, he was enraged. Right there, he smashed to pieces the tablets of the law engraved by the finger of God (Exodus 32:19). Moses had to engrave another one all by himself, as a punishment.</p>
<p>On another occasion, as the children of Israel sojourned in the wilderness, they suddenly ganged up against Moses and Aaron because there was no water for them to drink. The Lord then instructed Moses to assemble the congregation, and tell the rock before their eyes to bring forth water for them to drink.</p>
<p>Moses, obviously angry at the people’s outburst, charged and rebuked them, tagging them rebels! In a fit of rage, he turned and struck the rock instead of speaking to it as the Lord had instructed; in fact, he struck it twice (Numbers 20:11). Water came out for the people to drink, but Moses’ action displeased the Lord.</p>
<p>In as much as Moses was referred to as “very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth” (Numbers 12:3), he allowed anger affect his ministry and walk with God, such that he wasn’t allowed to lead the children of Israel into the Promised Land as the Lord had intended. He certainly was faithful in the administration of all God’s house (Hebrews 3:5), but anger was his undoing.</p>
<p>Anger is a quick destroyer. Don’t even try to “tame” it; eschew it. If you’ve been termed or described as someone who’s quick to get angry, get before the Lord in prayer, and give yourself to the Word in meditation.</p>
<p>There’re people who won’t fulfil their calling, as it has happened in history, because of anger. And in such cases, what God does is to have another plan. Don’t let it happen to you. Why should anyone miss out with God, and fail in their divine destiny, because of a negative attitude that could easily be controlled and overturned with God’s Word? Psalm 37:8 (NIV) says, “Refrain from anger and turn from wrath” Act on God’s Word. Refuse to let anger rule you.</p>
<p>Say these with me, ‘Dear Father, I delight myself in your Word and to do your will. Your Word is in my heart, causing me to walk in righteousness and fulfil my destiny in you. I’ll not give myself to anger, rage or fury, for my desire is to please you in all things, as I live by your Word, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church&quot; (EPHESIANS 5:29)</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, in John 10:11 &amp; 14 said, &quot;I am the good shepherd&quot; The Greek word for &quot;shepherd&quot; is &quot;poimēn&quot; and it means &quot;Pastor&quot;; one that&#x27;s called of God to nourish, carefully protect and cherish the flock. This is what Jesus does to the Church; He nourishes and cherishes it. The Apostle Paul implied this in his Spirit-inspired admonition in our theme verse.</p>
<p>How does the Lord nourish the Church? He does it through the ministry of the Word! It brings to mind something the Lord said to me while in prayer many years ago. He said, &quot;Feed my sheep.&quot; While I was still pondering on the statement, He said it again. At this time, tears flowed freely down my eyes, because I knew what He meant. He wanted me to teach the Word; and I&#x27;ve been at it ever since.</p>
<p>What the Lord said to me back then parallels His encounter with Peter in John 21:17. After asking Peter three consecutive times, &quot;Do you love me?&quot; and Peter answered in the affirmative, He said to him, &quot;Feed my sheep.&quot; He was telling Peter to feed them with the Word. The Word is food for the spirit, and anyone who dares to believe and receive the Word is nourished, built up, and sustained in the victorious life. In Acts 20:32, the Spirit writes, &quot;And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.&quot;</p>
<p>The Church is very important to the Lord. The Bible says, &quot;we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones&quot; (Ephesians 5:30). We&#x27;re one with Him. And through the ministry of the Word, He sustains, energizes, strengthens and prepares us for His soon return: &quot;That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish&quot; (Ephesians 5:26-27).</p>
<p>Even now, the Lord is nourishing you as you study this devotional. He&#x27;s doing something to your spirit; He&#x27;s invigorating and vitalizing you through and through, because He cherishes you. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it (LUKE 9:24)</p>
<p>A certain man advised his son who was a Christian against being too active for Jesus Christ. He was concerned that the son could lose his life for serving Jesus Christ and preaching the Gospel. But the son replied, “Dad, I’m only doing what Jesus said I should do; I’m serving Him with my life.”</p>
<p>The man was offended and said with acerbity, “You’re doing what Jesus said you should do? That’s why He died young; at thirty-three! They killed Him!” Like that man, there’re many who neither understand Christ’s purpose, nor the meaning of life. It’s not how long you live; it’s about the life you live.</p>
<p>The truth is, for such people, the issue really isn’t that they want to live long or want their loved ones to live long. If that were the case, God promised them eternity; their real problem is the fear of death.</p>
<p>As long as the fear of death dominates a man, he can’t live to his best potentials; he can’t fulfil his calling in life. He’ll say and do things he really doesn’t believe, all in a bid to save his life. But we read in our opening verse, “whosoever will save his life shall lose it” Live your life for Christ unreservedly! You’ve got to be able so say, “Come what may, I stand for Jesus Christ and His Kingdom! I’ll preach the Gospel, no matter what!”</p>
<p>Remember what He said in Luke 10:19, “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.” As you go about preaching the Gospel, especially in these last days, be fearless, for the Lord Himself is your defence. Even now, He’s saying to you the very same words He said to the Apostle Paul in Acts 18:10, “For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.”</p>

<p>“Be careful how you act; these are difficult days. Don&#x27;t be fools; be wise: make the most of every opportunity you have for doing good.” Ephesians 5:15-16 TLB</p>
<p>Time is God&#x27;s gift to you and a fixed asset, which you must learn to invest wisely. It&#x27;s only twenty-four hours in each day, so you&#x27;ve got to prioritise all you do. Investing your time wisely means investing your time in spiritual things. As a Christian, the Word of God must be the topmost priority to you; therefore, you must find or create time out of your day to fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p>Moses said in Psalm 90:12, “Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.” Here, he was talking about scheduling. You need to create the time to study the Word and schedule your prayer times because your future depends on it. When you wake up in the morning, don&#x27;t just roll off your bed and go blindly about your day. Spend quality time first to fellowship with the Holy Spirit in prayer and in the Word.</p>
<p>Ask Him to guide you as you schedule your activities for the day and prioritise your activities. Ask Him to help you save time, and you&#x27;d discover how much you&#x27;re able to accomplish for the Kingdom daily. Then, you&#x27;ll become more productive, effective and progressive. Choose always to be spiritually alert so that when you are faced with a difficult situation, it&#x27;ll meet you well prepared, and you&#x27;ll know what to do. Remember that life&#x27;s got no extra time, so make everyday count by doing only those things that will advance the Kingdom of God and improve your life.</p>
<p>DECLARATION
Dear Father, I thank you for the guidance of your Spirit in my life, and the wisdom that you impart to me every day. I&#x27;m continually surrendered to the Lordship of your Word. Thus, my steps are ordered in victory, success, and excellence, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Did you know that as a Christian, you’re actually born of God? The Bible says in 1 John 4:4, “Ye are of God, little children”; meaning that your origin is in God; you’re born of Him; you came from Him. No wonder John exclaimed, “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world” (1 John 5:4).</p>
<p>The Christian isn’t an ordinary person; he’s a partaker of the divine nature. I would to God that every Christian understood what that means! It means you’re in God’s class of being; you belong to a heavenly pantheon; you’re an associate of the God-kind. So, when we say we’re more than conquerors, this is what it’s about; we’re not merely quoting scriptures. As He (Jesus) is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17); meaning that as He’s divine, so are we divine.</p>
<p>He said in John 5:26, “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.” Then 1 John 5:11-12 says, “And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life.” We have the same life with Him; it’s the divine life; it’s what makes us absolutely indestructible.</p>
<p>When we say a Christian ought not to be sick, it’s premised on this reality. Divine health is your nature, not a hope or promise from God, because you’re born of God’s incorruptible seed—His Word (1 Peter 1:23). Therefore, the life in you can’t be corrupted by sickness, disease or death. Refuse to accept that it’s “normal” or okay for a Christian to be sick; it’s not.</p>
<p>In Mark 16:17-18, the Lord Jesus, referring to the Christian, said, “if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them” You’re not among those that can be “infected” by anything. Jesus said so, and if He did, then it’s an absolute reality. No infection should thrive in your body.</p>
<p>Meditate on this truth until it gains the ascendancy in your spirit and becomes your experience. Refuse to accommodate anything that’s inconsistent with you.</p>

<p>God’s Word comes to you with the power to produce in you the message it bears. His Word never comes empty; howbeit, you must receive it in faith and respond accordingly. That was what Mary did when the angel of the Lord brought her the message from God that she would give birth to the Saviour, Jesus. She said, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word” (Luke 1:38).</p>
<p>She trusted the message; she believed it and responded in agreement, and it worked. That’s how you respond to God. The Bible says, “He hath said…so that we may boldly say” (Hebrews 13:5-6). Your faith-response is what you say as a result of God’s Word that comes to you. God didn’t give us His Word just so we can believe it, but most essentially, that we can respond to it. So, you can make your personal faith-proclamations on the basis of His Word. It’s the affirmation of it that produces results.</p>
<p>For example, the Word says, “Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:27). Your faith-response, therefore, should be, “Christ is in me; therefore, in my ministry, in my health, in my finances, in my family, job, business, academics, and in all that concerns me, the glory of God is manifest! I walk in the excellence and glory of Christ; there’s no reproach in my life!”</p>
<p>Psalm 23:4 says, “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me” Your faith-response should be, “No matter the evil or adversities, I triumph over them, because greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world.” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Make the Word effectual in your life, with your faith-response.</p>

<p>So many around the world today didn’t seem to have any problem with their health until they went for a check-up. The doctor said they had diabetes, and immediately, that information changed their lives; their sufferings began. They were in good health, until they got the doctor’s report. But you see, the medical data tells the fact, but God tells the truth.</p>
<p>God’s truth about your health is, “If Christ be in you, though your body may be ravaged by sickness or disease, the Holy Spirit, who perambulates your body, inundates it with divine life, ridding you of every infirmity.” Understand who you are: you’re born of God; you’re a new creation in Christ! The life in you is the very life of God; it’s not the kind that gets sick; it’s called “the imperishable life”; it’s incorruptible.</p>
<p>Even if you were born with a blood or heart condition, it’s all passed away, because the Bible says, “if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. And all things are of God” (2 Corinthians 5:17-18). The old life or nature that could be sick has been supplanted by the life of God. Moreover, the Bible says, “Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses” (Matthew 8:17); Jesus did! He already took all sicknesses and infirmities away from you; therefore, enjoy divine health.</p>
<p>Don’t say you have diabetes; you can’t have it, because it’s not from God. As a new creation, everything in you, everything about your life, is new, and from God; we read it in 2 Corinthians 5:17-18. James 1:17 says, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights.” Then we read in our theme scripture, “A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.” Sickness, disease, failure, lack, and weakness are not from God; they don’t come from heaven; so, don’t accept them.</p>
<p>The things that are from God are pure, perfect, and are of divine wisdom. If it hurts, binds or has darkness in it, it’s not from God; reject it in the Name of Jesus. Accept and endorse in your life only that which is consistent with the provisions of the Gospel and perfect will of God for you.</p>

<p>(Trust In God&#x27;s Faithfulness) ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome~6852</p>
<p>&quot;Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for is faithful that promised;)&quot; (Hebrews 10:23 KJV).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, reflecting on the crises of these last days, warned that, &quot;Because lawlessness is increased, most people&#x27;s love will grow cold&quot; (Matthew 24:12 NASB). Indeed, many are beginning to lose hope, wondering if God still cares and protects. Of course, He still cares for and protects His children! Psalm 91:3-8 attests to God&#x27;s sovereign commitment to protect and take care of you---even amid all the troubles and crises in the world!</p>
<p>It says, &quot;Surely he shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence. He shall cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you shall take refuge; his truth shall be your shield and buckler. You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day, nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday. A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you. Only with your eyes shall you look, and see the reward of the wicked.&quot; How comforting this is!</p>
<p>Trust His Word. You&#x27;re shielded and divinely protected against the fierce attacks of the enemy, whether at night or in the day. Your faith-response, therefore, should be, &quot;The Lord is in me, with me, and for me; therefore, I refuse to fear!&quot; No matter how adverse or severe the situation or the circumstances around you might be, refuse to let your heart be troubled!</p>
<p>Keep your focus on God&#x27;s Word. He said in Isaiah 43:2, &quot;When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame scorch you.&quot; Trust and hold on to His Word, for in it is your safety.</p>

<p>Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (PHILIPPIANS 3:13-14).</p>
<p>Consider a classroom of students studying the same course. Among them, some are reading very hard, so they don’t fail the exams. Perhaps they had failed in some previous exams. Then you have these other students who are reading very hard as well, because they want to have excellent grades. They want to win a prize.</p>
<p>Though all these students are reading hard, their motivations are different. And this is how it is in life. That someone is working so hard doesn’t mean he’s in the right direction. It all depends on what his inspiration is. You should always be inspired by the dream of success, and not the fear of failure. Refuse to be haunted by past mistakes; rather, be challenged by the opportunity of a greater future. Many whine and grumble about their past, sorrowing about their past, wondering what to do about their past, instead of looking at the future with the hope and the opportunities it presents for greater success.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the challenges or shortcomings experienced in the past, be inspired by the joy of winning. See the bright and glorious future ahead. Get into the New Year with this mind-set. Paul said, “this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize” Don’t think failure. Don’t think defeat. Launch out into the year with the power of the Spirit, seeing only victories and endless possibilities.</p>
<p>You’re born to win; and the Lord is leading you on a victory parade. Forget the past; take a hold of your future, and win!</p>
<p>🗣️CONFESSION: Dear Lord, you’ve equipped me with strength. You made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights. You’re the strength and glory of my life! In you I live, and move and have my being. I’m triumphant today and always by your Spirit. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones&quot; (EPHESIANS 5:30)</p>
<p>There&#x27;re some who see the Church as a Gentle nation that got some &quot;second-class&quot; salvation from God. Those who hold such erroneous beliefs about the Church don&#x27;t understand the mystery of the Church.</p>
<p>The reason some people don&#x27;t understand the Gospel of Jesus Christ about the Church is that the Old Testament, which is what they hold on to, doesn&#x27;t explain the revelation of the Church. It was a mystery; it wasn&#x27;t revealed to the Old Testament prophets. So, the experts in Judaism don&#x27;t know anything about the Church, even though the prophets testified of salvation of Gentiles. To learn about the Church, you&#x27;d have to study from the gospels (from the words of Jesus Himself) and then into the epistles where the revelation of the Church as the Body of Christ was unveiled.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:16-17 says, &quot;And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby: And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.&quot; In other words, God preached peace and reconciliation to both the Jews and the Gentiles and brought them together in one body called the Church! It&#x27;s a new body made up of people from among the two groups: Jews and Gentiles. However, to be in this body, you must be born again, whether you&#x27;re a Jew or you&#x27;re a Gentile.</p>
<p>Neither of the two groups is inferior to the other. Our opening verse says, &quot;For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.&quot; It doesn&#x27;t get closer than that! The Church is His body. And when He said, &quot;I will build my church.&quot; (Matthew 16:18), He was talking about the body of Christ, and that&#x27;s you and me, all our brothers and sisters around the world; we&#x27;re the expressions of His reality, of His fullness, His grace, glory, kingdom, power and personality. We&#x27;re His body! Glory to God!</p>

<p>&quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&quot; (John 1:1).</p>
<p>As a Christian, it&#x27;s so important that you have an understanding of the Word. That understanding will help you have a concept of the Scriptures in a way that&#x27;s far beyond the generic; your approach to the Word will be different. This is important, because except and unless you understand the Word, you won&#x27;t know how to apply it to your life and situations.</p>
<p>The Word is Himself, God. That&#x27;s what we read in our opening text. When He speaks to you, He becomes to you and in you what He says. Every time you study it, you feed your spirit and you&#x27;re able to live the life of the Word. Then you discover that your Christian life every day is full of joy and excitement.</p>
<p>As you prepare your goals for the coming year, make studying the Word, devoting quality time to search and meditate on the Scriptures a top priority. This will cause you to be enlightened, informed, refreshed, strengthened and graced for greater effectiveness in your work and ministry, and all that the Lord would have you do in the coming year and beyond. You&#x27;d find yourself walking in the path that He&#x27;s chosen for you before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Remember that your life has a purpose, and the purpose of God for you is revealed and becomes clearer as you fellowship with the Word and the Spirit. He&#x27;ll grant you insight through the Scriptures. He&#x27;ll bring your thoughts to something that He wants you to know now, that you can apply to your life. Then, His wisdom will leap out of the message and inundate your heart, and you find that you&#x27;re walking the path of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace (Ephesians 1:7).</p>
<p>Reading the scripture above without some indepth study, one might conclude that what we have in Christ is “forgiveness,” because of the way the King James renders it. But in reality, what we have in Christ completely transcends that.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a pardon; the remission of judgment. When you’re “forgiven,” it means you’re not going to be punished for the offence, but you’re still a recorded offender. But in Christ, our sins aren’t merely forgiven, but remitted. The Greek word is “aphesis”; the complete blotting away or removal of sins according to the riches of His grace.</p>
<p>In Christ, the error itself is removed; you’ll not be judged, not because you’ve been pardoned, but because the sin doesn’t exist! So, if a Christian does something wrong, and says, “I can’t just forgive myself,” that means he doesn’t really believe in Jesus and His vicarious death. He died on account of our sins. He’s not just asking you to forgive yourself, He’s telling you that He’s greater than you and He’s the Judge, and that your sins are remitted.</p>
<p>If you believe that He’s the ultimate Judge, and that He’s not holding your sins against you, why should you feel so frustrated because of your errors? Don’t be like those who are saddened by their past mistakes whenever they want to pray. They remember something wrong they had done and allow it to dissipate their faith. Some, as a result of the errors they made, have gone into severe depression. Some others have succumbed to suicidal thoughts, unable to face the shame and possible humiliation. But that’s so wrong!</p>
<p>Yes, you did something wrong; you messed things up, but don’t let it dominate you. Jesus took responsibility for your wrongs; He paid the price already. Refuse to allow the failures and mistakes of yesterday keep you in bondage.</p>
<p>The power of sin to ruin you has been removed, because the Bible says sin shall not have dominion over you (Romans 6:14). When Satan reminds you of your sin, you ought to remind him of the death of Jesus on the Cross, through which you have remission—complete blotting away of sin. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us (EPHESIANS 3:20).</p>
<p>The Lord is more committed to your prosperity and progress than you could ever be. No matter the thoughts and desire you have for success, God sure has better thoughts and plans for your success. It brings to mind what the Spirit revealed through the prophet Jeremiah: “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end” (Jeremiah 29:11).</p>
<p>Can you see that? It means that His thoughts towards you are always good; there’s no single thought of evil, sickness, poverty or negativity in His mind toward you. Think about it! Some people have lived with the erroneous belief that God is mad at them, and His disposition towards them is dependent on how good, nice or well-behaved they’ve been, but that’s not true. First, you need to understand that God is love (1 John 4:8,16). Secondly, He is goodness personified.</p>
<p>Luke’s submission in Acts 10:38 gives us an idea of His nature and disposition; His plans and purpose towards His people. It says, “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.” Let this be your meditation; ponder deeply on the Father’s love and affectionate disposition towards you. He said in 3 John 1:2, “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”</p>
<p>Appreciate the Father’s love for you. He loves you more than you could possibly imagine; He loves you more than you love yourself, and he’s more desirous and passionate about your success than you could ever be. He seeks your good all the time. Oh! how gracious and loving He is!</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I’m grateful for your love, and acknowledge your glory in my life. There’s none like you, blessed Father. You’ve made my heart your dwelling place, and beautified me with your righteousness. Your goodness, mercy, and grace follow me all the days of my life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27).</p>
<p>There’re too many of God’s children who are still looking up to God for one blessing or the other. They’re looking up to God to heal them, to touch them, to provide for them, to answer their prayers. But the truth is, there’s no other blessing that’ll come to you from heaven until the second coming of the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>There’s no prayer that the answer will come to you from heaven. Everything you’d ever need in life is in Christ, and Christ is in you, and to have Christ is to have everything. Colossians 1:27 says, “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” Have you been desiring or expecting to see the glory of God revealed in your finances, your health, business, or family? The glory has already been revealed. That’s the meaning and reason for Christmas; that’s why we’re so full of joy that Christ was born into this world, to live in our hearts.</p>
<p>Christ in you is your assurance of divine health, prosperity, success, victory and dominion. Hallelujah! What you need is to discover Christ in you. If Christ isn’t in a man, then his sufferings are justified; his pains are “excusable.” But not so with you; you’ve been brought into the “glory life.”</p>
<p>This Christ-consciousness will inspire an extraordinary boldness in your life. It’ll cause you to live every day, exuding joy indescribable, and full of glory. When you discover Christ in you, there’ll be no place for any disease in your body; that’ll be the end of darkness and lack. Glory to God!</p>
<p>The revelation of Christianity is Christ IN YOU; not in heaven. Don’t start fasting and asking Him to pour something out from heaven; don’t ask Him to give you a blessing from heaven. He’s blessed you already with Himself; with all the blessings that are in Christ (Ephesians 1:3). Consciously take some time today to meditate on Christ: who He is, who you are in Him, and all that He’s accomplished for you. It’ll transform your life. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>CONFESSION
What a privilege it is to be a member of His body, of His flesh and of His bones! Christ in me, the hope of glory! I’ve been granted the grace and ability in Christ to reign and rule over all circumstances! I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Christ in me is my assurance of a life of continuous victory and unending success. Blessed be God!</p>

<p>If as a Christian, you find that you&#x27;re always crying and begging God in prayer for your needs, you&#x27;re not living in the Name of Jesus. We don&#x27;t beg in His Name. Don&#x27;t beg Him for your health or for anything. It&#x27;s a slap on His face. It&#x27;s like a child begging a responsible father for breakfast or dinner. He loves you more than that.</p>
<p>Do you think God doesn&#x27;t know that you have that pain in your body? You think He doesn&#x27;t know that you&#x27;ve been experiencing migraine headaches? Or that you&#x27;re behind in your bills? He&#x27;s aware. But He wants you to change things! You have a weapon, an instrument, the Name of Jesus! Use it to effect a change in your body, in your finances, and any other area of your life. You can tell yourself, &quot;I&#x27;m not going into 2021 in this condition or situation; I demand and effect a change, in the Name of Jesus!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wake up and be who I&#x27;ve made you; realise the power in my Name and use it to make your life ever-glorious!&quot; That&#x27;s what the Lord is saying to you, even now! Get rid of the pain and come out of that distressing situation. In His Name, you have a right to refuse anything that&#x27;s not of God in your life. Every sickness, disease and circumstance bows to that name.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what troubles you; you don&#x27;t need to cry for help; speak forth words in His Name, and you&#x27;ll be amazed at how quickly things will turn around in your favour. Practise using that Name, and build your faith on it through the Word. It&#x27;s a lifestyle. You&#x27;ve got to grow in it. It&#x27;s an environment to live in. Use it for every area of your life. That&#x27;s what the Bible tells us: &quot;And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, DO ALL IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS, giving thanks to God and the Father by him&quot; (Colossians 3:17).

<p>Sometimes as Christians, we miss God’s order of things. God is a God of order, and order gives meaning to things. For example, all around the world, people tend to confuse the order and say, “fasting and prayer,” instead of “prayer and fasting.” Prayer comes before fasting in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>Not understanding the right order may account for the reason many people fast without praying, which is largely a waste of time and effort. The emphasis should be on praying. It’s a call to prayer, and because you’re praying, you’re consciously staying away from eating. The fast is on, because you’re praying, not because you’re not eating.</p>
<p>Acts 13:2 says, “As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said” Notice the order: they ministered to the Lord and fasted. How do you minister to the Lord? It’s in worship, prayer, praise and thanksgiving. The focus was on ministering to the Lord, and because of this, they fasted. Then the Lord spoke to them after they had prayed.</p>
<p>The New Year is just around the corner, and in preparing for it, you must spend time to pray and fast. Pick the days, or if such days have already been designated in your group or in your local church, be sure to participate fully, bearing in mind the purpose of the fast: praying; ministering to the Lord.</p>
<p>Some people occupy themselves with various irrelevant activities during prayer and fasting, so they don’t feel the hunger until it’s time to break the fast, no; it’s not that way. Aside from praying, the only activities you should indulge in and encourage are such that would further inspire you to pray, such as studying and meditating on the Word.</p>
<p>Take your Bible and some Christian books to read, and messages to listen to or watch on your devices. Put the TV off, and cast the newspapers and magazines aside. Possibly, put off your phone or turn off the network; you don’t need any distraction.</p>
<p>If you desire specific outstanding results in the coming year that only the anointing can produce, you need to do this: Spend quality time to speak in tongues and position yourself for achievements and significant exploits, not just in the coming year, but in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Say these with me, Blessed Lord, I thank you for all that you’ve prepared for me in the coming year. My spiritual antenna is raised to hear and receive your instructions, guidance, and wisdom that’ll propel me in the path of greatness that you’ve ordained for me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>
<p>Daniel 9:3-5 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes: 4 And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments; 5 We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:</p>

<p>&quot;Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance and in everything, by prayer and petition (definite requests), with thanksgiving, continue to make your wants known to God&quot; (PHILIPPIANS 4:6 AMPC)</p>
<p>One of the challenges that many have with prayer is the lack of focus. When you pray, you must have focus. David, in one of his prayers, said to the Lord, &quot;Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: UNITE MY HEART to fear thy name&quot; (Psalm 86:11).</p>
<p>Notice the underlined expression! The New International Version puts it this way: &quot;give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.&quot; So, in prayer, focus your attention on the Lord, and be conscious of what you&#x27;re praying about. Some people pray about many things, and a moment later, they don&#x27;t remember what they prayed about. If you don&#x27;t remember what you prayed about, how would you know when God answers?</p>
<p>You have to learn to keep record of what you say to the Lord in prayer; be specific. If there&#x27;re things you&#x27;re concerned about that you&#x27;d like to pray about, write them or make a mental note of them when you pray. Then as you pray, receive.</p>
<p>What God wants is that you express your faith in specific terms. Faith makes you a possessor. When you have made your definite request of the Lord, rejoice and give Him glory, knowing it&#x27;s done.
&quot;Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, BELIEVE that ye receive them, and ye shall have them&quot; (Mark 11:24).</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-obedience--pastor-chris-oyakhilome7122">THE POWER OF OBEDIENCE ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~7122<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to THE POWER OF OBEDIENCE ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~7122" title="Direct link to THE POWER OF OBEDIENCE ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~7122" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#the-power-of-obedience--pastor-chris-oyakhilome7122">​</a></h2>
<p>&quot;And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even death on the cross&quot; (PHILIPPIANS 2:8)</p>
<p>God has His structures and systems, and operates by principles, but there are those who always choose their own way. The Bible says there&#x27;s a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death (Proverbs 14:12). It pays to listen to God and follow His ways. Never walk in disobedience.</p>
<p>For example, as a result of Adam&#x27;s disobedience, the Bible tells us &quot;Death ruled like a king&quot; (Romans 5:17 CEV). The Amplified Classic translation puts it this way: &quot;because of one man&#x27;s trespass (lapse, offense) death reigned through that one&quot; Well then, as one man&#x27;s disobedience led to condemnation for all men, so also did Christ&#x27;s act of righteousness lead to eternal life and divine acquittal of all men. Jesus, the second and last Adam, did this by obedience.</p>
<p>We also read in our opening verse that He &quot;being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even death on the cross.&quot; Remember that Jesus is Himself God, but nothing was going to make Him rebellious against the Father. He was going to be obedient unto death, even death on the Cross. God had to respond to the obedience of Jesus: &quot;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name&quot; (Philippians 2:9). He was given the highest title that could be conferred, because of His obedience. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Obedience is a great blessing in the realm of the Spirit. Being born again, you have an obedient spirit; the Bible calls us obedient children (1 Peter 1:14). So, it&#x27;s natural for you to walk in the light of God&#x27;s Word, and be completely yielded to spiritual instructions.</p>

<p>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved (John 3:17).</p>
<p>Imagine that you have friends or relatives who aren’t born again or people who work with you who aren’t born again; don’t let them go to hell! You need to weep and cry for their salvation. In your intercessory prayers, you need to wail and travail for their souls, that the light of the glorious Gospel would shine in their hearts. You need to pray for them knowing the terror that awaits them, until you’re assured of their salvation. Don’t take this lightly.</p>
<p>Think about your uncles and aunts; think about your cousins, your spouse, your children; don’t let them perish without God! Don’t let them go to hell! Do you know what it is to be in the darkest place for eternity, and never have hope of coming out?</p>
<p>Your presence in your home, school, workplace, neighbourhood, estate, city or country isn’t for a game. It isn’t just for you to be happy and celebrate that you’re born again; you must be concerned for the salvation of others. You’re a saviour to your world. You were sent to save others.</p>
<p>You’re on earth and alive to do the Lord’s work; to win more and more people to Jesus Christ. We’ve got to snatch them out of hell; some of them are already so close, and if we don’t rescue them, they’ll slip right into it. We must not let them!</p>
<p>The Lord has committed to us the ministry of reconciliation, and faithfully, we must keep carrying out our ministry, turning men from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</p>
<p>Blessed Father, I thank you for making the Gospel heard and received in my world, and your righteousness established in the hearts of men. Indeed, the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ. The Lord reigns forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p>Matthew 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come. ||</p>
<p>2 Peter 3:8-10 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</p>

<p>&quot;even though we once did estimate Christ from a human viewpoint and as a man, yet now...we know Him no longer [in terms of the flesh]&quot; (2 CORINTHIANS 5:16 AMPC)</p>
<p>When some people say, &quot;I want to be like Jesus,&quot; what they really mean is to be like the &quot;Jewish man&quot; who walked the streets of Galilee and Capernaum. Some even get enthused at discussions about His physical stature: His build, height, physique, looks, etc., losing sight of what&#x27;s more important---His spirituality. Beyond His physicality, you should focus on &quot;Jesus---the Word!&quot;</p>
<p>The limitations of the &quot;physical&quot; Jesus were Jewish. As a Jew, for example, He celebrated Passover, but Passover meant nothing to the non-Jew. Therefore, our focus should be on Jesus the Son of God; God in flesh. See Him in, and through the Word, because He&#x27;s the living Word. The Apostle Paul, at some point, mistakenly thought of Christ as though He were merely an ordinary man of Jewish descent. But then, he realized that even though Jesus walked the earth in a physical frame, and lived as a Jewish man, He wasn&#x27;t ordinary.</p>
<p>Paul&#x27;s focus henceforth was on Jesus---the Word---and he went on to be so successful in his ministry! John 1:14 tells us that God&#x27;s Word was personified, and the result was the man, Christ Jesus: &quot;And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us&quot; So, see Him as the Word-incarnate; see Him as the totality of God&#x27;s thoughts, ideas, opinions, will and emotions tabernacled in human flesh. Focus on Him as God&#x27;s perfect imprint, the icon of the unseen God, just as Hebrews 1:3 reveals.</p>
<p>Moreover, here&#x27;s something quite supreme: as He is the Word made flesh, so are you an offspring of the Word. 1 Peter 1:23 says, &quot;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever&quot; 1 John 4:17 says as He is, so are we in this world. Not as He was, in Galilee, but as He is now, risen in glory, power, strength and excellence, so are you now. You have His righteousness, life, and nature in you NOW. You&#x27;re the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His person. Hallelujah!</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-the-name-of-jesus-is-so-powerful--pastor-chris-oyakhilome7237">Why The Name Of Jesus Is So Powerful ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome~7237<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why The Name Of Jesus Is So Powerful ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome~7237" title="Direct link to Why The Name Of Jesus Is So Powerful ~ Pastor Chris Oyakhilome~7237" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#why-the-name-of-jesus-is-so-powerful--pastor-chris-oyakhilome7237">​</a></h2>
<p>&quot;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth&quot; (Philippians 2:9-10).</p>
<p>When we talk about praying in the Name of Jesus, and using that Name as an instrument, many really don&#x27;t understand it! Why is the Name of Jesus so important? What&#x27;s in a name anyway?</p>
<p>Besides being that word or term that distinguishes a character, a name is a symbol of authority, which means that a name is defined by the character or authority that&#x27;s behind it. The power of the Name Jesus, therefore, isn&#x27;t in the spelling or pronounciation of the name J.E.S.U.S; because all around the world, we all don&#x27;t pronounce the name the same way. Rather, the reason the name is powerful is the one who answers it. The one whom the Name represents was given all authority in heaven and in earth (Matthew 28:18). Jesus Christ is the Name by which all things were created.</p>
<p>John 3:35 says, &quot;The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.&quot; Colossians  1:15-18 testify of Him as the heir of all things: &quot;Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.&quot;</p>
<p>God gave Him pre-eminence---superiority over all things! He is before all things, and by Him, all things consist. That&#x27;s why His Name is so powerful; it&#x27;s not about how the Name sounds; it&#x27;s about who He is. He&#x27;s the greatest of all; highly exalted above the heavens, and His glory above all the earth. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also&quot; (GENESIS 1:16)</p>
<p>We read in our opening verse that God made two great lights, the &quot;greater light&quot; to rule the day and the &quot;lesser light&quot; to rule the night. &quot;Light,&quot; in the Scriptures, symbolizes &quot;truth.&quot; Just as there&#x27;re different kinds of light, there&#x27;re also different kinds of truth revealed to us in the Scriptures, and they don&#x27;t rank equally; there&#x27;re lesser truths and greater truths.</p>
<p>For example, when we say, &quot;God is going to heal you today.&quot; As much as that&#x27;s a truth, it&#x27;s a lesser truth. It&#x27;s wonderful to know that no matter the ailment, you can receive healing, but God&#x27;s best for you is divine health. As you mature in the things of the Spirit, you move from asking for healing to living in divine health.</p>
<p>Deliverance is also a great truth, but living in divine protection is a greater truth. All through the ministry of Jesus, He never needed to be &quot;set free&quot; or &quot;delivered&quot; from the devil or any trouble. There&#x27;s something greater and better than deliverance: it&#x27;s living above and victorious always. Put the Word to work in your life, for the Word is the true light (John 1:9; 17:17). Measure your life&#x27;s experience with the greater truths of God&#x27;s Word. It&#x27;s your responsibility to appropriate that which has already been consummated for you in Christ Jesus, and live the higher life to which you&#x27;ve been called.</p>

<p>&quot;A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgements, and do them&quot; (EZEKIEL 36:26-27)</p>
<p>The Lord spoke in prophecy through the prophet Ezekiel about this extraordinary blessing for the new creation, long before Jesus came to die for us and give us eternal life. He said, &quot;I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgements, and do them.&quot;</p>
<p>It brings to mind what the Spirit of God said through the Apostle Paul in Romans 8:14, &quot;For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.&quot; This refers to the &quot;huios&quot; (Greek) of God, the matured sons of God---those who have come to spiritual manhood. In them, the Word of the Lord is fulfilled: God has put His Spirit within them, and will cause them to walk in His statutes, and they shall keep His judgements and do them. The babe in Christ, that is, the spiritually immature, doesn&#x27;t know the &quot;judgements&quot; of God.</p>
<p>The &quot;judgements&quot; of God refer to His thinking, His mind concerning people, things or events. There&#x27;re certain things in life that you may not readily find scriptures to connect them with in order to ascertain God&#x27;s position on such subjects. However, through the Holy Spirit, you&#x27;re able to understand and interpret the mind of God on such issues and establish His righteousness.</p>
<p>Hebrews 5:14 says, &quot;But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.&quot; The &quot;strong meat&quot; of God&#x27;s Word belongs to those who, through the leading and training of the Spirit, have exercised their spiritual senses to discern and walk in  the perfect will of God. Your desire should be  to glorify Christ in all things, as you establish His righteousness on earth, and fulfil His perfect will for your life. This is spiritual maturity in Christ.</p>

<p>For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body (JAMES 3:2)</p>
<p>The words you speak are a true measure of your spirituality. It makes no difference what others might think or say about you; what matters are the words that come out of your mouth every day, irrespective of who you may be talking to: God, men, yourself, circumstances, or nature. Be sure you always, speak gracious, faith-filled, and spirit-building words. Tame your tongue.</p>
<p>The Apostle James likened the tongue to the rudder of a great ship that the captain uses to navigate the ship aright, irrespective of the fierce winds driving against it (James 3:4-5). This means that with your words, you can keep yourself in health, in faith, in success, and in the transcendent life. Don’t talk fear, lack or your inabilities. Talk the Word! Consciously put the Word on your lips.Isn’t it wonderful that with your tongue, you can disallow sickness, disease, infirmity, and weakness from your body?</p>
<p>Always speak health and strength to your body. Many are sick, weak, broke and suffering today because of their careless talking through the years. Get your tongue under control and have your life under control!
Use your tongue to come out of trouble, depression, sickness, pain, poverty, and frustration.</p>
<p>Today, where you are, and what you are in life, are the result of your words. If the result isn’t such that you’re pleased with, you can consciously begin to chart a new course, and decide what the next five or ten years will be like for you. If the results are already wonderful, you can walk in greater glory and higher levels of success if you use your tongue right.</p>
<p>Jesus said you shall have what you say. Therefore, use your tongue to beautify your life (MARK 11:23). ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSc, DD.</p>

<p>Romans 5:18-19 NIV “Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.”</p>
<p>Under the Old Testament, God’s blessings for the children of Israel were based on their obedience to the Law of Moses. They had to keep every part of that Law just to enjoy the benefits of the covenant God struck with Abraham. However, they couldn’t keep His laws and, as such, couldn’t enjoy the blessings. Thank God Jesus came – He made things different for us today in the New Testament. According to Colossians 1:12, you’ve been made a sharer of the blessings and benefits of the Kingdomlife reserved for all God’s children. This happened the moment you were born again.</p>
<p>You don’t have to try to “obey” the Law for God to bless you today; you were born blessed (Ephesians 1:3). Christ already fulfilled all the Law; you’re the fruit of His obedience: “By one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous” (Romans 5:19). Through the obedience of Christ, God’s gift: His blessing of righteousness was given to you.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the New Testament are you told to “obey God” or to “obey the Law”; rather you’re called His obedient child: “As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance” (1 Peter 1:14 KJV). We’re described as having “obeyed” God’s Word of truth from the heart (Romans 6:17). So our blessings, our inheritance in Christ, aren’t preconditioned on obedience; rather, they are our birthright!</p>

<p>He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light. John 5:35</p>
<p>The verse above is how the Lord Jesus described the man John the Baptist in today&#x27;s opening scripture; he was a burning and shining light. That means everywhere John went, he preached with so much passion and zeal, and people were influenced and changed.</p>
<p>Like John, burn and shine ever more brightly for Jesus this year. Win more souls, and be excellent in all you do. This is how to burn and shine for Jesus.</p>

<p>&quot;And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you&quot; (JOHN 14:16-17)</p>
<p>As a little boy, growing up, I was full of fear. But everything changed when I received the Holy Spirit. All the fears in me were disabled and deleted. He began to teach me the Word of God and I became emboldened.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit gave me utterance, became my teacher and began to guide and instruct me. He began to show me what to do, how to understand the Scriptures, how to interpret the Scriptures. My whole life was transformed. I knew what I was and where I was headed, and how He altered my life and redirected everything.</p>
<p>The same can happen for anybody. The Bible says He&#x27;s no respecter of persons (Acts 10:34); what He does for one, He&#x27;ll do for another under the same circumstance. Even if He&#x27;s never done it for anyone, and you require it, He&#x27;ll make it happen for you. Maybe today you have low expectations in life; maybe everyone has given up on you! It may be at home, or in school, or at your workplace, or among your peers; you&#x27;re the struggling one, and now you&#x27;re wondering, &quot;How can I ever get better? Is there any hope for me?&quot; Yes, there&#x27;s hope in Christ.</p>
<p>No need to struggle. If you&#x27;ve received the Holy Spirit, recognize His presence in you. Learn to have fellowship with Him through the Word and prayer.</p>
<p>Have faith in His ability to make you a success and cause you to fulfil His destiny for your life. Take advantage of His glorious ministry in your life. Pray in tongues always and follow His guidance, and He&#x27;ll make you successful in all things.</p>

<p>O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph (Psalm 47:1).</p>
<p>Our opening verse is talking about the shout of victory. Some people shout out of fear, but in Christianity we shout in victory. We shout unto the Lord with the voice of triumph. It&#x27;s like the shout the children of Israel gave in conquering Jericho. As they journeyed to the Promised Land, they got to Jericho, but the city was shut with thick and imposing walls (Joshua 6:1).</p>
<p>The Lord, however, gave Joshua the strategy to conquer Jericho. It was the &quot;shout strategy&quot;: And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram&#x27;s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall &quot;SHOUT WITH A GREAT SHOUT; AND THE WALL OF THE CITY SHALL FALL DOWN FLAT, AND THE PEOPLE SHALL ASCEND UP EVERY MAN STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM&quot; (Joshua 6:2-5). When the people did as the Lord instructed, the walls came down flat (Joshua 6:20).</p>
<p>Some people don&#x27;t understand it when we shout; it&#x27;s spiritual. The Bible tells us about Jesus, that He shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:&quot; (1 Thessalonians 4:16). It&#x27;s like the kind of shout He gave at the tomb of Lazarus; the Bible says He yelled with a loud voice, &quot;Lazarus, come forth&quot; (John 11:43).</p>
<p>Lazarus, having been dead, and buried for four days, already believed to be putrefying, came out of the grave alive! When we shout in victory, the enemy is discomfited; the dead come back to life. Some people only shout out of fear; and that&#x27;s the wrong shout; ours is the voice of triumph. We shout ahead of the battle; ahead of the challenges; therefore, when they come, they&#x27;re walkovers.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no victory without a shout. When you face challenges, shout, not in exasperation, but in triumph. Even when you&#x27;re not happy, shout! Even now, shout aloud with the voice of triumph; it&#x27;s an act of faith. Shout and declare that you&#x27;ve won. The future can depend on your shouting; so don&#x27;t keep quiet; shout your victory.</p>

<p>(Discern The Body Of Christ)</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 11:29 AMP C “For anyone who eats and drinks without discriminating and recognizing with due appreciation that [it is Christ’s] body, eats and drinks a sentence (a verdict of judgment) upon himself.”</p>
<p>When people don’t understand the reality of the Word of God, they go into error and, as a result, their lives are in jeopardy. In Matthew 22:29 AMPC, Jesus said, “You are wrong because you know neither the Scriptures nor God’s power.” Take our opening verse for example; it reveals something striking about the Holy Communion: the wine isn’t just a drink; it’s the communion of the blood of Christ, just as the bread represents His body. To drive this point home, the Apostle Paul said, “What the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. And I would not, that ye should be associates of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:20 JMNT).</p>
<p>When the Gentiles offer sacrifices to idols, they’re actually offering them to demons. This means that those sacrifices are connected to demons. Anyone who partakes of those sacrifices in any way, comes into fellowship with demons, and some have attracted demons to themselves that way. Some people have become sick as a result, and even mentally troubled, unable to do anything for themselves.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Bible says when we take the cup and eat the bread, we’re in fellowship with God. Blessed be God! 1 Corinthians 11:26 tells us categorically that taking the Communion is participating in the blood, and body of Christ. It’s the reason we’re admonished to discern the Lord’s body; be mindful of its power and significance. Many have trouble today in their physical body, while some have even died, for not discerning the Lord’s body.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 11:30 GNB says, “That is why many of you are sick and weak, and several have died.” What cause is the Spirit referring to? It’s the failure to discern the body of Christ. Therefore, examine yourself and relate properly to the Church of God. Don’t treat your local church or its members carelessly or with disdain. Walk in love always, and honour God’s people.</p>
<p>🔊 PRAY
Dear Father, thank you for the blessing to participate in the communion of the blood and the body of Christ. Thank you for the guidance of your Spirit who helps me discern the body of Christ. I have eternal victory and dominion over sin, sickness, disease, death, and the devil, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 11:18-34</p>
<p>▶️ ACT
Get ready to participate in the upcoming Communion service in your church. Spend time to pray in the Holy Ghost and prepare yourself ahead for the bread and the cup of the Lord.</p>

<p>&quot;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth&quot; (ACTS 1:8)</p>
<p>Some years ago, a young man came to me and said he suddenly woke up one day to discover half of his body had become numb. He had lost feeling on that side of his body, including his face. This happened overnight. When he talked to me about it, I knew he had to swing in action immediately.</p>
<p>So, I asked him to go over to a certain side of the platform, kneel there, and for an hour nonstop; he should pray in tongues as fast, hard, and as loud as he could. I told him to do this repeatedly for a few days and monitored him while he was at it. I knew it was serious business, but he didn&#x27;t need anybody to lay his hands on him.</p>
<p>After some days of praying in the Holy Ghost like that, all the symptoms disappeared and he was completely healed. Hallelujah! After you&#x27;re born again, everything in your body is already touched by the power of the Holy Spirit. There&#x27;s life in you. You can&#x27;t be a failure or be diseased. You can&#x27;t be said to be barren.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what you go through in life, take advantage of the the power in you for the change and miracle you require. That power  is activated as you pray in tongues, and it&#x27;s dynamic in its working. We read in our theme verse, &quot;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you&quot; That power is &quot;dunamis&quot; (Greek)---the dynamic, ability to cause changes.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no situation  you can&#x27;t change by yourself! The inherent power to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ask, think or imagine isn&#x27;t in heaven; it&#x27;s in you. You may have been told that you were born with an incurable disease; it doesn&#x27;t make any difference now, because you can change it! Put the Word to work; activate the power in you for a miracle. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Behold, I have indelibly imprinted (tattoed a picture of) you on the palm of each of my hands&quot; (ISAIAH 49:16 AMP)</p>
<p>When you hear of other people&#x27;s testimonies of God&#x27;s faithfulness in their lives, have you ever wondered, &quot;God, what about me?&quot; After many years in the ministry, I found out that a lot of people wonder if the Lord has forgotten them. If such a thought has ever crossed your mind, I&#x27;ve good news for you. God says, &quot;See, I have tattooed your name upon my palm.&quot; (Isaiah 49:16 TLB).</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t give up, help is on the way! God isn&#x27;t partial and He hasn&#x27;t forgotten you. He may not come when you want Him to but He&#x27;s always on time; He&#x27;s never late. Those wonderful testimonies you hear can happen to you as well. Remember, &quot;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever&quot; (Hebrews 13:8), what He did for one He&#x27;ll do for another under the same circumstances.</p>
<p>Skeptics will say that these things happen by chance. Well, if that&#x27;s true doesn&#x27;t that mean Jesus Christ came out of the grave by chance? A skeptic is a skeptic, he won&#x27;t believe anything no matter how hard you try to prove your point! I believe in miracles because I believe in God. So, if you need a miracle, you have to believe God. The Bible says, &quot;without faith it is impossible to please God: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him&quot; (Hebrews 11:6).</p>
<p>Proverbs 24:10 says if you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small. The Living Bible renders the same Scripture in a most pointed manner, and it says, &quot;You are a poor specimen if you can&#x27;t stand the pressure of adversity.&quot; Therefore, strengthen your hand and your faith with the Word of God. Trust completely in His Word today; He never disappoints!</p>

<p>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).</p>
<p>Make no mistakes about it, the time left before the Master’s return is shorter than many realize. What we’re expecting right now is the Rapture of the Church, the “catching away” of all those who are born again and walking in the light of God. Suddenly, we’ll disappear from this world to meet the Lord in the air.</p>
<p>Someone may ask, “How is that going to be possible? Imagine that the driver of a commuter bus or pilot of an airplane filled with people is born again, but the passengers aren’t; are you saying the driver or pilot will be raptured while the vehicle or airplane crashes?”</p>
<p>First, people who ask such questions haven’t understood what’s about to befall the world. The Rapture itself is judgement for the world. In Luke 17, Jesus said the day Noah entered into the ark, the floods came. Also, the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, fire came from Heaven and burnt up the city; judgement began immediately.</p>
<p>At the Rapture, cars and planes crashing with people onboard is all part of the judgement for the rejection of Christ. At that point, the hour of His grace would have been over. If any Christian is left behind, it’s because he or she wasn’t living the life of a Christian. They’ll be amongst the ones who’ll go through the Great Tribulation that’s to take place after the Rapture. And among them, a multitude of people will eventually be saved.</p>
<p>But you don’t want to be in that group. Jesus said, “Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man” (Luke 21:36). Prepare yourself for the “first flight.” Each day that passes takes us a day closer to His glorious appearing. Live for Him, and get others in your world ready for that day.</p>
<p>Say these words after me, &#x27;I’m awake and alert in the spirit, and my life is guided by Christ’s love and Word, and by my expectation of His imminent return. I make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof; I’m led continually by the Spirit, manifesting the fruits of righteousness. My desire and passion to win my world to Christ flourishes, and many, through me, are brought to the Kingdom, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>“There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.” (ROMANS 8:1-2)</p>
<p>There’s an operative principle in Christ, and it does more than bringing someone out of sin. This law of the Spirit affects your mind, your body, and everything you do, such that everything about your life just keeps growing, multiplying, and blazing. This life law only works for those who are born again. Those who are without Christ are subject to the spiritual law of sin and death on which Moses’ law was based.</p>
<p>Whereas, the law of the Spirit of life produces life in, and for everyone who’s in Christ Jesus, the law of sin and death produces corruption, scorn, bondage and death for, and in those who live without Christ in the world. Such people are without hope. But blessed be God! We’ve been born again, according to God’s abundant mercy into a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead (1 Peter 1:3), and the law of the Spirit of life is at work in us.</p>
<p>From the time Christ rose from the dead, God stopped counting men’s sins against them (2 Corinthians 5:17-20). This doesn’t just apply to the Church, but to the whole world! Jesus paid for the sins of the whole world! God is no longer angry at anyone; what He’s saying now is “Come and enjoy the life in Christ!”</p>
<p>Once you accept that invitation and receive Christ, automatically, the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus starts functioning in you. You have eternal life and the very nature of God in your spirit. Now, you can serve the Lord truly, and live by the principle of eternal life.</p>

<p>“Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” (MATTHEW 6:31-33)</p>
<p>I want you to read the text above again, but this time, contemplatively. Many have thought the Lord Jesus meant that we should seek the Kingdom first before we can go about seeking other things. That’s not what Jesus said; He only wants you to seek the Kingdom of God and nothing else! According to Him, everything else is granted us once we seek after the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make any difference that you’re a teenager, the Lord can still use you to bring others into His kingdom, thus expanding His Kingdom. And you can start from where you are, for where you are is your mission field.</p>
<p>Recognise that you’re on a mission, regardless of where you are or what you do; the Gospel is your number one priority. Your life shouldn’t just revolve around your school work, friends and family. You have to be concerned about the development of your spirit, and the expansion of the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The Lord’s injunction for us to seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness calls for every one of us to take a life assessment according to His Word and walk in His plan for you and others.</p>

<p>After hearing Jesus Christ had raised Lazarus from the dead, the council of Jewish leaders held an emergency security meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;This man is a security threat; we&#x27;ve got to stop Him before He puts the whole nation at the risk of being destroyed by the Romans. Let&#x27;s charge Him to the Sanhedrin and silence Him once and for all,&quot; some of them said.</p>
<p>Then Caiaphas the high priest spoke up: &quot;Are you all so dumb? Don&#x27;t you know it is expedient that one person should die for the nation so we would not all perish?&quot;</p>
<p>Caiaphas didn&#x27;t know it, but he was prophesying. God&#x27;s anointing was upon him to do so as the high priest. The Bible credits him with this prophecy that Jesus would for the nation, even though he did it in wickedness and ignorance, because after Jesus had resurrected, he bribed the guards to lie that He never rose again but that His body was stolen by His disciples! (Matthew  28:11-14). He even went to the extent of warning the apostles not to so much as mention the Name &#x27;Jesus&#x27; again (Acts 4:17-18).</p>
<p>All these he and his co-conspirators did in ignorance. They succeeded in condemning Jesus to the death of the cross but the Bible says, &quot;had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory&quot; (1 Corinthians 2:7-8). Thank God they did, for what they meant for evil, God turned it around for good, Hallelujah! This same Jesus is now Saviour and Lord.</p>
<p>You may be facing a trial by fire today or such persecution as would make the soul weary, but remember, all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his purpose (Romans 8:28). What the enemy meant for evil against you, God has ordained it for good and will bring it to pass in your life just as He did in the life of Jesus, Hallelujah!</p>

<p>God wants you to carry out His instructions according to the prescribed order. To do otherwise is to walk against His perfect will, like what happened to David and the children of Israel when they didn’t follow His prescribed order in moving the ark of God into the city of David. David got a new cart, and two men, Uzzah and Ahio, rode in the cart together with the ark as they drove it to the city of David (2 SAMUEL 6:3)</p>
<p>Then, something significant happened. The oxen pulling the cart stumbled and the cart shook. Uzzah tried to stop the ark from falling and when he did, he died instantly. David, baffled and afraid at what had happened, wouldn’t bring the ark into the city anymore. They had to keep it in the house of a man named Obed-edom. Interestingly, while the ark of God was in Obed-edom’s house, he and his family prospered exceedingly.</p>
<p>David couldn’t but wonder why the same ark that Uzzah touched and died would bring so much blessing to another man and his family. Then he found out why, as he searched the Scriptures. In 1 Chronicles 15:2, God’s prescribed order was that only the priests (the Levites) should carry the ark of God. That was God’s plan.</p>
<p>David, realizing their error, said to the priests and elders of Israel, “For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order” (1 Chronicles 15:13). How important this is! Uzzah could have been spared, had they followed God’s prescribed order.</p>
<p>It brings to mind the Lord’s admonition to Moses while he was to set up the Tabernacle; He said to him, “See that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount” (Hebrews 8:5). There’s a pattern; there’s a way; there’s a prescribed order in doing the things of God; follow it and you’ll experience His grace and blessings in your life and service of God, Glory to God!</p>

<p>&quot;And they went forth, and preached   every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following&quot; (Mark 16:20).</p>
<p>Preach the Gospel with passion, and as you do, the Lord will confirm His Word with signs following. We have something to give to the world; it&#x27;s the saving Gospel of Jesus Christ. Recall what the Lord charged us to do: &quot;Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give&quot; (Matthew 10:8). He has given us both the power and authority to do mighty works in His Name and demonstrate the character of the Holy Spirit to our world.</p>
<p>Therefore, take your place in the ministry of the Gospel. Never lose focus of the Master&#x27;s calling on your life. Serve Him selflessly, with an undying passion. If you&#x27;re passionate for Him, He&#x27;ll be passionate for you; He&#x27;ll stand up for you if you&#x27;d stand up for Him: &quot;Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven&quot; (Matthew 10:32).</p>
<p>The Bible says, &quot;For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead&quot; (2 Corinthians 5:14). Here, the Apostle Paul says our love and passion for the Lord compels us with the truth of the Gospel.</p>
<p>The Lord is with you, strong and mighty; and with the faith of God in your spirit, take your partnership in the Gospel to a higher level. Get &quot;wild&quot; for God! Invest your time and resources in world evangelism. Keep winning souls and let nothing quench your love for the Lord.</p>
<p>The Bible says those that turn many to righteousness shall shine as stars forever (Daniel 12:3). Shine evermore by making an impact with the Gospel. Be so passionate for the Gospel that its impact in men&#x27;s lives, and spread around the world, is all that matters to you.</p>

<p>“Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the Lord blessed him. The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.” (GENESIS 26:12-13 NIV)</p>
<p>Today’s opening scripture gives a good glimpse as to the kind of life God has destined for every of us His children: one of consistent progress. Your path in life is as the shining light that shines brighter and brighter till the perfect day (Proverbs 4:18). This matches what Apostle John describes in John 1:16, talking about the life of glory and success that we have in Christ: “And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace.”</p>
<p>When it says, “grace for grace” it actually means success heaped upon success; glory upon glory: a life of ever-increasing splendour. That’s the life that you’ve got in Him; therefore, always see increase. Aspire for more; dare to dream bigger. See yourself birthing new ideas and charting new frontiers; see yourself fruitful and productive in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>There’re yet more “lands to conquer.” Remember that at Shiloh, Joshua challenged the children of Israel saying, “How long will you neglect to go and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers has given you?” (Joshua 18:3). See and capture your next levels of success, increase, victory and promotion.</p>

<p>Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth (PROVERBS 6:2)</p>
<p>There’s a spiritual language for the Christian. That’s why, as a child of God, you ought to put the Word on your lips, because the supernatural life is based on your tongue. Your tongue rules your life. In Matthew 12:36-37, Jesus said, “But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the Day of Judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”</p>
<p>Literally, this means a man will go to heaven or hell because of his words. Read the Apostle Paul’s submission about salvation in Romans 10:8-10: “if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”</p>
<p>The Apostle James likened the tongue to the rudder of a great ship, which the captain uses to direct the ship wherever he wants (James 3:4-5). Likewise, your life is the character of your words. If your words are wholesome, your life will be perfect, excellent, and full of glory. Proverbs 15:4 says, “A wholesome tongue is a tree of life” Jesus taught that what you say, is what you get (Mark 11:23).</p>
<p>Watch what you say, for your confessions control your life. You can keep yourself in health, safety, prosperity, and victory with your words. Stir your life in the direction of God’s destiny for you with your faith-filled confessions. Always talk success and increase only.</p>
<p>1 PETER 3:10 says, “For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile&quot;.</p>
<p>” PROVERBS 18:21 says, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.” Create and sustain your glorious life with your words.</p>

<p>Ephesians 6:10 “Be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might.”</p>
<p>Chad was going out on a road trip with his dad when they saw a policeman giving a much heftier man strict instructions, with which the man complied. Chad was curious and asked his dad, “Why Is that policeman not afraid of the huge man? What if the man tries to hurt the policeman?”</p>
<p>Chad’s dad looked back and answered, “The policeman is confident and strong in the government’s authority backing him; there’s no need to exert his physical power.”</p>
<p>This is what the Spirit means in 2 Timothy 2:1, when He, through Apostle Paul, said to Timothy, “You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.” Being strong in the Lord doesn’t mean being strong in your physical might or muscles; no! It means to be strong in the grace that’s in Christ Jesus; understand what that grace has brought to you and take advantage of it.</p>
<p>It’s something you have to do for yourself. For example, the grace of Jesus Christ has brought us divine health in the Gospel; take advantage of that grace and stay in divine health. His grace brought us prosperity as well; therefore, refuse to be poor: “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich” (2 Corinthians 8:9).</p>
<p>His grace has ushered us into a life of righteousness: “For if by the one man’s offense death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:17). Grace reigns by righteousness. Therefore, take advantage of His grace and keep reigning in life.</p>
<p>Understand what it means to be endowed with God’s grace; it means God has given Himself to you, thereby giving you all that He has. By grace, you received His life and nature of righteousness, with dominion to rule over the devil, sickness, disease, the world, and its systems. Glory to God! Refuse to be swayed by the adversities of life; take advantage of the grace of God in Christ Jesus. Live the Word; that’s what it’s all about. You can’t take advantage of His grace until you know what His grace has done for you, given to you, and made you!</p>

<p>As God’s child, when you received the Holy Spirit, you also received the power to cause changes. Wondering where this power is? It’s in your mouth (Ecclesiastes 8:4). With this power, you can decide how you want your day to go.</p>
<p>As you get up each morning, speak to your day, declare what it is you want to see, and how beautiful you want your day to be. When you start each day this way, you’ll have an excellent day every day.</p>

<p>&quot;God loves (He takes pleasure in, prizes above other things, and is unwilling to abandon or to do without) a cheerful (joyous, &quot;prompt to do it&quot;) giver [whose heart is in his giving]&quot; (2 Corinthians 9:7 AMP).</p>
<p>The giver is a soulwinner and the soulwinner is a giver! The soulwinner is always looking out for souls into the Kingdom of God. His ultimate desire is to touch someone&#x27;s life in a special way, irrespective of race, colour or location. He&#x27;s a man who already knows that his needs are met by his giving and as such, he devotes more of his prayer time to lost souls all over the world.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the soulwinner also bountifully gives towards the Lord&#x27;s work and advances the cause of the Gospel all over the world. He sees the bigger picture in life.</p>
<p>The &quot;taker&quot; (or stingy man), on the other hand, is always out to get from everyone--both God and man. His eyes are closed to the needs of the lost and hurting around him. He is spiritually myopic; all he thinks about is how to fill his pocket with more money and his belly with more food. Don&#x27;t let this ever be a description of you!</p>
<p>Learn to live and move in the power of the Spirit through your giving so you can remain in the continuous flow of God&#x27;s blessings. As God blesses you, ensure that the Kingdom is moving forward through you, because that&#x27;s your primary responsibility. It is God&#x27;s utmost desire that everyone of His children be actively involved in soul-winning. He continually increases your finances so you can have a greater capacity to give to His work around the world. Don&#x27;t be like some folks who become less committed to world evangelization the more the Lord blesses them. Let your passion for soul-winning and giving reach an all-time high, because the soul-winning giver rules the world!</p>

<p>“Then Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, “If you return to the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths from among you, and prepare your hearts for the Lord, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.” (1 SAMUEL 7:3)</p>
<p>We’re in the final “seconds” of the last days, and you must be focused on the Lord, serving Him heartily. The Bible says, “You may as well know this too…that in the last days it is going to be very difficult to be a Christian” (2 Timothy 3:1 TLB). Notice it doesn’t say, “It shall be impossible to be a Christian,” but “difficult.” So, it’s telling you to serve the Lord, regardless and independent of circumstances or persecution.</p>
<p>This isn’t the time to hide your Christian identity. Nothing whatsoever should be viable enough to take your attention away from the Lord and His Kingdom. Some are only fervent in serving the Lord when everything seems rosy. But the actual test comes when trouble strikes, and they get discouraged and suddenly lose their fire. Some others only serve the Lord during times of challenges. As soon as they have a miracle and are out of the dilemma, their commitment to the Lord immediately wanes. Something is wrong. Don’t let that happen to you. Be on fire for the Lord all the time.</p>
<p>Be instant in season and out of season. Let nothing compete with or inhibit your love for and commitment to Christ. The Bible says, “Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain” (1 Corinthians 15:58 NIV). When everything is going smoothly, be steadfast. And when it’s a period of adversity, serve the Lord with all your heart still. Proverbs 24:10 NIV says, “If you falter in a time of trouble, how small is your strength!” and Colossians 3:23 GNB tells us, “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as though you were working for the Lord and not for people.” Praise God!</p>

<p>&quot;As for us, there&#x27;s no question-we can&#x27;t keep quiet about what we&#x27;ve seen and heard&quot; (ACTS 4:17-20 MSG)</p>
<p>The devil has never wanted the Gospel of Christ preached and has been trying  all means to stop it. He doesn&#x27;t want people to hear what Jesus has done for them and that&#x27;s why we have to tell everybody that the Word works.</p>
<p>I once heard R. W. Schambach tell of his first experience in casting out demons. He commanded the demons in a lady to come out of her but they adamantly refused to leave. Defiant, the demons said to Schambach, &quot;We&#x27;re not coming out and we&#x27;ll wear you out.&quot; &quot;We don&#x27;t wear out, devil&quot; replied Schambach. I want you to note that he didn&#x27;t say, &quot;You will not wear me out.&quot; His statement is another way of saying, &quot;We belong to a class that cannot be worn out.&quot; We&#x27;re special, unique and different from the kind of  beings that could be worn out.</p>
<p>Then he went on to say, &quot;My elder brother Jesus defeated you on Calvary and He put His foot on your neck.&quot; As he said that, the demon shouted, &quot;Don&#x27;t say that!&quot; but he said it again in spite of the demon&#x27;s protest. Finally, the demon said, &quot;Alright, I know I am defeated, but please don&#x27;t tell everybody.&quot; According to R. W. Schambach, he made up his mind to tell the whole world that Jesus has defeated the devil. This is what the Lord anointed His children to do.

The Bible says, &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear  without a preacher?&quot; (Romans 10:13-14). You must realize that you&#x27;re the preacher in your world; your home, office, class or neighbourhood. You can&#x27;t afford to fold your arms and not do anything, while those around you continue on the hapless journey of destruction, bondage, sickness and poverty.</p>
<p>God has anointed you to deliver men from the bondage of the enemy, therefore, it&#x27;s high time you be about your heavenly Father&#x27;s business, for many more need the message He put in your heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end&quot; (ISAIAH 9:7)</p>
<p>If you were under the bridge when Jesus met you---you didn&#x27;t have a home, a friend and food to eat---He&#x27;ll take you out of poverty and change your life forever. Did you know this was one of the reasons the Roman government during the days of the Apostles was against Christianity?</p>
<p>The emperors of the time discovered that everyone that received the Gospel (good news) of Jesus Christ, no matter how low he was, soon began walking and talking like a king. Some of their servants who believed in Jesus no longer talked or behaved like slaves. They weren&#x27;t rude or anything like that but, there was just something about them that gave them human dignity.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don&#x27;t do something about this, one day these people will take over,&quot; the authorities must have thought, and they began to persecute them. They didn&#x27;t care much about religion. They knew religion brought people down and enslaved them by man-made rules and regulations. But this &#x27;new religion&#x27; seemed to stir the people up instead: the guy may not have any money in his pocket, but he walks and talks like a king nevertheless. That&#x27;s what Christianity does; it stirs up your excellent spirit. When you keep talking like that it wouldn&#x27;t be too long before it starts to show in your life that way.
═══════════════</p>
<p>Can you imagine what was on the minds of the authorities? They had thought they&#x27;d finally got rid of this Jesus for good, only to find out that He was more dangerous &#x27;dead&#x27; than He was alive. Little did they know that He was still alive, living forever at the right hand of the Father. So we are here today to remind every living creature of this truth.</p>
<p>Jesus came into your life to lift you and give you hope and a future. More than all that, He came to deliver to you an inheritance. When He lifts you, no man or demon, nothing created can bring you down. So you see, no country or government can stop the prosperity of God&#x27;s people. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder (Matthew 21:44).</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ is the ground and pillar of truth (1 Timothy 3:15). However, there&#x27;re those who have set themselves as enemies of the Church. Some have vowed that by the time they are through with Christianity, nobody will remember it existed. In Psalm 2:4, the Bible shows us that &quot;He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision&quot;. Such misled folks are not alone in their derision; many have made such empty threats before, but God&#x27;s Word and His work outlived them, and will yet outlive anyone who stands in its path.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re in the biggest and greatest union that the world has ever seen; we&#x27;re in the greatest team ever. We aren&#x27;t in something that&#x27;s irrelevant and weak, and fading away; the Church of Jesus Christ is stronger, bigger and more effective today, than any time in history. This is the reality. We&#x27;re seeing greater miracles today than any time in the history of the Church. Haggai 2:9 says, &quot;The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former&quot; That&#x27;s His Word, and so it&#x27;s got to be, and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on all around the world.</p>
<p>The Church is stronger than ever before, and we give the credit to the Holy Spirit, whose influence, power, impact and work is evident in the body of Christ today more than ever. Those who keep whipping the Church, saying that the Church today is void of power and in a backslidden state, are not in touch with reality; they&#x27;re not seeing rightly.</p>
<p>Jesus prayed the Father to send the Holy Spirit. Then He (Jesus) ascended to heaven, and the Holy Spirit has been with us ever since, building the Church. He&#x27;s in charge of the Church today; He&#x27;s the Lord of the harvest. It&#x27;ll therefore be out of place for anyone to say or suggest that the Church is failing in the hands of the Holy Spirit, when in reality, we&#x27;re making the greatest impact for the Lord in our day. Glory to His Name forever!</p>
<p>CONFESSION
I belong to the church of the living God, the ground and pillar of truth, where I&#x27;m taught the Word, equipped, trained, nurtured, built, and edified in wisdom and righteousness! Thank you Father, for your power and glory in the Church, and your work of righteousness that&#x27;s being spread and established all over the earth, in Jesus&#x27; Name. Amen.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-13 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: ;</p>
<p>Luke 4:16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.</p>
<p>Matthew 16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</p>

<p>“But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.” (2 CORINTHIANS 3:18)</p>
<p>“Why do I look like that?” Bailey shrieked as she used the standing mirror in her sister’s room; she didn’t like the way her face suddenly contorted as she moved towards it. Also, her nose looked bigger than usual, and her eyes bulged out from her face. “Ugh! Why do I look like this, Linda?” she screamed as her sister walked into her room.</p>
<p>“Don’t be a drama queen!” Linda smirked. “I told you not to use that mirror; it’s a funny mirror! Use this one instead!” “Oh, okay, I thought so; that first mirror had a problem; I can see now how beautiful my face looks,” Bailey said with relief in her voice.</p>
<p>It matters what mirror you use in life; I’m not just talking about the one for physical looks and features but the mirror that reflects your spirit—the Word of God. When you look into God’s mirror, there’s so much glory to discover and see, which is why you should always be eager to learn the Word and see all that He planned for you to be.</p>
<p>Desire more of God’s Word, His glory, and the increase of His wisdom in your life! Keep studying and meditating on His Word, and not only will you know Him more, but His glory will also increase in your life as well. Keep beholding the glory in the Word because the more you see the glory, you become what you see (2Corinthians 3:18)! No one beholds the glory of God without being impacted; His glory transforms you.</p>
<p>Recall the experience of Peter, James and John at the mount of transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-3). When they saw Jesus transfigured in their presence, Peter said, “Lord, it is good for us to be here” (Matthew 17:4). At that moment, they forgot about the whole world; they wanted to stay in the glory of God.</p>
<p>In John 17, Jesus prayed to the Father for His disciples, and there, He said so much about the glory. Why? Because the kingdom is “glory-focused,” it’s all glorious. And that’s the life He’s given us; we carry His glory! He wants us to be conscious that we’re the effulgence of His glory! Hallelujah!</p>

<p>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen (2Corinthians 13:14).</p>
<p>Your highest calling as a Christian is fellowship with the Lord. Without fellowship, nothing you do on earth is esteemed in Heaven. To fellowship with Jesus is to fellowship with the fullest revelation of the essence of deity. But you see, you can’t fellowship with Him except through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>That’s why I often wonder why some people think they don’t need the Holy Spirit. There’s nothing more void than a life without the Holy Spirit, because He’s the author of life. Without Him, all you have will be darkness. He’s the One who gives you light and quickens the Word of God in your heart. God’s Word won’t mean anything to you without the insight and revelation the Holy Spirit gives.</p>
<p>The Bible says His words are life to those that find them (Proverbs 4:22); and the way to find them is through the Holy Spirit. Your desire should be to fellowship more with the Holy Spirit every day; I mean fellowship with participation, where you’re actively engaged with Him in a romance of righteousness.</p>
<p>The glorious thing about this is that, for all the successes that you achieve through the guidance and wisdom you receive as you fellowship with Him, He gives you the credit. Another beautiful impact of your fellowship with Him is that you become so mingled with Him that your body becomes His body; your tongue becomes His tongue, your hands, His hands, and your feet, His feet. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>In this kind of relationship, every limit and barrier is taken off your way; you experience nothing but progress in life. You’re so full of His glory and wisdom that they overflow from you to others. He takes over your life and you experience unprecedented manifestations of His power that causes many to wonder at you. These and more are what fellowship with the Holy Spirit will bring to you. Praise God!</p>
<p>Be the best version of you😊</p>
<p>“As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he&quot;.</p>
<p>See aright, expand your vision and walk in the Reality of God’s plan for your life each day!</p>

<p>&quot;My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations&quot; (James 1:2).</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve heard some ministers say, &quot;I don&#x27;t like criticism at all.&quot; If you&#x27;re in that group, it means you&#x27;re not yet ready for the real work; the miraculous. The moment miracles start in your ministry, you&#x27;ll start hearing things like, &quot;Hmmn! Who does he think he is?&quot; &quot;Where does he get his power?&quot; &quot;The miracles are fake!&quot;</p>
<p>Show me a man who has enemies and I&#x27;ll show you a successful man. A hard statement, but a true one nonetheless! Nobody needs to announce you when you don&#x27;t amount to a heap of beans. Nobody will criticize you when your car is smoking like a chimney all over town. The reason they don&#x27;t criticize you is because they haven&#x27;t noticed you. When they notice you, they&#x27;ll criticize you for sure!</p>
<p>So when the people around you say nasty things about you, don&#x27;t be angry or mad at them, don&#x27;t even reply your critics. Just smile! God has made you a city that&#x27;s set upon a hill; you cannot be hidden (Matthew 5:14). He wants to display you for all the world to see.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not necessary to run from criticism. Besides, you wouldn&#x27;t be the first to be criticised. Remember that David was criticized by his brothers after he was anointed by Samuel. Eliab, his eldest brother criticized him when he showed up at the war front, but David was unperturbed by his criticism. By this attitude he was able to fulfil his destiny by killing Goliath (1Samuel 17:42-50). Even the Lord Jesus was criticized by the scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees because of His miracles. So you see, you shouldn&#x27;t worry about about your critics neither should you be disturbed that you&#x27;re the devil&#x27;s target. It&#x27;s at that point that God becomes your Jehovah Nissi - The Lord your Banner. Hallelujah! Right in the midst of the problem you can say like David, &quot;now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me&quot; (Psalm 27:6). Count it all joy for you&#x27;re a victor at every count.</p>

<p>&quot;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth&quot; (Acts 1:8).</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about the fact that God chose you before you were born, to be His witness? He knew you and foreordained you to live for His glory. The Bible says &quot;For whom he did foreknow, he also predestinate to the comformed to the image of his Son.&quot; (Romans 8:29).</p>
<p>God foreordained and planned that through you, He&#x27;ll bless and transform the lives of those in your world and in regions beyond. He set you apart to do His will, and to be His witness.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, understanding this, echoed the same message in Galatians 1:15-16: &quot;But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother&#x27;s womb, and called me by his grace, To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen&quot; Paul&#x27;s  passion and unrivalled commitment to the Gospel resulted from his knowledge and understanding that he was chosen and sent of God to turn the Gentiles from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</p>
<p>Recall his profound  statement of commitment to the Gospel in 1 Corinthians 9:16: &quot;For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!&quot; Become aware, convinced, and challenged by the divine mandate and obligation to preach the Gospel.</p>
<p>As in our opening verse, the power of the Holy Spirit in your life is to make you an effective witness of Jesus Christ; a minister of reconciliation. You&#x27;ve been given the mandate to preach the Gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15), and make disciples and pupils of the nations (Matthew 28:19). Make this your focus, and experience true fulfillment in your life.</p>

<p>&quot;My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you&quot; (Galatians 4:19).</p>
<p>In the 3rd chapter of Paul&#x27;s epistle to the Galatian Christians, he calls out their outright repudiation of the message of faith. They had left the simple message of grace in Christ to keeping the Law of Moses in order to be justified. Having learnt that they had accepted the teachings of false teachers, Paul chided them, &quot;O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth&quot; (Galatians 3:1).</p>
<p>There&#x27;re some like that in the Church today; they started well but went on listening to wrong doctrines and were misled. They became argumentative, confrontational, disorderly, rude and unruly in the house of God, and some even stopped fellowship with the church altogether.</p>
<p>When you have a brother or sister in the Lord or a whole family disobeying the truth of God&#x27;s Word, obstinate, and walking contrary to the instructions of the Spirit, it&#x27;s because the spirit of foolishness has taken over their minds; thus, it&#x27;s time to travail in birth again until Christ is formed in them, as Paul the Apostle did.</p>
<p>Why did Paul have to travail in birth again for the Galatians? He travailed in birth previously, by which they came to Christ. He determined to do so again now that they were falling away from the truth. This travail in birth is intercessory prayers that leads to salvation and deliverance of one who&#x27;s lost or fallen out of the way.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what you do for such people; you pray again and again, in intercession and fasting---that the Christ-life gains the ascendancy in them, and they be fully yielded to, and established in God&#x27;s truth and righteousness.</p>
<p>The words &quot;travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you&quot; show that the life of Christ wasn&#x27;t being manifested in them; they had become worldly, living on the wrong information that was destroying their faith. So, learn to pray fervently in the spirit for new converts and new members in the churches of Christ around the world. Pray that they&#x27;ll increase in the knowledge and revelation of Christ, and be established in the faith through the ministry of the Word and the Holy Spirit, fulfilling their purpose and leading others to Christ.</p>
<p>Also pray for those who may be facing difficult times and persecutions, or wavering in their faith, that they be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man, rooted and grounded in love, pleasing Him in all things, in Jesus&#x27; Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&quot; (Romans 12:2).</p>
<p>When you allow unforgiveness in your heart, bitterness and malice set in and you will end up committing sin by walking contrary to the new life of the Kingdom, which is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. The moment you permit bitterness to well up inside you, it results in depression and quenches the Spirit. It creates a burden, represses, destabilizes and slows down your growth, and eventually makes you walk outside the will of God.</p>
<p>On the other hand, &quot;Love (God&#x27;s love in us) does not insist on its own rights or its own way, for it is not self-seeking; it is not touchy or fretful or resentful; it takes no account of the evil done to it (it pays no attention to a suffered wrong)&quot; (1 Corinthians 13:5 AMP). Love is not selfish, but kind. Galatians 6:2 tells us to bear one another&#x27;s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. The Law of Christ is love and everyone that loves is born of God and knows God (1 John 4:7). Natural human love can turn to hatred, but the God-kind of love will never go bitter. Love is a product of a transformed life that is considerate and forgiving.</p>
<p>Check yourself today and snap out of emotions that cause you to be bitter and depressed. Remember God has given you a spirit of love, power and a sound mind.</p>

<p>“And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.” (1 JOHN 5:11 NIV)</p>
<p>Moses and the Israelites were in a quagmire before the Red Sea, and in panic, they cried out to God for help. The Lord, however, responded to Moses in a most amazing manner: “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on. Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground” (Exodus 14:15-16 NIV). The Lord was making Moses aware that the help he required was already with him. In other words, “Moses, use what you have!”</p>
<p>In our wonderful journey of faith, God expects us to have a life of continual victory and prosperity; and all that’s required is for you to use what you have. As a Christian, you have treasures resident in your spirit (2 Corinthians 4:7). One of such treasures is eternal life. Jesus said, “He who believes in Me has everlasting life” (John 6:47). Everlasting life here refers to the incorruptible life of God in your spirit. Use this life in you against any health challenge that may be trying to find a place in your body. Declare, “I refuse to accommodate any sickness, disease or pain in my body because I have the life of God in me!”</p>
<p>Another thing you have is righteousness from the Lord (2 Corinthians 5:21, Philippians 3:9), so when the devil tries to weaken your faith by making you feel unrighteous, you ought to say to him: “I am the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus! Get out, in Jesus’ Name!” If he tries to make you feel you’ve got a problem loving others, declare: “The love of God has been poured out within my heart through the Holy Spirit who was given to me” (Romans 5:5). You’re a manifestation of God’s love, and it radiates through you. Think this way about yourself; speak and live accordingly. It’s so important to know what you have in Christ, and the way to know is from the Word of God. Learn more about what you have in Christ and confess it.</p>

<p>&quot;Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid&quot; (MATTHEW 5:14)</p>
<p>This present world is a world in spiritual darkness. It was the same in the days of Jesus. Recall at his arrest, He said, &quot;this is your moment, the time when the power of darkness reigns&quot; (Luke 22:53 NLT). After Jesus ascended to heaven, the remained in darkness. But you&#x27;re the solution to that darkness. We read in our opening verse that you&#x27;re the light of the world. You have to shine ever more so brightly in these last days, through the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Our world isn&#x27;t for the devil; it&#x27;s for the Lord. He put us here to run this world with His light and righteousness from the realm of the Spirit. As you walk in faith, putting the Word to work and insisting on your divine rights and heritage in Christ, you&#x27;re making your light shine.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter the darkness in the world---the sickness, disease, poverty and insecurity ravaging this world---you&#x27;ve been empowered to rule and reign in Christ, through the Word. Others would see you and understand who a true Christian is; they&#x27;d see the glory and excellence of Christ in you.</p>
<p>Isaiah 60:1-2 says, &quot;Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.&quot; This is your moment to shine as the light in a dark world by walking in righteousness, prosperity, health, soundness of mind and body as guaranteed in the Word of God.</p>

<p>&quot;And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth&quot; (John 1:14).</p>
<p>God spoke the Word in recreating and restoring order to the earth after it became a dark chaotic mass. In the midst of the darkness and chaos, He said, &quot;Let there be light,&quot; and light became (Genesis 1:3). The Word that gave light to the world became flesh, and dwelt amongst us in the person of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus walked the streets of Galilee, Capernaum, and Jerusalem, as the Word in human form. He lived as the Word and did everything He did with, and through the Word. He healed the sick with the Word. He raised the dead with the Word, and cast out devils with the Word. He only had to speak words, and miracles ensued.</p>
<p>Recall how He raised Lazarus from the dead, a man who had been dead and buried for four days and who surely must have begun to decompose. When Jesus called out, &quot;Lazarus, come forth&quot; (John 11:43), the man who had been dead came out alive! How awesome! Jesus lived and triumphed with words, showing us how to live in this world.</p>
<p>When He needed to feed the multitude, and all that was available was a little boys lunch (five loaves of bread and two fish), He spoke words (Matthew 14:17-21). He took the loaves of bread, and fish and invoked the power of multiplication into them and they became more than enough to feed five thousand men, women and children not counted, with twelve baskets as leftovers.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s given us the same life wherein we triumph with words. He said in Mark 11:23, &quot;You shall have what you say.&quot; You can speak life to your job, finances, health and family and cause miracles to happen. When you speak over any situation, your words prevail. You&#x27;re a king, and where the word of a king is, there&#x27;s power (Ecclesiastes 8:4).

<p>&quot;And Samuel grew, and the LORD  was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground&quot; (1 SAMUEL 3:19)</p>
<p>Our theme verse shows us something very significant about God; He places premium on words. Jesus emphasized the importance of words several times in His teachings. In Matthew 12:36, &quot;every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgement.&quot; This is a serious warning.</p>
<p>Notice He didn&#x27;t say men shall give account for some idle words that they speak, but for every idle word. Idle words are empty, ineffectual words; coarse language. In Ephesians 4:29, He said, &quot;Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your  mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.&quot;</p>
<p>Not only must your words be gracious and edifying always, they must also be faith words. Words are things; they have substance; they create or destroy. &quot;Death and life are in the power of the tongue&quot; (Proverbs 18:21). Don&#x27;t be careless with words. Your words represent you; they&#x27;re your life.</p>
<p>Mark 11:23 says, &quot;For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea...he shall have whatsoever he saith.&quot; Jesus said  in Matthew 12:37, &quot;For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.&quot;</p>
<p>Even salvation is activated by words. Romans 10:9-10 tells us, &quot;That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.&quot; Take words seriously.</p>

<p>Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me (John 14:30).</p>
<p>One of the ways Satan finds his way into people’s lives is through thoughts; their acceptance of his thoughts. When Satan plants a lie in a man’s heart and the man believes and accepts it, automatically, THERE’S A CONNECTION BETWEEN HIM AND SATAN. –See Video–</p>
<p>Remember, you can’t separate a man from his word, likewise, you can’t separate Satan from his word. Therefore, refuse to accommodate his thoughts and words. In our opening verse, Jesus said Satan had nothing in Him. This is very instructive. It lets you know why Jesus had no sense of doubt or fear; there was nothing of darkness in Him, and He declared it boldly.</p>
<p>Have the same confidence. Refuse to accommodate anything from the devil. Don’t give place to frustration, depression or sadness. Ephesians 4:27 says, “Neither give place to the devil”; you give place to him by giving place to his thoughts and words. Think about it: How did Jesus locate Satan in Peter? It was because Peter spoke the thoughts Satan had planted in his heart, and immediately, Jesus turned to Peter and said, “get thee behind me, Satan” (Matthew 16:23).</p>
<p>Was Jesus referring to Peter as Satan? No, He wasn’t. But Peter gave place to Satan by accepting his thoughts and giving voice to those thoughts. This still happens today with many people. Satan could come to someone and say, “Can’t you see how miserable your life is? This Word of God that you’ve believed all these years, is it really working?”</p>
<p>If you ever hear such a voice, refute it, for that’s Satan talking. Don’t entertain his thoughts. Like Jesus, let him have nothing in you. When He comes with those negative, depressing thoughts—thoughts that are contrary to God’s Word—tell him off immediately, with God’s Word in your mouth, and he’ll flee.</p>

<p>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (2 PETER 1:3).</p>
<p>When we talk about salvation, some people don&#x27;t understand it; it&#x27;s a big word. It encapsulates all the wonderful blessings resulting from the redemptive work of Christ: salvation, healing and divine health, success, freedom, liberty, preservation, etc.; they&#x27;ve all been paid for! They&#x27;re yours now to enjoy! All the good things of life are all in the salvation package; the glorious life is your heritage. Prosperity with peace is your birthright.</p>
<p>Read the opening verse again; it says His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness.

<p>Remember this: Jesus shed His blood for you, being the only sinless one qualified to save us by His blood.

<p>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him. (ISAIAH 53:5).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus suffered and endured the pain and shame of the Cross, not because of His sins or for Himself, but for us. He took our place and bore the punishment for sin on our behalf. While on the Cross, bearing the burden of our sins, He cried out in anguish, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” (Mark 15:34).</p>
<p>God turned His back on Jesus because our sins were laid on Him. Habakkuk 1:13 tells us that God is holy and doesn’t behold iniquity. The separation from the Father, on account of our sins, was what Jesus never wanted, for which He prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, “Father, if you be willing, take this cup away from me, nevertheless not my will, but your will be done” (Matthew 26:39).</p>
<p>The Father’s will prevailed. Jesus died on the Cross, and descended into hell. He was put to grief. Upon taking all the punishment that was necessary, the Bible says He was justified in the Spirit (1 Timothy 3:16) and was raised back to life. He was raised to life for our justification: “Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification” (Romans 4:25).</p>
<p>To be justified means to be acquitted of guilt; to be declared righteous. He was our substitute in death as well as our substitute in resurrection. When He died, you died with Him; when He was buried, you were buried with Him. When God raised Him from the dead, you were also raised together with Him in newness of life! Now, you’re sin-free; at complete liberty to serve the Lord and live for Him in glory and righteousness. You’ve become not just righteous, but also the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. Such a blessed reality!</p>

The Word of God is the light of my life, and by the Word, I see and take a hold of my righteousness and inheritance in Christ, walking in holiness and manifesting the glory of God everywhere.

<p>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus.&quot; (Romans 8:1).</p>
<p>The word translated &#x27;condemnation&#x27; in this verse of Scripture also means Judgement.&#x27; So we can read it thus: &quot;There is therefore now no judgement to them which are in Christ Jesus.&quot; Judgement is a part and of God&#x27;s programme even though some folks don&#x27;t think so. The Bible clearly reveals two main judgements for sinners. The first one took place when the Lord Jesus was judged for the sins of mankind on the cross of Calvary, and the second will take place on the judgement day, before the great white throne. Sadly, most folks are only familiar with the latter.</p>
<p>According to Romans 8:1, a man doesn&#x27;t have to face the second judgement. He can obtain God&#x27;s righteousness by faith in the first judgement. Jesus became the sacrifice for our sin on the cross of Calvary and He paid the penalty by His death (Galatians 3:13-14). Thank God He didn&#x27;t remain in the grave. He resurrected on the third day! Therefore, as many as believe in Him are justified from every sin. What&#x27;s more, what we have is more than remission of sins; we now have a new nature. So you see, we have every reason to celebrate the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Today, Jesus is sitting on the throne of grace calling all men to accept what He did for them. Now, every man can boldly come before the throne of grace to obtain mercy (Hebrews 4:16). But someday not too far away, that throne of grace will become the throne of judgement where the entire world would be judged according to their works. It&#x27;s our responsibility to announce to the world that the price has been paid already for their redemption as there will be no place for repentance on the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive (1 CORINTHIANS 15:21-22).</p>
<p>When Jesus died on the cross, He didn’t take the place of “Christians,” but the place of sinners. He came as man’s substitute. The whole world has been saved from the punishment of sin, but God’s interest wasn’t just to save man from the punishment of sin, but to save man from the life and nature of sin.</p>
<p>The death of Jesus Christ settled the charges against us, but it didn’t make us one with God or reconcile us to God! It didn’t bring us into friendship or relationship with God. It didn’t give us eternal life, until we took the very next step as revealed in Romans 10:9-10. It says anyone who confesses the Lordship of Jesus, and believes that God raised Him from the dead shall be saved.</p>
<p>Our individual confession of His Lordship, and belief in His resurrection, “activated” our salvation; it gave us eternal life, and brought us into oneness with God. We were awakened to the fatherhood of God, to the recreation of our spirit; to the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, and the efficacy of the Word of God.</p>
<p>Now, Jesus Christ isn’t only the Lord of your life, but also One in whom you’ve found rich and deep fellowship: “That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ” (1 John 1:3). This is what God always wanted with man: fellowship! Jesus made it a reality. Now, we’ve been made associates of the God-kind; we’ve become God’s dwelling place. All these were made possible, not by His death, but by His resurrection</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, thank you for the vicarious death of Jesus, the glorious works of salvation, and the inextricable oneness and sweet fellowship you’ve ushered me into, as a result of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I declare that I’m righteous, victorious, excellent and full of glory, living the supernatural life, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;And Jesus came and spake unto them...lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen&quot; (Matthew 28:18-20).</p>
<p>Some people haven&#x27;t really thought of the fact that God lives in the &quot;now.&quot; Jesus said, &quot;I&#x27;m with you always.&quot; He didn&#x27;t promise to be with you when you get to heaven; He&#x27;s with you now!</p>
<p>When the Father revealed Himself to  Moses at the backside of the desert, He introduced Himself  as the &quot;I Am That I  Am!&quot; He&#x27;s not the &quot;I was&quot; or &quot;I shall be,&quot; but the great &quot;I am!&quot; He lives in the now of your life, not in the past or in the sweet bye and bye. Many Christians don&#x27;t enjoy the life of the Father in the &#x27;now&#x27; because they see God as their &quot;help in ages past and hope for years to come.&quot; They only recognise the past ages and the years to come, not taking today into cognisance, yet they live between the two.</p>
<p>Jesus said &quot;lo, I am with you alway&quot;; check out the tenses! He didn&#x27;t say, &quot;lo, I will be with you&quot; or &quot;lo, I shall be with you.&quot; Rather, He said, &quot;I am with you always!&quot; This is a present-hour reality, a statement of fact and not a promise. God didn&#x27;t  promise to be with you. He said, &quot;I am with you.&quot; His Name is &quot;I AM that I AM!&quot; not I was&quot; or &quot;I will be&quot; but &quot;I AM.&quot; Our Heavenly Father is a &#x27;now&#x27; Father!

<p>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life (ROMANS 6:4).</p>
<p>If Christianity were all about salvation from sin, there wouldn’t have been the need for Jesus to rise from the dead. His death on the Cross would have been enough; it paid for all our sins and guaranteed complete propitiation. However, that’s redemption, and not Christianity!</p>
<p>Redemption refers to saving someone by paying a price. When Jesus died, He paid the price for man’s redemption with His own life; He did that for all humanity; not for Christians. The Christian isn’t the man that Christ died for. Look at it this way: when Jesus hung on the Cross, in the mind of God, we were all hanging there too (in Him), for He was our representative. When He cried out, “It is finished,” and gave up the ghost, we also died in Him.</p>
<p>Now, here’s the big thing, which Satan didn’t see coming and the angels still marvel at and seek to look into: Christianity is based on the resurrection of Jesus, and not on His death. The resurrection of Jesus Christ gave us something far beyond redemption; it ushered us into a newness of life. We’ve been raised up together with Christ (Ephesians 2:6).</p>
<p>Romans 10:9 says, “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that GOD HATH RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD, thou shalt be saved.” It lets us know that salvation comes by believing in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the subsequent confession of His Lordship. A Christian is one who identifies with the resurrected Christ. The Christian has no past, for the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:17: “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature”; meaning that he is a new species, one that never existed before.</p>
<p>No wonder James declares that “Of his (God’s) own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures” (James 1:18). Being born again, therefore, you’re not the “redeemed”; you’re the fruit of the redemptive work of Christ.</p>
<p>Redemption was consummated with His death, but Christianity came from the resurrection. Hallelujah!</p>

Dear Father, I thank you for making me one with Christ. I’m a new creation and I walk in the newness of life, conscious that I’ve been raised together with Christ, and made to sit together with Him in the place of victory, authority and dominion forever, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses (ACTS 13:38-39).</p>
<p>Always, I think about Jesus and His vicarious sacrifice in our behalf and I’m overwhelmed by how much He loves us. He took our place of judgment and condemnation, and gave us His nature of righteousness. In Him, not only have we been made righteous, we’ve been made the very epitome and expression of God’s righteousness.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:21 says, “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” Many think that all Jesus came to do was to save us from sin, no; He achieved much more. He saved us from our sins so we could become sons of God. His ultimate aim was to give us the God-life, the God-nature of righteousness, so we could be in fellowship with God.</p>
<p>When He hung on the Cross of crucifixion, we were in Him. He was made sin for us. When He died and was buried, in the mind of justice, we all died and were buried in Him. And that was the end of sin. Our sins were buried with Him. But here’s the most sublime part: on the third day, when God raised Him from the dead, we were also raised together with Him into a newness of life. Romans 6:4 says, “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”
Your past with all the failures, weaknesses, and defeat, were buried with Him. Now that you’re born again, you have a new life in Christ Jesus; a life of glory and righteousness. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>🗣 CONFESSION</p>
<p>Having been baptized into Christ in His death, and raised up with Him in His resurrection, I now walk in the newness of life. My past with all the failures and defeat are all gone, because I’m a new creation in Christ. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>(You Have His Love Nature)</p>
<p>“That Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height—to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.”- EPHESIANS 3:17-19</p>
<p>The scripture above is a beautiful prayer by the apostle Paul for the Body of Christ. In it, he lets us know that with the knowledge of the love of Christ, we will be filled with all the fullness of God. When the love of Christ is working in you, you’ll love every single person that comes across your path, no matter how seemingly worthless, insignificant or unlovable they may appear.</p>
<p>When the Bible says in John 3:16, “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son” (John 3:16), it wasn’t referring to the world of buildings, cars, machines, vegetation, oceans and mountains, but the world of people. That means He loves every single person in the world. You too ought to love everyone without discrimination; you have the capacity to love like God.</p>
<p>Make the clouds of Praise fill the Nations of the Earth…</p>
<p>Let your love for the people for whom Christ died motivate you to soul winning, so you can turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God.</p>
<p>🌏CONFESSION: I am a child of God, created in His very image of love. I have the ability to love like my heavenly Father who gave up His Son Jesus to die for my sake. The love of Christ has taken a hold of me, and I’m manifesting it by reaching out to my world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, Hallelujah.</p>

<p>Send us around the world with the news of your saving power and your eternal plan for all mankind (PSALM 67:2 TLB).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, in Mark 16:15, said, “Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” He commissioned us to preach the good news of God’s Kingdom, and God’s eternal plan for all humanity. Our responsibility, as preachers of righteousness, is the greatest honour and privilege on the face of the earth. We’re bearers of the news of His saving power; dispensers of eternal verities.</p>
<p>This was something the likes of David, the prophet of God, contemplated and wished to be a part of, hence his inspiring words in our opening verse. All he had was the promissory note of salvation, yet he was so inspired and excited, and wished he could go around the world to herald this great news of God’s saving power.</p>
<p>As new creations, and being in the world at a time when what David admired and looked forward to have been fulfilled, how could we be quiet? Jeremiah said, “But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay” (Jeremiah 20:9).</p>
<p>Make the Clouds of Praise fill the Nations of the Earth…</p>
<p>Make your life count with God by making an impact with the Gospel; be committed to soul winning. A very important evidence of the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life is dynamic evangelism! In Acts 1:8, Jesus said, “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me.” You can’t claim that God saved you, and not tell others about it. Don’t keep quiet; preach the Gospel everywhere.</p>
<p>The Bible says the Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes (Romans 1:16), and you’re the bearer of the message. The power won’t work except the message is preached. Therefore, be faithful in your responsibility as a soul winner.</p>
<p>🌏PRAYER🌏</p>
<p>Righteous Father, I’m so grateful for your boundless blessings in my life. Thank you for the power of the Spirit that’s at work in me to effectively minister the Gospel to those in my world, and in the regions beyond. Your grace is released even now for hearts to be touched, and converted by the news of your saving power, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>&quot;Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully&quot; (1 Peter 5:7 AMPC).</p>
<p>What a remarkable scripture! You don&#x27;t have to worry over anything in life. Roll all your cares over to Him. You and God can&#x27;t be caring about the same things, and the same time. If you&#x27;re going to be fretful and anxious, He can&#x27;t intervene, because your worries will stop His power from flowing your way. Refuse to care! Confess the Word and say, &quot;I refuse to be anxious over anything. However, in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, I make my request known unto God; therefore, His peace that surpasses all understanding garrisons my heart and mind in Christ Jesus&quot; (Philippians 4:6-7).</p>
<p>Perhaps you have a loved one who might be in danger. Instead of crying out in fear, &quot;Oh God, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening; say, &quot;Father, I thank you because I know that you care! You&#x27;re in charge; therefore, my loved one is protected.&quot; Confess that God cares! Be conscious that He cares. Jesus Christ was so conscious of the Father; He spoke of Him all the time. I have that consciousness! He says, I will not leave you fatherless (John 14:18), and He sent the Holy Spirit to take care of us, because He cares.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re not fatherless. There&#x27;s someone who cares for you; He&#x27;s your heavenly Father. He cares about every detail of your life; He cares about everything that pertains to you. He perfects all that concerns you, and you&#x27;re important to Him; He knows your name. No matter the situation, get into your closet, shut the world out, and lift your hands and say, &quot;I have a Father, the Almighty; He&#x27;s King of kings and Lord of lords, and He cares for me.&quot; You&#x27;re not alone; greater is He that&#x27;s in you than all the troubles in the world.</p>

<p>&quot;And ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, WHOM SATAN HATH BOUND, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?&quot; (LUKE 13:16)</p>
<p>In praying for the sick to get well, there&#x27;re certain truths to be mindful of; otherwise, you may pray from sunup to sundown with little or no impact. First, recognize that God wants them well; He isn&#x27;t the one responsible for the sickness. Some believe God uses sickness to carry out His plan or to correct His children; that&#x27;s a lie from the pit of hell. No sickness is from God.</p>
<p>Secondly, does that sick person want to be well? This would be an important question to answer. Jesus asked certain folks in the Bible who apparently were in distressing health situation the simple question, &quot;What do you want?&quot; So, it&#x27;s important the person is willing and ready to get well and that there&#x27;s mutual faith.</p>
<p>Thirdly, be in tune with the Spirit. The Holy Spirit can guide you to know whether or not a demon is responsible for that sickness or disease. That way, you&#x27;re able to deal with the situation. For example, the woman that was bowed-over in Luke 13, Jesus showed us Satan was responsible for her infirmity. The moment Jesus cast the devil out, the woman was healed.</p>
<p>Never be afraid of demons or evil spirits. The Name of Jesus is greater than all. We cast out evil spirits with words, as Jesus did. In Matthew 10:8, Luke 9:2, Luke 10:9, Jesus charged the disciples to heal the sick, and He didn&#x27;t ask them to pray to Him or to the Father to heal the sick. Evidently, we have authority from Jesus to heal the sick and bring health and joy to a dying world. Be bold about it. Glory to God!</p>

<p>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest (JOSHUA 1:9)</p>
<p>The scripture above was God’s message to Joshua, as he led the children of Israel through the wilderness. God said to him, “Be not afraid.” Why? Because there were frightful experiences in his way. But God said, “Be not afraid.” Then He took it further; He said, “neither be thou dismayed.” When things begin to look like you’ve been defeated, don’t be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you. What an assurance!</p>
<p>Many years ago, I heard a story that’s remained indelibly on my mind. A Pastor told a story of how God visited a certain man in a vision. As he and the Lord walked together, the Lord assured him “I am with you no matter how difficult the journey may be.” Though he couldn’t see the Lord, he could see the footprints. As they journeyed, there were two different footprints so, he was sure the Lord was with him. Every now and then, he looked and saw the Lord’s footprints, and kept going.</p>
<p>At a point, things got tougher and harder. Then he looked, but this time saw only one footprint! He cried and said, “Lord, where are you? Things are worse here! How could you leave me now that I need you the most?” Then he heard the voice of God, “I’m still here.” But the man said, “No, I was seeing your footprints all along; but you’ve stopped. All I see now are my footprints.” Then God said, “No, the footprints that you see aren’t your footprints; they’re mine, because I ’m now carrying you.”</p>
<p>What a soul-stirring response from the Lord! How loving our God is! Even when we’re not aware, and it looks like He’s left us, He’s there. The man was crying because he thought he was alone. But God was carrying him. He has said, “I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee” (Hebrews 13:5). At the most difficult part of the journey, He’ll carry you.</p>
<p>Those times you look around and don’t seem to find any sign of His presence, the Lord is there with you. He’ll never leave you nor forsake you; even when everyone else deserts you, He’s always with you. So, be encouraged; be strengthened, and be full of joy. The Lord your God is with you, and He lives in you. You’re never alone! Shout Glory!!!</p>

<p>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints (EPHESIANS 6:18)</p>
<p>The more time you spend in fellowship with the Lord through prayer, the more His character and personality are revealed in and through you. This is one of the most exciting benefits of prayer. Through prayer, your spiritual antenna is raised to pick God&#x27;s thought and think like Him. Some people only pray when they&#x27;re compelled to do so by certain challenges they face in life, and that&#x27;s not right. As Christians we were called into fellowship with our heavenly father.</p>
<p>You get to know the Lord and love Him more as you fellowship with Him through prayer and study of the Word. Praying, and praying the right way, is an important activity in the life of every Christian. It makes your life beautiful, vibrant, and exuberant with praise at all times. Take your personal times of prayer, devotions, and meditation very seriously. Create the opportunities in the course of your day to fellowship with the Lord through prayer.</p>
<p>When you pray often, especially in the spirit, you&#x27;ll live with a pure heart toward all men; you won&#x27;t criticize others as you will see only the good in them. Learn to intercede for others more than ever before.</p>
<p>1Timothy 2:1 says, &quot;I exhort therefore, that,  first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be make for all men.&quot; Take this domination of the Spirit seriously. Consciously practise this today! Take some time to pray for those around you, and for those in distant lands; it&#x27;s your priestly responsibility to do this.</p>
<p>As you spend more time in prayer, your  life will flourish from glory to glory because prayer is more than just an opportunity to get God to do something for you! It&#x27;s a time to commune with the Lord and bask in rich spiritual consciousness; so give more time and attention to prayer. May God strengthen us to pray in Jesus name. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>And these signs shall follow them that believe…they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (MARK 16:17-18)</p>
<p>In the past year, perhaps, more than ever in the history e this generation, we’ve seen intense distress of nations, with many living in immense fear. Even amongst Christians, we’ve seen church leaders go as far as putting up a sign to indicate they’re shutting down their churches because of fear.</p>
<p>But such actions are inconsistent with the ministry of Jesus Christ in whom we’ve believed. How can a Christian—who the Bible says is the salt of the earth and the light of the world, the one who’s anointed with the Holy Ghost; a God-carrying vessel—be afraid?</p>
<p>Jesus highlighted the signs with which to identify those who believe in Him, part of which we read in our opening scripture. No one who truly believes in Jesus will be afraid of any sickness or infectious disease. He said in Luke 10:19, “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>reaction to the things going on in the world today shows whether or not you truly believe in Jesus. It’s the pressures of life that reveal your convictions. If as a Christian, you’re “afraid” of sickness or disease, then in which God did you believe? Certainly not the same God that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the Prophets and the Apostles knew and talked about.</p>
<p>For many years, I’ve laid hands on people with some of the most contagious diseases in the world; very infectious diseases; but I could never have any fear of becoming infected, because it’s the same ministry of Jesus, by the life and power of the Holy Spirit. We have the divine life  that’s “uninfectable” and impregnable to any sickness or disease. Take the Word of God seriously; study it; believe it, and live it.</p>
<p>🗣️CONFESSION🌍
I’ve been sent forth to be the solution to the problems of the world, and I’m fulfilling my ministry. I’m a partaker of the divine nature. I’m conscious that I have power over sickness, disease and infirmities; to heal them and live above them. This is my reality. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>“Ye also, as lively stones are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ&quot; (1 PETER 2:5).</p>
<p>Part of our ministry toward God as New Testament priests includes giving Him thanks, praising Him, presenting our bodies to Him and living holy lives before Him. These are our expressions of worship. You may have wondered, what are these sacrifices? Well, the scripture informs us that these sacrifices are “the fruit of our lips” (HEBREWS 13:15).</p>
<p>Just as the priest offered sacrifices of burnt offerings and burnt incense in the Old Testament, we in the New Testament offer sacrifices of praise to God with our words. Thus, praising God means giving thanks to His Name for definite reasons. Thus the sacrifices we should offer are the sacrifice of praise (Hebrews 13:15) and a living sacrifice of our bodies (Romans 12:1). The sacrifices of praise are the confessions, declarations, psalms, hymns and spiritual songs of the glory, grace and goodness of God that we make unto Him.</p>
<p>Too many times, people associate prayer with problems when ideally they don’t need to have a problem to pray. Prayer is a ministry for us as New Testament believers. This is why you can turn away from everyone and every thing to worship the Lord and adore Him. As you do this, you send forth incense unto God (Revelation 5:7; 8:2-3). Anybody can pray but it takes the child of God to send forth incense by the Spirit into the presence of God.</p>
<p>As we worship and praise God and present our bodies a living sacrifice to Him, His presence rubs upon us and overshadows us. His presence breaks us. A lot of Christians don’t know what it is to be broken. John the Baptist said, “He must increase, but I must decrease” (John 3:30). That’s exactly what happens to us when we stay in continual contact with God through worship. Then, our flesh becomes subdued until it’s broken, and the beauty and essence of God within our spirit is fully released.</p>

<p>&quot;Therefore encourage (admonish, exhort) one another and edify (strengthen and build up) one another, just as you are doing&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:11 AMPC).</p>
<p>There&#x27;re Christians who got offended and almost gave up the faith because someone in their local church mistreated or disappointed them. That&#x27;s wrong. God didn&#x27;t tell us everyone in the church will like us, treat us well and always be helpful to us. But He told you to like others, treat them well, and always be willing to help. So, it begins with YOU!</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t let the reason you&#x27;re the member of any particular church or group in church be that you&#x27;re looking for someone to help you; rather, develop a desire to render service, to help others. Acts 20:35 tells us that it&#x27;s more blessed to give than to receive.</p>
<p>If you felt ignored, rejected and uncared for, this should let you know what some others might be feeling too. So, take up the responsibility and look out for those in a similar situation and encourage and strengthen them. That&#x27;s Christian ministry; it&#x27;s one of the beautiful blessings and privileges you get from being a member of a local church. The Church---the local church---has a ministry, and God wants you to be a vital member.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no one on earth who has no family; everyone belongs in a family. If you find that you&#x27;re the only one you know in your entire family, reach out and help someone else who&#x27;s lonely, and make them part of your family. You should never be alone. Don&#x27;t live for yourself only. Be responsible for others, just as there&#x27;re leaders over you who are responsible for you.</p>

<p>(Fasting Amplifies God’s Signals In Your Spirit) ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~8911</p>
<p>Daniel 10:12 NASB He said to me, “Do not be afraid, Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words&quot;.</p>
<p>“Why do we have to fast?” Mark asked his Cell leader during their meeting. “Can’t God just answer our prayers without us having to fast?” he went on. “God doesn’t answer our prayers because we fast,” his Cell leader replied, “our prayers are immediately heard and answered because we’re His beloved children.” Note the underlined part of our opening verse: Daniel’s prayer was answered the very first day he prayed. The important thing about fasting is the “purpose” of the fast. The quality of a fast isn’t so much dependent on its longevity as it is on its purpose.</p>
<p>God isn’t “moved” or influenced by the length of your fast. Your fasting only influences and affects you. Fasting makes you more conscious of the divine nature in you. Telecommunications companies use tall masts, rising high into the sky, to raise antennas above the “interference level” so they can receive clear signals from surrounding base stations. Similarly, fasting helps to raise your spiritual antenna so you can be attuned to God’s frequency in such a way that His signals are amplified and clearer to you. The kind of fast ’m referring to is the kind where you separate yourself from all distractions and spend time to pray, study, and meditate on God’s Word. At such times, it becomes easy for the Lord to get your attention, minister to you, and transform your life because your affection is fully set on Him.</p>
<p>Through this kind of purposeful fasting, your spirit stands up like a giant, the influence of the flesh wanes, and your divinity rises. At such a time, when you utter a word, it transcends the arena of the human mind; it proceeds from your spirit with the potency and energy of the Holy Ghost to accomplish what you desire. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Mark 11:23 NIV
“I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Go, throw yourself into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him”</p>
<p>Life produces for you a garden of all the words you’ve said and will ever say. Get this because this is the truth, and there’s no middle ground! As a Christian, you must keep talking the Word only; if you want to live in health, talk health. If you’re going to walk in righteousness and always produce fruits of righteousness, then talk righteousness; every so often, consciously declare, “I’m the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. I produce fruits of righteousness.”</p>
<p>You’ve got to say it to live it. You might say, “What if I haven’t been saying anything? What will my life be like?” You’d still have a garden; unfortunately, it’ll be full of “weeds” because you’d have left your garden unattended, and weeds will definitely grow of their own accord. So, keep yourself in victory, dominion and prosperity with your words.</p>
<p>God already did all that’s necessary for you to have and enjoy life in Christ to the full, through the power of the Holy Spirit. It’s your responsibility now to keep things that way, and it’s mainly by your confession. Constantly affirm that you’ve got a great life. Declare that you’ve been called to glory and virtue; it’s a life of power and moral excellence. Make these declarations every day.
There isn’t anything you don’t have (1 Corinthians 3:21; 2 Peter 1:3), and there isn’t anything you can’t do (Philippians 4:13). Therefore, always declare abundance, supernatural provisions, strength, possibilities and victories, and your life will go in that direction only.</p>

<p>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever (2 CHRONICLES 20:21).</p>
<p>As Christians, God hears and answers when we pray, but how to make His power that is released on our behalf work for us is what many don’t know. One of the ways to activate that power is through praise! Throughout the Scriptures, we find amazing and inspiring accounts of how God delivered His people from imminent destruction and dire circumstances, when they activated His power through praise.</p>
<p>Three nations—Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir—came out against Judah and made ready to attack her. However, King Jehoshaphat was wise. He gathered all Judah together to seek the Lord in prayer and fasting. When they prayed, God revealed to them the exact location of their enemies’ camp, and gave them the strategy to defeat them. 2 Chronicles 20:22 says, “When they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.” When trouble strikes, like Jehoshaphat, “put the singers in front” and you’ll have the same result.</p>
<p>Don’t wait until you feel like singing before you make a melody in your heart and sing praises unto the Lord. Whether you feel like it or not, whether you’re happy or not, praise Him all the same. Paul and Silas experienced a supernatural jailbreak by offering this kind of unusual praise.</p>
<p>For preaching the Gospel, they were tortured and incarcerated in a Roman maximum-security prison. However, at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises to God. As they did, the power of God was activated and they were supernaturally set free (Acts 16:25-26). This miraculous encounter led to the salvation of the prison warden and his entire family. You may be faced with a difficult situation today for which you’ve prayed and confessed that it’s all working out for your good, yet, nothing seems to have changed. Don’t give up! It’s time you offered to God the unusual praise. Speak and sing joyous tongues of praise and thanksgiving, and as you do, the power of God will move on your behalf, and you’ll have a great Miracle.</p>

<p>&quot;Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?&quot; (1 CORINTHIANS 3:16)</p>
<p>Have you ever heard some Christians sing, &quot;Holy Spirit, come down; rain down on us.&quot; Such a song is inconsistent with truth, because the Holy Spirit already came down on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-3) and lives in you today. It&#x27;s also no use singing, &quot;Come live in me Holy Spirit.&quot; It&#x27;s clear from our opening scripture that He dwells in you: &quot;Know ye not that  ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?&quot; (1 Corinthians 3:16).</p>
<p>Some even get emotional and cry, singing, &quot;Fill me, O Lord!&quot; But the Word never said God is going to fill you. Paul, by the Spirit, said in Ephesians 5:18, &quot;And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.&quot; It&#x27;s your responsibility to be filled with the Spirit. He told you to do it. Therefore, no matter how much you sing and cry to the Lord to fill you, you&#x27;ll never be filled, because the Word already shows how to get filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Singing the wrong songs creates unbelief and deepens ignorance. Therefore, when you sing, listen to the words; sing songs that are founded on the truth of God&#x27;s Word in the Gospel of Christ. Our worship, praise and thanksgiving or even songs of edification must be correctly delivered in words consistent with the New Testament of Christ. It&#x27;s not about singing your favourite song or the one that gives you goose bumps; it&#x27;s about singing scriptural songs of the present truth.</p>

<p>&quot;A man&#x27;s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit&quot; (Proverbs 29:23).</p>
<p>Some people have the erroneous idea that you have to be rich to be proud. However, the rich and successful people aren&#x27;t always proud. In most cases, true success and riches are the expression of humility.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &quot;But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble&quot; (James 4:6). So for the rich man to be exalted thus, it means he must have been humble at some point in his life. Forget about those who may have used the wrong means to attain some level of status in the society. I&#x27;m talking about those who through their hard work or some blessing of favour have found themselves journeying successfully on the ladder of wealth or prominence.</p>
<p>The spiritual principle is that a man first must be humble to get into the position of greatness. Pride will impede your prosperity. Saul, the king of Israel, started out as a humble man. The Lord chose him as king over His people, Israel, because of his humility (1 Samuel 15:17). But when he became proud and impudent a few years into his reign in Israel, the Lord took the kingship away from him and his household, and gave it to David, a lowly shepherd boy.</p>
<p>Humble people impress God. No wonder the Bible says that God exalts the humble; no wonder a timid fisherman like Peter became a great apostle; no wonder a harlot like Rahab became a forebear of the Lord Jesus; no wonder an injurious personality like Saul became the great apostle Paul. How does God see you? Make up your mind to walk in humility today.</p>

<p>Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments; As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore (PSALM 133:1-3).</p>
<p>One of the many benefits of going to church is the opportunity for corporate worship. Worshipping God on your own is wonderful, but as Christians, we’re required to come together in our respective congregations to worship the Lord, because His intention is to grow His children as families. Of course, there’re families where nobody recognizes another—no communication between parents and the children—that’s not ideal.</p>
<p>God lets us have our individual worship, individual prayers, individual Christian service, but there’s also corporate worship, corporate prayer, and corporate service; things we do together as a congregation.</p>
<p>In as much as each one of us has the responsibility to study the Word of God on our own, we should also come together to hear the Word of God as a congregation. These are Christian responsibilities and they’re designed by God for the growth, nourishment, and strengthening of the individual child of God, and the body of Christ as a whole.</p>
<p>Don’t miss such things. They’re not just programmes of the church; they’re responsibilities given to us through the Word of God. It’s got nothing to do with whether you feel like it or not, because even when you don’t feel like going to work on a Monday morning, you still go because the job is important to you.</p>
<p>Ensure to take advantage of the corporate worship with fellow believers. David said, “I was glad when they said let us go into the house of the Lord” (Psalm 122:1). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>🌍PRAYER🌍
Dear Father, thank you for the instructiveness of your Word. Now, more than ever, I take going to fellowshipping believers church with seriously. and other And in accordance with your Word, your blessings are evidently manifested in my life, and your glory is seen in all that I do, in Jesus’ Name.

<p>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might… For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand (EPHESIANS 6:10-13)</p>
<p>The first part of our opening scripture admonishes that you be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might. The Lord never tells us to do something we couldn’t do. If He says, “Be strong in the Lord,” it means that’s what you need to do. He gives further instructions in the eleventh verse: “Put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”</p>
<p>This is telling you to prepare, and stay prepared ahead of the evil day. He tells you what to do against the devil. If you put on the whole armour of God as He has said, you’ll be able to stand against all the stratagems, schemes, maneuvers, and manipulations of the devil.</p>
<p>The reason many falter when they face challenges is that they don’t act on the Word. In the verses we read in our theme scripture, God instructed us clearly on what to do. What He said in verse thirteen is the reason for verses 10-12. There’s a day of trouble (the evil day); it’s to be anticipated. There’s an enemy out there seeking whom to devour, and when he has the opportunity, he’ll strike. But we’re not ignorant of His devices.</p>
<p>Satan isn’t a factor. As long as you’re strong in the Lord—keeping His Word in your heart and in your mouth—you’ll discomfit the enemy whenever he shows up. As long as the Word of God is your arsenal, you’ll always win. The Word of God is the sword of the Spirit with which you cut the devil down. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body more than raiment&quot; (Matthew 6:25).</p>
<p>God doesn&#x27;t want you worried over anything. When worry attacks your mind, don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to go away on its own; no. Worry is spiritual; that&#x27;s why you have to repel it with your shield of faith: &quot;Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked&quot; (Ephesians 6:16).</p>
<p>You need to protect and defend yourself against worry and then go on the offensive with the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God in your mouth, concerning your situation. That&#x27;s what you use to repel worry: the &quot;Rhema&quot; of God in your mouth.</p>
<p>What does God&#x27;s Word say? It says, &quot;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus&quot; (Philippians 4:6-7 NIV). Don&#x27;t sit there worrying and whining; decĺare what you want and give thanks to God because it&#x27;s done. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Having done that, it says, &quot;The peace of God that surpasses understanding, will garrison your heart and mind in Christ Jesus.&quot; So, here you are, circumstances don&#x27;t look right, everything looks like there&#x27;s trouble; yet, you&#x27;re at peace! Others can&#x27;t understand how you can be absolutely unflustered in the midst of so much trouble. The reason is simple: you&#x27;re acting on the Word! You&#x27;ve cast all your cares upon Him (1 Peter 5:7). That&#x27;s how to live a worry-free life.</p>

<p>(Your True Value With God)</p>
<p>“Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all, especially to those who are of the household of faith.” - Galatians 6:10</p>
<p>God’s most valuable assets on earth are not its breath-taking natural wonders or the fancy cars, airplanes, and architectural masterpieces; they’re people! The Bible says, God so loved the world, not the world of things, but the world of people, that He gave His only begotten Son to die for us and show us our value (John 3:16). You’re valuable to God; that’s why He doesn’t want you sick or poor. He wants you well, happy, and prosperous.</p>
<p>God expects you to value others the same way He values you. Don’t despise people. It’s easy to tell whether or not you love people from the way you talk to them. If at any time you’ve despised someone, you ought to fall on your knees in repentance before the Lord and ask Him to forgive you. Understand that no matter how famous or successful you may be, having value and true regard for people is what counts much with God.</p>
<p>You may be great at preaching and winning souls but that’s nothing to God if you haven’t learned to walk in love and value people for who they really are (1 Corinthians 13:1-3). He’s only impressed by the compassion we have and show to the people around us. He’s impressed by the love you show to those for whom Jesus died; that is what makes us true soul winners, and true disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ. “By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:35).</p>

<p>And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel (1 CHRONICLES 21:1)</p>
<p>The Bible shows how evil spirits influence men to do wrong. One of such instances is what we read about David in our theme verse. Imagine David, a righteous king, was moved by Satan to number Israel against God’s will. As a result, God took actions against Israel.</p>
<p>There’s another incident recorded for us in the gospels. When Jesus made it clear to His disciples that it was necessary for Him to die on account of our sins and be raised back  to life for our justification,  Peter took Him aside and began to “rebuke” Him, saying, “God forbid, Lord! This must never happen to you; you’re not going to die” (Matthew 16:22).</p>
<p>Jesus, right away, identified that it was Satan speaking through Peter, and the Bible says “he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind  me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men” (Matthew 16:23). So, even good men can be moved by Satan to do or say the wrong things. That’s why God wants us to know the truth; know His Word. When you know the truth, you can walk in the light of it. You’ll know how to pray, and how to put a stop to Satan’s works and influences around you.</p>
<p>Learn to pray for all nations of men, leaders and those in authority as admonished in 1 Timothy 2:1-2. Boldly declare by the Spirit that the will, plans and purposes of God be established in and around you, in the  hearts of leaders in your community, city, town, nation and in the organisation where you work. Pray that they refuse to yield to negative influences that could stir them to wickedness; rather, they rule with justice and equity, righteousness and truth. Amen.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s important as a Christian to know what God expects of you. For example, even in prayer, How do you pray? Do you just pray as you wish?
No, you pray and live According to his word, always and in everything.
You should want to know how to please God because that&#x27;s what your life is about.
You have to know his will in order to please Him
Jesus said He always did those things that pleased the Father.
But you can&#x27;t please him unless you know his will!: His word.
Only through through scriptures can you identify God&#x27;s will and plan.</p>
<p>For example, in the OT there were kings and those who followed them who thought that praying to one God was not enough. So they said &quot;let&#x27;s pray to many gods&quot;... Like most politicians are doing today.
When they are in a public event, they pray to all the gods.
This is crazy. It&#x27;s a demonstration of confusion.
You cannot pray to all the gods.</p>
<p>2 Kings 21:1-6
Manasseh was the longest reigning King in Israel.
V3: He served all the heavenly bodies and built altars for them
5-6 NIV- He did so much evil. He sacrificed his own son in the fire. Consulted mediums ,(like those Christians who use the horoscope)</p>
<p>He offended God with all of these kinds of worship.</p>
<p>2 Kings 23:5
This was King Josiah. Look at what he did.
He pleased God.</p>
<p>What does the bible say about such things?
1 Cor 10:19-20 (NKJV)
Gentiles sacrifice to Demons.</p>
<p>When Israelites were offering those sacrifices to those so called gods, they were worshipping demons.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s the same thing today.
God told us to flee from idolatry. Don&#x27;t be involved in idolatry. Don&#x27;t worship demons/devils.</p>
<p>Through the word of God we can know God&#x27;s will, plans,where we stand, what we are supposed to do in any situation.</p>
<p>Romans 4: 12-
V13- God made a promise to Abraham that he should be the Heir of the world. God willed the world to Abraham and his seed.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:29
If you belong to Christ, you are Abraham&#x27;s seed.
That&#x27;s amazing!</p>
<p>This is in Christ Jesus! (Gal 3:16)
God didn&#x27;t say &quot;seeds&quot;, He said &quot;seed&quot; which is Christ.
Thus the promises made to Abraham and his seed were made to Christ.</p>
<p>Hebrews 2: 5
Heb.2.5 - For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.
Heb.2.6 - But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
Heb.2.7 - Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:
Heb.2.8 - Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
Heb.2.9 - But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
Heb.2.10 - For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
Heb.2.11 - For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</p>
<p>God gave man so much authority, but in the present situation of things/conditions, you don&#x27;t see that. Man looks like a victim so many times. Man goes through so many trials and difficulties..
But..
We see Jesus, Crowned with glory and honor.
Right now, Jesus has full authority over all things.
So if you think about yourself like an ordinary man or woman, look up and see Jesus who is already crowned with glory and honor; who already has full authority.
Just look at him
He&#x27;s got the power already.
Look at him
He is already crowned with glory and honor
he is not going to be</p>

<p>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed (Acts 16:25-26).</p>
<p>In the sixteenth chapter of the book of Acts, Luke tells us an inspiring story of how Paul and Silas were incarcerated; persecuted for preaching the Gospel. They were put into the inner prison, in chains; their feet were fastened in stocks. But something happened as they began to sing joyfully: there was an earthquake to bring them out of prison.</p>
<p>Many times, all we do is make requests in prayer. But there’s power in praising the Lord joyfully. The Bible says “Rejoice evermore” (1 Thessalonians 5:16). There’ll always be circumstances and situations that’ll try to get your attention and knock your joy off. Sometimes, it may be some wave of bad news to make you sad and angry or some issues on your mind. Whatever the case, refuse to worry; be joyful in praise to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “Casting the whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you watchfully” (1 Peter 5:7 AMPC). And then He says, “Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6-7 NKJV).</p>
<p>Someone might say, “I only get anxious when the issues get very serious.” No, Jesus said, “Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in me” (John 14:1). Yes! Nothing should ever trouble you. That’s why it’s important to meditate on the Word of God. Through meditation on the Word, you’re conditioned to have the right mindset; you can’t but be joyful!</p>
<p>The Prophet said, “I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God” (Isaiah 61:10). The psalmist said, “And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation” (Psalm 35:9). The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 21:16, “have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?” Learn to praise the Lord joyfully always.</p>
<p>Say these after me, &#x27;Dear Father, my heart is filled with the joy and laughter of the Spirit today. The joy of the Lord in my life is independent of circumstances. It doesn’t matter what news or event tries to make me unhappy; I’m always joyful in the Holy Ghost, with whom I’m ever victorious. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>1 Peter 1:8 (KJV) Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:
.
Proverbs 17:22 (KJV) A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.</p>
<p>Psalm 30:11-12 (KJV) Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; 12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</p>

<p>And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it (Colossians 4:17).</p>
<p>As a child of God, it’s important that you locate yourself in God’s purpose for your life and function in it. Functioning in God’s purpose for you will make your life count both in quality and in the impact you make in the world.</p>
<p>There’re three basic ways you can find and keep yourself in God’s purpose for you. First is by praying often in the spirit. Praying in the spirit helps to position you in line with God’s thinking and activate your spirit to receive His thoughts. When your spirit is activated, he’s then able to receive God’s signals, counsel and guidance. Then you find that your actions are in sync with God’s purpose and plan for your life.</p>
<p>Something else you have to do to locate yourself and function in God’s purpose is to focus on those things God has called you to do. If you keep your focus and refuse to be distracted, you’ll be walking in God’s purpose from one level of glory to another. Don’t push to the future the things God has asked you to do now; focus on them and do them NOW, for your future begins now! So now is the time to do the things God has asked you to do.</p>
<p>The third thing to do in locating yourself in God’s purpose is to meditate on God’s Word; assimilate His thoughts into your spirit. That way, your spirit will be conditioned to act in line with the will of God. If you do these three things, the necessary result is that the Spirit of God will guide you into the perfect will of God for your life, such that you’ll never have to wonder whether or not you’re doing the right thing; you’ll know.</p>
<p>Say these after me, &#x27;Dear Father, thank you for granting me length of days, and for helping me fulfil my destiny and calling in Christ. I’m running my race swiftly, pressing towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, under the inspiration of your Spirit, and guidance of your Word, in Jesus’ Name. Amen</p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 1:11Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:</p>
<p>Acts 13:22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.</p>

<p>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success (JOSHUA 1:8)</p>
<p>This scripture is your recipe for success. The Amplified version says: “This Book of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe {and} do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall deal wisely {and} have good success.” Notice it didn’t say “God shall make your way prosperous,” but that “YOU shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall deal wisely in the affairs of life and have good success.” But for this to happen, you must meditate on the Word.</p>
<p>This is what many haven’t learnt; the importance and power of meditation. The subject of your meditation should be consistent with the provisions of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Meditating on anything else that’s not consistent with the Gospel will not produce lasting results. Meditating on God’s Word often, will make you deal wisely in the affairs of life. You’ll become circumspect and penetratingly perceptive; you’ll have extraordinary amplitude of comprehension.</p>
<p>The wisdom of God will function in you so much that when you make decisions or take actions on anything, it will be just right. Learn to consciously meditate on the Scriptures. In Psalm 119:97, David said, “O how love I thy law! It is my meditation all the day.” No wonder he was so successful and dealt wisely as king over Israel. As you think through, talk and shout God’s Word in meditation, you’re programming yourself for the upward and forward life, and your success will be apparent to all.</p>

<!-- -->Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content (PHILIPPIANS 4:11).</p>
<p>Pastor Chris Says
━━━━━━━━━━
One of the attributes of God is that He’s self-sufficient. He doesn’t need anything from anyone or anywhere. Everything is in Him. He doesn’t “need” power; He is power. He doesn’t “need” wisdom; He is wisdom. He doesn’t “need” righteousness; He is righteousness. He’s the selfexistent and self-sufficient God. Did you know that’s the life He’s given you as well?</p>
<p>Like Him, you don’t have to depend on external forces or factors. Everything you require to fulfil all that God wants you to do, and to be all that He created you to be is in you. Consider the Greek rendering of the word “content” in our theme scripture; it’s “autarkes,” from where the English derived the word “Autarchy.”</p>
<p>Autarchy is the policy of economic independence on external forces; to be self-sufficient. When you study 2 Corinthians 9:8 (AMPC), you see this clearly as God’s will for His children. It says, “And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].”</p>
<p>This is simple to comprehend because truly, a Christian is one in whom Christ dwells, and Christ is everything. When you have Christ, you’re full; you have it all. This was something I meditated on much in my youth, and I made up my mind it was going to be my experience and it’s been ever since.</p>
<p>Make up your mind to live in blessings and abundance, because it’s the life God has given to you in Christ. Refuse to allow circumstances determine or dictate the outcome of your life. Live in God’s Word. Even if it’s power you thought you needed, the Holy Spirit Himself, who is the power of God, lives in you. His power in you is inherent; self-generating. Your responsibility is to activate and put it to work at all times. Get to know who you are and live accordingly, independent of circumstances. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>🗣️PRAYER
Dear Father, I thank you, for you’ve granted me all things that pertain to life and godliness. No matter what happens, I’ll always be on top, because everything I require for absolute victory and supernatural prosperity is in my spirit. I bring forth success from within me, and I’m moving from glory to glory, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (COLOSSIANS 1:27).</p>
<p>If you’ve ever been to Israel and the Old City of Jerusalem, you’d have heard of or visited the Western Wall, or Wailing Wall. It’s one of the most significant historic sites for the Jewish people. While thousands of people from different nationalities throng the Wailing Wall every year to relish this archeological masterpiece, others religiously journey there to say or recite prayers, hoping their prayers will be answered faster at this site.</p>
<p>No doubt, the Wailing Wall is an iconic religious site, but God isn’t more there than He is in you. Some are carried away by the idea that if they pray at, let’s say a “prayer mountain,” a forest, or the Wailing Wall, God will hear them more. If that were true, Jesus would have taught about it; He’d have instructed us to pray at the Wailing Wall, but He didn’t.</p>
<p>The Apostles would have said so too, but they didn’t. In fact, Jesus said, “believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father…But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him” (John 4:21-23). The inspiration and blessing of the New Testament is in your heart; it’s with you everywhere.
═══════════════</p>
<p>The Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, reveals the truth about Christianity—the mystery that was hidden from ages and from generations. That mystery is “Christ in you, the hope of glory” (Colossians 1:26-27). This is God’s vision; that’s the reason for the New Testament. Everything you’d ever need in life is in Christ, and Christ is in you; to have Christ is to have everything.</p>
<p>Henceforth, look into your heart, for that’s where all the answer is. Christ resides in your heart. You’ve already been blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ (Ephesians 1:3). The totality of the character and nature of the man Jesus, all that He represents—His life, power, wisdom, majesty, glory and grace—are all tabernacled in you. This is the blessing of the New Testament. Praise God!

📖 And these signs shall follow them that believe… They shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (MARK 16:17-18)
═══════════════</p>
<p>Acts 28 shows us one of Paul’s experiences on the Island of Malta where he and a company of others stayed as a result of a shipwreck. During their stay, the Bible says Paul healed the father of Publius. Publius was the headman in that part of the island: “And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him” (Acts 28:8).</p>
<p>Notice the spirit’s language; it says Paul prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him. Some people tell us, “We must be very humble and never say we healed anybody; only God heals.” But Jesus told us to heal the sick. He was very emphatic; He said, “Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give” (Matthew 10:8).</p>
<p>In Luke 9:1-2, the Bible says, “he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.” He made us healers. Hallelujah! Read Acts 14; the Bible says Paul was preaching in a city called Lystra and noticed a certain man who was crippled from his mother’s womb, and healed him (Acts 14:8-10).
═══════════════</p>
<p>The eleventh verse says, “And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.” Notice the underlined portion: the people saw what Paul had done. Understand that this is the Spirit’s account, His narration of what transpired. The Spirit says Paul did it.</p>
<p>You’re not an ordinary person; you’re a divine package of power to bless and heal your world. As you preach the Gospel, do what Jesus said to do: heal the sick, raise the dead, and cleanse the lepers. Your hands are  healing hands; they transmit the power of God. Through you, His divine presence is made manifest to those in your world.

If what the prophet spoke in GOD’s name doesn’t happen, then obviously GOD wasn’t behind it; the prophet made it up. Forget about him (DEUTERONOMY 18:22 MSG)         
═══════════════
When God gives a prophetic word, it’ll come to pass whether or not you believe it. Think about this: Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice” (Matthew 26:34). Did Peter believe? No! In fact, he insisted, “Even if I must die with You, I will not deny or disown You” (Matthew 26:35 AMPC).</p>
<p>But did the words of Jesus come to pass? Yes! Peter denied Jesus and disowned Him. In fact, on a certain occasion, Peter cursed and swore that he didn’t know Jesus. How about the story of Judas? When Jesus told His disciples one of them would betray Him, Judas Iscariot didn’t accept what Jesus said about him neither was he happy about it.</p>
<p>═══════════════
Then the Bible tells us in Luke 22:3 that an evil spirit entered into Judas Iscariot. When that happened, he walked out of where Jesus and the disciples were, went to the Chief Priests to conclude arrangements to betray Jesus. Look through the Scriptures, you’ll find several prophetic words to kings, and prophecies to nations; they didn’t have to believe those prophetic words, but the words came to pass nonetheless.</p>
<p>However, when you believe the prophetic word, you’ll be blessed; more so, when the word of prophecy concerns you for your benefit. For example, when Mary received the prophetic words about the birth of Jesus, she said, “Be it unto me, according to thy Word” (Luke 1:38).</p>
<p>Mary believed and gave birth to the Lord Jesus Christ (Luke 2:6-7) according to prophecy. The Bible says, “And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord” (Luke 1:45). When you believe, those words of blessings come to pass in your life. The difference, however, is that when God speaks prophetically about your nation, about your time, your course of life, whether or not you believe it, it’s going to happen anyway. So, what you do is to learn the Word; understand the Word; find and take your place in that prophetic word, and you’ll be victorious always.

<p>However, when you believe the prophetic word, you’ll be blessed; more so, when the word of prophecy concerns you for your benefit. For example, when Mary received the prophetic words about the birth of Jesus, she said, “Be it unto me, according to thy Word.” (Luke 1:38).</p>
<p>Mary believed and gave birth to the Lord Jesus Christ (Luke 2:6-7) according to prophecy. The Bible says, “And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord” (Luke 1:45). When you believe, those words of blessings come to pass in your life. The difference, however, is that when God speaks prophetically about your nation, about your time, your course of life, whether or not you believe it, it’s going to happen anyway. So, what you do is to learn the Word; understand the Word; find and take your place in that prophetic word, and you’ll be victorious always.

If what the prophet spoke in GOD’s name doesn’t happen, then obviously GOD wasn’t behind it; the prophet made it up. Forget about him (DEUTERONOMY 18:22 MSG)         
═══════════════
Pastor Chris Says:
When God gives a prophetic word, it’ll come to pass whether or not you believe it. Think about this: Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice” (Matthew 26:34). Did Peter believe? No! In fact, he insisted, “Even if I must die with You, I will not deny or disown You” (Matthew 26:35 AMPC).</p>
<p>But did the words of Jesus come to pass? Yes! Peter denied Jesus and disowned Him. In fact, on a certain occasion, Peter cursed and swore that he didn’t know Jesus. How about the story of Judas? When Jesus told His disciples one of them would betray Him, Judas Iscariot didn’t accept what Jesus said about him neither was he happy about it.</p>
<p>═══════════════
Then the Bible tells us in Luke 22:3 that an evil spirit entered into Judas Iscariot. When that happened, he walked out of where Jesus and the disciples were, went to the Chief Priests to conclude arrangements to betray Jesus. Look through the Scriptures, you’ll find several prophetic words to kings, and prophecies to nations; they didn’t have to believe those prophetic words, but the words came to pass nonetheless.</p>
<p>However, when you believe the prophetic word, you’ll be blessed; more so, when the word of prophecy concerns you for your benefit. For example, when Mary received the prophetic words about the birth of Jesus, she said, “Be it unto me, according to thy Word” (Luke 1:38).</p>

<p>“You brood of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak what is good? For the mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart. The good man brings out of his good treasure what is good; and the evil man brings out of his evil treasure what is evil. (MATTHEW 12:34-35 NASB)</p>
<p>God created the human heart with the ability of containing life or death. What you hear and believe about yourself determines what contents you’ll have in your heart. That’s why Proverbs 4:23 says, “Keep and guard your heart with all vigilance and above all that you guard, for out of it flow the springs of life” (AMPC). You should set a security watch at the doorpost of your heart, and scrutinise everything that seeks to enter in with God’s Word.</p>
<p>You won’t get the Word into you by watching movies, spending endless hours on the wrong internet sites, or chatting online. You’ve got to study the Word of God; learn it, master it, and live by it. This is so important because what you feed your spirit on is what will come out of your mouth eventually and govern your life.</p>
<p>You can make positive changes in your life every day. So, be on point with God’s Word, such that when the devil tries to approach you with his lies of sickness, fear and lack, you can show him the Word which declares to you your divine health, security and inheritance in Christ. Tell him what’s written and he’ll flee from you in terror!</p>
<p>Just as a sponge soaks in water, soak in the Word daily and it will ooze out of your mouth effortlessly! God’s Word in you will propel you on to a new and higher realm of faith! Hallelujah!</p>

<p>“Without having seen Him, you love Him; though you do not [even]now see Him, you believe in Him and exult and thrill with inexpressible and glorious (triumphant, heavenly) joy. [At the same time] you receive the result (outcome, consummation) of your faith, the salvation of your souls.”  - (1 PETER 1:8-9 AMP)</p>
<p>Being happy and full of joy is a personal decision and a deliberate choice that you have to make. Demons can’t stand joy, and if Satan can knock the joy out of you, he’ll have you in a corner. That’s why the Bible says, “Do not sorrow, for the joy of the Lord is your strength” (Nehemiah 8:10). This joy is in your spirit, and you’ve got to stir it up all the time.</p>
<p>One sure way to stir up joy in your spirit is to spend time fellowshipping with the Holy Spirit. Being born again, you’re in that environment of the Spirit, where there’s glory, life, righteousness, peace, and joy (Romans 14:17). Hallelujah! Those who function outside this environment face frustrations and easily get agitated, because nothing seems to work out in their lives. And because they’re constantly hurting, they tend to hurt others around them too. Don’t be that way!</p>
<p>In (John 15:11), Jesus said, “These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.” The Lord’s desire is for His joy to be in you twenty-four hours a day, irrespective of the circumstances you face. He’s given you joy that’s independent of the happenings around you; joy that flows from your spirit, indescribable and full of glory! (1 Peter 1:8). Inspire others by how you’re able to remain joyful and on top, in the midst of challenges.</p>
<p>Refuse to wear a sad look as though the whole world hung on your shoulders. Jesus has taken your sorrows and He’s brought you into His joy, abundance, and peace. Hallelujah! available without charge. That’s what Jesus did for us.</p>
<p>🌍CONFESSION: I’m full of joy, and strengthened by the Holy Spirit today! I live in God’s presence where fullness of joy and pleasures abound forevermore. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>&quot;And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes...I will also save you from your uncleanness: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you&quot; (Ezekiel 36:27-29)</p>
<p>True and lasting prosperity comes through the Holy Spirit. God says in Ezekiel 36-29 &quot;I will put My Spirit within you... and I will also save you from your uncleanness: and I will call for the corn, and will increase it&quot; In other words, He&#x27;s saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll get rid of the mess from your life, and then I will call for the corn&quot;; that&#x27;s prosperity! When the Holy Spirit starts living in you, He brings prosperity into your life.</p>
<p>In the Church of Jesus Christ, there&#x27;s been a lot of  preaching about prosperity. It&#x27;s been preached that &quot;When you give, God will give back to you.&quot; But you see, it doesn&#x27;t end there. So many of God&#x27;s people give; they sow seeds and give their offerings, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to come back to them multiplied as God said it would. Why? The reason is that when you sow your seed, if the rain doesn&#x27;t fall and there&#x27;s no water, something will go wrong with the seed. That rain is symbolic of the Holy Spirit in biblical parlance.</p>
<p>The Bible says, &quot;Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field&quot; (Zechariah 10:1). This is talking about the Holy Ghost! When you sow your seed or give to God, if it&#x27;s going to come back multiplied, it&#x27;s going to be as a result of the rain, and your prayer is what makes the rain to fall.</p>
<p>This is the mistake some Christians have made. They just give and then expect a harvest; they don&#x27;t pray. That&#x27;s like using God&#x27;s Word for gambling! When you give to God, you must recognize  that He is Almighty God, and then you pray in the Holy Ghost. That way, you water your seed. When you do that, you&#x27;ll have such a great harvest, there&#x27;ll be no room enough to receive it all, PRAISE God!</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prayer-and-fasting---pastor-chris-oyakhilome11806">PRAYER AND FASTING - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~11806<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to PRAYER AND FASTING - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~11806" title="Direct link to PRAYER AND FASTING - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~11806" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#prayer-and-fasting---pastor-chris-oyakhilome11806">​</a></h2>
<p>And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting (Mark 9:29)</p>
<p>Sometimes as Christians, we miss God’s order of things. God is a God of order, and order gives meaning to things. For example, all around the world, people tend to confuse the order and say, “fasting and prayer,” instead of “prayer and fasting.” Prayer comes before fasting in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>Not understanding the right order may account for the reason many people fast without praying, which is largely a waste of time and effort. The emphasis should be on praying. It’s a call to prayer, and because you’re praying, you’re consciously staying away from eating. The fast is on, because you’re praying, not because you’re not eating.</p>
<p>Acts 13:2 says, “As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said.” Notice the order: they ministered to the Lord and fasted. How do you minister to the Lord? It’s in worship, prayer, praise and thanksgiving. The focus was on ministering to the Lord, and because of this, they fasted. Then the Lord spoke to them after they had prayed.</p>
<p>The New Year is just around the corner, and in preparing for it, you must spend time to pray and fast. Make sure you participate fully, bearing in mind the purpose of the fast: praying; ministering to the Lord.</p>
<p>Some people occupy themselves with various irrelevant activities during prayer and fasting, so they don’t feel the hunger until it’s time to break the fast, no; it’s not that way. Aside from praying, the only activities you should indulge in and encourage are such that would further inspire you to pray, such as studying and meditating on the Word.</p>
<p>Take your Bible and some Christian books to read, and messages to listen to or watch on your devices. Put the TV off, and cast the newspapers and magazines aside. Possibly, put off your phone or turn off the network; you don’t need any distraction.</p>
<p>If you desire specific outstanding results in the coming year that only the anointing can produce, you need to do this: Spend quality time to speak in tongues and position yourself for achievements and significant exploits, not just in the coming year, but in the years ahead.</p>
<p>PRAYER FOR YOU
Blessed Lord, I thank you for all that you’ve prepared for me in the coming year. My spiritual antenna is raised to hear and receive your instructions, guidance, and wisdom that’ll propel me in the path of greatness that you’ve ordained for me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come (John 16:13)</p>
<p>Jesus said in John 14:26, “But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”</p>
<p>The Christian life isn’t possible without the Holy Spirit. At best one can only have a nice religion without Him. The Holy Spirit brings the power of God into your life. He’s the one who nudges you from within to go and pray, and reminds you to study the Word. In your times of prayer, He brings words into your spirit, in other tongues, so that you’re able to commune with the Father in a holy heavenly language only He understands.</p>
<p>Always listen to the Holy Spirit. Often times He trains us to recognize and obey His voice. In the army, soldiers are drilled regularly, not because there’s war, but because they’re being prepared for war. They’re being trained to become tough and to learn to take orders. That’s the same way the Holy Spirit trains you. When He makes you do things, don’t ask “What’s the purpose?” He’s looking at a larger picture; He’s getting you ready and prepared for the future He has for you.</p>
<p>Sometimes while in church, the Pastor makes everyone stand up; don’t complain that he’s making you stand again and again. That’s not learning to listen to the Holy Spirit. You may not know, but He’s training you to endure hardness as a good soldier. You may wonder why your Pastor makes you pray for a long time, but it’s the Spirit training you to learn to stay at the place of prayer. There’s a training process in Christ, and you have to ensure you yield yourself totally to it.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, thank you for the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in my life. His presence is the greatest blessing I could ever have, for He is my advantage and the secret to the glorious and successful life. I yield myself totally to you dear Holy Spirit, to fulfill your ministry in my life and manifest your glory through me, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>
<p>Acts 11:11-12 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man&#x27;s house:</p>
<p>Acts 16:6-7 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</p>

<p>We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation) (2 CORINTHIANS 6:1-2).<br>
<!-- -->═══════════════</p>
<p>We’re living in the day of salvation; the day of God’s grace, not His wrath. The Bible says, “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:11-13).</p>
<p>As we approach the end of this present world, we’re to live circumspectly, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present them perfect in Christ Jesus (Colossians 1:28). He wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4).</p>
<p>That’s why He sent us to preach the Good News of salvation; to preach the Gospel. This is the day of the Gospel, and “Gospel” means good news! We’re ambassadors of Good News: “To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God” (2 Corinthians 5:19-20).</p>
<p>In Matthew 9:37-38, Jesus said to His disciples, “The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.” We’re His labourers for the harvest, His witnesses, sent with the message of His saving power. We’re the bearers of the Gospel of His grace.</p>
<p>Take the message everywhere this Yuletide. Preach it boldly, and He’ll confirm your words with signs, wonders and miracles. Remember, Jesus said, “this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come” (Matthew 24:14).</p>
<p>This Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes. It’s the power of God to make sinners righteous, to bring men into fellowship with God. What an honour it is to be the bearer of the Good News of Christ’s salvation, helping people discover Jesus, and turning them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</p>
<p>═══════════════
🌍CONFESSION🌍
═══════════════
Dear Father, it’s such an honour to be the bearer of the Good News of Christ’s glorious salvation to mankind! Your truth is proclaimed in all the earth in these last days, and your Kingdom is established in the hearts of men. Many are snatched from destruction and damnation, into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. Blessed be your Name forever. Amen.

<p>Rev Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DD</p>
<p>There is something really beautiful in God&#x27;s word for Christmas.
I want to talk to you on THE BIRTH OF A KINGDOM</p>
<p>You know, we think about the birth of Christ. But this birth was only a precursor to the manifestation of the kingdom of God.
It&#x27;s the birth of a kingdom and this is extraordinary.</p>
<p>Matt 2:1-2
He was born &quot;King of the Jews&quot;. Think about it. Not &quot;born to become a king&quot;. He was born &quot;KING&quot;.
The wise men came to worship the King of the Jews.
It&#x27;s remarkable!</p>
<p>After Jesus 3 beautiful years of ministry, he was arrested and brought to Pilate.</p>
<p>John 18:33-38
Look at it again. He was born King of the Jews. The wise men said so at his birth; now as a grown adult, Pilate says the same thing to him.
Look at Jesus&#x27; response.
Pilate had been listening to lies all his life. He knew about the media of his day. He knew when Caesar sent out messages, etc. There was no truth. In Rome, truth was whatever the Roman government said it was.
Pilate said &quot;What is truth&quot;? Because he was truly confused.
He wanted to let Jesus get out of there in a hurry.
People who lie don&#x27;t want to see people telling the truth</p>
<p>Jesus was born King! That&#x27;s wonderful.
This is very important.
Where is Jesus today? Where is he gone?
We are celebrating his birth but where is He? What is he doing at this very moment?</p>
<p>Luke 19:12-27
Jesus tells us an important story that&#x27;s loaded with meaning.</p>
<p>The first man given 1 pound, traded with it and got 10 pounds and was rewarded with 10 cities
Second man got 5 pounds ad was rewarded with 5 cities.
Not 5 houses.
5 houses would have been enough... But he was rewarded with Cities.
Remember there were a group of citizens who didn&#x27;t want him to reign over them. He faced those ones too.</p>
<p>Interestingly after Jesus told them this story, in verse 28, he went to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The man in the Parable went to a far country to RECEIVE a kingdom and to RETURN.
He called 2 groups
His servants and his citizens.
He told his servants to occupy till he returned, then gave each of them a pound to trade with.</p>
<p>After He received the kingdom, he came back. Those citizens who didn&#x27;t want him to reign over them, were aware that he went to receive Kingly authority. Even while they grumbled, he received the authority. That&#x27;s why he was able to give his servants 5 or 10 cities. Those were cities owned by those citizens who didn&#x27;t want him to reign over them.</p>
<p>According to the bible, Jesus, when he left here (remember he left twice). Did Jesus get the Kingdom? Yes, he did.
If he did, what&#x27;s the implication of that?
What might it mean?
After Jesus resurrected, He was in the garden that was the place where he was buried. Mary and the other woman had come to complete the embalming of his body and found that his body was not there.
They hurried off to tell the disciples that his body had been stolen.
A little after then, they were still wandering around the garden area and Mary saw a man who she thought was the gardener.
She asked him &quot;do you know where his body is?&quot;.
Then Jesus called her name and she recognized his voice and ran toward Jesus.
The Master said &quot;don&#x27;t touch me, because I&#x27;ve not yet ascended to my Father&quot;.
According to the bible, he had become the Lord high priest. He was to take his blood to the presence of God in Heaven.</p>
<p>Later on that day, he appeared to his disciples and showed them the print of the nails and hole on his side where he was pierced. No one touched him them too.</p>
<p>8 days later, he came again, with Thomas present, who did not previously believe.
Jesus called Thomas to come and put his finger into his hands and his side.
When Thomas did, he fell on his knees and this time, didn&#x27;t call him &quot;Master&quot;, he said &quot;My Lord and my God&quot;.
Jesus said &quot;now you believe.&quot;

<p>In the time between when Jesus saw Mary and when Thomas touched Him, He must have ascended to the Father.</p>

<p>As at April 2022, when I was praying, the spirit of God began to speak to me about this. That the coming year would be the tile of decision for the world. They are being presented with this opportunity as though they were never given and yet for many it will be their final call. That&#x27;s very serious.
But it also should stir  in us the necessity to take the message to the ends of the earth. It shall be so because this year is the year of THE PROLIFIC CHURCH.</p>
<p>The church shall spread throughout the earth unhindered. This prolificacy of the church in these days shall be as never before experienced. The church shall proliferate to the ends of the earth unhindered.</p>
<p>The parable of the Kingdom.
It&#x27;s like a woman that put a little leaven in a dough of bread and it spread to all of it. So is the kingdom. Like a mustard seed, though it be the smallest, when it is down, grows to be a great tree and birds of the air can lodge in it&#x27;s branches.</p>
<p>You are going to be so prolific everywhere in an outstanding way. You get in there and the spirit of multiplication, you will see it happen because this is God&#x27;s plan for his church in 2023.
The church will spread throughout the earth unhindered.</p>

<p>FEBRUARY 2023
REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DD~13030</p>
<p>This is a special moment in the kingdom of God.
For us declaring there will be healing streams, the work of angels have already begun.
Plan for the healing streams.</p>
<p>What is God telling us for this month of February?
Obadiah 1:17, Joshua 14:7-15</p>
<p>Caleb demanded that Joshua actualized the words that Moses had spoken concerning him.
Hebron had giants there, but because of the words of Moses, Joshua gave Caleb Hebron for an inheritance.
Caleb drove them out and took possession of it.
He converted the inheritance to a possession.
It&#x27;s one thing to have an inheritance allotted to you, it&#x27;s another thing to have it in possession.</p>
<p>Upon mount Zion shall be deliverance... And the house of Jacob shall possess their possession
This month is a month of possession.</p>
<p>The inheritance was already yours but now you will enter into it by the power of the holy ghost.</p>
<p>Every giant will be slayed.
Every resistance will destroyed by the power of the holy ghost.
Take possession in the name of Jesus!!!</p>

<p>📖 &quot;Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life&quot; (Proverbs 4:13).</p>
<p>In 2 Kings 13, we find a very interesting story concerning the Prophet Elisha and Joash, King of Israel. Joash was having trouble with the Syrians and wanted victory over them. So, he came to the man of God, Elisha. Part of their ensuing dialogue was Elisha instructing Joash to take some arrows and smite them upon the ground.</p>
<p>The Bible says Joash did it three times and stopped (2 Kings 13:18). Elisha, the man of God was furious (the Bible says wrath) with King Joash (2 Kings 13:19) because he stopped. He should have kept on shooting the arrows until the Prophet told him to stop. Shooting the arrows only three times meant he was only going to defeat Syria three times; whereas, God&#x27;s plan was something far better. Joash didn&#x27;t know that it mattered how many times he shot the arrows. The prophet didn&#x27;t ask him to stop, but he stopped by himself.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s what I want to get across to you: Sometimes, many ignore very important things without knowing it, such as paying attention to prophetic instructions, which is part of God&#x27;s guidance for His children. A prophetic instruction is an instruction of the Spirit that&#x27;s given to you by the Spirit; it&#x27;s directed to you, for you. It could come to you directly by the Spirit of God from within you or through someone whom He&#x27;s given some leadership influence over your life.</p>
<p>For example, the Lord may be asking you to fast for a certain period of time, but you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s important; so, you either didn&#x27;t  fast at all or you didn&#x27;t meet the duration, and then something unpleasant happens. You may not realize that it&#x27;s connected to the instruction that you didn&#x27;t follow. Such things matter; so, don&#x27;t take them lightly. It could be some spiritual instruction from your Pastor, to you or to the congregation of which you&#x27;re a member. These are all important.</p>
<p>When God gives you a prophetic instruction or guidance, it&#x27;s in your interest to follow through. Your entire destiny or the next level of your success, promotion and greatness may depend on it.</p>

<p>═══════════════
📖 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him (ACTS 5:32)
═══════════════
Luke 11:13 is one of the scriptures many misapply and misunderstand about receiving the Holy Spirit. There, Jesus said, “If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?” But then, He wasn’t talking to Christians, but to those under the Old Covenant.</p>
<p>Anyone could have received the Holy Spirit by asking; but sadly, most never did because they didn’t ask. Jesus said ask and it shall be given unto you (Luke 11:9). But after the New Testament was effected, from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Word never told anyone to ask for the Holy Spirit. What we’re told is how the apostles ministered the Holy Spirit to people; they “prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost” (Acts 8:15); and some received without prayer (Acts 10:44-46).</p>
<p>It’s actually pointless to ask God for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is one of the cardinal gifts of God—to all men. By simply obeying His call to believe the Gospel, anyone can receive Him. He said in Acts 2:17, “And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh” See also, Acts 5:32, Hebrews 5:9, Romans 2:8.</p>
<p>═══════════════
Notice He didn’t say, “I will pour out of my Spirit upon all Christians, but upon all flesh.” This is the Father’s blessing. It has come now. Without the Holy Spirit, you can’t live the Christian life. God desires that you walk in the fullness of the Spirit and live righteously and victoriously in this present world.</p>
<p>If you haven’t received the Holy Spirit since you’ve been born again, Galatians 3:14 says, “that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.” Simply say, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, I open my heart now, and I receive the Holy Spirit.” Then by faith, receive as simply as you received Christ. While thanking Him, you may even now be filled with the Spirit, speaking with tongues or prophesying. Glory to God!

I live an extraordinary life of excellence and the supernatural, because I’m filled with the Holy Spirit who leads me and directs my steps in victory, glory, dominion and power. He blesses the world through me, for He’s made me a life-giver and fountain of blessings. Blessed be God!

<p>═══════════════
📖 &quot;Behold, I shew you a mystery; WE SHALL NOT ALL SLEEP, but we shall be changed&quot; (1 CORINTHIANS 15:51)</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:27 has been misunderstood by many for so long. It says, &quot;And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgement.&quot; For many people, this means &quot;We must all die someday; everyone has an appointed time to die.&quot; But no; they&#x27;re wrong. It&#x27;s not true that everybody has to die. The Bible doesn&#x27;t say &quot;it&#x27;s appointed to men to die.&quot; There&#x27;s a difference between  &quot;it is appointed unto men to die&quot; and &quot;as it is appointed unto men once to die&quot;</p>
<p>In the latter, the argument is on how many times they should die, not that they must die. It can be rewritten as &quot;Because they&#x27;re not supposed to die more than once&quot; That is, Christ was the sacrifice, and because they&#x27;re not supposed to die more than once, Christ, therefore, was offered to die once and for all. Now that He has died, it means death is no longer compulsory. That&#x27;s the meaning of that scripture, not that men have an appointed date with date.</p>
<p>Death isn&#x27;t from God; it&#x27;s an enemy, and it has been defeated, awaiting destruction: &quot;For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:25-26). &quot;Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality  to light through the gospel&quot; (2 Timothy 1:9-10). When you&#x27;re born again, you&#x27;re born into life and immortality- &quot;deathlessness&quot;!</p>
<p>Now you can understand why our theme verse says, &quot;We shall not all sleep&quot;; meaning that we shall not all die. It&#x27;s telling us everybody isn&#x27;t going to die. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 says when Jesus comes back, the dead in Christ (Christians who had died) shall rise first, and then it says, &quot;we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds&quot; That means everybody didn&#x27;t die.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not subject to death. Eternal life---the God-life, the very essence of  divinity---was imparted to your spirit when you received Christ. The Scriptures declare that if you have the Son of God, you have that life. But you must have the knowledge of it and live every day with the consciousness of this reality, a consciousness of life, not death. Praise God!</p>

<p>📖
And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him (COLOSSIANS 3:17)<br>
<!-- -->═══════════════</p>
<p>Jesus said in Mark 16:17, “In my name shall they cast out devils.” I would to God all of God’s children understood what this means; the authority and dominion we wield in His Name! When you address devils and situations in the Name of Jesus, they have no option; they must comply.
═══════════════
Then think about what we read in our opening verse: “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus” (Colossians 3:17). This means you’re to live your life in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That simply means one thing: absolute victory for you every day. If you’d do what the Word says, your life will be full of joy, glory, excellence and victories. You can’t fail or be defeated in His Name.</p>
<p>When you pray, you’re guaranteed to receive answers, because every request you make is as though Jesus were the one making that request, since you’re making it in His Name. The Father sees your requests as Jesus’ request; you’re praying in His place and since Jesus can’t be turned down, your request can’t be denied. Glory to God!</p>
<p>It’s a legal thing; He gave us the power of attorney to use His Name and live in His Name. It doesn’t matter what challenges you might be facing; if you’d use the Name of Jesus, victory is assured. Praise God!

At the Name of Jesus, every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father! I rule and reign triumphantly every day, by living in the Name of Jesus. Hallelujah!

<p>📖Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you (LUKE 10:19).</p>
<p>As a Christian, rather than panic or be overwhelmed with fear when you face dire circumstances or opposition, use your authority in Christ. This reminds me of something that happened several years ago in Switzerland. I was standing at the road junction in Geneva with my wife and we were preparing to cross the road to the other side.</p>
<p>Someone had flipped the switch for the light to stop the vehicles, so pedestrians could cross. For some reason, I wasn’t so attentive, so when everyone else had already gone to the other side was when I began to cross. By then, the lights had changed for the vehicles to come through. And there they were racing towards me and I was right in the middle of the road. The speed at which they were coming was high, and everybody watching from the sidewalk held their breath.</p>
<p>Well, I stood right there and said, “STOP!!!” Of course, I didn’t do that as a traffic warden. I had to use a higher authority; my authority in Christ. Guess what happened: the vehicles screeched to a halt, with the one ahead of them stopping right in front of me, mere centimeters away from where I stood.</p>
<p>You could hear as everyone heaved a big sigh of relief, and then I calmly walked away. Imagine if I had pushed the panic button and responded in fear. Some of us don’t know this yet but we’ve got something that can stop engines. And guess what! That same thing can start engines too! I remember the late Archbishop Benson Idahosa.</p>
<p>The story is told how he was in an airplane with several others and the pilot announced that they had lost one engine and the other one was having trouble and could fail anytime soon. While the other passengers panicked and envisaged a crash, the Archbishop got up and spoke in other tongues, and when he was through he said to the plane, “Move!” The engine perfected its work and the plane became stable until it landed perfectly.</p>
<p>The cockpit crew couldn’t explain how everything returned to normal from that chaotic state, but went to the Archbishop and thanked him for saving their lives. We’ve got something we can use. We have authority in the Name of Jesus. You can use that Name against any sickness; you can use it to improve your job, your finances, your marriage, and your family – everything about your life! Praise God.</p>
<p>&#x27;Dear heavenly father, I thank you for the power in the Name of Jesus; the Name above all names. I live in health, safety, peace and prosperity today and always, because I function by and in the power and dominion of the Name of Jesus. Amen.</p>

<p>📖&quot;Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel&quot; (NUMBER 23:23)</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, Balak, the king of Moab was angry with Israel and hired the prophet called Balaam, to curse Israel. More to Balak&#x27;s chagrin, each time Balaam was to curse Israel, blessings came forth from his mouth. Then he said to Balak, &quot;Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he (God) hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it&quot; (Numbers 23:20).</p>
<p>Balaam eventually gave up trying to curse Israel after three failed attempts. The Bible says he saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel; and so, he refused to continue seeking enchantments against Israel (Numbers 24:1). In other words, he realized it was futile to curse or concoct negative schemes against those whom the Lord had blessed. His conclusion on the matter was what we read in the opening verse. See how the Good News Bible puts it: &quot;There is no magic charm, no witchcraft, That can be used against the nation of Israel&quot;</p>
<p>Today, such things still happen: people go to voodoo priests, sorcerers, and diviners to put a curse on a colleague or someone they&#x27;ve perceived as an enemy. Sometimes, people who never had any history or trace of sickness could suddenly come up with a terminal disease or even become lunatic, as a result of a curse placed on them. Oftentimes, those who have been cursed aren&#x27;t even aware that it&#x27;s a curse that&#x27;s working against them; their problems defy every medical or human effort.</p>
<p>But thanks be unto God! Once you&#x27;re born again, no one can curse you, because you&#x27;re the blessed of the Lord. The New Creation is the blessed of God. We&#x27;re His chosen ones: &quot;But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people&quot; (1 Peter 2:9).</p>
<p>Never be afraid of any sorcerer, magician, or voodoo priest; their actions against you are futile, no matter how they try. You can&#x27;t be bewitched. You can&#x27;t be charmed. You can&#x27;t be cursed. You walk in blessings only, and only the blessed Word of the Lord can come to pass in your life. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>📖And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light (GENESIS 1:2-3)</p>
<p>When you read the Psalms, you’d notice that David knew the value of words, and he taught his son, Solomon, the same. It was Solomon who said, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue” (Proverbs 18:21). David his father taught him that. David knew that death and life weren’t in the power of the sword; they’re in the power of the tongue. And he proved it when he confronted Goliath of Gath. You need to understand how he defeated Goliath.</p>
<p>It’s easy to think that he defeated Goliath with a smooth stone and a sling. But no; it was with words! Study the account in 1 Samuel 17. He was sure of defeating Goliath because he put his faith in words. He used the tools as guided by the wisdom of God. He had the stone and sling and words coming out of his mouth. He knew he didn’t take Goliath out with a stone; the Spirit of God was upon him, and the Spirit of God uses words.</p>
<p>Words release spirit-power. Without words, the Spirit will do nothing. Read our theme verse again. The Spirit was all over the world, but nothing changed. Then the Bible says, “And God said”; suddenly, the Spirit acted and whatever God said became! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>At the second coming of Jesus, the Bible says He’ll smite the AntiChrist “with the spirit of his mouth” (2 Thessalonians 2:8), which refers to the sword of the Spirit, which is the “Rhema” of God—words coming out of His mouth (Revelation 19:15, Ephesians 6:17).</p>
<p>When you speak the Word, you release the power of God into action on your behalf. So, when you face crises in life, don’t cower. Don’t panic. Speak words! Speak and effect a change.

<p>📖For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart (HEBREWS 4:12).</p>
<p>It’s so important to understand that when you were born again, you were actually born of the Word. The Bible says, “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever” (1 Peter 1:23). You’re the offspring of the Word. You’re called to live by the Word, even as you’re being built by the Word; you dwell in the Word.</p>
<p>Therefore, as one who’s born of the Word, when you speak, your words cease to be mere words. That’s the reason Romans 10:8 says of the Word: “The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.” You’re to always give vent to the Word; speak the Word always.</p>
<p>Here’s what the Spirit is saying to you even now: “In the realm of the spirit, the Word is all that’s necessary; receive the Word at my mouth, says the Lord, have it in your spirit for your spirit is the home of the Word. As you receive my Word, you’ll think my thoughts and walk in my realm of life. Therefore, when you speak, it will come to pass, because it’s the Word; says the Spirit of the Lord!”</p>
<p>Yes, you’re born into that realm; created, fashioned and sharpened by the Word. As you grow in the Word, you become a manifestation of the Word. That’s the way Jesus was; He was the out breathing of God, the Word of God made flesh. He walked the streets of Israel as the Word. And as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17). We’re called the word—the epistle of Christ: “Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart” (2 Corinthians 3:3). Meditate on these truths today.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I thank you for the effectual working of your Word in my life. I’m made, fashioned and sharpened by your Word; therefore, my life is a manifestation of your outbreathings. Your Word is in my heart and in my mouth, and as I speak it forth, it produces results, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>If Jesus truly gave us the legal right, that is, the power of attorney to use His Name, what results should we expect when we use His Name? What&#x27;s so important about the Name of Jesus? What does His Name represent and why should we have so much confidence in the Name of Jesus?</p>
<p>We have the answer in our opening scripture. Notice the construction; it&#x27;s absolute.

This sovereign decree is in force in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth (in hell). His Name has power in all three worlds; that power applies to the &quot;things,&quot; that is, whatever exists in all three worlds; whether they be thrones, governments, galaxies, principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world or in high places; they&#x27;re all subject to His Name.</p>
<p>This is remarkable! It explains why you should never be influenced by anything in life. It makes no difference what Satan and his cohorts of hell are concocting; you can neutralize their efforts and overturn their works in the Name of Jesus.

<p>&quot;The Lord shall open to you His good treasury, the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its season and to bless all the works of your hands; and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow&quot; (DEUTERONOMY 28:12)</p>
<p>The Contemporary English Version renders the theme verse beautifully. It says, &quot;He will make you successful in everything you do. You will have plenty of money to lend to other nations, but you won&#x27;t need to borrow any yourself.&quot; Let this truth dawn on your spirit, and your mentality will change. You&#x27;re loaded with blessings for your generation. You&#x27;re a custodian of God&#x27;s manifold blessings.</p>
<p>Therefore, everywhere you are, dispense blessings; dispense God&#x27;s grace, love and compassion to those you come in contact with; it&#x27;s your calling! Be a giver because of who you are and where you come from: you&#x27;re Abraham&#x27;s seed. The Lord said to Abraham, &quot;and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice&quot; (Genesis 22:18). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus did all that He did on the Cross that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, and it has (Galatians 3:14). Glory to God! Now we&#x27;ve received the promise of the Spirit. Galatians 3:29 says, &quot;And if ye be Christ&#x27;s, then are ye Abraham&#x27;s seed, and heirs according to the promise&quot; The world belongs to you. Be conscious of this truth.</p>

<p>📖I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death (REVELATION 1:18)</p>
<p>Following Adam’s disobedience, the Bible says death came upon all men: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned” (Romans 5:12). Death was associated with sin, so when Adam committed high treason back in the Garden of Eden by obeying Satan, death began to work in every man. Satan gained liberty to afflict men with sickness, disease, destruction and ultimately death, at his will.</p>
<p>But when Jesus came, things changed. Men and women who were all their lifetime subject to bondage because of the fear of death were liberated through the victory of Jesus Christ over death and the grave (Hebrews 2:14-15). Jesus went right into hell—Satan’s domain—paralyzed Satan and his cohorts and obtained the keys of death and hell! He dealt with the problem of death when He triumphantly rose from the dead and ushered man into a new life.</p>
<p>Today, anyone who’s born again needs not fear death, for death has been defeated by Jesus. No wonder the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 15:54-57, “Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>He’s given us victory over death and the grave. Today, Satan can no longer take anybody’s life at will because he doesn’t have the power of death anymore. Christ has given us life to live to the full. In His presence is fullness of joy and at His right hand are pleasures evermore: “The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows)” (John 10:10 AMPC).</p>
<p>CONFESSION
I’m crucified with Christ, nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God! I’ve been brought into life and immortality. I’m fearless, for death has been paralysed—defeated by Jesus, and when He did it, I was in Him! Hallelujah!</p>

<p>📖God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth (JOHN 4:24)</p>
<p>Some people say they’re praising God and all they say is, “Lord, I praise you”; but the truth is that they haven’t praised Him. To give someone a gift, for example, you don’t just say, “I give you a gift” and do nothing; you deliver the actual gift to the person. You don’t give the gift with your mouth; you act it.</p>
<p>It’s the same with praising, thanking and worshipping the Lord. You do it with content. When you say, “I bless you, Lord,” then go ahead and bless Him. How do you bless Him? It’s by giving Him thanks: you thank Him for who He is, what He’s done, and for His glory in your life.</p>
<p>There has to be a meaning when you thank Him; what’s the thanks connected to? So, you say, “I thank you Lord for X, Y, Z.” It must be connected to something; otherwise, you only muttered words. If I came to you, and said, “Thank you,” you’d want to know what I’m thanking you for.</p>
<p>Even when He tells us to have a heart that’s full of thanksgiving, it still has a purpose; there’s something in your heart that you’re thanking Him for. I may pray in my privacy and say, “Father, thank you”; that’s because in my heart, I have so many things I’m grateful to Him for that I’m not voicing, because God sees the heart. In my heart are these beautiful thoughts of what He’s done for me or said to me for which I’m expressing thanks.</p>
<p>So, always, when you praise Him, it’s got to have meaning; it’s got to have content. The content is the fruit of your lips, giving thanks to His Name: “By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name” (Hebrews 13:15).</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, from the depth of my heart, I’m grateful for your grace, mercy, wisdom and power by which I live triumphantly today, prospering in all that I do. Thank you for your glory in my life; you’re righteous, holy, gracious, kind and pure. Your Kingdom is everlasting, and you rule the nations in righteousness. Blessed be your Name forever, O Lord. Amen.</p>

<p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome~13835</p>
<p>Opening Prayer: Esteemed Pastor Lanre Alabi</p>
<p>A Video Documentary on TRANSHUMANISM was played.</p>
<p>Transhumanism is an extension of the eugenics; a theory that postulates that with the aid of science and technology, humans can evolve and advanced from this limited state of mind and body into a more enhanced and intelligent being. Either microchips are inserted, bionic prosthetics or genes are altered. And the narrative is that they are used to remove all forms of defects, diseases and illnesses. And this is sponsored by leaders of the WEF.</p>
<p>Hearing it, the science enthusiasts will want to welcome it, but if someone can make humans better, it means that they can make people worse.
This is an evil agenda, because it leads to total control of the human sovereignty. They will access to your thoughts and emotions, political leaning.
This is their description of a new world. They have even changed the indicators of time, for example they changed what we have come to know as BC (Before Christ) to BCE (Before Common or Current Era) and AD (Anno Domini) into CE (Common or Current Era), all in a bid to remove the Christ. The new generation coming up with see the BC and AD as a relic of the past.</p>
<p>Changing your physical appearance is just surface, but when your genes are edited or altered, then that is dangerous.</p>
<p>Deception is one of the hallmarks of the last days.
One of the deceptions that will be employed is Deception by subterfuge. For instance when you hear news networks says “Russian Disinformation”, what they’re are actually referring to are those that they deem as those are who are pushing back their propaganda on the involvement of Russian in the United States election, which was false. There’s no indication anywhere that Russia meddled with their elections. This is a far left political agenda, targeted against fundamentalists, majorly Christians.</p>
<p>The Antichrist will be a transhumanist personality. He will be a transhuman in a transhuman era. The argumentation of humans; and who is the person that is intelligent enough to determine who needs to be augmented?</p>
<p>This month is our month of prayer and praise.
Let’s begin with</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:15:
By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.</p>
<p>The Hebrew Christians understood his use of language, citing a term that he had used in his writing, which is prophetic.
In the book of psalms, the word praise is being used a lot. Understanding the Hebrew and Greek writing and analogies, you would discover that the meaning given to praise is what the original meaning depicts.</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:15 (AMPC)
Through Him, therefore, let us constantly and at all times offer up to God a sacrifice of praise, which is the fruit of lips that thankfully acknowledge and confess and glorify His name.</p>
<p>The term described sacrifice of praise being referred to here was properly described by Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 33:11
The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise -- the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth forever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return -- the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>Todah is from the word yadah and in their actual sense it means the extension of the hand, admiration, a Choir of worshippers, confession, thanksgiving, in its usage: thanks, thanksgiving, praise, confession, thanksgiving in liturgical, thanksgiving in procession or line of company.
They are offshoots of yadah…to hold out ones hand physically; worship with extended hands, to confession, praise and to shoot.</p>
<p>Further broken down to the vowel tenses: to throw to shoot to cast to throw down. All this in given thanks and confessing.</p>

📖Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth (MARK 9:23)
═══════════════
In the Kingdom of God, in the realm of the supernatural, are infinite possibilities. That’s the realm in which we live; that’s the realm into which we were born. There’s no limit to your success. Hallelujah! Jesus said in our opening scripture, “All things are possible to him that believes.”</p>
<p>The Bible says in Romans 10: “With the heart (spirit) man believes”; your spirit has the capacity for infinite possibilities. When your spirit takes a hold of God’s Word, there&#x27;s no telling what you can do; there&#x27;s no telling what you could be; there’s no telling what you could have!</p>
<p>═══════════════
If you&#x27;d only believe, there’ll be a complete metamorphosis of your life. It doesn&#x27;t matter what limits have been placed on you; whether from your family, your friends, your location, your job, or your training—it makes no difference—you’re open to infinite possibilities. If you can only believe!</p>
<p>Dare to believe God. Dare to believe and act on His Word, and your path in life will be one of endless progress, victories and prosperity. Every so often, declare, “I go above and beyond the limits in the Name of Jesus. All things are possible to me. I have ability for all things. Amen.”

Dear Father, thank you for your Word which brings to my heart the pictures of infinite possibilities, as there’s no limit to the extent, reach and capacity to which my spirit can envision, contemplate and create.

<p>📖And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy (ACTS 2:17)
═══════════════</p>
<p>Did you notice that the first response or result of having the Spirit poured out upon all flesh is that men and women would prophesy? It shows the importance of prophecy in prayer. Until you find yourself prophesying in prayer, you haven’t utilized the power and benefits of prayer.</p>
<p>Prophecy is two-fold: we speak forth and we foretell. The key is being filled with the Spirit. The Bible says in Ephesians 5:18, “And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.” The underlined expression connotes something that’s supposed to continue. The proper rendering is actually, “Be being filled with the Spirit.”</p>
<p>That means you should always be filled with the Spirit. If you’re that way, your prayer life will be enriched with prophecy where you speak forth God&#x27;s Word and you foretell the future. Don’t leave your future in the hands of others; create your “aion”—course of life—with prophecy.</p>
<p>As an individual, how your life goes depends a lot on you. Likewise, as the Church of Jesus Christ, we must also recognize that we have a responsibility to determine what happens in our communities. That’s why our prayers must be laden with prophecies. Whenever we come together to pray, we must know we’re coming together to determine the future of our cities, our nations, and our world through our prophetic utterances. Hallelujah!

Dear Father, I thank you for putting your Word in my heart and in my mouth, thus giving me the power to control my future. I declare that I&#x27;m moving forward by the power of the Holy Spirit, making progress with giant strides, and waxing stronger every day, in all things, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

<p>In going into this second half of the year, we are going to be very tough on all fronts and one of those areas would be in the business of the Lord.
Some of you are going to act in a tough way for the Lord.
We need to have some pushback.</p>
<p>The bible says &quot;I&#x27;ve seen servants on horses and princes walking on their feet&quot;.
&quot;There is he that is rich and maketh himself poor&quot;
When you do nothing, you can suffer a lot.</p>
<p>For example in 2020/21, I talked about the vaccines. An example of things that cities and nations are meant to go through and everyone just goes through it.
They think that the only way to go against it is to go to the streets.
NO! Use the courts. Become more knowledgeable about the law and what needs to be law.
Whatever is a law didn&#x27;t fall from heaven
If a law is not good, there are channels and ways to challenge and get rid of it.</p>
<p>I did say about the vaccines that there is no scientific evidence that vaccines ever worked.
The way they tell people to vaccinate their children, you would think it is a law from God.
But I was right and I am still right today
Infact, many scientists are coming out to say the same thing now.</p>
<p>(Video play out)</p>
<p>They did a 10 year study and the CDC regulators hid the report. Those who were unvaccinated were healthier than kids who got all the vaccines.
The talk that being vaccinated gives you immunity against the disease is totally unfounded.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s time to sue the schools and organizations that forced children and people to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t think that every doctor agrees with vaccines. It&#x27;s just a group of the who became more powerful because they Got government to include them in the regulation. So they became more wealthy and Influencial than those who didn&#x27;t agree with them.
It&#x27;s a scheme. A scam!!!</p>
<p>If they insist that you must vaccinate your child, Go to court and demand that they must provide scientific evidence.</p>

And the Lord will create over the whole site, over every dwelling place of Mount Zion and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy (a defense of divine love and protection) (ISAIAH 4:5 AMPC)         
═══════════════
Pastor Chris Says
━━━━━━━━━━
Glory to God! The theme verse today foretells of a phenomenon previously experienced by Israel, a reference to the pillar of a cloud and of fire which attended them in their exodus from Egypt. They were under God’s divine protection, provision, love and care. Exodus 13:21-22 says, “And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire”</p>
<p>Even though they were in the desert, in that terrible arid land, they weren’t scorched by the sun. Then at night, they were kept warm by a pillar of fire. Thus, day or night—they were under a special atmosphere. That’s amazing! This didn’t happen for one day, three days, a few months or a year; it was for forty long years. God protected them!</p>
<p>Read the psalmist’s account of this in Psalm 105:37 (AMPC): “He brought [Israel] forth also with silver and gold, and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.” Deuteronomy 29:5 (NKJV) says, “And I have led you forty years in the wilderness. Your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet.” This is extraordinary; they were in God’s presence and He fed and nurtured them.</p>
<p>Nehemiah 9:20-21 (GNB) says, “In your goodness you told them what they should do; you fed them manna and gave them water to drink. Through forty years in the desert you provided all that they needed; their clothing never wore out, and their feet were not swollen with pain.” He hasn’t changed. The same God takes care of you and nurtures you today. His presence in, with, and about you today makes you an oasis of love and grace in a troubled world.</p>
<p>You live in His presence, in a divine atmosphere of joy, bliss and glory, where you’re absolutely independent of circumstances. Be mindful of this always. There could be chaos or anarchy everywhere, but in Him you’re at peace and in safety. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>═══════════════
🗣️CONFESSION
═══════════════
I dominate my environment with the atmosphere of the Spirit. I walk in the Spirit, for that’s the realm from which, and into which, I’m born. There’s no gloom, sadness, lack, poverty or weakness in and around me, because I live perpetually in God’s divine presence in an atmosphere of joy, brightness and victory. Hallelujah!

📖“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you” (LUKE 10:19)
═══════════════
As a child of God, your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost (1 CORINTHIANS 6:19)
which means your body isn’t yours; it’s owned by God. However, you are the one to keep watch over your body and keep it in health. You’re the one to exercise authority over your body, keeping it free of sickness, disease and infirmity.</p>
<p>The words of Jesus in our opening verse should let you know that you’re not ordinary; you have the right to tell your body how it should feel. Tell your body what to do, and it’ll respond. Jesus said in Mark 11:23 that you shall have what you say. Don’t permit in your body anything that isn’t consistent with God’s Word for your life; take charge and rule over your body.</p>
<p>When you perceive the symptoms of sickness in your body, reject them. They only become real when you say they are. Your words aren’t empty; what you say comes to pass. Therefore, talk to your body always.</p>
<p>Don’t say, “I have a growth in my stomach and it’s hurting so bad. The doctor says its cancer,” Don’t talk about the growth; talk to it instead. Tell the pain to cease, and tell your body to function rightly in line with the life of Christ that’s in your spirit.
Christ literally lives in you! He dwells in your spirit and expresses Himself through your physical body. Your consciousness of this reality makes it easy for you to exercise dominion over your body against sickness, disease and infirmity.</p>
<p>The Spirit of God vitalizes every fibre of my being! The God-life in me destroys sickness, disease and infirmities! I’m healthy and strong! Only the life and nature of Christ – His beauty and glory – are manifested in my physical body, because He perambulates in me, through the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah!
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
I live above the systems of this world because the greater One lives in me! I’m not subject to the elements of the world, and my life is a testimony of God’s greatness. Divine might is at work in me; my strength is renewed daily, causing me to triumph over sickness and infirmity.</p>
<p>I refuse to be moved by what I feel, or what my senses tell me. I refuse to let my feelings dictate the circumstances of my life. Any symptoms I perceive are lying vanities because the life of God is in me and working through me. Therefore, sickness has no place in my body.</p>
<p>I thank you, Lord, for your life that’s at work in me, in every fibre of my being, in every cell of my blood and in every bone of my body. My whole being is immune to death, decay and the corrupting influences in the world! My path is the path of life, righteousness, joy, gladness and peace forevermore.
Christ is my life; in Him I live and move and have my being.</p>
<p>I’ve been delivered from sin, sickness and death, and catapulted into God’s realm of abundant life. My body is the temple of the Holy Ghost; therefore, I am ‘uninfectable’. Hallelujah!

<p>📖And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God. (ROMANS 12:2)</p>
<p>Progress is something everybody wants. Success, and greater levels of success, is the desire of every human person. Yet, this remains an elusive phenomenon for many, because they haven’t acted on the Word. The Word of God is clear on how to have a fruitful, productive, and efficient life of success; it’s by the renewing of your mind, not by the renewing of your environment, wardrobes, homes, or bank accounts.</p>
<p>Why is your mind so important? It’s because God has fashioned the mind as the instrument for your transformation. Your mind is unlimited in its potential to create whatever you desire. When you put your mind-power to work, the possibilities are endless. There’re no limits to what you can achieve, and absolutely no restrictions to how high you can propel yourself in life.</p>
<p>Your prosperity is essentially determined by the content and quality of your mind; because with your mind, you can change anything about you! You can establish a perfect structure and administration for your life, and enjoy to the utmost the special life and blessings God has given you.</p>
<p>Open your mind to God’s Word through study and meditation. Don’t just gloss over or leaf through the pages of the Bible; study! 2 Timothy 2:15 says, “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”</p>
<p>Through conscious meditation on the Word, your mind is organized, reorganized, programmed or reprogrammed. Its contents and processes are synchronized with God’s thoughts and perfect will for your life. That’s what brings about the transformation.</p>
<p>Remember, who you are today is a function or expression of the contents and workings of your mind. Through God’s Word, you can work on your mind and change its contents, and that change will show up in your life as an upgrade, reflecting in your character and the results you have in life. Blessed be God!</p>

<p>═══════════════</p>
<p>📖But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ (EPHESIANS 4:7)
═══════════════
Romans 5:17 says, “For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”
This lets you know you’re not to pray, “O God, give me abundance of grace”; rather, you’re to “receive” abundance of grace. The key word is “receive,” which is translated from the Greek word “lambano” and it means to take possession, to seize something and make it yours.</p>
<p>Those who take personal possession of abundant grace shall reign, not beg, in life. They’ll live victoriously every day, over and above circumstances. That’s what it means to reign. Sometimes, you hear people say, “That’s the reigning thing now,” referring to a trend, fashion, etc.; no, they’re wrong. Nothing else is reigning but you, because you’ve received abundance of grace.
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
The religious mind might question that and say, “How can you say that? Jesus is the one reigning.” Yes, but He’s reigning through you. The way He reigns today is through us the Church. Hallelujah! This is so powerful.
Many have only understood grace as the bestowal of divine gifts or “unmerited favour”; but grace means much more. It’s to be endowed with the presence of God. That means God has given Himself to you, thereby giving you all that He has.</p>
<p>God’s grace on your life is the outworking or outward reflection of an inward divine influence: the beauty, power, perfection, excellence, virtue, and glory of divinity in your spirit. It’s that divine influence and endowment that beautifies your spirit and saturates your life with favour, acceptability, liberality, advantage, joy, pleasure, and supernatural gift or ability.</p>
<p>Take advantage of God’s grace in your job, family, finances, health and relationships today. Paul admonished Timothy to take advantage of the grace of God (2 Timothy 2:1) and rule over the devil, sickness, disease, the world and its systems.
═══════════════
PRAYER
═══════════════
Dear Father, I thank you, for I’ve received abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness; therefore, I’m reigning in life, over and above the corrupting influences of this world: sickness, lack, and everything that limits. The grace of God is multiplied in my life through the knowledge of the Word, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.

📖&quot;Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state  I am, therewith to be content&quot; (PHILIPPIANS 4:11)
═══════════════
The life the Master lived here on earth was so impressive. Jesus was far removed from the decadence of the world, the penury around Him and the corruption and failure of His society. He lived far above, and beyond the government and systems of the day when He walked the earth.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t find Jesus interfering with their politics or trying to do something about their economy. In other words, He didn&#x27;t bring some strange or heavenly currency into their system, yet He was never limited by money. Money was His slave. He was self-sufficient. Whatever He required, He didn&#x27;t need to call out of heaven; He brought it forth from within.</p>
<p>This is the life that He&#x27;s given us: He&#x27;s made us self-sufficient, to function above and beyond the systems of this world. He said you&#x27;re in the world, but not of the world. That means you&#x27;re not to be ruled, dominated or influenced by the systems, that is the crippling and corrupting influences in today&#x27;s world. You play by a different set of rules. Many around you may be influenced, and provoked to compromise as a result of the corruption in today&#x27;s world, but be like Jesus. Be independent of circumstances.
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
Think and talk like Paul, who said, &quot;But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus&quot; (Philippians 4:19). In the eleventh verse, while in prison, he wrote: &quot;Not that I speak respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content (independent of circumstances) (Philippians 4:11). He was self-sufficient. Furthermore, he said, &quot;I can do all through Christ which strengtheneth me&quot; (4:13).</p>
<p>Refuse to be enslaved by the system of this world; live above and beyond it. That&#x27;s the only way. Learn God&#x27;s Word and operate a law that&#x27;s higher than the law that runs in the systems of this world. Job 22:29 says, &quot;When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up&quot; Keep your head up high and maintain your faith-composure. When it seems like you&#x27;re beginning to feel the pressure, don&#x27;t give in; keep doing the Word. Shut yourself in and talk the Word. Hallelujah!

<p>═══════════════
📖&quot;And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them, triumphing over them in it&quot; (COLOSSIANS 2:15)
═══════════════
Paul&#x27;s letter to the Church at Ephesus in the sixth chapter of the book of Ephesians lets us in on the possibility of a structure of the devil and his demons. So he talks about the different orders of principalities: &quot;For we wrestle not against the flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places&quot; (Ephesians 6:12). So there are principalities, powers, and rulers of the darkness of this world.</p>
<p>Also, Paul refers to the highest cadre as wicked spirits in the heavenly places (Ephesians 6:12 AMP). These set up their thrones  and operate in the heavenly places; they control large dominions, rule over nations and regions. They also control the affairs of men who yield themselves to the devil. But as you study Ephesians 2:6, you observe that you&#x27;ve been raised together with, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. You&#x27;re seated with Christ, far above all principality and power and every organization of the adversary. That means you&#x27;re superior to even the highest ranking demon!
══════════════</p>
<p>══════════════
Realize that you occupy the place of authority in Christ, far above Satan and everything that&#x27;s connected to him. Satan is a defeated foe, who&#x27;s been stripped of all power, influence and dominion. So, it doesn&#x27;t matter if he assigns himself or his demons to monitor your activities and try to ruin things for you, they&#x27;ve been programmed to fail! In Christ, you defeated Satan and all his demons and overcame all the manipulative and evil structures of the world set up by him.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:15 (MSG) describes the current dismal and powerless state of Satan and his cohorts after what Jesus did to them: &quot;He stripped all the spiritual tyrants in the universe of their sham authority at the Cross and marched them naked through the streets.&quot;</p>
<p>So for you as a child of God, the devil and his demons don&#x27;t count, so never be afraid of them. Not only has Jesus given you power and authority to cast out devils (Mark 16:17), He also made you superior to Satan and his demons. So you shouldn&#x27;t have a care in the world about Satan and his evil structure and activities in the earth, for you&#x27;re seated with Christ in the place of power, &quot;Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not in this world, but also in that which is to come&quot; (EPHESIANS 1:21). ~ PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DD.

The Bible says, &quot;The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it&quot; (Proverbs 10:22). Poverty isn&#x27;t a blessing. That&#x27;s the reason Jesus delivered us from it. The Bible says He was rich, yet for our sakes, He became poor so that through His poverty, we might be made rich. He gave us prosperity in place of poverty, in the same way that He gave us His righteousness in place of sin.</p>
<p>When we say poverty isn&#x27;t a blessing, that&#x27;s not to say that when someone is poor, something is wrong with him or her; no! Anyone can make a choice. It&#x27;s like what the Bible says about many who suffered, not accepting deliverance, that they may obtain a better resurrection (Hebrews 11:35).</p>
<p>There may be people who have chosen to live in poverty. If that&#x27;s your choice, it&#x27;s okay, because it&#x27;s the choice you&#x27;ve made. It&#x27;s a sacrifice, and you shouldn&#x27;t feel ashamed for making that choice. But if you became poor circumstantially or as a result of being oppressed by others or for some other reasons outside of your personal choice, then that&#x27;s not okay. You have a right to change things.
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
However, when you choose to be poor, don&#x27;t try to make anybody else poor, except they also seek from you the principles of poverty, that they also might become poor. But there are some of us who are called to do certain things in the world for which reason we can&#x27;t and must not be poor. This isn&#x27;t because we love to be &quot;rich&quot; but because of responsibility, but because of what we have to do. God is counting on us to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth. He said in Matthew 24:14, &quot;And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.&quot; The Gospel is free but it&#x27;s not cheap to publish.</p>
<p>The Lord said through the Prophet in Zechariah 1:17, &quot;My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad&quot; Refuse to be poor. Make up your mind that you&#x27;ll be as prosperous as God has ordained you to be. He said in 3 John 1:2, &quot;Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.&quot; He wants you to prosper spiritually, physically, and financially. Make a choice not to be anything less.

📖Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you (JAMES 4:7)
═══════════════
Satan never plays fair; so you have to always be on the offensive against him. Our opening scripture says to resist him; but how do you resist him? It’s with the Word—the Sword of the Spirit. Don’t think the devil is sleeping; he’s not! The Bible says he prowls to and fro like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8).</p>
<p>Don’t wait for his fiery darts before putting him in check. What the devil likes to do is to get your attention, so that you&#x27;re always on the defensive, fighting to get your peace back, to get your health and strength back, or to get things back to normal; ever fighting to restore something; no! Don’t let yourself be hemmed in such a position.
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
While with your faith you’re neutralizing all the fiery darts Satan throws at you, always be on the offensive with the “Rhema” of God in your mouth. In Ephesians 6:10-16, the Apostle Paul gave a list of the protective part of our armour. Then in the 17th verse, he gave the only offensive tool: “the sword of the Spirit,” which is the “Rhema” of God.</p>
<p>Rhema is Greek for the &quot;spoken word.&quot; In this case, it’s your proclamation of the inspired Word of God for the hour and the season. It’s always a word said, or a word in saying; otherwise, it’s not a sword; it’s not a weapon. Always put the Word on your lips; that’s what you use to discomfit the enemy and all adversities.
═══════════════
PRAYER
═══════════════
Dear Father, your Word is in my heart and in my mouth, prevailing as I speak it forth! I speak forth righteousness, wisdom, prosperity, victory and abundance. And with the shield of faith, I extinguish and render ineffective the fiery darts, lies, tricks and stratagems of the adversary, walking on in the victory of Christ, in Jesus&#x27; Name. Amen.

<p>📖 Let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest [of God, to know and experience it for ourselves], that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and disobedience [into which those in the wilderness fell] (HEBREWS 4:11 AMPC).</p>
<p>Too many people are struggling in life when they ought to be living in God’s blessings. Some are always praying to God to give them this or that, whereas the Bible says He’s already blessed us with ALL spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:3).</p>
<p>God has already done all He ever needed to do for man. The Bible says, “For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world” (Hebrews 4:3).</p>
<p>God isn’t in heaven, thinking of what to do about your healing, deliverance, prosperity or any such thing; no. He’s not even thinking of what to do about the salvation of the one who hasn’t yet received Christ. You might then wonder, “So what’s God doing?” He’s at rest!</p>
<p>He already did everything He needed to do about your salvation, health, prosperity, etc., and finished the works before the foundation of the world. Now, He wants you to enjoy all that belongs to you in Christ. He wants you to live in blessings.</p>
<p>2 Peter 1:3 says, “According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness” Can you now see that there’s no need for you to struggle in life? Paul emphasized the same thing; he said in 1Corinthians 3:21, “all things are yours.” Since all things are yours, you ought to cease from all struggles; refuse the hard life. Remember what the Word says: “For we which have believed do enter into rest” (Hebrews 4:3).</p>
<p>Being born again, you’ve been brought into the Promised Land, into the land of blessings. What God expects from you now is for you to arise—wake up—into this experience, and live in the fulfillment of His blessings and promises.</p>
<p>🗣CONFESSION: I live in the fulfillment and reality of God’s blessings; I’ve been brought into God’s rest. All things are mine. I take full advantage of all that’s available to me in Christ, and by my faith I triumph gloriously in every place. Amen!

📖 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought (NUMBERS 23:23).
═══════════════
There’re Christians who have come to the conclusion that their predicament is the result of a curse working against them. They’re thus going around seeking deliverance from so-called ancestral or other curses. Such Christians, consciously or inadvertently, have been deceived. The Christian is superior to Satan and everything of darkness, and therefore can’t be under a curse.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature” (2 Corinthians 5:17). You’ve been born anew, called to inherit a blessing, not a curse: “ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing” (1 Peter 3:9). Read God’s promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:3: “And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” Blessings are at work in you, because you’re the seed of Abraham. No one can bewitch you or cast a spell on you.
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
If you were told that someone was trying to charm you, you don’t even have to pray for it not to work. You can neither be charmed nor cursed. There’s no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel. This is your heritage as the seed of Abraham.</p>
<p>Did you say there’s someone somewhere scheming against you, your family, or your job? Don’t panic. Don’t fret. Their schemes against you can’t work. They should take a cue or learning from Balaam of the Old Testament. After several futile attempts to enchant and curse Israel, he submitted, “No magic spells can bind Jacob, no incantations can hold back Israel” (Numbers 23:23 MSG).</p>
<p>Balaam couldn’t lay a curse on them, because they were God’s people; and today, we’re living out better promises. You walk in blessings only, and only the blessed Word of the Lord can come to pass in your life. Even the demons know who you are. There’s a mark on you; you’re branded for God; sealed for blessings. Glory to God!
═══════════════
🗣CONFESSION
═══════════════
I’m branded for God, and there’s no enchantment against me! I’m blessed with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ. I’m conscious of this truth and the authority I have over all principality, power, and the rulers of the darkness of this world! I walk in blessings only! In Christ, I’m secure and fortified against all machinations of the enemy. Glory to God!</p>

📖 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (Mark 16:17-18).
═══════════════
If you’d learn to use the Name of Jesus in your life, in everything you do, you’d be amazed at the victories and extraordinary blessings you’d experience every day. His Name is an instrument, a great blessing for us in the New Testament. The Word tells us to use the Name of Jesus in all things. Colossians 3:17 says, “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.” You couldn’t fail or lose in His Name! His Name is the key that unlocks every door!</p>
<p>What many have lacked is the consciousness of the power and authority of His Name. But thanks be unto God! The Church is marching on; knowledge is increasing, and many more are discovering who they are in Christ, and their place of glory and dominion in His Name.
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
Philippians 2:9-11 tells us that God gave Jesus the Name that’s above every name. He vested all authority in His Name and passed it into law in heaven, in earth and under the earth. Therefore, when you make demands in His Name, He sees to it that it happens (John 14:14).</p>
<p>When someone is sick in your home, don’t run helter-skelter, looking for help; take charge and declare, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke the pain; I rebuke the affliction!” Mention the sickness and command it to go! He told us to heal the sick; so, it’s our responsibility to do it in His Name; and His Name never fails!</p>
<p>Even now, rebuke the infirmity. Declare that every storm is stilled in your home, office, school, or environment. Affirm that you’re in abundance and the lines are fallen unto you in pleasant places. Use His Name to effect the changes you desire, and create blessings for yourself and others.!
═══════════════
🌏PRAYER
═══════════════
Dear Father, thank you for the power of attorney to use the greatest gift of all times—the Name of Jesus. Everything that exists in this world and beyond is subject to that Name; I change situations and establish your will in my world by that Name. I live victoriously and dominate life&#x27;s situations and circumstances, in the Name of Jesus! Amen.

<p>Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side (Psalm 71:21).</p>
<p>Some of the synonyms of the word “excellence” are superiority, extreme beauty, glory, and one more word, greatness. Excellence is greatness. “Greatness” here means, “surpassing others.” In other words, excellence makes you surpass others.</p>
<p>This makes us understand people like Abraham and David who were described as great. Since greatness is a synonym of excellence, then Abraham and David were excellent men. Excellence also means extra-ordinary discretion; it means having excellent perception. Many aren’t perceptive to the needs of others and their environment, and that’s what makes the difference between the greats and the smalls. Great people have great visions, and great visions don’t mean great plans or ambitions, but an extraordinary amplitude of perception—the ability to see so much at the same time.</p>
<p>The Spirit of God trains us to be excellent in different ways. Sometimes, He uses seemingly insignificant things to train us for greatness. Imagine you came into a room and saw a glass cup placed dangerously at the edge of a table. An excellent person will quickly make a move to prevent that cup from breaking. If you can rescue a dangerously placed cup, then God can trust you to rescue human beings.</p>
<p>You’ll be more likely to see danger and do something about it to protect others. If you consistently manifest excellence in the seemingly small things of life, you’re programming your spirit for greatness. Those little things you do on the outside are a reflection of the happenings on the inside. For instance, picking up litter from the floor depicts excellence in your spirit. Truly, excellence is greatness, for it makes you see all the little things that others ignore, thereby putting you ahead of them.</p>
<p>Daniel 6:3 NKJV Then this Daniel distinguished himself above the governors and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king gave thought to setting him over the whole realm.</p>
<p>Daniel 2:48 NIV Then the king placed Daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.</p>

📖 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest (Luke 10:2).
═══════════════
The Lord Jesus said, “Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest” (John 4:35). There’s been such a great harvest of souls into the Kingdom in these last days. The Lord is doing a quick work.</p>
<p>We’ll yet witness a greater move of the Spirit that’ll culminate in an unprecedented harvest of souls in places like China, the Middle East, and other regions that many had thought would be difficult to penetrate. These vast fields of souls are ripe and will be massively reached with the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>God has given us the most sublime assignment of all time, which is preaching the Gospel to every creature. He could have used the angels to minister or preach the Gospel for the salvation of men, but He didn’t. He chose us for it instead.
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
We’ve been entrusted with the most important news and message in all the world, for every generation: the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which He said shall be “preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come” (Matthew 24:14). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Be fervent in spirit, and preach the Gospel anywhere and everywhere. Let the light of Christ shine through you continually. Lead people to Christ. His message that we bear is filled with divine power to save and transform men’s lives. Therefore, proclaim it with intensity. Challenge, warn, and urge those around you who haven’t received Christ to do so. We’re in the time of great harvest, and the grace of God for salvation has been poured out upon all men.

<p>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble (James 4:6).</p>
<p>When the Lord gives you an assignment, He empowers you for whatever He calls you to do, by granting you grace for the job. When He increases your responsibilities, He also increases the grace. Except He increases your ability for the higher responsibility, you really can’t accomplish that purpose. That’s why increased grace is so important. Grace here, is the bestowal of special favour and ability to fulfil God’s plan for your life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as you study the Scriptures, you’d discover that there’re different graces. For instance, there’s the grace for salvation, and every child of God received that grace. The Bible says, “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast”</p>
<p>(Ephesians 2:8-9). It’s akin to what the Bible says concerning faith: “according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith” (Romans 12:3).</p>
<p>Just as God dealt to everyone in Christ the measure of faith, even so has the grace for salvation been given to all men. But then, there’s the gift of faith, which is different from the measure of faith given to us in Christ. Likewise, Titus 2:11 says, “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.” But there’re also different graces in Christ.</p>
<p>Hebrews 4:16 says, “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, AND FIND GRACE TO HELP IN TIME OF NEED.” In other words, there’s grace for your assignment; there’s a grace for anything the Lord instructs you to do or that’s consistent with His plan and purpose for your life. Therefore, knowing the Lord’s plans and purposes, you can obtain whatever grace you require. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Say these after Me, &#x27;Dear heavenly Father, I thank you for lavishing me with grace. I take advantage of this grace, riding on it to fulfil your plans and purposes for my life. I make full proof of your grace in my life, for my work, ministry, academics, health, finances, and all that I’m involved with, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace [which was bestowed] upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</p>
<p>2 Peter 1:2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</p>
<p>Galatians 6:18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.</p>

<p>But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them (2 Corinthians 4:3-4 NKJV).</p>
<p>When it comes to winning souls, we must recognise that we are engaged in a “fight.” The Apostle Paul calls it the good fight of faith, because there’re evil and desperately wicked spirits that seek to keep people away from experiencing salvation.</p>
<p>If the sinners don’t receive the Gospel, it’s not because our gospel is difficult or obscure; it’s because Satan has blinded their minds. That’s what we read in our opening verse. Satan is actively working to obstruct their understanding and reception of the truth; that’s why we must intercede for them.</p>
<p>Soul winning is more than just telling someone about Christ; there’s also the fight we fight in prayers. Even when they hear and accept our message, Satan still tries to hinder their growth and progress in Christ, attempting to impede their journey of spiritual maturity. What are we supposed to do? Fight! We contend for their souls in prayer.</p>
<p>It brings to mind what Paul said in Galatians 4:19, “My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.” This is soul-travail! You pray passionately that every resistance to their spiritual growth and progress is broken; and that their desire for the things of the Spirit is sustained in them as they grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Have these in mind as you go forth preaching the Gospel everywhere.Always pray that those with whom you share  the message will receive it with faith,and that Satan’s bondage and deception are destroyed Amen.</p>
<p>Say these after Me, &#x27;Dear Father, I am grateful you entrusted me with the sacred task of sharing the message of eternal life with those around me and in distant lands. I’m filled with a deepened sense of zeal for lost souls, and I affirm that the radiant light of your glorious Gospel shines brightly in the hearts of the lost. I declare that this light dismantles the chains of religious bondage and dispels darkness, bringing forth freedom and salvation, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 3:6 [It is He] Who has qualified us [making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient] as ministers and dispensers of a new covenant [of salvation through Christ], not [ministers] of the letter (of legally written code) but of the Spirit; for the code [of the Law] kills, but the [Holy] Spirit makes alive.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:18-19  But all things are from God, Who through Jesus Christ reconciled us to Himself [received us into favor, brought us into harmony with Himself] and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation [that by word and deed we might aim to bring others into harmony with Him]. 19 It was God [personally present] in Christ, reconciling and restoring the world to favor with Himself, not counting up and holding against [men] their trespasses [but cancelling them], and committing to us the message of reconciliation (of the restoration to favor).</p>
<p>Matthew 28:19-20 Go then and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 Teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days (perpetually, uniformly, and on every occasion), to the [very] close and consummation of the age. Amen (so let it be).</p>

📖 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. (JAMES 4:6)
═══════════════
Grace is the supernatural influence at work in you that causes everything you do to prosper; it’s a divine enablement that causes increase, promotion, and progress! However, the degree to which you let the grace of God in you reflect on the outside is up to you. The more you fill your heart with God’s Word and have the Holy Spirit work in your life, the greater the workings of grace in your life.
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
You can and should increase in that outward reflection of the Glory of God in your spirit, to such an extent that others would see it and testify to it. They might not be able to explain it, but they’ll glorify God for His excellence that’s resplendent in you, and in all you do.</p>
<p>Some Christians are asking God for more anointing, but there’s nowhere in the Bible where it’s stated that God will give you more anointing. All you need is more grace. More grace gives you more capacity to accomplish or do more. As you succeed and make progress, God expands your coast; He increases your ability. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve been managing a business at a certain scale, and now you want to grow it to be ten times or even a hundred times bigger, you need more grace. Otherwise, you may not be able to sustain the new level of growth and increase, because you don’t have the capacity to manage the business at that level. Some people think that in such circumstances what they need is more money, no; they need more grace.

<p>“You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; rich as he was, he made himself poor for your sake, in order to make you rich by means of his poverty.” 2 Corinthians 8:9.</p>
<p>Believe in the super abundance of Jesus Christ. When you study the entire eighth chapter of 2 Corinthians in context, you’d understand that the Apostle Paul was talking about financial and material prosperity. For our sake, the Lord Jesus Christ laid down His reputation, His riches, His wealth; He laid down everything and identified Himself with us, and took our place. He became us on the Cross. Everything He did was for your sake. He wasn’t poor, but He became poor for your sake.</p>
<p>In the same way, you weren’t rich, but now through Him, you’ve been made rich, just as in Him you’ve been made righteous. Until you understand this revelation, you’ll never enter into your wealthy place in God. Your trust shouldn’t be in your family or social background, education, government, society or in the business that you do. Your trust shouldn’t be in any bank; rather it should be in the Word; in whom and what Christ has made you. He’s fulfilled His part.</p>
<p>He said, “Behold, here I am, coming to do Your will, O God—[to fulfill] what is written of Me in the volume of the Book” (Hebrews 10:7 AMPC). He already became poor so that you, through His poverty, might become rich. Now, you’re to step into what He’s done for you and made you. Believe in what He’s done for you, and take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 8:18 KJV But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.</p>
<p>Isaiah 48:17 KJV Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.</p>
<p>3 John 1:2 KJV Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
<p>Say these after Me, &#x27;Dear Father, I’m forever grateful for my glorious inheritance in Christ! As an heir of prosperity, I live to bless others and lift them out of the thraldom of lack through the power of your Spirit that’s at work in me. I walk in super-abundance, and experience undeniable success in all that I do, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith (Romans 12:6).</p>
<p>Understanding the gift of prophecy and how it works is very important, so we can use it accurately. Prophecy is often in operation in an utterance of faith. An utterance of faith is declaration of words that’ll come to pass, or words that you desire to come to pass.</p>
<p>However, you can’t use that level of merely declaring words of faith to alter the course of a nation, a city, a family, or another person’s life. You’d have to know the will of God, and the direction of the Spirit, to utter words that are in consonance with the Spirit of God in order to effect the kind of change that’s consistent with His will.</p>
<p>What this means is that the gift of prophecy must operate through revelation, not just through your utterance of faith. For instance, you might have been in a prayer meeting where the prayer coordinator, being led of the Spirit said, “Prophesy to your country.” Then as a result, you began to speak prophetic words; things you desired to see happen in your country.</p>
<p>However, just because you went ahead and prophesied as instructed didn’t necessarily mean you spoke precisely the mind of God about your country at that particular moment. The words you uttered may be inconsistent with God’s revelation.</p>
<p>This shows that you can’t just stay with the forthtelling part of prophecy; you need the revelatory part as well. You must know the mind of God. When you do, you’ll know what words to speak, and not take sides against Him. It’s the reason we pray a lot in the Spirit. When we pray in the Spirit, our spirits are more open to allow the wisdom of God to bubble up within us, and guide us in the right choice of words.</p>
<p>Moreover, studying the Scriptures also plays a vital role. As you study and meditate on the Scriptures, your spirit is flooded with light; you’re enlightened as to the plans and purposes of God by which you’re able to pray and prophesy in accordance with His will. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Say these after Me, &#x27;Dear Father, I thank you for the gift of prophecy, which is operational in my life and with which I bless and edify my world. I prophesy that your righteousness is established in the hearts of men around the world; and through the truth of the Gospel, salvation, healing and health, prosperity and success, deliverance, wholeness, preservation, peace and joy spread in the nations of the earth, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Rev. Chris Oyakhilome Dsc DSc DD
1ST OCTOBER 2023~15265</p>
<p>There are a couple of things happening in our world that we must address and deal with.
They are not really as new as many people think 
When we read the bible we see that these are things that have been there a long long time.
Somehow there are people that are given new opportunities to old sins and unrighteousnesses. </p>
<p>Ephesians 6:12-
This scripture informs God&#x27;s people that the real enemy is not another human being. In the world, there are lots of problems that people face; local, within the home, within your city, institution, the country, or the world.
We wrestle not against flesh and blood..</p>
<p>Mark 16: 17-
Devils= demons. 
Demon= Greek &quot;Daimon&quot;. It particularly refers to some deity. It historically comes from &quot;Distribution of fortunes&quot; (fortune tellers). The spirits that were supposed to distribute fortunes whether they were good or bad (God&#x27;s and goddesses). Most didn&#x27;t know what was behind these spiritual entities. 
Some use the word &quot;Demons&quot; carelessly to refer to a bad habit. They don&#x27;t know what they are talking about. These are real demons. </p>
<p>There are some generic terms in the bible that refer to these supernatural beings of evil:; Demons, evil spirits.
In the OT you find &quot;evil spirit&quot; more frequently used than in in the new. They assumed that if someone was affected or confronted by an evil spirit, it was from God. The idea was that everything came from God whether good or bad. 
That&#x27;s why Jesus came to let us know who God really is; His character.
Even the prophets of old didn&#x27;t really know him.
When God manifested himself to Moses in n exodus 6, he said &quot;I am Jehovah. Your Fathers knew me as Elshaddai&quot;. 
Jesus comes and says &quot;I and my Father are one. If you have seen me, you have seen the Father&quot;. Then we study to know it was true. He was God in human flesh, born of a virgin.. which was supposed to be humanly impossible. 
Mary became pregnant by the prophetic word spoken to her. She became pregnant by the power of the holy spirit. That&#x27;s why Jesus is called the word of God/logos in Flesh. 
The scriptures are replete with information on the person of Jesus. 
Until you discover that Jesus truly is God, you don&#x27;t know him. </p>
<p>One things the Jews walere sure if, was that Joseph was not his real father. 
Jesus told them about the ascension and it happened. He ascended before their eyes, proving who he was. 
Not only did he prove himself to be deity from his miraculous works, he also proved himself to be God by his miraculous death, resurrection and ascension to heaven..
He ascended in his physical body. 
They watched him go. That never happened to anybody from the creation of the world. 
The Biggest thing that ever happened in this world!!!</p>
<p>Where do demons come from? Who are they? Another generic term used not directly from scripture but definitely implied is &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;. 
There are 2 kinds of Fallen Angels. 
There are those that fell together with Satan/Lucifer, then another group..
The first group are still in this world and they have an order.. beginning with their boss, Satan the devil. He is the personification of evil. They do evil things. </p>
<p>KJV, NIV John 8:44 This is the character Satan and the same character of the fallen angels. This let&#x27;s us know who was behind the killing of Abel. It is natural for Satan to lie. He never tells the truth. </p>
<p>(Documentary: THE GENDER AGENDA)</p>
<p>We see that those young people were lied to and deceived. Not just the deception that came from medical officials, school teachers and their peers, but more importantly the lies that came from Demons/evil spirits. 
Many times, they are not able to distinguish between words coming from a human being and words from an evil spirit. </p>
<p>Acts 19:13-17
What is Vagabond Jews: These guys walking around aimlessly, hopelessly, Jobless....</p>

📖 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid (1 CORINTHIANS 6:15)
═══════════════
Jesus said, “You shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover” (Mark 16:18), because your hands aren’t ordinary; they’re the hands of Jesus. That’s what we read in our theme verse: “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?” Your feet are the feet of Christ. Your eyes are the eyes of Christ. He walks, talks, sees and blesses through you. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>I’ve often wondered when Christians sing, “My hands are blessed” if they understand the implication of their words and the power of the truth professed. The reason your hands are blessed is that they’re the hands of Jesus, and He’s made you a blessing. So, your hands are the extension of you (the blessing), because you’re the extension of Christ. Hallelujah!
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
Therefore, learn to use your hands. There’s victory power through your hands. There’s a profuse effusion of divine power when you stretch or lift your hands in prayer and worship. The same thing happens when you stretch it in the direction of a situation you want changed or something or someone you want blessed.</p>
<p>For example, if there’s something that’s been damaged in your home, or there’s a situation in your life that you want changed, with your mouth and your hands, you can change anything! The Bible tells us that by the stretching forth of the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders were wrought amongst the people (Acts 5:12).</p>
<p>As you stretch forth your hands, hopes will be restored; burdens will be lifted; sicknesses and diseases will be healed; destinies will be changed, by the power of the Holy Spirit. Use your hands today in faith, and watch miracles happen.
═══════════════
PRAYER
═══════════════
Dear Father, thank you for your power in me. You’ve infused me with divine ability to heal, deliver, remove burdens and cause people to prosper! I’m a package of solution to my world. Thank you for your grace at work in me to bless and lift others, in Jesus’ Name. Amen

📖 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her (LUKE 10:42)
═══════════════
There’re those who get so carried away with their work and other activities that they lose focus of what truly matters—the Word! They get so preoccupied in the many activities that they don’t have time to fellowship, study and meditate on the Word. That’s wrong!</p>
<p>The Word of God is your food for life. 1 Peter 1:23 says, “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.” You were born of the Word and can only be sustained by the Word. 1 Peter 2:2 says, “As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.”</p>
<p>True and lasting success comes from conscious meditation on the Word of God: “This Book of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe and do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall deal wisely and have good success” (Joshua 1:8 AMPC).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus counselled Martha in Luke 10, He was unequivocal in letting her know what to prioritize: the Word! He said, “Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her” (Luke 10:41-42).
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
No wonder the Spirit says to us in Colossians 3:16 AMPC, “Let the word [spoken by] Christ (the Messiah) have its home [in your hearts and minds] and dwell in you in [all its] richness, as you teach and admonish and train one another in all insight and intelligence and wisdom [in spiritual things, and as you sing] psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, making melody to God with [His] grace in your hearts.”</p>
<p>Give attention to the Word and fellowship with the Holy Spirit! Spend quality time in prayer, every day; you’ll experience such peace and prosperity—such blessings and glory in your life that you never thought possible. Hallelujah!
═══════════════
PRAYER
═══════════════
Dear Father, I’m blessed and transformed to hear and receive your Word today! Even now, your Word stirs faith in me, dispelling worry, doubt and fear; I’m built up by the Word of your grace, walking in my inheritance in Christ. Amen.

<p>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil (Ephesians 5:15-16).</p>
<p>Time is an asset, which you must learn to invest wisely. Investing your time wisely means investing your time in spiritual things. Moses had this on his mind when he prayed to the Lord to “Teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom” (Psalms 90:12). Each day you live is an opportunity to accomplish so much, but the question is: How well do you schedule your day?</p>
<p>When you wake up in the morning, don’t just roll off your bed and stumble blindly into the day. Spend quality time first to fellowship with the Holy Spirit in prayer and in the Word. Ask Him to guide you as you schedule your activities for the day and prioritize your activities. Ask Him to help you save time, and you’d discover how much you’re able to accomplish for the Kingdom on a daily basis. Then, you’ll become more productive, effective and progressive.</p>
<p>Remember that life’s got no extra time; so make every day count by doing only those things that’ll advance the Kingdom of God, and improve your life. There’re people who have desired for a long time to read the entire Bible in one year but haven’t been able to achieve this. Some start bu tdon’t complete it. “I usually don’t have enough time,” they lament, trying to exonerate themselves, but that’s not a good enough excuse. Time is a fixed asset; it’s only twenty-four hours in one day; so we have to prioritize.</p>
<p>If you were wishing to have more time to study God’s Word, the truth is, you may never get it. What you need is to create the time to study the Word, and schedule your prayer times as well, because your whole future depends on it. Proverbs 1:32 says, “For the turning away of the simple shall slay them” The simple are those who ignore truth; they ignore revelation and never take spiritual things seriously. They know it’s important to pray, but they’re too busy to do so. God calls them the simple, and He says their complacent attitude shall make them victims in life.</p>
<p>Don’t be like the simple, who would rather do other things than spend time on spiritual matters. Choose always to be spiritually alert so that when the “evil day” comes, it’ll meet you well prepared and you’ll know what to do!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prayer-and-fasting-for-results---rev-chris-oyakhilome16290">PRAYER AND FASTING FOR RESULTS - REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME~16290<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to PRAYER AND FASTING FOR RESULTS - REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME~16290" title="Direct link to PRAYER AND FASTING FOR RESULTS - REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME~16290" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#prayer-and-fasting-for-results---rev-chris-oyakhilome16290">​</a></h2>
<p>Prayer and fasting are spiritual ACTIVITIES.
There are various kinds of prayers. The Prophetic prayer is one and it is done by telling forth the word of God. It is done by the Spirit. Other forms of prayer include praise and worship prayer, and intercessory prayer.</p>
<p>In prayer and fasting programme like this, you don&#x27;t only pray at the end. Rather you are I perpetual prayer and studying session throughout the day. You are being filled with tongues, word and prophecies throughout the day. You are being staired in the spirit all day. You are filled with the word, inspiration and impartation of the spirit then you close it with a congregational prayer session.</p>
<p>In the morning, you spend time to pray. Have the praying sessions. You pray for the growth of the church around the world, for individuals and groups.</p>
<p>The most important kinds of prayer for a time like is the prophetic and, worship and praise prayer. The result of such if mixed with faith, will linger for a long time.</p>
<p>If you will prayer, you will be stairing up your spirit to get the thoughts of God for that hour, day and coming year. Two days charge of the spirit via the spiritual activities may not be enough. Hence, the need to make it three days.</p>
<p>The Spirit of God needs our attention and that&#x27;s why we have activities like this for this time. They sets our mind on course for the purpose. Set our affections on God. This helps one to adjust oneself to God&#x27;s perfect will.</p>
<p>The lack of Joy and fulfillment admist believers is because people are in the wrong place; out of the will of God.Prayer and fasting helps you to lift yourself beyond the wall. You see farther.</p>
<p>Other benefit is the conditioning of spirit.</p>
<p>Condition your spirit to think success only. The mind set deals with the way you think.</p>
<p>Preconditioning deals with the inspiration that comes from fellowship.</p>
<p>It keeps one God-inside minded. It gives a sense of fellowship and the zeal to commune more.</p>

📖 I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions (ACTS 2:17).
═══════════════
God loves to show us visions when we pray. If you’re going to have extraordinary results in life, it’s important that you learn to catch the visions that the Spirit of God brings to you. When I pray, I see; I relate with divine visions; I’m lifted above this world; I receive ideas from God and get directions for life.
Some people don’t see visions when they pray.</p>
<p>To be visionless is to be stagnated. But one sound idea from God can transform your life forever. This happens as you shut out the world and fellowship with the Holy Spirit in prayer. Then He shows you the future and helps you know the next vital step to take, and how to take it. As you give yourself to the Word of God and yield to the leading of the Holy Spirit in prayer, He’d show you things to come, such that you don’t walk in darkness.
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
Jesus said in John 16:13, “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.” Being born again and filled with the Holy Spirit, you can know something of your future.</p>
<p>You should never find yourself in a situation where you don’t know what to do next in your life. In John 8:12, the Master said, “I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” Knowing this, you don’t have to worry about tomorrow; you can take His light and set it into your future, and your path will be illuminated to know and walk in His perfect will for you. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>🗣️SAY THESE WITH ME
&#x27;Dear Father, thank you for the privilege of prayer, and the ability to see the right vision of who I am in Christ. My path is illuminated with endless possibilities. I see that I’m righteous, holy and perfected in Christ, and beloved of Him. What a blessing it is to see that I’m the carrier, as well as the effulgence of your glory, and the dispenser of your grace, mercies, goodness and salvation to my world. Hallelujah!</p>

📖 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (HEBREWS 11:1)
═══════════════
Imagine that someone, a very rich person that you know, gives you a signed cheque and says, “Fill in any amount you want!” God gave Solomon a blank cheque by asking him, “What do you want?” Solomon asked for wisdom and understanding (1 Kings 3:8-9). God didn’t send an angel from heaven to make Solomon wise. All He said was, “Solomon, you have it!” The moment God spoke those words, Solomon became what God said.</p>
<p>It’s such a blessing to hear God and to receive His Word. His Word to you at any time in your life regarding any situation is all you need. In Matthew 17:20, Jesus said, “If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.” He just told you nothing shall be impossible unto you. That’s a blank cheque from God waiting to be cashed. All you have to do is fill in the blanks; the cheque has already been signed. When was it signed?
═══════════════</p>
<p>═══════════════
It was signed when the Holy Ghost came into your heart to live in you. The Bible says, “It’s in Christ that you, once you heard the truth and believed it (this Message of your salvation), found yourselves home free—signed, sealed, and delivered by the Holy Spirit” (Ephesians 1:13 MSG). So, it’s been signed!</p>
<p>It’s time for you to fill it out. But how? It’s with your mouth! The Bible says, “my tongue is the pen of a ready writer” (Psalm 45:1). You fill in the blanks by speaking; as you declare words of faith in agreement with God, you’re writing in the Spirit; you’re composing a good matter! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>If life has been somewhat difficult and you’ve found yourself struggling, it’s because you haven’t filled in the blanks. The cheque has been signed, meaning that you’ve been authorized. Don’t wait anymore; start talking and watch your life go from glory to glory.
═══════════════
CONFESSION
═══════════════
I accept my new reality and identity in Christ. I’m whom God says I am: holy, unblameable and unreproveable in His sight. I’m born of the incorruptible seed of God’s Word. I’m unconquerable and indestructible because the Word of God is my life. God’s nature of righteousness is in my spirit and I live in absolute mastery over circumstances. Hallelujah!

📖 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned (Matthew 12:36-37)
═══════════════
A witness is a proof producer; one who has evidence. We produce evidence that Jesus is alive and that His message of salvation is a message that works. Hallelujah! 2 Corinthians 5:19 says, “To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.” This is our message.</p>
<p>Jesus brought humanity out of sin so that they might inherit His righteousness. He brought us out of death, pain and penury so that we might have life to the full and live in prosperity, health and wellness. Now we can help those who don’t know Him to discover His light, learn about Him and receive His righteousness. He saved us and made us His partners in saving others.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 6:1-2 says, “We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation).&quot; We’re living in the day of salvation, the day of God’s grace, today. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>As we approach the end of this present world, we ’re to live circumspectly, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus (Colossians 1:28). He wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4). That’s why He sent us to preach the Good News of salvation.</p>
<p>In Matthew 9:37-38, Jesus said to His disciples, “The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.” We’re His labourers for the end-time harvest, sent with the message of His saving power. We’re the bearers of the Gospel of His grace. What an honour!</p>

PRAYER

I chart a greater and brighter future for myself with my words. I take my place of dominion and I reign in the Name of Jesus over circumstances through words. I speak the right words only, thereby effecting changes in my family, health, business and ministry. The world is subject to me. I walk in righteousness and produce works of righteousness. Amen.

<p>SEASON 9, PHASE 1, DAY 2</p>
<p>REV. CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DSC DD~16915</p>
<p>(Documentary: Paid to Lie , Pt 2)</p>
<p>The nefarious and mendacious media are all part of Satan&#x27;s agenda. They are paid to lie..
The bible says that lies are for a short time and that all liars will find themselves in the Lake of fire.
Pray for the Media; for those who have yielded themselves to falsehood.</p>
<p>This is Day 2, Phase 1, Season 9.</p>
<p>When you hear the term &#x27;a new world order&#x27;, what comes to your mind?
What do they mean?
It was George Bush Snr who made that term popular. He didn&#x27;t create it, but he made it popular.</p>
<p>Yesterday I explained to you what they actually mean when they talk about the rule of law.
When they talk about a new world Order, they are referring to the same thing as the rule of law. It is actually an euphemism for a global ecological pecking order.</p>
<p>These are masters of diplomacy. They know how to use language. That is a real subterfuge.</p>
<p>For example, in the WHO pandemic preparedness treaty, not many understand that their plan has got nothing to do with health. In that treaty (which they don&#x27;t put out there for everybody to see), it is so voluminous with lots of repetitious language with legal terminology that the layman would be bored to read. It&#x27;s thousands of pages just so that you allow it pass. They tell you the friendly things you&#x27;d like to hear.
But that document seems emergency powers. They want to be able from the WHO hQ to declare a health emergency in your country far away.  In that document, they are the ones to decide that there is a health emergency in your country.
And with that decision, they arrogate to themselves by that treaty, the power to declare emergency rule.
Your parliament and government will be suspended and your government will be ruled by Decrees.
That will be THE END of your nation state.
This is what is in that treaty.
They would have the power to control your country.</p>
<p>During the COVID lockdown, the governments were locked down and run by Decrees and they were taking counsel from the friends of the WHO. (Like lobbyists in the tobacco or pharmaceutical industry)
These people are heartless because it&#x27;s a Satanic work and Satan is heartless.</p>
<p>This thing is not so much about money as it is about control. That&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t care how much they put into it because they know that money is nothing. If you have the control, it doesn&#x27;t matter how much a person&#x27;s got.</p>
<p>You find the Grandchildren of the Eugenicists coming to hatch out what their grandparents planned long ago. It&#x27;s about Eugenics and they world they would like to create.
But we will not live in their world. They will live in our world. Until the rapture of the church, we control everything.
Their plan will not work.
We are still praying.</p>
<p>REVELATION CONTINUED....</p>
<p>When you read the book of Revelation the insight you gain is beyond eschatology for ethics. It helps to position you spiritually, mentally, emotionally. It helps to guide your hopes. You realize that we are not doing what we are doing for nothing or just for this world. It&#x27;s beyond this world.</p>
<p>I showed you a diagram. (The book of Revelation in chapters)
Chapters 2&amp;3 are warnings to the churches.
From Chapter 4 to 22, he is dealing with things that will be hereafter.</p>
<p>By Chapter 4, the rapture has taken place.
Chapter 4&amp;5 are about activities on heaven
Chapter 6-18 is about Judgements.
Chapter 19, the Lord is coming to the earth to complete the Judgement and begin his millennial reign..</p>
<p>The book is not put in order in a chronological way. It&#x27;s like a panorama.</p>
<p>Revelation 4: KJV, AMPC
V1:  After the warnings to the churches....He is looking into Heaven now.
Whose voice sounded like a trumpet?
It was not Jesus&#x27;s voice. (Rev 1:1). It&#x27;s that angel who is showing John.</p>
<p>V2-3: AMPC helps with description.
Sardius is like reddish glowing stone...
It&#x27;s all like stones...</p>

<p>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness (2 Peter 1:5-6).
Godliness in our opening text means piety or godly reverence.</p>
<p>God wants you to have some piety in your life. He wants you to build a godly character with the Word. There’re some things you shouldn’t do, not because they’re bad in themselves, but because they’re not excellent. He wants you to be an example of a true Christian in the way you conduct yourself.
Even though Christianity isn’t essentially an outward show, in our opening verse, the Apostle Peter is dealing with an outward show—those actions that are seen as godly. There should be some calmness and spiritual decency in your life. Never be rough and brash—in your communication or attitude—because you’re always in the presence of God and in the presence of angels.</p>
<p>Never use obscene or vulgar language. Consciously say and do the right things, even when no one is watching. Have some piety, not only when you come to church. You’re an ambassador of Christ; you represent Christ. Reflect Him in your demeanour and in every aspect of your life.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re the symbol and embodiment of the glory, perfection, beauty, and righteousness of Christ. Therefore, conduct yourself, your life, accordingly: &quot;be an example (pattern) for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity” (1 Timothy 4:12 AMPC).</p>
<p>Confession
I’m the symbol and embodiment of the glory, perfection, beauty, and righteousness of Christ. I’m an example of the believer in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity. I set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Christ, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor (Psalm 8:4-5 ASV).</p>
<p>I’m ever so awed by the wisdom and greatness of our God. To think that He’d choose us—the new creation—to be His partners in executing His master-plan of salvation for the world beggars the imagination. The greatest of it all, which the angels themselves are amazed at, is that this great God of glory would call us into fellowship with Himself through the Holy Spirit, and give us the Holy Spirit to live in us. The angels haven’t got over that yet; they’re still seeking to understand its implication.</p>
<p>The angels of God are glorious beings; they know who they are: they’re mighty, and excellent in glory, but they’re amazed at what God has done for and with us, because as glorious as they are, God doesn’t live in them. However, as “unworthy” as we were, He gave us a new life and made us His living tabernacles. This is a mystery to the angels; they don’t understand the reason for this yet. And guess what! God chose us to explain it to them.</p>
<p>Every time we preach Jesus, and teach about the Holy Spirit, the angels listen. They love it! Because it’s something they only know about from the Scripture, but they don’t have the experience; they don’t know what it’s like; so they hear it from us. Read this beautiful verse: “To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God” (Ephesians 3:10).</p>
<p>This is the Apostle Paul writing to the Church; we’re the ones from whom the principalities and powers in heavenly places get to know the mysteries of God, and His multifaceted wisdom. The Bible lets us know that the angels would have given anything to be in on this (1 Peter 1:12), but we’ve been chosen to explain the mysteries to them. Since this is part of our responsibilities as God’s children, it means we must know the Word, live in the Word, and live out the Word, as the expression of the living Word.Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father (Galatians 4:1-2).</p>
<p>Oftentimes, when people read the portion of the scripture above, they think it only refers to human leaders. But no; it includes angels. Angels protect and watch over you to ensure your wellbeing, and they report to the Father in heaven.</p>
<p>However, when a Christian walks in the flesh and against the Word, angels also have the right to wield the rod of correction.
In the Gospel of Luke, the Bible describes for us the Archangel Gabriel’s visit to Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist. The angel told him he’d have a son, but Zechariah doubted him, saying, “Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years” (Luke 1:18).</p>
<p>The response provoked the angel, and he smote Zechariah with dumbness until the child was born. The angel disciplined Zechariah for daring to doubt his message. Angels minister for us; they run errands for us, but they have authority to take certain actions.
This is why, as a Christian, you must be careful in your life. Refuse to be rude, proud or arrogant.</p>
<p>Don’t disregard spiritual authority and instructions. Angels frown at such things. The Bible specifically tells us to respect authority, because of the angels. Many are facing certain challenges in their lives that wouldn’t go away; and it’s because they’re walking against God’s Word. Until and unless they make a change, there’ll be no solution.</p>
<p>Walk in the wisdom of God by acting on the Word. Honour and revere those the Lord has placed over you to teach and raise you up spiritually. Be quick to act on spiritual instructions. Walk in love. These will strengthen your spiritual effectiveness and enhance the ministry of angels in your life.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, your Word is building me up strong, and your wisdom is evident in my daily walk, as I press towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. I walk in righteousness and true holiness, and my desire is wholly to please you in all things, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. (Colossians 3:16).</p>
<p>Human life is controlled from the realm of the spirit, and to remain ignorant of that is to fool oneself. Whether we&#x27;re conscious or ignorant of the laws that exist in that realm makes no difference; they&#x27;ll work either for you or against you, just as natural laws. The law of gravity, for example, will work for or against you, depending on your application of or relation to it.</p>
<p>Your life is dependent on your right application of spiritual laws, for life is spiritual. There&#x27;re people who, after leading nations and building successful careers, were reduced to nothing because Satan got a hold of them. If only they had recognized that life is spiritual! The Bible says, &quot;(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ&quot; (2 Corinthians 10:4-5).</p>
<p>The strongholds described above aren&#x27;t metal barriers or walls; they&#x27;re ideas in people&#x27;s heads, and theories they&#x27;ve accepted in life that have kept them from moving in the direction of God&#x27;s dream and destiny for them. Those ideas were built into their minds by satanic forces. That&#x27;s why some people will reject tithing, and refuse to pay their tithes even though they&#x27;ve heard about the blessings and the fulfilment of the promises of God for the one who pays his tithes.</p>
<p>Those strongholds can only be pulled down by the power of God&#x27;s Spirit, and His Word. In Psalm 119:66, the Psalmist said, &quot;Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.&quot; He knew that believing the commandments wasn&#x27;t enough, and so he asked the Lord to teach him good judgment, which is akin to spiritual knowledge. He asked to be granted the wisdom to discern the principles of the spirit realm, to know what is of God and what isn&#x27;t of God.</p>
<p>Make rich deposits of the Word in your spirit, through study and meditation. Colossians 3:16 says, &quot;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.&quot; This is a vital key to living successfully and navigating your way gloriously through life.</p>
<p>CONFESSION
The Word of God is my light and my life. Through the word, I live successfully and navigate through life victoriously. I&#x27;m set on the course of glory and excellence, making progress by the power of the spirit! Halleluiah.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-real-you--pastor-chris-oyakhilome17111">THE REAL YOU – PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~17111<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to THE REAL YOU – PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~17111" title="Direct link to THE REAL YOU – PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME.~17111" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#the-real-you--pastor-chris-oyakhilome17111">​</a></h2>
<p>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth (John 4:24).</p>
<p>Just as God is a Spirit, man is also a spirit, and was made in the image and in the likeness of God. Thus, your body isn’t you; it’s your house, the home of your spirit. Your physical eyes can’t see by themselves; they’re windows through which your spirit sees the world around you.</p>
<p>Romans 12:1 says, “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.” If your body were the real you, how then would you be able to present it to God? Who would do the “presenting,” seeing that your body is what YOU are to present? This lets you know there’s more to you than your physical body; you’re a spirit being.</p>
<p>The real you is who Peter calls the “hidden man of the heart” (1 Peter 3:4). He’s the same one the Apostle Paul calls the “inward man” (2 Corinthians 4:16). The inward man is the human spirit; the one who can’t be seen with the physical eyes. The “outward man” is the body with its five senses. The real “you” is the inward man, not the outward man. When you speak, it’s the inward man that talks through your mouth.</p>
<p>Too many are only concerned about what’s going on in their bodies, not giving the required attention to developing and educating their spirits. The man inside, your spirit, is the one that God deals with and relates to, not the physical body. The Lord relates with your spirit in leading and guiding you; He contacts you through your spirit. Walk in this consciousness, and live beyond physical circumstances.
Your spirit is where the life of God resides. When you received the Holy Spirit, He mingled with your spirit and became one with your spirit, in an inseparable union (1 Corinthians 6:17).</p>
<p>Now you can better understand why your spirit is what really matters to God. It’s important to learn how to function from your spirit, and the way to do this is to keep your focus on the Word of God, and live from inside out, refusing to be moved by the dictates of your physical senses.</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, I thank you for your light in my spirit; I live from inside out, fully conscious of your life and glory in me. I refuse to be moved by the dictates of my physical senses, but keep my focus on your eternal Word by which I’m transformed from glory to glory, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p>

<p>Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God forever and ever. Amen (Revelation 7:12).</p>
<p>One important thing you can give to God is your praise and thanksgiving. In Luke 17:17, Jesus asked the leper who returned to give thanks, “Were there not ten cleansed? But where are the nine.” In Matthew 26:27, Jesus gave thanks to God for the cup – His own blood that would be shed! David wanted to show kindness to anyone who was left of the house of Saul, because of his gratitude to his friend Jonathan (2 Samuel 9:7).</p>
<p>Elisha prayed for the woman who provided him with food and shelter to have a child – that was his expression of gratitude for the love she had shown to him (2 Kings 4:12-17).</p>
<p>Maybe you’re thinking to yourself that there’s particularly nothing to be thankful for; you’re thinking, “After all, I’m sick” “I’m unhappy”; “I have bills to pay.” Well, if you’re a Christian, your life ought to be radiant and full of thanksgiving. Ephesians 5:20 says, “Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”
Your prayers must be filled with gratitude, irrespective of what you feel or what you’re going through. Do not only acknowledge what you can see, rather acknowledge what God has done, because that is what keeps you living a life of gratitude.</p>
<p>Give God your praise and thanksgiving today as a demonstration of your gratitude for all He’s done for you. He deserves all your praise and adoration.</p>

<p>Isaiah 10:17
The Assyrian is the spiritual depiction  of the Antichrist.</p>
<p>Remember we are the light of the world, and he is saying our light will not just brighten but become a fire;</p>
<p>We are about to consume and destroy those things that the Antichrist spirit is doing aroind the world.
I told you about the things they are doing around the world.
But we are the fire and they are the chaff.</p>
<p>I saw armies marching in the spirit. 
This month is the month of Formations
Formations is the arrangement of people or things for unity; for a definite purpose. 
It is the act of forming or establishing something.
In the realm of the spirit we are having military formations. Things are going on.
We came together in February and in March we are getting organized. 
Something is happening in the  spirit.</p>
<p>(Prayer session)</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 10:3
God designed Weapons with which to pull frown strongholds. We have such spirutual weapons that are  mightily effective.</p>
<p>All the works of darkness, of deception in the Nations of the world, Doesn&#x27;t matter what forces are behind them; doesn&#x27;t matter that they use the media....
The lying tongue is only for a short time
The lying tongue cannot be successful.
In the day of the church when the spirit of truth is poured out on us around the world, the power of deception cannot prevail .
We live and function by the spirit of truth and we are releasing truth to all Nations and deception cannot stand against this power od truth.</p>
<p>The day of deception will come when the whole world will be deceived, but that day is not today.</p>
<p>This is the day of the church and we insist on it in the name of Jesus.  
We have overcome the world. 
This is God&#x27;s  truth. </p>
<p>(Prayer)</p>
<p>John 16:7-14
The Holy Ghost carries out His work of conviction on the Nations and  he will convince them of truth.</p>
<p>In Acts 2, the Holy Ghost came in full force to begin his ministry and He has been here ever since to guide men into all truth</p>

<p>To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved (Ephesians 1:6).</p>
<p>The word “accepted” in the scripture above is “charitoo” (Greek), and it means to grace; that ‌ is, to be imbued with special honour; make accepted or be highly favoured. So, the scripture should actually read, “He has made us highly favoured in the beloved.” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Someone in Scripture who got such a description was Mary. Luke 1:28 says, “And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured” And that’s exactly what God is telling you; you’re blessed and highly favoured.</p>
<p>Mary was blessed and highly favoured because she was to carry Jesus in her womb through the Word. Today, you’re carrying Jesus in your spirit through the Word. Glory to God! His Word isn’t just in you, His Word is your life, for you’re born of the Word. What a life He’s given us!</p>
<p>What does it mean to be favoured? It means that you’re blessed beyond measure; you’re blessed of God even when you don’t seem to deserve it. In essence, look beyond your ability; look beyond whether or not you qualify; God Himself is your ability and your sufficiency. That’s what it says in 2 Corinthians 3:5, “Our sufficiency is of Him.”
Being highly favoured means everything you do prospers. Even when others fail or make losses, you excel, because you’re sponsored by the Spirit; he orders your steps. Even if you were surrounded by critics and detractors, it’ll make no difference because you’re God’s man or woman, piloted by grace.</p>
<p>As God’s favour is manifested in your behalf, doors and opportunities which can’t be humanly explained are open to you. The Bible says, “And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance” (2 Corinthians 9:8 AMPC). This is God’s desire for you. Psalm 5:12 says, “For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.” Everywhere and every time, throughout this year, be conscious that you’re blessed and highly favoured.</p>
<p>CONFESSION
I’m divinely favoured and positioned for the glorious life! Grace has put me ahead, and I can never be disadvantaged! I increase in beauty, honour and influence. I live and walk with the consciousness of one who’s blessed of the Lord; and through me, blessings are dispersed to those in my world. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked….and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God (Ephesians 6:16-17).</p>
<p>The Word of God is a sword; it’s an offensive weapon for spiritual warfare. Notice that Paul didn’t ask that you thrust or strike the enemy with a physical copy of the Bible as you would a physical sword, no! The Greek rendering for “word” in this verse is “Rhema.” and it means the spoken Word.</p>
<p>“Rheme” is a specific Word at a specific time for a specific purpose. Thus, the ‘Rhema’ of God is the Word of God from your heart to your mouth-the inspired Word that comes out of your mouth. In the Master’s encounter with the devil, the Bible tells us. “Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God” (Luke 4:4 NKJV). Again, the underlined word is translated “Rhema” (Greek). The Lord Jesus, in speaking “Rhema, wielded the sword of the Spirit (the weapon of the spoken word) and discomfited the devil.</p>
<p>God’s “Rhema word isn’t just a word that’s kept in your heart: rather, it’s inspired by God and comes out of your mouth. It’s always a word said, or a word in saying, Hallelujah! Always put the Word on your lips: if it’s not coming out of your mouth, it’s not a sword; it’s not a weapon.</p>
<p>Just as the “Rhema” word is a weapon with which you get on the offensive against the adversary, your faith is a weapon, a shield against the adversary and his onslaught: “Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.” You don’t have to look around for a shield called faith; faith is in your spirit. You were born again with the measure of faith you require (Romans 12:3) to live victoriously and reign gloriously in life. All you need do is grow it by more of God’s Word and strengthen it by using it.</p>
<p>That faith neutralizes, quenches, defuses and puts out all the fiery darts the enemy throws at you. Your faith is the victory over all circumstances and adversities of life: “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith ” (1 John 5:4). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>PRAYER
Dear Father, your Word is in my heart and in my mouth prevailing as I speak it forth! I speak forth righteousness, wisdom, prosperity, victory and abundance. And with the shield of faith, I extinguish and render ineffective the fiery darts, lies, tricks and stratagems of the adversary, walking on in the victory of the Lord. Amen.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:13-16; Hebrews 4:12; Hebrews 11:3</p>

<p>My dear friends, don’t believe everything you hear. Carefully weigh and examine what people tell you. Not everyone who talks about God comes from God. There are a lot of lying preachers loose in the world (1 John 4:1 MSG).</p>
<p>Some people are quick to believe visions, dreams, or prophecies without first finding out whether or not such visions, dreams or prophesies are in line with the Word of God. This accounts for mess many have found themselves in today. A vision, dream, or prophecy that isn’t consistent with God’s Word, is not from Him. In fact, such visions, prophecies, revelations and dreams should be rebuked in Jesus’ Name!</p>
<p>The only sure way to know if a vision, dream, prophecy or revelation is from God is to check its consistency with the Word. God doesn’t contradict Himself. Take for example someone who dreams about getting married to a non-Christian. There’s no need to muse about such a dream because it definitely contradicts the Word. 2 Corinthians 6:14 says, “Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness? ”</p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 5:21 says “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.” In other words, subject all things to the light of God’s Word. Don’t accept a prophecy, dream or vision that doesn’t measure up with the Word. Just because you felt good about it doesn’t mean it came from God.</p>
<p>God’s Word is the supreme authority – the sole standard – by which we judge whether the manifestations we see or experience are for Him. Therefore, judge all prophecies with the Word; if they are not in sync with the revelations of the new creation in Christ, they must be discarded.</p>

<p>REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DSC DD~18087</p>
<p>We have to watch and pray</p>
<p>Dan 4
King Nebuchadnezzar had a dream and wanted Daniel to interpret the  dream. There is an important part of the dream
Damiel 4:15-16
The subject of this dream was Nebuchadnezzar himself. He was to be givem the heart of a beast. He would become like an animal and go into the bush.
For 7 years, he would live like an animal... And at the end of that period he would come back and continue to be King and run the empire.</p>
<p>V17:
God can take even those non compos mentis and put them in places of authority.</p>
<p>We can&#x27;t just leave things the way they are. We must pray. Because the spiritual controls the physical.</p>
<p>Romans 8:26
&#x27;help&#x27; comes from different words which means to take hold together against. Or to take hold together from the opposite side.
But it is literally the former.<br>
<!-- -->That presupposes that One is joining together with another to put their forces together to work against another.</p>
<p>He takes hold together with us against... In our limitations and weaknesses, we form a force together  against whatsoever it is thay comes against us.</p>
<p>Luke 10:39-41
Jesus was teaching. Mary sat at his feet to listen to his message, but we are told about Martha.</p>
<p>Martha was Cumbered.<br>
<!-- -->Read from the RSV.
Martha was distracted with much serving.
She wasn&#x27;t saying Mary should come and help with the food, but she wanted Mary to help because she was anxious and troubled about many thungs. The Master understood this .</p>
<p>Imagine you find yourself distracted by many things.. The holy spirit helps us in that situation so that our minds can become calm and we can have composure.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t even know the details of how to pray as we ought. But the holy spirit intercedes for us with deep sighs.
This is not referring to speaking in tongues. They are sighs and groanings too deep foe words. Like you are crying and you don&#x27;t know why.  Words are not coming out of your mouth. You are just sobbing.</p>
<p>The holy ghost makes intercession for the saints. Whatever you are praying  about will be answered because you are prayinf by the holyghost.</p>
<p>V28: When you pray like that you just know everything is going to work out for your good. You just know it.<br>
<!-- -->Verse 28 is based on verse 26&amp;27</p>
<p>If you want everything to always turn out for your good, practice verse 26&amp;27</p>
<p>Colossians 4:12... Epaphras was recorded to always do this.  He laboured fervently in prayer.<br>
<!-- -->It is to strive/to contend for something or with an adversary.<br>
<!-- -->Epaphras got into contention with some force on behalf on the saints in Colosse.<br>
<!-- -->1 Tim 6:12. Fight the good fight.</p>
<p>Genesis 20:17-18; 21:1
Abimelech had taken Abrahams wife until God talked to Abimelech in the night and instructed him to restore Sarah to her husband.<br>
<!-- -->At this time, Abraham already had the promise that he would bear a son through Sarah but there was no pregnancy yet.
Abraham was told to pray for Abimelech.
(They had been made barren before because of Sarah)
After Abraham prayed for Abimelech&#x27;s household to receive children, Sarah was able to receive her miracle too.</p>
<p>Job 42:
Job had lost everything.<br>
<!-- -->His friends came to see him and were speculating as to what may have  caused his downfall, asking him to repent of whatever sin he may have committed.<br>
<!-- -->God stepped in and corrected the friends that  they were wrong with what they said. God asked them to go to Job and ask him to pray for them.
Job could have refused because he was angry at them.
But he prayed for them and everything turned for his good.</p>
<p>V10- things turned around for him because he prayed for his friends.<br>
<!-- -->God restored to him, everything and twice as much.</p>
<p>There is a benefit in praying for others; When you take your attention away from yourself.</p>
<p>God will make happen to you and for you what you make happen for others.</p>

<p>You can train yourself to become an effective intercessor, and to do that, you’re going to train yourself to spend time in prayer.</p>
<p>As a student in high school, I couldn’t run very fast. Since sprinting was out of the question for me, I began to think of something else I could participate in during our annual sports day. Then I figured that since there were people who could run very fast but not for long, there’d also be those who might not be able to run very fast but could run for a long period.</p>
<p>I concluded that I fell in that second category and started training for long-distance running with a friend. We chose to try the 800m race, and very early every morning, we did several laps around the school field.</p>
<p>Though I eventually didn’t run in any competitive race, I practised. It was tough going at first, and I felt like quitting after the first lap, but I discovered it got easier each morning we trained. After some weeks of consistent practice, not only was I able to complete the laps, I was also able to maintain my speed and even go faster.
I learnt a powerful principle from this: anything you practise consistently long enough will get into your system and become a part of you.</p>
<p>I also discovered I could break myself spiritually and discipline myself to pray using this principle. I would set the alarm on my clock to wake me up at a certain time during the night, and then I’d spend some time praying for different people and events. The more I did this, the easier it became, until I didn’t need an alarm clock to wake me up anymore. It just became natural for me to get up at that time to pray. At the beginning it was hard, but I knew I didn’t need anybody to do it for me; it was my responsibility to train myself to pray. This is what you must do also.</p>
<p>Remember, the rule in intercession is that you’re persistent and continue in prayer for as long as is necessary. You don’t stop praying until you have a note of victory in your spirit. When you do, you’ll find yourself singing or laughing in the spirit. This laughter comes from your spirit. As David said, your heart begins to “indite” a good matter (Psalm 45:1). You bubble over with joy and laughter from your spirit. That’s when you know your ministry of intercession has been fulfilled for that matter.</p>

<p>Documentary on the Hoax of Malaria Vaccines.</p>
<p>When you understand the African policy of the United States as clearly stated by Henry Kissinger,the former secretary of State, you&#x27;d see that it was a policy of population reduction.
It is America&#x27;s policy for Africa...which means, whatever food they endorse, send or sponsor to Africa, Whatever drink and whatever project..it is in their national interest of drastically cutting down population in Africa to &quot;near zero&quot;.</p>
<p>(Video play out of a member of British Parliament about the WHO and their plans to strategically take over the nations of the world- The Pandemic Treaty/Accord)</p>
<p>The WHO wants to have the absolute power to decide what is misinformation. They want to assume the power of the Truth police. On suspicion of what they think is a health Crisis, Mr. Tedros can shut down your country.
The WHO cannot and should not be given such authority. The nations will lose their sovereignty.
For the financing of the WHO, all the nations contribute only 40%. the  rest of it comes from clandestine organizations.</p>

<p>MESSAGE:</p>
<p>Ezekiel 37:1-
&quot;valley&quot; is described as a plain.
In the spirit, the Prophet Ezekiel was made to move around this wide Valley full of dry bones.
These dry bones became corpses when he prophesied to the bones. .
V5-6 : Look at the content of the prophecy.
V8: There was still no breath in them
V9: He was told to prophesy the second part of it.
The same word for breath is the same for wind or spirit.
V10
V11: The bones were symbolic for the whole house of Israel.
V12-14 : He is going to bring them back from Captivity into the Land of Israel; What was seemingly a hopeless situation.</p>
<p>V15-22
He is using symbolisms here for the nations of Israel and Judah.</p>
<p>1Kings 13:1-5
This Prophet is prophesying to the Altar.
Prophecy is not only to people.
About 300 years later was when this prophecy was fulfilled.
They would have thought he was a false prophet. Different Kings came, died and left...</p>
<p>2 Kings 23:15-18
King Josiah had been born at this time. He became King at the age of 8.
He fulfilled the prophecy exactly the way it was said...three centuries later.</p>
<p>These are very significant stories because first you see he tells us about Ezekiel being in the spirit and being shown things.
The first is to see if in the spirit.
He is given words to speak .
And he speaks them in the spirit.
In the Natural, he is told what he saw in the spirit and what that signified.
It is important to interprete correctly.
He then prophesied to them, having done that in the spirit.</p>
<p>The other one spoke to an inanimate altar as he was instructed, having seen so in the spirit.</p>
<p>What we see here is the power of God&#x27;s word in the mouth of his prophets.</p>
<p>When we were watching the documentary a moment ago I was thinking what goes through the minds of many people.
Sometimes they think of the insecurity of food and government policies..
We are not I. This world as Victims.
God has put us here to keep the peace. We are to keep the world the way God wants it.</p>
<p>There are others who have a bad Job of working with Satan to destroy the world. Our job is to give healing and blessings to the nations.</p>
<p>I shared with you last time... &quot;If they shall drink/assimilate/imbibe any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them&quot;. It is a sign of who you are. You are born again with the life and nature of God in you.
There are a lot of Christians who don&#x27;t know this and because they don&#x27;t know this, they live as humans and suffer human experiences.
This is why spiritual growth and upbringing is necessary.
They have to grow and be trained in the life and nature of God.
Like learning to crawl, walk...
You can&#x27;t stay in a phase for too long.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God (Luke 16:15)</p>
<p>A man isn’t a success because other people say he is. A long list of academic, political, or business achievements isn’t essentially the definition of success. That a person is famous and celebrated by men doesn’t mean he or she is a success before God. A successful life, one that pleases God, is that which achieves those things that God has called the person to do.</p>
<p>Thus, the first thing is to know what God has called you to do. There’re people that are praised in this world and acclaimed to be successful, who will eventually end up in hell. Some are already there. It doesn’t matter what anyone says about you, the only one who matters is the one who made you. He’s the one who knew the purpose for which you were born. So, don’t live your life to the applause of men. Jesus said, “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

Don’t seek to please men; do all things with only one goal in mind: to please the Lord Jesus and be a success for Him.</p>
<p>God wants us to be successful according to His definition of success, not according to man’s standards. He wants us to have a great life; He wants us to do excellently well; He wants us to be productive in our lives; producing results that glorify Him.

They’re in bondage to their past, probably because of some terrible things they had done or the hurt they suffered, and they’ve been living with the pain ever since. Prisoner of the past .</p>
<p>You need to understand what it means to be born again, to be a new creation: you’re a brand new person. You’re not the same person who had those horrible experiences. That person died in Christ. The new “you” is absolved of all guilt; free of errors and imperfections.</p>
<p>Romans 5:18 says, “Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.” Jesus wasn’t only delivered on account of our sins, He was also raised for our justification (Romans 4:25). What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means you were declared “not guilty”; no charge against you. The reason is simple: you’re a new creation; a brand new person without a past. So, even if you did something wrong in the past that still makes you feel guilty, it’s all based on memory and emotions. In Christianity, we don’t walk by our feelings; we walk by faith. We live on the affirmation of God’s Word.</p>
<p>Don’t recollect a bitter experience you might have had many years ago and start crying that God should forgive you. Refuse to be held captive by guilt or memories of the past.</p>
<p>Romans 4:25 AMPC says Jesus was raised from the dead for “(our acquittal), [making our account balance and absolving us from all guilt before God].” When you come to Jesus, He makes you free from every kind of bondage: “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed” (John 8:36). Hallelujah!</p>

<p>REV CHRIS OYAKHILOME DSC DSC DD~18989</p>
<p>This is the month of June and every year for us it is the month of Prayer. </p>
<p>I want to read some verses of the bible to you</p>
<p>John 14:12&amp;13
Jesus is talking here. 
Its remarkable what he said here. </p>
<p>Isaiah 53:1-6,10-11
The prophet is talking about Jesus Christ here. 
He prophesied many years  before Jesus Christ.  (About 700 years before fulfilment.)
He spoke concerning the son of God who would come and take sinful mans place and be crucified.</p>
<p>V10-11
After his sacrifice for man,
He shall see his seed... He shall prolong his days
The church, the nodybof Christ,  is prophetically refered to here as &quot;His seed&quot; and that&#x27;s wonderful.</p>
<p>No wonder, in listing the different generations, He lists Christ as two generations. One is the man Jesus himself and  the second is his seed; the church (the 13th and 14th generation from the carrying away into babylon)</p>
<p>The church carries on the works of Christ.</p>
<p>V8: &quot;Who shall declare his generation?&quot;
He was cut off. 
That&#x27;s the reason he prolongs his days in verse 10 through the church.</p>
<p>They thought they were done with him but it&#x27;s not over. He multiplies himself throigh the church everywhere.</p>
<p>John 14v12-
We continue the works of Jesus.</p>
<p>Acts 1: 1-
What He began both to do and  teach, we have continued both to do and teach.
Prayer becomes our way of carrying on the works of the master. Prayer for the church is not how to try to get what we want. It is how we carry out Gods will.
Whatever it is you can ever desire in this world, its provided for in Christ.
What the Christian  ever needs is how to use the word to appropriate for himself whatever he requires. Nothing to cry or beg for. </p>
<p>1 Corinthians 3:21-22
All things are yours. Think about it. That covers everything. 
The whole world is yours.  Things present... Things to come... All are yours. 
Whether in this life or the one to come. 
Your life can be full of praise everyday. </p>
<p>Don&#x27;t look at life from your experience. Get your experience to conform to God&#x27;s word.  Learn God&#x27;s word. Put the word of God to work. 
Your job is to make the word manifest in your life. </p>
<p>2 Corinthians 4:6
Christ has shined in your heart.  Christ is in you now. What&#x27;s  he doing there?
he is in you to make manifest the glory of God. . Everyday your life should be the manifestation of the glory of God. 
Your life is for the out working of the glory of God. You have this extraordinary power and glory in your life. </p>
<p>There are too many who live life according to how they feel,  what information they received or how others perceive them. 
But no! You are to live your life according to the knowledge given to you by God.
How does God see it? What&#x27;s his opinion?
He lets you see life from his perpective.
What does God think or Know about that situation?
You&#x27;ve got this amazing treasure in your life. </p>
<p>V7: Did you know you have treasure in you? You have it right here. In this physical body. 
His extraordinary glory and power is deposited in this body,  so that when it is manifested,  anybody can tell that this glory is not human. It is beyond what the human body can produce.</p>
<p>My life is for the glory of God!!!</p>
<p>(Read above verse in AMPC)</p>
<p>Everyday of your life, you can have the glory of God manifested. You are living a life that is not human</p>
<p>I live a supernatural life. </p>
<p>John 14:12-13
These are the Love works of the master.
He is still working. He is making things happen through us. .
I&#x27;m not alone. Christ is at work in me.
V14: no special clause. If you ask ANYTHING in my name,  I will do it. </p>
<p>Most people have never tried that. They don&#x27;t believe Jesus meant it. 
I believe he said what he meant and he meant what he said. </p>
<p>John 16:23-
Referring to the day of the church. 
This is not a contradiction of what we just read. 
You cannot ask Jesus something in the name of Jesus. That&#x27;s foolish prayer. Its praying without thinking about what you are saying. Such people don&#x27;t get results.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/docs/t-nuggets/pastor-chris.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_JAkA"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/miscellaneous"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">miscellaneous</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/your-loveworld"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">your loveworld</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#make-war-with-words---pastor-chris-oyakhilome590">MAKE WAR WITH WORDS - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~590</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#your-mind-is-your-capital---pastor-chris-oyakhilome591">YOUR MIND IS YOUR CAPITAL - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~591</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#he-never-leaves-you--pastor-chris-oyakhilome595">HE NEVER LEAVES YOU – PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~595</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#understanding-true-worship---pastor-chris-oyakhilome596">UNDERSTANDING TRUE WORSHIP - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~596</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#he-gives-more-grace-not-more-power---pastor-chris-oyakhilome599">HE GIVES MORE GRACE, NOT MORE POWER - PASTOR CHRIS OYAKHILOME~599</a></li><li><a class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight" href="/rhapha-base/t-nuggets/pastor-chris#a-word-for-you-by-rev-dr-chris-oyakhilome602">A WORD FOR YOU BY REV.
