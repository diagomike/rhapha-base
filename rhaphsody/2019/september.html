<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand (Isaiah 53:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ponder again on what we just read: it pleased the Lord to bruise Him and make His soul an offering for sin; He’d bring forth seed that would prolong His days, His influence, and establish His rule forever. It answers the question the prophet asked in Isaiah 53:8: <em>“…who shall declare his generation?”</em></p>
<p>We’re His seed, declaring His generation. The pleasure of the Lord is prospering in our hands. We—the Church—are the ones declaring who He really is and His plan of salvation for all mankind. We bear witness to His deity, and continue all the beautiful things that He began, both to do and teach (Acts 1:1); His miraculous works and teachings about the Kingdom of God, which He continued through the Apostles. They, in turn, delivered the same teachings to others, and finally, it got to us. And we’re carrying it on until He returns.</p>
<p>He said in John 20:21, <em>“…as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.”</em> We’re His ambassadors. We’re His witnesses. We’re the effulgence of His glory, the dispensers of His love, righteousness, and grace. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted (Matthew 23:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A very striking quality of truly great people is their humility. It makes no difference where they are, they respect leadership; they honour structures, principles, and maintain order. It brings to mind something that Jesus did when He was to feed a crowd of five thousand men (women and children not counted). He said to His disciples, <em>“…Make them sit down by fifties in a company. And they did so, and made them all sit down”</em> (Luke 9:14-15).</p>
<p>The instruction was simple: sit down in manageable groups, and the men did. Not to heed such a simple instruction would be to be out of order, which oftentimes is the result of pride. Don’t try to “rise,” when the instruction is for you to “sit.” Relax and calm down. Get in order.</p>
<p>1 Peter 5:5-6 says, <em>“…be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.”</em> Those who are proud, despite their desire for expansion, progress or advancement, don’t experience much, because God resists the proud. He gives grace to the humble.</p>
<p>When you come for a Church meeting, for example, and you’re given an instruction as to where to park your vehicle or directed in the auditorium as to where to sit, don’t complain. Comply. Don’t shrug with contempt at the venue or facility managers; don’t disrespect the ushers.</p>
<p>Our opening verse in the Amplified Classic says, <em>“…whoever humbles himself [whoever has a modest opinion of himself and behaves accordingly] shall be raised to honor.”</em> Humility is the speed for life, the catalyst for ever-increasing greatness and unlimited progress. It’s the way to experience quantum leap, and be elevated to honour in your life.</p>

<p><em><strong>Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts (Zechariah 4:6).</strong></em></p>
<p>True success in life is primarily dependent on your relationship with the Holy Spirit. He’s the most important factor for your success. The Bible says, <em>“…it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy”</em> (Romans 9:16). In John 15:5, Jesus said, <em>“I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.”</em></p>
<p>The man who’s in fellowship with the Spirit, who’s yielded to Him for guidance and inspiration, is described for us in Psalm 1:3: <em>“And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.”</em> How inspiring!</p>
<p>Become more conscious of the Holy Spirit’s indwelling presence and glory in your life. Make your times of fellowship with Him the most important moments of your life.</p>
<p>One moment of fellowship with the Holy Spirit can give a lifetime advantage and boost in your journey of success that nothing else can create for you. He’s your guarantee of a life of rest and peace. He’s the one who glorifies your life and brings you into favours, promotions and blessings untold. He’s all you need, for with Him, you can do all things and be all that God created you to be. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months (James 5:16-17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people pray absent-mindedly, without their emotions, and it’s one of the reasons their prayers are ineffective. Notice our opening scripture; it talks about Elijah praying in a heartfelt, emotive manner; he was passionate.</p>
<p>Not many realize that it’s okay to get emotional with the Lord, because He’s got emotions too. The Bible says, <em>“He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh…”</em> (Psalm 2:4). Laughter is an emotion. Joy is an emotion, and God expresses His joy (Zephaniah 3:17). Therefore, in prayer, it’s okay to focus your mind on Him and express your love lavishly and passionately.</p>
<p>When you get your emotions involved in prayer, your spirit is conditioned in a way that’s receptive to the Holy Spirit. At that moment, your mind is channelled to your purpose of prayer and attentive. Recall that the Bible says, <em>“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,</em> <em>whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee” (Isaiah 26:3). Learn to stay your mind and emotions on the Lord in prayer!</em></p>
<p>If, while you’re praying, your mind strays to other thoughts, consciously get it back to focus on the Lord and the subject matter. On the other hand, if you’re praying in tongues or praying without a particular subject, you can still keep your mind and emotions on the Lord and let your spirit or the Holy Spirit bring forth words or thoughts to your consciousness at that time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you (Matthew 5:44).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Christians have what they call, “Enemy vanquishing services,” where they pray against their perceived enemies. But that’s not scriptural. The Word says, <em>“...Love your enemies….”</em></p>
<p>Whatever God tells you to do is for your benefit. If He tells you to love your enemies, it means you can, and it’s also for your advantage. So, you’ve got to do the Word. Moreover, the Word shows that the adversary we contend with isn’t flesh and blood: <em>“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood…”</em> (Ephesians 6:12).</p>
<p>Christians who pray against their enemies do so mainly out of fear and insecurity, and that’s because they’re ignorant. If Jesus Christ is your Lord, the Master and Shepherd of your life, then you have nothing to fear. David understood this and exclaimed in Psalm 27:1, <em>“The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?”</em> Have this same consciousness.</p>
<p>Consider Solomon; the Lord said to him, <em>“...Ask what I shall give thee”</em> (2 Chronicles 1:7). Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge. Then, God said to him, <em>“...Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies…Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like”</em> (2 Chronicles 1:11-12). This is instructive! The Lord commended him for not asking for the destruction of his enemies.</p>
<p>The desire of the Spirit is to see the salvation of your enemies. They’re already in trouble with God if they don’t repent. However, your role is to intercede for them and bring them words by which, or through which they can be saved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God (Matthew 5:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Christian, you’re a sanctified vessel, called to live righteously unto God. Iniquity or evil shouldn’t be found in your heart. You must keep yourself and your heart pure with the Word of God.</p>
<p>If, having been born again, your heart is still full of lust for evil things, something is wrong; there has to be a change! Make up your mind about it. You’ll need to have sessions of meditation and fasting without further delay.</p>
<p>The Word purifies the mind and spirit. God desires to take you to the next and higher level in your walk with Him, but you’ve got to let go of any ungodly lifestyle. The Bible says, <em>“Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us”</em> (Hebrews 12:1).</p>
<p>What’s that weight that’s not letting you run as effectively as you should in fulfilling God’s plan for your life? Get rid of it. Jesus said, <em>“…for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me”</em> (John 14:30). Be sure that Satan has nothing in you.</p>
<p>Pay attention to changes the Holy Spirit may be guiding you to make, and receive corrections. It’s all so you can fulfil His destiny for you gloriously without reproach. Refuse to allow any weight or sin cling itself to you, so you can make faster progress in your life.</p>
<p>Remember what the Word says: <em>“...sin shall not have dominion over you...”</em> (Romans 6:14). The moment you say “No,” that’s it! Psalm 119:9 says, <em>“Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.”</em> All it takes is acting on the Word. So, make it your life’s work to live in the light of God’s Word.</p>

<p><em><strong>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years ago, sitting in church as a kid, I watched a drama piece being performed by the drama group. I was particularly enthralled by the last act. As the actors walked off the stage, the young boy who acted the preacher’s role picked up the song: <em>“Christ   is coming, the King of glory; no more sorrow; no more weeping; tell the story among the nations; Christ is coming by and by.”</em></p>
<p>The song hit me, and tears began to stream down my face. I left that service singing that song in my heart repeatedly. I felt like the song was talking to me. Though I was quite young, it created a burden in my heart. Every so often, I’d pray, “Lord, I’ll tell the story among the nations.” Now, what’s the story?</p>
<p>The story isn’t that Christ is coming but that He came once before. The Bible talks about His second coming, but He already came and went back to heaven, and many aren’t aware yet.</p>
<p>As I read the Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—I found they were all telling the story. It’s the story of Jesus; His origin, His birth, His life on earth, His death, His resurrection, and ascension. The Book of Matthew has a theme: it’s mainly about Jesus, King of Israel.</p>
<p>Mark takes it a bit further, showing us this Jesus is the Christ. Luke tells us He was God’s answer; and John sees Him as the Word and tells from the beginning, the story of the One who made all things, and pre-existed the beginning. It’s the story of the Word who became flesh and dwelt among us.</p>
<p>John and the rest of the Apostles have gone to heaven, having told the story of the Son of God. Now, we must tell it, and keep telling the same story. We must remain dauntless in proclaiming His undying love for humanity, as we usher men into the glory of His divine presence and love. Amen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth (John 17:19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are Christians who don’t have the reverential fear of God; they think they’re at liberty to live the way they choose. But that’s dangerous. There’s a way of life that’s not right for a Christian, and if you’re going to fulfil the purpose of God for your life, then you’ve got to have purity of heart; you must live according to your nature of righteousness and true holiness in Christ.</p>
<p>In Joshua 3:5, we read something striking that Joshua said to the children of Israel. He said, <em>“… Sanctify yourselves: for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you.”</em> Joshua understood the power of sanctification; the power of separating yourself from the wrong things; the power of purifying your mind and your life.</p>
<p>You’re God’s vessel, sanctified to be in fellowship with Him through the Holy Spirit. Don’t jeopardize that communion because of a bad attitude or worldly lifestyle. 2 Corinthians 13:5 says, <em>“Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves….”</em> Use the Word to purge and examine yourself always. 2 Timothy 2:21 says, <em>“If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.”</em></p>
<p>You were separated from the World through the Gospel, but you’ve got to take the world out of you, through the sanctification of your mind and soul. This happens as you yield to the authority and lordship of the Word, and guidance of the Holy Spirit in your life. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth (John 1:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s possible to know God with a limited revelation, and a lot of people are that way. They have a very myopic view of who God is. But you see, you can’t live beyond the revelation of God that you have. In the Old Testament, God revealed Himself in several names. He said to Moses, <em>“I am the LORD; I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of El-Shaddai, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them”</em> (Exodus 6:2-3).</p>
<p>However, in the New Testament, He revealed Himself in the Name, Jesus! The Bible says the totality of divinity resides in Jesus Christ (Colossians 2:9). So, the Name of God in the New Testament is Jesus. In Matthew 28:19, Jesus commanded His disciples to baptize the people in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. In carrying out that divine instruction, they baptized people in the Name of Jesus.</p>
<p>Read the Book of Acts; the Apostles understood that the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, is Jesus; that’s the Name for the Godhead. The Father responds in that Name; the Holy Spirit answers to the name as well.</p>
<p>The Psalmist declared, <em>“…for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name”</em> (Psalm 138:2). We read in our opening verse that the Word became flesh and dwelt amongst us. That’s Jesus! Philippians 2:9 says, <em>“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name.”</em></p>
<p>If the Name of Jesus is higher than every other name, then it’s obvious that’s the Name of God Himself. He couldn’t have a name that’s lesser than the Name of Jesus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned (Matthew 12:37).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Words possess creative energy. Words are things; they have substance and never die. Jesus showed us how to use words. In every miracle He did, in every blessing He imparted, He used words. He spoke, and whatever He said came into existence.</p>
<p>He taught that the most powerful force in life is the force of words and cautioned us not to speak empty, inoperative words (Matthew 12:36). He said in John 6:63*, “…the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.”* The same goes for your words; they’re eternal.</p>
<p>Read Romans 10:9 and see the power of words with respect to salvation: <em>“...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”</em> A man will only go to hell or to heaven on the basis of his words. If he spoke the words that God said we should speak for salvation, he’d be saved. But if he didn’t, he’d be damned. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>There’re blessings untold for the one who’s born again, but to enjoy them, you must acknowledge and speak them forth. 1 Peter 3:10 says anyone who wants to enjoy life and see good days must speak wholesomely. Where you are today in life is a reflection of what you’ve been saying all your life.</p>
<p>Therefore, build your life with the right words. Speak words that are consistent with the glorious life of righteousness, peace, health, wealth and joy that you have in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><em><strong>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being born again, even though you still have the same physical body, your spirit has been recreated in the likeness of Christ. This is what Jesus made possible for us: He gave us His life and nature of righteousness, having taken our place of sin and condemnation on the Cross. Now we have and live a life of purpose in the earth.</p>
<p>The moment you were born again, you were born into a life of purpose with God. You’re God’s outstretched hand of blessing to your world. It makes no difference what you were, prior to giving your heart to the Lord. It makes no difference that others may have thought you wouldn’t amount to anything in life. Today, you’re a prince of power with God. Understand, acknowledge, and appreciate your new destiny in Christ.</p>
<p>We read in our opening verse that <em>“…old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</em> You’ve been catapulted to a life of victory, success, prosperity, hope, and assurance. But that’s not all. Through you, God wants to bring many others into the same blessed union and fellowship of the Spirit, so their lives can also have meaning and purpose with divinity.</p>

<p><em><strong>But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal (Matthew 6:20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Christians, we’re workers together with God (1Corinthians 3:9). In other words, we have the same purpose; we’re on the same course. We have the same vision, and we put everything into achieving that vision, which is turning men from darkness to light, and from the domain of darkness into the Kingdom of His love-Son.</p>
<p>There’s no other reason for you being on earth than to demonstrate His glory in bringing others to Him, and also train for the Spirit-life. This is why you must use your earthly resources, the things that He has blessed you with, for the furtherance of the Gospel. Your relevance in the spread of the Gospel is one of the major reasons He channels prosperity your way. Your involvement in soul winning attracts more grace and prosperity to your life.</p>
<p>Therefore, it’s important that, always, the spread of the Gospel around the world is top priority to you. Matthew 24:14 (TLB) says, <em>“And the Good News about the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, so that all nations will hear it, and then, finally, the end will come.”</em> These compelling words reiterate the urgency of the moment—the need to preach the Gospel throughout the world, to every man, woman, boy and girl.</p>
<p>It’s our heavenly Father’s desire that everyone hear the Gospel of the Lord Jesus and have the opportunity to believe in His Name. But it’s our responsibility to make it happen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Whoever will humble himself therefore and become like this little child [trusting, lowly, loving, forgiving] is greatest in the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 18:4 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more knowledgeable you are in the things of the Spirit, the more humble you become. If your knowledge in Christ, and of God, doesn’t produce a greater level of humility in you, then something is wrong; your knowledge is of the flesh and such knowledge puffs up (1 Corinthians 8:1).</p>
<p>True knowledge of God is the knowledge of the Spirit, and in unity with His Spirit. The more you know Him, the more you reveal and reflect Him in your thoughts, character, words and actions. In Matthew 11:29, He said, “<em>…I am meek and lowly in heart….”</em></p>
<p>The One who said this is the same One described as the embodiment of all knowledge and wisdom. Philippians 2:5-8 further lets us in on His humility. It says, <em>“Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself   of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.”</em></p>
<p>Don’t be high-minded. That’s what Jesus meant when He used the word, “lowly” in our theme verse. It means to “condescend without being condescending”; it’s one of the key things about humble people.</p>
<p>Humility is a life; it’ll work in you, whether you’re with the high and mighty or with the lowly. It’s often expressed in action by the willingness to take on the responsibility of service to others, in loyalty to the Word.</p>
<p>Something else about humble people is that they take responsibility, even for other people’s errors, and don’t keep a record of the wrongs done to them. They free those who hurt them, because true humility is submitting to the Lordship of Jesus Christ through the Word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth (Proverbs 6:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your personal life as a Christian, you must demonstrate the Word everywhere, and at all times. Don’t let casual talk rob you of the effectiveness of the Word in you, and through you. Never become so casual with the Word and in your talk that you lose respect for the truth of God’s Word and who He’s made you. Maintain the consciousness of the honour the Lord has placed on your life, such that even when you joke, it’s never against the Word, your identity or heritage in Christ.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers”</em> (Ephesians 4:29). Your jokes shouldn’t be coarse; don’t go overboard. It’s okay to be funny, but don’t get so funny that you forget who you are. Express dignity, honour, even when you joke.</p>
<p>When you talk about God, be reverent, because His angels are always present. Many have got themselves into trouble because of their casual or idle communication, forgetting that they’re snared or taken captive by their words.</p>
<p>Never say anything that’s against your body or your life, all in the name of making a joke. You may not mean it, but if you say it, you’ll have it. That’s what Jesus said in Mark 11:23. He didn’t say, “You’ll have what you say, only if you weren’t joking”; rather, He said, “You shall have what you say.” It’s a law of the Spirit; use it to your advantage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace (Romans 8:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Bible talks about the carnal mind, it doesn’t mean a sinful mind per se, even though the carnal mind is prone to sin. A carnal mind means a mind that’s ordinary; of mere human understanding; just normal human life.</p>
<p>The person who’s carnally-minded, even though he’s born again, reasons and acts like the natural man. He lives according to the senses. He’s more attuned to, and concerned about the things of the flesh. The Word and the spiritual realities of the Kingdom hardly get his attention.</p>
<p>Now, the Bible tells us that to live that way is enmity against God (Romans 8:7); meaning that the carnal Christian walks at cross-purposes with God. He’s not ruled by or subject to the Word of God; a state that leads to death—separation from everything gracious and divine! Why in the world should anyone live at such a base level?</p>
<p>Be Spirit-ruled and Word-governed. Refuse to be stirred by and attracted to fleshly things. The Bible says, <em>“…they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh…”</em> (Romans 8:5). What are the things that stir you up? Remember, where a man’s treasure is, there will his heart be also.</p>
<p>You’re after the Spirit if your affection time and energies are focused on things pertaining to Christ, His Gospel, and the eternal life that He’s given us. So, let the Word of God control your values, ideas, opinions, choices and decisions.</p>

<p><em><strong>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God (James 1:19-20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many don’t realise how maintaining a joyful heart is key to fulfilling God’s purpose for their lives. Isaiah 12:3 says, <em>“Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.”</em> Your faith prevails in an atmosphere of joy, joy that comes from your inner man.</p>
<p>Some allow their desires or failed expectations rob them of their joy. But as a Christian, your joy is independent of circumstances. True joy is in fulfilling your purpose; doing the things the Father asked you to do.</p>
<p>The Word admonishes us in James 5:13: <em>“Is any among you afflicted (ill-treated, suffering evil), let him pray; Is any merry, let him sing Psalms.”</em> In Ephesians 4:26, the Word tells us that we shouldn’t allow our anger, fury or exasperation last for long.</p>
<p>God’s holy anger is only expressed towards those who do evil and works of unrighteousness; and it’s not your job to be angry on His behalf. For example, when Samuel was angry that the children of Israel asked for a king, God said, “Samuel, why are you angry? They didn’t reject you; they rejected me” (Read 1 Samuel 8:6-7). God didn’t permit Samuel to be angry.</p>
<p>Anger defaces your beauty in the spirit. Therefore, eschew anger. Manifest the joy of the Lord always, for the joy of the Lord is your strength; that’s where your glory is. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain (Philippians 1:21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some countries today, the authorities are trying to use the weapons of fear, persecution, and intimidation to suppress and prevent the preaching of the Gospel. But the Gospel can’t be stopped. Jesus said in Matthew 24:14, <em>“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”</em></p>
<p>Never be intimidated by any government, group, or individuals who set themselves against the Gospel. They’ll fail, as they’ve always failed. When Saul of Tarsus made havoc of the Church, Jesus knocked him out and said, <em>“…it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks”</em> (Acts 9:5).</p>
<p>There’s no legislation, gang-ups, trumped-up charges and pronouncements against the Church that can stand. Christians need to be more conscious of this, and stand for the Gospel everywhere, preaching it boldly with absolute convictions, even unto death. Consider the Apostle Paul’s persuasion about Christ and the Gospel in our opening verse; so inspiring! You can’t be threatened with death when you’re already dead! We’ve been crucified with Christ; nevertheless, we live. Therefore, have no fear of death, because to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</p>
<p>As far as the Gospel is concerned, some of us have come to understand that whether it’s death or life, we win. Thus, we’re unapologetic about the Gospel; we’re ready and able to face anything! We’ve put it all on the line; we’ve counted the cost and come to one conclusion: the Gospel must be preached; no threats can stop us!</p>
<p>Square your shoulders, chin up, chest out, because you’re Christ’s ambassador; the bearer of the news of His saving power. This is your purpose; it’s the reason you’re alive. You’re totally consecrated to God; you’re His property; therefore, nothing and no one can hurt or hinder you from fulfilling your destiny in the Gospel.</p>
<p>Let the passion to spread the Gospel around the world burn in your heart like never before. Remain resolute and declare like the Apostle Paul: <em>“…necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!”</em> (1 Corinthians 9:16).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a clear distinction between your status and your state. Your life isn’t about what you’re going through. The revelation of God’s Word that you have unveils your status, but that may not change your state or situation, until you put the Word to work.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to understand is what God says about your status, because if you understand your status, then you can change your state. This means you superimpose the tenets and principles of the Kingdom on your situation for a change.</p>
<p>In our Kingdom, for example, it’s written that greater is He that’s in you than he that’s in the world. If you’re conscious of this reality, and understand your status as the one in whom Christ literally dwells, you’ll be unperturbed, irrespective of the adversities you face, because you know you’ll always win! The greater One is in you.</p>
<p>The prognosis about your health situation may seem dire, but your status is that you have the very life and nature of God, and divine health is at work in you NOW! This must be clear to you. And once you act on that truth, the health situation will change.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s a situation of lack; there’s no money in your account; that doesn’t mean you’re broke or poor. Take your eyes off the situation; focus on your status. The Word says you’re the seed of Abraham; you own the world. You’re an heir of God, and a joint-heir with Christ. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Always remember that the challenges you face, irrespective of how they come, are subject to change. Your role is to act on the Word; keep affirming who you are in Christ. As you keep your focus on the Word, you’re metamorphosed, and every unfavourable situation will align with your status as an associate of the God-kind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you… (Acts 1:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a difference between the Person of the Holy Spirit and the impartations of the Holy Spirit. In the Scriptures, we read how handkerchiefs and aprons taken from the body of Paul healed the sick (Read Acts 19:12). The Holy Spirit wasn’t on the handkerchiefs and aprons, but His power was on them.</p>
<p>As a Christian, you’re a greater and better recipient of the Spirit’s power. He lives in you, and is real in you as a person, but He has also imparted your whole being with His power. This is where many have missed it: they seem to be more conscious of the power than the Person of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>You can have the power of the Holy Spirit, and not be in fellowship with the Person of the Holy Spirit, and that’s dangerous. It happened to some in Bible days, and still happens today.</p>
<p>For example, Samson was endued with the power of God; the power was in his hair, but he wasn’t living right. He disregarded the Word of God, and fell in love with a Philistine. He knew his decisions were wrong, but he was confident that if trouble came, all he had to do was activate the power of God in Him. He knew how to “shake himself” (Judges 16:20) for the power to work. He knew how to make contact with the “power,” but wasn’t in fellowship with the “Person.” Of course, he would pay dearly for his error eventually.</p>
<p>That’s just like some people today. Someone could be healing the sick, casting out devils, but his ways aren’t right with God; he’s not in fellowship with the Holy Spirit. All he has are the impartations of the Spirit. That’s not what God wants.</p>
<p>Your fellowship with the Holy Spirit is the most important thing in your life. Apportion regular times in the day to spend with Him, and He’ll reveal mysteries to you concerning your life, future, family, job, finances and everything else related to you. He’ll fly you on eagle’s wings and navigate you through life victoriously. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations (Jeremiah 1:5).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being born again, there’s a definite place for you that nobody else occupies. You don’t have a duplicate. Nobody was ever like you; no one is like you today, and no one will ever be like you. There’s a definite purpose for your life, and when your purpose is clear, everything else lines up for you.</p>
<p>Have you discovered why God created you? You may say, “He created all of us to serve Him; to worship Him and be in fellowship with Him.” All of that is nice, but why did He create YOU? It’s about YOU.</p>
<p>I discovered my purpose very early in life. As a teenager, I wrote in my diary, “I was born as an answer to the cry of millions.” My purpose was clear; I knew what to live for, and I made up my mind to be God’s best for me, because I’m the only one of me that He has.</p>
<p>Sadly, many live and grow old without ever knowing the reason they came. Nothing could be more miserable than that! There’s no life more empty and frustrating than to live without a purpose.</p>
<p>You’re not an accident in this world. God didn’t bring you into this world to merely “complete the square.” Consider the fact that there’re over 7 billion people on the face of the earth, but no two fingerprints are alike.</p>
<p>You’re unique, and so is your destiny in Christ. Whatever God destined you to do, nobody can do it exactly like you. Nobody can say what He wants you to say the exact way you’d say it. Nobody can get your kind of results.</p>
<p>Therefore, get excited about your uniqueness. Fulfil your purpose. Be what God made you to be. He planned before the foundation of the world that you’d serve Him and live for Him. Through you, His righteousness would be established in the earth, and in the hearts of men. Glory to His Name forever!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand (Isaiah 53:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible records that if all the miraculous works Jesus did were to be written, the whole world wouldn’t contain the books. That’s absolutely true. His entire life was an unending stream of miracles, signs, and wonders. He brought hope, joy, and life to many. The Bible says He went about doing good, healing ALL that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with Him (Acts 10:38).</p>
<p>This Jesus, although in heaven, is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8). He’s still loving, gracious, merciful, compassionate, and works miracles today as He did in Bible days. He still lifts, blesses, and transforms lives today, but He’s doing it through us.</p>
<p>That’s what we read in our opening verse; we’re His seed, prolonging His days. We stand in His stead, bearing His glory and divine presence. He gave us the Holy Spirit, so we can minister His grace, wisdom, salvation, righteousness, love, healing, wholeness and beauty in a dark world, to a broken humanity.</p>
<p>When we come before the sick, the downtrodden, the poor, the rejected, the neglected, and the fainthearted, Jesus shows up in us and there’s a turnaround in their situation. He’s the solution that the world is looking for, and we minister Him, for we’re partakers of His divine nature and dispensers of His verities and love.</p>
<p>You bear His divine presence; you’re Heaven’s headquarters because you’re God’s house; His living, moving, active tabernacle. Therefore, impact your world with His divine presence. He’s as present in you and active through you today as He was in Bible days. Have this consciousness, the Christ-consciousness, and bless your world with His divine presence that you bear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship (Exodus 31:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It takes much more than skill and dexterity to do God’s work. You have to be filled with the Spirit! Recall what we read in our opening scripture. The Lord specifically appointed Bezaleel for an assignment, but He had to fill him with the Spirit first.</p>
<p>Church maintenance, the music or technical department, children’s ministry, the first-timers’ ministry, the ushering department, pastoral care units, cell ministry, etc., are all aspects of pastoral work. You can’t do them through the flesh, but by the Spirit. You must, and always, do what you do in the house of God and in the Kingdom by the power of the Spirit, otherwise, it’ll be of no divine significance or impact.</p>
<p>Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3:5-6, <em>“…our sufficiency is of God; Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”</em> It’s the Spirit that gives life; therefore, your work and service in the house of God must be sanctified by Him.</p>
<p>In Romans 15:15-16, Paul testified of the grace given to him to be a minister of God to the Gentiles. Then, he prayed <em>“…that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.”</em> There’s no ministry without the Holy Spirit. Nothing succeeds without Him.</p>
<p>If you function in any capacity as a leader or worker in the church, the Spirit must sanctify your work! Zechariah 4:6 says, <em>“...Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.”</em> There’s a constant infilling of the Spirit that you require, and must experience, as you walk with the Lord. Read Ephesians 5:18-21 to learn how to be filled with the Spirit, always.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world (John 6:33).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Luke 4:4, Jesus said, <em>“…man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.”</em> Also, in John 6:35, He said, <em>“…I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.”</em> A symbolism to this effect is seen in Luke 9, when Jesus multiplied five loaves of “bread” and gave to His disciples to feed the multitude with.</p>
<p>The bread is symbolic of the Word of God that He gives us, which we, in turn, should “give” or share to others. As we distribute the bread (the Word), as we share the Gospel with others, and bring more souls to the Kingdom, there’s multiplication. Acts 6:7 says, <em>“And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.”</em></p>
<p>As you win more souls, the Word of God increases, because the Word goes into every man’s world. If there were five hundred people that received the Word, they’d take the same Word to five hundred worlds, and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>Do you want the Word of the Lord to increase? If your answer is “yes,” then sow it into the hearts of men; “distribute the bread.” Recall that as the disciples distributed the bread to the multitude in Luke 9, the bread kept multiplying.</p>
<p>This was the Lord’s idea and expectation when He gave the great commission in Matthew 28:19-20. He told us to take the Gospel to every man’s world, and make students of those in our environments. Therefore, preach, teach, share the Word in such a way that others would receive, and become effective preachers and teachers of the same Word. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart (Ephesians 4:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, highlights the awful state of the non-Christian in our opening text. Let’s read from the Amplified translation for further clarity: <em>“Their moral understanding is darkened and their reasoning is beclouded. [They are] alienated (estranged, self-banished) from the life of God [with no share in it; this is] because of the ignorance…”</em> (AMPC).”</p>
<p>What a dreadful state for anyone to be in! If ignorance of God and His Word could put man in such a state of hopelessness, hemmed in the domain of darkness, imagine then what the accurate knowledge of God would do!</p>
<p>Knowledge in this context isn’t scientific or mental. Rather, it’s a special kind of knowledge: “epignosis” (Greek). It refers to accurate, full and precise knowledge of God; experiential knowledge of God, acquired through revelation and acquaintance.</p>
<p>After receiving salvation, yielding yourself to the ministry of the Word is crucial. Proverbs 11:9 declares, <em>“...but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.”</em> You already have an inheritance bequeathed to you in Christ, but through the knowledge of God, you’re able to take a hold of what’s rightfully yours in Christ.</p>
<p>Yield yourself to knowledge. Have a voracious appetite for the Word. Those who don’t know the Word easily get overwhelmed by circumstances, and defeated by the crises of life. But through the knowledge of God, grace and power over crisis (peace) are multiplied in your life (2 Peter 1:1-3). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12-13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Jesus walked the earth, He lived the Kingdom life. His life and ministry were miraculous and supernatural. He fed five thousand men with a little boy’s lunch (women and children not counted). He raised the dead, walked on water, etc. He did so many other supernatural things, which are recorded for us in the Bible.</p>
<p>But here’s the point: the miracles that Jesus performed weren’t miracles to Him. Rather, they were the expressions of His Kingdom life. The things He did, and the way He lived shows the way we ought to live and function today, for we’re in the Kingdom now. Being born again, we’ve been born into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son, where the supernatural is natural with us.</p>
<p>Therefore, like Jesus, your entire life, every day, should be an unending gusher of the miraculous and supernatural. Every move you make, every step you take, every word you speak, should be outflows of the supernatural! This is because the Word of God is clear: <em>“…as He (Jesus) is, so are we in this world”</em> (1 John 4:17).</p>
<p>We have the same life He has. His power is in you, working all the time, because He lives in you. But you have to learn how to let it flow out to the world. Divinity is at work in you. It’s the reason you must inundate your mind with God’s Word and thoughts from the Spirit of God! Consciously practise the God-life by living out God’s Word.</p>
<p>Many live as ordinary men due to their ignorance of the Word (Psalm 82:5). Study and meditate on God’s Word continually, to appropriate the blessings of the supernatural life in Christ and live in that realm—EVERY DAY!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scripture above isn’t a promise. Now that you’re born again, you’re a new creature already. The Word doesn’t say you’d become a new creature once your ways or behaviour have become perfect; no! The qualification is being in Christ.</p>
<p>Then, the latter part of the verse says, <em>“…behold, all things are become new.”</em> This means, see through the Word! See spiritually. It doesn’t matter what your life was like before you gave your heart to Christ; now that you’re born again, things have changed!</p>
<p>Notice the underlined word, “behold”; it means to see from God’s perspective. Don’t look at the physical anymore; see through the Spirit. Maybe you were born with a heart condition; old things are passed away! That blood condition is passed away. That cancer has passed out of your body! Those bad habits are gone. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Even the positive things in your life are replaced with better ones. Have this consciousness. See yourself and your life through the Word. All things in your life, now that you’re born again, are of God (2 Corinthians 5:18). That means they’re divine; they’re perfect. No strange “bodies” in you; nothing of the devil is in you.</p>
<p>Jesus said, <em>“…for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me”</em> (John 14:30). As He is, so are we. The enemy doesn’t have his sickness, disease, infirmities, failure, or weakness in you. You were created perfect in Christ Jesus. This is the Word of God concerning you; see yourself in this light.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life (1 John 5:13 ESV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being born again, you have the life and nature of God in you; therefore, you’re not an ordinary person. 2 Peter 1:4 says, <em>“Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature….”</em></p>
<p>Some Christians refer to themselves as “ordinary human beings,” feigning some kind of humility, but that’s sad. As long as you believe, confess, and act on that statement, you’re conforming to the human nature. Whereas, your human nature was supplanted by God’s divine nature the moment you were born again.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</em> You’re a new creature, with a new life—the divine life—not the human life. The life in you now is no longer by blood, but by the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Bible says the life of the flesh is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11). But Romans 8:8-9 says, <em>“So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God….”</em> <em>But read the concluding part; it says, “But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit….”</em></p>
<p>Being born of the Spirit, you’re sustained by the Spirit; He’s the life of your physical body. Romans 8:11 says, <em>“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”</em></p>
<p>Now you can further understand when the Bible says in John 1:12-13, <em>“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.”</em> Become more conscious of the God-life in you, and give expression to your divine nature in Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life (John 5:24).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The curse of death is on everything in the earth, and that’s the reason everything in the earth depreciates. But when you’re born again, you’re translated from the realm of death into the realm of life.</p>
<p>This is why you must vehemently refuse sickness, because sickness is incipient death; gradual, progressive death. If sickness tries to attack your body, don’t accept it! Act on the Word. In your path, there’s no death; there’s no darkness; therefore, refuse to accommodate anything that’s of darkness. The Bible says, <em>“…Resist the devil, and he will flee from you”</em> (James 4:7).</p>
<p>What we read in our theme scripture were the words of Jesus. Later on, after He had ascended, and the New Testament Church started, the Apostle Paul reechoed the same truth. In Romans 8:1, he said, <em>“There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.”</em></p>
<p>Why is there no “death” or condemnation for those who don’t walk after the senses, but live in accordance with the Word? The answer is in the second verse: the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made them free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:2). Glory to God!</p>
<p>The world is under the curse of the law of sin and death, but you don’t live under that law. You live by the law of the Spirit of life, and in that realm, only life controls. Meditate on this truth and let it inundate your soul and reveal itself in your body.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen (Revelation 1:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every Christian is a king-priest unto God. You may say, “I never answered the call to be a priest.”  But the day you made Jesus Christ Lord of your life, you were immediately catapulted to that office. And your primary responsibility as a king-priest is intercession.</p>
<p>In intercession, you take hold together with God; you side with Him in bringing His will to pass on behalf of someone else. That means you must know His will and purpose concerning a person, a country, a situation, or whatever you’re praying about, to be able to pray accurately.</p>
<p>Some Christians have cultivated the erroneous belief that the ministry of intercession is for certain Christians or for only those in the church’s prayer group, but that’s not true. We all have an obligation of intercession (Ephesians 6:18).</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 2:1-3, the Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, writes, <em>“I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men…For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.”</em> So, you have to fulfil your ministry of intercession as a king- priest, and in so doing, there’re certain facts to note.</p>
<p>First, the prayer of intercession is always on behalf of another. Secondly, you’ll have to be persistent, because you’re trying to prevail on someone else to align with God’s will. Therefore, you must continue in prayer for as long as it takes, concentrating the influence of God’s power towards the one for whom, or the situation for which, you desire a change. Also, watch out for the note of victory in your spirit; that’s when you become certain that you have what you asked for.</p>
<p>Take up the ministry of intercession and learn to cause changes in the Name of Jesus. God has given you the dominion and the authority to alter the course of events in the earth—the occurrences in your life, in your family, and in the lives of those around you. You can achieve this through your intercessory ministry as a king-priest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith (Romans 12:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the gift of prophecy and how it works is very important, so we can use it accurately. Prophecy is often in operation in an utterance of faith. An utterance of faith is declaration of words that’ll come to pass, or words that you desire to come to pass.</p>
<p>However, you can’t use that level of merely declaring words of faith to alter the course of a nation, a city, a family, or another person’s life. You’d have to know the will of God, and the direction of the Spirit, to utter words that are in consonance with the Spirit of God in order to effect the kind of change that’s consistent with His will.</p>
<p>What this means is that the gift of prophecy must operate through revelation, not just through your utterance of faith. For instance, you might have been in a prayer meeting where the prayer coordinator, being led of the Spirit said, “Prophesy to your country.” Then as a result, you began to speak prophetic words; things you desired to see happen in your country.</p>
<p>However, just because you went ahead and prophesied as instructed didn’t necessarily mean you spoke precisely the mind of God about your country at that particular moment. The words you uttered may be inconsistent with God’s revelation.</p>
<p>This shows that you can’t just stay with the forthtelling part of prophecy; you need the revelatory part as well. You must know the mind of God. When you do, you’ll know what words to speak, and not take sides against Him. It’s the reason we pray a lot in the Spirit. When we pray in the Spirit, our spirits are more open to allow the wisdom of God to bubble up within us, and guide us in the right choice of words.</p>
<p>Moreover, studying the Scriptures also plays a vital role. As you study and meditate on the Scriptures, your spirit is flooded with light; you’re enlightened as to the plans and purposes of God by which you’re able to pray and prophesy in accordance with His will. Hallelujah!</p>
