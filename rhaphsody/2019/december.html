<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering (Luke 9:29).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many times, people pray, “O God, let your glory rest upon me.” But in the New Testament, that’s a wrong prayer. Many pray that way because they admire what happened with Moses in the Old Testament; the glory of God that came upon Him and rested on his countenance. But we have something better than that today, because the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of glory, lives in us.</p>
<p>What we have in us is a more excellent glory; a surpassing glory: <em>“For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious”</em> (2 Corinthians 3:10-11). Read our theme verse again; it says, “And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.” It shows what happened to Jesus as He prayed at the Mount of transfiguration: He was transfigured; there was so much glory radiating from Him that His appearance was altered. But that glory and power was from within.</p>
<p>The same thing happens when we pray. There’re two things that we do that get us transfigured and have the glory literally resplendent on our countenance. The more you do them, the more of that transfiguration you’d experience. The first is praying in tongues. The Bible says, <em>“He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself…”</em> (1 Corinthians 14:4); you’re charged, edified and built up, like you build the power of a battery, which means your light glows. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Jude 1:20 says, <em>“But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost.</em>” This must be the type of prayer that Jesus prayed, that in the spirit, they could see a transfiguration. Secondly, every time you pray the Word, it happens to you too. Yes, you’re transfigured from glory to glory.</p>
<p>The more accurately the Word of God comes through your spirit in prayer, the more you glow in the spirit. This will help you understand why you should pray all the time. When you pray, you’re transfigured, and the more you stay in that glory, the more you carry its effect along with you. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your mind is very important. It’s the door to your spirit, and it’s also the door from your spirit out, to bring something into the natural world. The underlined portion of our opening verse tells us, <em>“…be ye transformed (metamorphosed) by the renewing of your mind....”</em> This means you exchange your thoughts for God’s thoughts; you cast away your carnal thinking, your fleshly ideas, and receive His glorious thoughts and ideas. The latter part of it says, <em>“…that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”</em></p>
<p>The word, “prove” is from the Greek—dokimazo— meaning to scrutinise or examine. Simply, it’s like the Customs official who’s assigned the responsibility of disallowing illegal exports and imports—interdiction of contrabands. Once he sees such, he disallows it from entering the country. That’s what that scripture is making us understand as the result of renewing the mind. You’re able to “prove,” that is, scrutinise the thoughts you allow to go through your mind, to be sure they’re consistent with God’s Word and His perfect will for your life.</p>
<p>Now that you’re born again, you’re required to think excellence and only see pictures of excellence. Focus your mind on things that are pure, just, honest, lovely, virtuous and of good report (Philippians 4:8). You can’t afford to continue with the old way of life; you’re different now.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:22-23 says, <em>“That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; And be renewed in the spirit of your mind.”</em> It’s expressing the same thought: think and live differently now that you’re a child of God. As you do this, you’d be giving vent to the glory in your recreated human spirit; the beauty of the Spirit in you will be revealed on the outside in an ever-increasing measure. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect (Matthew 5:48).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people, because they haven’t been accurately taught the Word, believe and hold on to wrong teachings and ideas for many years. That something sounds nice and religious doesn’t mean it’s consistent with God’s Word. For example, there’re those who say, “We’re never going to be perfect. As long as we’re in this physical body, we’re going to sin; we’re going to keep making mistakes.” But this isn’t what the Bible teaches.</p>
<p>Many of those who have such beliefs got it from their own experiences. They think everybody else is making mistakes somehow, because they’re making mistakes in their own lives. So, they don’t believe in perfection. But the problem is that they don’t know what perfection in Christ is. When you study the Word, there’s no place that suggests to us the impossibility of perfection.</p>
<p>We read in our theme verse: <em>“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”</em> The word, “perfect” is the Greek, “teleios,” meaning “full grown”; complete and nothing lacking. In this verse, God wants you to measure your heart with the heart of God. And the way to do this is through the Word.</p>
<p>When you think, love and forgive others as God wants you to; when you have the heart of the Father, that’s being perfect as He is perfect. If we couldn’t be perfect, God would never require it of us. Inspire those around you by the excellence of your life, and the perfection with which you do what you do, through the Spirit. The Bible says He’s called us to “glory and virtue” (2 Peter 1:3). That means He’s called you to excellence; therefore, living an excellent life is native to your spirit.</p>
<p>Believe in perfection, for that’s your life and nature in Christ Jesus. The Bible says He died to present you sin-free and perfect before the Father: <em>“And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight”</em> (Colossians 1:21-22 NKJV).</p>

<p><em><strong>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints (Ephesians 1:18 NKJV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we say revelation is progressive, it doesn’t mean that we’re adding any new thing or that God brings more revelation from time to time. It just means that our spiritual eyes are further enlightened to what’s already been revealed in the Scriptures. The reason it’s progressive is that we’re growing; we’re learning more, and increasing in our understanding.</p>
<p>As you study the Scriptures, there’ll be revelations as well as observations. However, much of what most talk about aren’t even revelations, but observations, because the Word of God is complete. Think about what Paul, Peter, and the other apostles said in the Scriptures, by the Holy Ghost; it doesn’t get better than that. You can’t create a “new revelation,” because it’s got to be based on what Jesus came to do. 1 Corinthians 3:11 says, <em>“For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”</em></p>
<p>There’s nothing you’d discover today that’s not already in the Scriptures. But you see, even when you study the Word, you may never know some things until the Spirit imparts that knowledge to you. And that is what’s important. The only thing that’ll change your life is that higher understanding that the Spirit gives; it’ll impact your life in every way. Your prayer will change; your thinking will change. You’ll become so much more effective in your work and ministry in the Gospel.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you’d realise that all that time you were “hoping” that one day, God would have mercy on you and help you, what you needed was the higher understanding that everything you could ever need in your life was already in you; already provided for. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not... (Luke 22:31-32).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my study of the Word, I’ve read this verse of scripture above many times. On one occasion, I said, “Lord Jesus, why did you have to pray for Simon? Aren’t you God? Why didn’t you just change him?” Why didn’t Jesus just prophesy to Simon and say, “Your faith will not fail”? Rather, He said, “I have prayed for you.” That’s because when you pray for someone, you can only do so in hope. So, Jesus prayed in hope for Peter. This is so instructive.</p>
<p>From time to time, the Lord opens our eyes to see some of our brothers and sisters in the Lord that we need to intercede for, to get them over to the place where we believe they ought to be. It’s not an exclusive responsibility of the Pastor. It’s something the Lord expects of you: that ingredient of mindful, deep prayer of intercession for others, not only for the lost but also for the one who’s already in the Lord but may be going astray.</p>
<p>If the Master would pray for Peter, how much more are we required to pray for our brothers and sisters that their faith fail not. Don’t watch them go down or criticise them for their mistakes. Stand in the gap for them.</p>
<p>Also, isn’t it interesting that Jesus didn’t say, “Simon, I have prayed for you that Satan touch you not”? He didn’t pray that Satan wouldn’t attack him. Rather, He prayed that Peter’s faith should prevail. What does this tell us? Satan isn’t a factor; the factor is our faith. It’s not about how bad the situation is; it’s not about how severe the sickness is; it’s not about how terrible the pain is; it’s about your faith being strong enough to prevail. That’s what matters.</p>
<p>So, when you see Christians who are being attacked by the devil in whatever way, whether by sin, sickness or lack, it’s part of your priestly ministry to pray for them that their faith doesn’t fail, irrespective of the situation they’re in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life... (1 John 5:13).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the verse above, the Apostle John says, “I want you to know that you have eternal life.” This simply lets us know that as Christians, we’re not mere humans. It’s so important that you believe, accept and understand this, because until and unless you know that you’re not a mere human being, you’re going to be subject to what human beings are subject to: the corrupting influences of this present world. The Bible says we’ve escaped the corruption that’s in the world, through lust, being associates of the God-kind (2 Peter 1:4). </p>
<p>Something indeed happened when you were born again; you were actually reborn. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</em> This isn’t a cliché! To be in Christ means you’re born into Christ; baptized into Christ (Galatians 3:27). This means you’re immersed into Him and have become one with Him.</p>
<p>Now that you’re in Christ, you have the life and nature of God. You’re a different kind of being. And according to the Bible, you don’t have two natures; your old nature was crucified with Christ (Romans 6:6). You have another life, the resurrection life, inside you now.</p>
<p>James 1:18 says, <em>“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.”</em> The underlined portion indicates that you’re another kind of man—the “Godkind” of man. Being born again, you were brought, not only into a knowledge of Christ but also into a union with Him that has made you an associate of the heavenly pantheon. No wonder Jesus said in John 10:34 (NKJV), <em>“...Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?”</em> Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit (1 Corinthians 6:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re those who aren’t sure what Christianity really is. So, they suffer from an identity crisis, because they don’t know who they are. It’s the same reason some get sick and afflicted, always seeking medical attention. Now, someone may wonder, “Are you saying Christians aren’t supposed to be sick?”</p>
<p>Yes, Christians aren’t supposed to be sick! The Christian has eternal life, and that life is superior to sickness, decay, and death. It’s the same life that Jesus had when He walked the earth. Jesus was never sick. That same supernatural life, which is absolutely infection and disease-proof, is what He’s given to us. Hallelujah! Now you can further understand why He said in Mark 16:17-18, <em>“These signs shall follow those who believe; if they drink anything deadly, they’ll not be hurt.”</em> Jesus said so, and He never lied to anybody.</p>
<p>The Christian belongs in God’s class; he’s not a mere religious person. Christianity isn’t a religion at all; it’s the active life of God in a human being. Christianity is Christ alive in you; it’s a real relationship with the real and living Christ. In Christianity, the divine life of Jesus Christ is imparted to you; it’s a real experience. Christ took up His abode in you the instant you were born again. </p>
<p>When you really get to know this, every day of your life, you’ll be so full of joy! The Apostle Peter talked about the joy that we have and exude as Christians: it’s indescribable and full of glory. Why wouldn’t it be, when you were born to express and manifest the glory and righteousness of Christ? Why wouldn’t it be, when you’re joined to the Lord; inseparably one with Him?</p>
<p>How then could sickness, lack, discouragement, depression, be normal with you? Those are things that the people of the world suffer; but you’re different! Philippians 2:12 says, <em>“…work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”</em> Make your Christianity real by “living” it. The Word won’t work until you work it. You’re the one to work things out, by His power working in you. Take a hold of the Word, and live by it, and your life will be excellent and full of glory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But that which ye have already hold fast till I come (Revelation 2:25).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the things you must make up your mind to do is to be very serious with your Christianity. Don’t profane spiritual things or play games with the Spirit. Some people become so carnal and casual with spiritual things and don’t realise when they’ve walked away from God and His plan for their lives.</p>
<p>It’s like what happened to Saul, the King of Israel. He had gone too far in the wrong direction that even when Samuel the prophet was interceding for him, God said, <em>“No need; I’ve found someone else to replace him”</em> (read 1 Samuel 16:1). God’s plan was for Saul to have an eternal dynasty in Israel, but he lost it, and David got it.</p>
<p>Esau’s story is another painful one. The Bible says, <em>“Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright”</em> (Hebrews 12:16). How sad! Afterwards, when he attempted to get the same blessing he had profaned, the Bible says in Hebrews 12:17, <em>“…he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.”</em> His tears didn’t make any difference; it was too late. This happens to many.</p>
<p>Imagine that a brother was made a cell leader or Bible study class teacher, but because someone “offended” him in the church, he was upset enough to walk away from his responsibility towards his cell members. He even decided he’d no longer be a member of the church. That’s so wrong.</p>
<p>Hebrews 12:15 says, <em>“Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled.</em>” Don’t allow bitterness or anger prevent you from fulfilling your destiny in Christ. Make up your mind to live in the Word, and by the Spirit of God. Follow spiritual instructions and be excited about your service in the house of God.</p>

<p>Galatians 3:27 NKJV says something powerful that parallels what we read in our opening verse. It says, <em>“For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.”</em> It means you’ve sunk into Him, like a garment. You might wonder, “I thought I’ve received Christ?” Yes, but this isn’t only from the inside now, but also on the outside.</p>
<p>You’ve received Christ Jesus, the Lord, and He lives in you by the Holy Ghost. Now that you’re born again, you’ve been brought into the new environment called Christ, and you have to walk in that environment. That’s what we read in our opening verse.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re in a car, you’re in a different environment. If it’s an air-conditioned car, the outside may be hot, but you’re moving around in your car, enjoying a different environment in the car, unlike the pedestrians outside.</p>
<p>This is reminiscent of the experience with the children of Israel when they left Egypt for the Promised Land. They went with their own atmosphere. The Bible says, <em>“By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people”</em> (Exodus 13:21-22 NIV).</p>
<p>Everywhere else in the desert was hot and arid, but God’s people dwelt in His divine presence. The pillar of cloud shielded them from the scorching heat during the day. At night, when it was cold, they had the pillar of fire which gave them warmth. In the same way, in Christ, you have your own atmosphere. When you’re going to work, you’re in this environment called Christ! When you’re at home, school, place of business or marketplaces of life, you’re in that environment.</p>
<p>This means nothing can hurt you. Like the children of Israel, you’re protected inside that environment— CHRIST—during the day and at night. Glory to God! What a place! It’s an environment of glory. Hallelujah! </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (2 Peter 1:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Christians still have the Old Testament mentality of trying to get something from God; trying to make His “promises” come to pass in their lives. But to have this kind of consciousness is to be oblivious or completely ignorant of what Christ really came to do. He came as the fulfilment of all of God’s promises, such that there’s not one single promise in the Bible yet to be fulfilled for the Christian.</p>
<p>Once, I asked a group of Christians to mention, if they thought there was any one promise in the Bible for the new creation. Someone mentioned Psalm 37:4 NKJV: <em>“Delight yourself also in the LORD, And He shall give you the desires of your heart.”</em> This is the problem: I said many are living the life of the Old Testament, and they think they’re living the Christian life.</p>
<p>Between the desires of your heart, and CHRIST that He’s already given you, which is greater? What else would you desire of someone who already gave you Himself? Didn’t you also read in 1 Corinthians 3:21 that all things are yours? Understand that all of the “promises” in the Old Testament have been fulfilled and abrogated. They are “old truths.” Think about when a country amends the constitution, and someone is still living by the old provisions; it won’t work that way.</p>
<p>God already gave you Himself, His Kingdom, and everything! When you come into Christ, everything belongs to you; there’s nothing more for Him to give you, for you’re a joint-heir with Him. Therefore, quit the struggle. Enjoy your life in Christ.</p>
<p>We read it in our opening verse that by His divine power, He already gave us (note it’s in past tense) ALL things that pertain to life and godliness; nothing is left out. Stop struggling with your bills. Stop struggling with your health. Choose the life of rest.</p>
<p>“Warring” in prayer for Him to fulfil His promises is an effort in futility. Live the Word, and in the Spirit; you’d discover that everything you could ever want is in the street that He gave you to walk in. Blessed be His Name forever!</p>

<p><em><strong>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Christian, it’s so important that you have an understanding of the Word. That understanding will help you have a concept of the Scriptures in a way that’s far beyond the generic; your approach to the Word will be different. This is important, because except and unless you understand the Word, you won’t know how to apply it to your life and situations.</p>
<p>The Word is Himself, God. That’s what we read in our opening text. When He speaks to you, He becomes to you and in you what He says. Every time you study it, you feed your spirit and you’re able to live the life of the Word. Then you discover that your Christian life every day is full of joy and excitement.</p>
<p>As you prepare your goals for the coming year, make studying the Word, devoting quality time to search and meditate on the Scriptures a top priority. This will cause you to be enlightened, informed, refreshed, strengthened and graced for greater effectiveness in your work and ministry, and all that the Lord would have you do in the coming year and beyond. You’d find yourself walking in the path that He’s chosen for you before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Remember that your life has a purpose, and the purpose of God for you is revealed and becomes clearer as you fellowship with the Word and the Spirit. He’ll grant you insight through the Scriptures. He’ll bring your thoughts to something that He wants you to know now, that you can apply to your life. Then, His wisdom will leap out of the message and inundate your heart, and you find that you’re walking the path of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals (1 Corinthians 6:9 NASB).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you study the synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark and Luke, you’d observe that Jesus extensively taught on the principles of our heavenly Kingdom. For example, in Matthew 19:5 and Mark 10:7-8, He acknowledged the union of one man and one woman as the standard expression of human sexuality in a marriage relationship.</p>
<p>The apostles built on the same foundation. In Romans 1:27 (NKJV), the Apostle Paul reiterated the Master’s words, denouncing those who engage in same-sex practice. It says, <em>“Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.”</em></p>
<p>Jesus said in John 15:19, <em>“…ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world….”</em> Refuse to be influenced by the system of this world, which is run by Satan. Don’t let your actions, reactions, thoughts, words, and responses be like those of the people of the world. Uphold our Kingdom ideals.</p>
<p>In our Kingdom, God’s Word is the final arbiter; we’re cultured and governed by the Word. Therefore, refuse to compromise the standards, values and principles of our heavenly Kingdom. Walk in the light of God’s Word and His righteousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world (1 John 4:4 NKJV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This natural world is under a curse and has all the negativities of the evil one infested in it. So, being born again, the world will come at you, mentally, physically, emotionally, and even spiritually. But what did Jesus say? <em>“These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world”</em> (John 16:33).</p>
<p> The Master overcame the world on your behalf, which means you’ve overcome the world. And the Apostle Paul says, <em>“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places…Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked”</em> (Ephesians 6:12-16).</p>
<p>Therefore, irrespective of the evil, darkness, and negativism in this world, you must think differently. Be unperturbed, because you’re in Christ, and in Him you always win. Nothing can be set against you. In your journey of faith, and in fulfilling God’s plan for your life, don’t entertain thoughts of fear, lack or unbelief. Put away anger, bitterness and unforgiveness. These are the things that can hinder your spiritual progress and the call of God on your life.</p>
<p>Keep your heart in God’s Word. 1 Timothy 4:1516 says to meditate on and give yourself wholly to the Word, and your victories and success in every endeavour will be inevitable.</p>

<p><em><strong>For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed (Isaiah 50:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God wants us to set our hearts on His Word and not be distracted by circumstances, experiences, or adversity. It brings to mind the words of the Psalmist in Psalm 119:69 (MSG): <em>“The godless spread lies about me, but I focus my attention on what you are saying.”</em> Also, Romans 4:19 (MSG) says, <em>“Abraham didn’t focus on his own impotence and say, ‘It’s hopeless. This hundred-year-old body could never father a child.’ Nor did he survey Sarah’s decades of infertility and give up.”</em></p>
<p>In the New Testament, the Bible talks about Jesus in Luke 9:51: <em>“And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem.”</em> Why was His face set steadfastly on His destination? He knew that was His last visit to Jerusalem, and this time, it was for His life; He was going to the Cross to die for the sins of the world, and He wasn’t going to let anyone distract Him from it.</p>
<p>In our world today, there’re so many distractions, but you must remain focused on the dream, the vision, that the Lord has put in your heart. Have a tunnel-vision towards God’s agenda. It’s the way to win. Many years ago, the Lord said to me, “Son, don’t look around. Be focused; refuse to be distracted.”</p>
<p>Some Christians have found themselves being distracted by too many things. They’re distracted by the state of the economy and several other happenings around them. They can’t accomplish much in life that way. When you’re a man or woman of purpose and vision, you’re not perturbed about the economics or economies of this world, because you know that you’re not of this world.</p>
<p>Nothing in, and of this world can place a limit on you or cause you to be disadvantaged, because you won before you came. You were already a success before you started. Therefore, set your sail and rule your world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me... (Psalm 50:23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When many hear “thanksgiving,” what comes to their mind is usually thanksgiving offering, which is good. God expects us to thank Him with our offerings, but thanksgiving is much more than giving your offerings; it ought to be a way of life.</p>
<p>Think about Jesus: during His ministry in the earth, He prayed on several occasions, but mostly in gratitude to the Father. When He was to raise Lazarus from the dead (someone who had been dead and buried for four days), He didn’t wail or beg; He gave thanks. He said, <em>“...Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me”</em> (John 11:41).</p>
<p>In St. John’s Gospel, He had ended His ministration to a multitude that followed Him to the desert area, but didn’t want to send them home, hungry. All that was available was a little boy’s lunch: five mini loaves of bread and two fishes.</p>
<p>That certainly wouldn’t suffice to feed a teeming multitude of five thousand men (women and children not counted). But the Bible says, <em>“And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would”</em> (John 6:11). Notice what He did that resulted in the miracle: He gave thanks!</p>
<p>When was the last time you gave thanks for something you realised you needed, without having to ask God for it? That’s the life you ought to be living as a Christian. Cultivate the lifestyle of thanksgiving. All things are yours already; therefore, when you think there’s something you require, give thanks to God for it, because you know it’s yours already.</p>
<p>The Father loves you so much; there’s nothing you’d have to “drag” Him to do for you. Your response—your faith-attitude—should be a daily life of praise and thanksgiving to Him for His grace and loving-kindness. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>The Greek word for “meditate” has a very interesting and inspiring connotation; it’s “Meletao.” It means to carefully set your mind on something, and then contrive. It also means to practise in your mind. Our opening scripture says to meditate on God’s Word; that means, set your mind on it; contemplate, contrive and practise it in your mind.</p>
<p>Imagine practising in your mind the outreach meeting you’re about to hold, or practising in your mind the people you’re going to lead to Christ in the coming year! It’s important that you contemplate, contrive and practise God’s Word, and His visions in your mind from time to time. See yourself walking in the realities of the Word and the visions it creates in your spirit.</p>
<p>Joshua 1:8 says, “<em>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein....”</em> Notice the underlined part: Meditation, contriving the Word will cause you to do what it says; it’ll propel you to action. And the blessing is manifested in the “doing” (James 1:22-25).</p>
<p>What’s 2020 going to be like for you? Begin to contrive and practise it in your mind. See visions of glory, visions of yourself walking in greater levels and dimensions of faith. See yourself charting new frontiers and blazing new trails for the Gospel. Hallelujah! Maybe the year hasn’t exactly been the way you expected; don’t be discouraged. Contrive now what you want the future to be.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re the architect of your own life, with the design brief from your heavenly client. An architect is able to walk through the length and breadth of a skyscraper in his mind, by reason of his training, even before the foundation of the building is laid. To him, that building is already a reality, even though it may still be on paper. Likewise, let the image of your glorious life and future be so clear and real in your spirit as you spend time in prayer and meditation (Exodus 26:30; Hebrews 8:5).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Don’t be quick-tempered, for anger is the friend of fools (Ecclesiastes 7:9 NLT).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai and saw the people worshipping a golden calf, which they had constructed by themselves, he was enraged. Right there, he smashed to pieces the tablets of the law engraved by the finger of God (Exodus 32:19). Moses had to engrave another one all by himself, as a punishment.</p>
<p>On another occasion, as the children of Israel sojourned in the wilderness, they suddenly ganged up against Moses and Aaron because there was no water for them to drink. The Lord then instructed Moses to assemble the congregation, and tell the rock before their eyes to bring forth water for them to drink. </p>
<p>Moses, obviously angry at the people’s outburst, charged and rebuked them, tagging them rebels! In a fit of rage, he turned and struck the rock instead of speaking to it as the Lord had instructed; in fact, he struck it twice (Numbers 20:11). Water came out for the people to drink, but Moses’ action displeased the Lord.</p>
<p>In as much as Moses was referred to as “<em>…very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth”</em> (Numbers 12:3), he allowed anger affect his ministry and walk with God, such that he wasn’t allowed to lead the children of Israel into the Promised Land as the Lord had intended. He certainly was faithful in the administration of all God’s house (Hebrews 3:5), but anger was his undoing. </p>
<p>Anger is a quick destroyer. Don’t even try to “tame” it; eschew it. If you’ve been termed or described as someone who’s quick to get angry, get before the Lord in prayer, and give yourself to the Word in meditation.</p>
<p>There’re people who won’t fulfil their calling, as it has happened in history, because of anger. And in such cases, what God does is to have another plan. Don’t let it happen to you. Why should anyone miss out with God, and fail in their divine destiny, because of a negative attitude that could easily be controlled and overturned with God’s Word? Psalm 37:8 (NIV) says, <em>“Refrain from anger and turn from wrath….”</em> Act on God’s Word. Refuse to let anger rule you.</p>

<p><em><strong>For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted (Luke 14:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Scriptures show us examples of many who accomplished extraordinary feats, rose to kingly positions, and went from obscurity to limelight when they were yet humble. Sadly, some of these who were elevated to such regal positions became haughty, arrogant, and proud; they became “big” in their own eyes, and were abased by God. The story of King Saul is a ready case in point.</p>
<p>Saul was given the grace of leadership and anointed as king over Israel. This happened “<em>when he was little in his own sight,”</em> according to the Bible (1 Samuel 15:17). Soon after, he went against spiritual instructions: he offered a burnt offering, against God’s commandment (1 Samuel 13:9-11). At another instance, he wouldn’t completely destroy the Amalekites as the Lord expressly instructed (1 Samuel 15:1-11). As a result of his pride, he was rejected by God from being king over Israel (1 Samuel 15:26). Sad!</p>
<p>But look at Jesus! Even though He knew who He was—the blessed, Sovereign (Ruler), the King of kings and the Lord of lords—He was humble. Luke 4:16-21 shows when He came to Nazareth where He had been brought up, He went into the synagogue as His custom was on the Sabbath day, and He stood up to read from the Holy Scrolls. He didn’t yell at the priest, “Look, the King of kings is here!” The Lord simply got up and read as He was asked. And when He was done reading, <em>“…He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down…”</em> (Luke 4:20 NKJV). What a show of humility! </p>
<p>If you’re a leader or pastor, for example, was there a time when it was such a great honour for you to be asked to speak before a congregation? Or have you suddenly become so big in your own eyes that you get offended if you aren’t called upon? 1 Peter 5:5 says, <em>“…be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.”</em> True humility is submitting yourself to the authority, influence, and impact of God’s Word and His instructions. When you do, you’ll receive more grace, wherein lies the power for promotion, increase, and supernatural progress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…even though we once did estimate Christ from a human viewpoint and as a man, yet now...we know Him no longer [in terms of the flesh] (2 Corinthians 5:16 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When some people say, “I want to be like Jesus,” what they really mean is to be like the “Jewish man” who walked the streets of Galilee and Capernaum. Some even get enthused at discussions about His physical stature: His build, height, physique, looks, etc., losing sight of what’s more important—His spirituality. Beyond His physicality, you should focus on “Jesus—the Word!”</p>
<p>The limitations of the “physical” Jesus were Jewish. As a Jew, for example, He celebrated Passover, but Passover meant nothing to the non-Jew. Therefore, our focus should be on Jesus the Son of God; God in flesh. See Him in, and through the Word, because He’s the living Word. The Apostle Paul, at some point, mistakenly thought of Christ as though He were merely an ordinary man of Jewish descent. But then, he realized that even though Jesus walked the earth in a physical frame, and lived as a Jewish man, He wasn’t ordinary. </p>
<p>Paul’s focus henceforth was on Jesus—the Word— and he went on to be so successful in his ministry! John 1:14 tells us that God’s Word was personified, and the result was the man, Christ Jesus: “<em>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us</em>….” So, see Him as the Word-incarnate; see Him as the totality of God’s thoughts, ideas, opinions, will, and emotions tabernacled in human flesh. Focus on Him as God’s perfect imprint, the icon of the unseen God, just as Hebrews 1:3 reveals.</p>
<p>Moreover, here’s something quite supreme: as He is the Word made flesh, so are you an offspring of the Word. 1 Peter 1:23 says, <em>“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”</em> 1 John 4:17 says as He is, so are we in this world. Not as He was, in Galilee, but as He is now, risen in glory, power, strength and excellence, so are you now. You have His righteousness, life, and nature in you NOW. You’re the effulgence of His glory and the express image of His person. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God unto salvation for all who would believe (Romans 1:16). In other words, the Gospel is no respecter of persons; its power works for all men. So, if you were wondering, “How do I reach out to people of other races?” that shouldn’t be a problem. First, there’s no such thing as “other races”; God made humans, and the Gospel is for all.</p>
<p>Never allow the glorious Gospel you’ve been entrusted with be tainted with any kind of discrimination or prejudice. Refuse it! The Word of God transcends all cultural, ethnic or national barriers. If you minister the Word of God in truth, it’ll break barriers and separate between those that are in bondage and those who really want to hear the truth. Truth has neither colour nor borders. Truth is divine! And the Word of God is truth (John 17:17).</p>
<p>Never be selective as to whom you want to preach the Gospel. John 3:16 says, <em>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</em> Jesus came to save the whole world, not a select few. There’re hurting people in all nations and nationalities; so, we must reach out to everyone, beginning with those in our immediate spheres of influence. You’d be amazed at the results the Word of God will produce in their lives!</p>
<p>Could there be those that might show resentment or display some form of prejudice and discrimination towards you as you preach to them? Probably! But never be intimidated by such people. The Apostle Paul understood this truth. In Colossians 3:11 (NLT), he said, <em>“In this new life, it doesn’t matter if you are a Jew or a Gentile, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbaric, uncivilized, slave, or free. Christ is all that matters, and he lives in all of us.”</em> Refuse the worldly categorization of people according to their physical or earthly descent. The Gospel is for everybody. Go all out this season and reach out to everyone with the message of Christ’s salvation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one who’s born again doesn’t have two lives or natures; he only has one, and that’s the divine life. When you were born again, a new life was introduced into your spirit, and the human life with which you were born of your earthly parents ceased to be; it was supplanted by the life and nature of God! It’s not something that can be figured out in the laboratory; it’s spiritual.</p>
<p>Moreover, this change isn’t one to take place in heaven, as some also think; it’s already happened. That’s the message of Christ. He came to give us the divine life; to make us sons of God: “Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is” (1 John 3:2). Our theme verse further buttresses this; it says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</em></p>
<p>Notice the phrase, “new creature”; it connotes something that’s not known; it’s new, or even “strange.” It’s like thinking you saw something sneak by, but couldn’t really make out what it was, and the best way you could describe it was to say, “I saw a creature; it’s neither a cat nor a dog; but I’m not sure what it is; it’s something strange.” It wasn’t like anything you’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>This is exactly Paul’s inference in 2 Corinthians 5:17. We’re a new species; a kind of creature that never existed before; a new type of man! When you come to this realization and understanding that what you have isn’t a mix of the divine and human natures, you’ll cease from the struggles to live right, and you’ll find yourself fulfilling God’s will for your life gloriously from a position of rest. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>When you were born again, you were born and baptized into Christ. 1 Corinthians 12:13 says, <em>“For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body…”</em>; you were baptized into the body of Christ, a new man, a new creature with a new life. The King James Version uses the word, “creature” which is a lot more accurate than the word, “creation” as used in some other translations. Being a “new creature” means you’re one of a kind; a peculiar breed. But that’s not all; the latter part of our opening scripture says, <em>“…old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</em></p>
<p>The underlined word, “behold” calls attention to something God wants you to notice, an important truth. He wants you to SEE that, indeed, you’re a new man in Christ Jesus; everything about your life is new and divine. The old life and nature you received from your biological parents are now supplanted by God’s divine nature, which is why Peter calls us “comrades” or “associates” of the God-kind (2 Peter 1:4).</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a mere change that took place in you when you were born again; there was an actual replacement of the human life with the indestructible life of God. You have the same life with which Jesus was raised from the dead: the resurrection life.</p>
<p>This is what makes it so sublime! It’s the reason sickness for the Christian isn’t supposed to be, because the life in you is divine. Even if you were born with a hereditary disease, the Bible says, <em>“Old things are passed away!”</em> That sickness or disease isn’t, and could never be, a part of your new nature in Christ. The old nature that was subject to sin, defeat, sickness, failure and death, is dead and gone! All things have become new, and all these new things are of God (2 Corinthians 5:18).</p>
<p>Everything about your life carries divinity in it because you were born into a divine environment; the Christ-environment. Blessed be God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we just read in the verse above isn’t a promise; it has already happened! Your physical body, your previously death-doomed and death-prone body, has been rejuvenated and vitalized by the Holy Spirit who lives in you. So, your life is from the Spirit, sustained through the Word. 1 Peter 1:23 says, “<em>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”</em> God gave birth to us by the Word, through the Spirit.</p>
<p>The blood that’s flowing through your veins isn’t what’s keeping you alive. But why is the blood important? First, it testifies of man’s humanity. Leviticus 17:11 says, <em>“For the life of the flesh is in the blood....”</em> Therefore, the redemption of man had to be by the shedding of blood, the blood of Jesus—life for life! Now that He gave His life for us to have His life, the life of your flesh is no longer your blood, but the Spirit.</p>
<p>Remember, He was raised back to life without blood, yet He wasn’t a Ghost. He said to His disciples after His resurrection, <em>“Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have”</em> (Luke 24:39 NIV). Notice He didn’t say, “flesh and blood”; the resurrection life doesn’t require blood to function, and that’s the life you have in you.</p>
<p>It’s the reason no sickness or disease can ravage your body, because sickness and disease attack the blood, to destroy the body. But thanks be unto God! John 1:12-13 says*, “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.”*  Have this consciousness and live above this world; above sickness, disease and the corrupting forces of this present world of darkness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re too many of God’s children who are still looking up to God for one blessing or the other. They’re looking up to God to heal them, to touch them, to provide for them, to answer their prayers. But the truth is, there’s no other blessing that’ll come to you from heaven until the second coming of the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>There’s no prayer that the answer will come to you from heaven. Everything you’d ever need in life is in Christ, and Christ is in you, and to have Christ is to have everything. Colossians 1:27 says, <em>“...Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</em> Have you been desiring or expecting to see the glory of God revealed in your finances, your health, business, or family? The glory has already been revealed. That’s the meaning and reason for Christmas; that’s why we’re so full of joy that Christ was born into this world, to live in our hearts.</p>
<p>Christ in you is your assurance of divine health, prosperity, success, victory and dominion. Hallelujah! What you need is to discover Christ in you. If Christ isn’t in a man, then his sufferings are justified; his pains are “excusable.” But not so with you; you’ve been brought into the “glory life.” This Christ-consciousness will inspire an extraordinary boldness in your life. It’ll cause you to live every day, exuding joy indescribable, and full of glory. When you discover Christ in you, there’ll be no place for any disease in your body; that’ll be the end of darkness and lack. Glory to God!</p>
<p>The revelation of Christianity is Christ IN YOU; not in heaven. Don’t start fasting and asking Him to pour something out from heaven; don’t ask Him to give you a blessing from heaven. He’s blessed you already with Himself; with all the blessings that are in Christ (Ephesians 1:3). Consciously take some time today to meditate on Christ: who He is, who you are in Him, and all that He’s accomplished for you. It’ll transform your life. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us… (John 1:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as Adam and Eve heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the Garden, in the cool of the day (Genesis 3:8), the Old Testament prophets weren’t left out. Some heard a voice in their spirits, while others heard a voice from above; they, however, didn’t see a form or a shape to that voice.</p>
<p>But when the baby Jesus was born in Bethlehem, it was that same voice that Adam and the prophets heard, that was born in flesh! Jesus was always the Word of God in the bosom of the Father. But now, “…the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us….” The actual Greek translation of the word, “made” is “ginomai”; it means to bring to existence, or to become. Jesus wasn’t conceived like everybody else; He was conceived of the Holy Ghost and became flesh. A miracle of miracles!</p>
<p>The most amazing part of this intrusion into the sense realm wasn’t only that He put on flesh, and dwelt among men, but that He was the Father’s unflinching, unfailing and unconditional love manifested. His words, actions and miracles were all love-inspired. Jesus is God’s love in flesh. Love is the totality of His personality. Jesus couldn’t choose whether to love you or not to love you. He could only love you. He said in John 15:9 (AMPC), “I have loved you, [just] as the Father has loved Me….”</p>
<p>This Christmas, ponder on Jesus as the revelation of God’s love for you! Think how much He loves you, to have given Himself as a ransom for your sins. He said in John 15:13 (NKJV), <em>“Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.”</em> He did exactly that for you and me.</p>
<p>Make His love your heartfelt contemplation; stay and be at rest in His unrivalled and unconditional love for you. If you ever comprehend this truth, it’ll suddenly awaken in you, your value, and you’d never be discouraged, despondent, fearful, afraid, intimidated, or ashamed, irrespective of the challenges. Your consciousness of His love for you will make you a success and a victor forever. Merry Christmas!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end (Jeremiah 29:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has a plan for your life, an excellent one at that! Remember, He’s gracious and of loving-kindness. Some people keep pets such as dogs, cats, etc. They didn’t create or give birth to the pets, but they do everything to give them the best of life.</p>
<p>Now, if men would be thoughtful enough to plan a good life and future for their pets, not to mention their biological children, why then should anyone wonder that the Almighty God, who created us, would have a glorious plan for our lives? Ephesians 2:10 (AMPC) says, <em>“For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].”</em></p>
<p>God’s plan is the best; your role is to discover that plan and walk in the light of it. As you study and meditate on the Word, you become more and more acquainted with His plans for your life.</p>
<p>Also, you must yield yourself to the ministry of the Holy Spirit. He’s the One who helps you understand the Scriptures. He grants you insight into the mysteries and realities of the Kingdom. He’s in you to help you fulfil God’s plan for your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh (Galatians 5:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 4:25 says, <em>“Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.”</em> This scripture isn’t telling you to struggle to put away lying; rather, it’s letting you know that now that you’re in Christ, truth has become natural to you. It’s now natural for you to live the Christ-life; the life of righteousness.</p>
<p>1 John 3:9 says, <em>“Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.”</em> Some theologians have wrestled with this verse, because it’s different from their experiences. But what it says is very clear: anybody who’s born of God doesn’t sin! But many still wonder, “How could this be true when I find myself sinning again and again, despite all my efforts to not sin?” So, they think that Apostle Paul’s writing in Romans 7:15*—” For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I*”—seems to be more consistent with their lives. But they forget he was talking about the man under the law, the unregenerate man.</p>
<p>Paul went on to say, <em>“O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”</em> (Romans 7:24); and he gave the answer. He said, <em>“There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit”</em> (Romans 8:1). What you need is to walk in the Spirit. Our theme verse says, <em>“...Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.”</em></p>
<p>Become conscious of who you are in Christ—the righteousness of God—and walk accordingly. As you do, you’d discover that living the true Christian life is natural to your spirit, because your spirit, which is the real you, is created by God in righteousness and true holiness. Therefore, you’re not supposed to struggle to do right or live right. That’s why He gave us His righteousness. His righteousness in you gives you the ability to live above sin and without sin-consciousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Do not fret or have any anxiety about anything, but in every circumstance and in everything, by prayer and petition (definite requests), with thanksgiving, continue to make your wants known to God (Philippians 4:6 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the challenges that many have with prayer is the lack of focus. When you pray, you must have focus. David, in one of his prayers, said to the Lord, “<em>Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name”</em> (Psalm 86:11).</p>
<p>Notice the underlined expression! The New International Version puts it this way: <em>“…give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name.”</em> So, in prayer, focus your attention on the Lord, and be conscious of what you’re praying about. Some people pray about so many things, and a moment later, they don’t remember what they prayed about. If you don’t remember what you prayed about, how would you know when God answers?</p>
<p>You have to learn to keep record of what you say to the Lord in prayer; be specific. If there’re things you’re concerned about that you’d like to pray about, write them or make a mental note of them when you pray. Then as you pray, receive.</p>
<p>What God wants is that you express your faith in specific terms. Faith makes you a possessor. When you have made your definite request of the Lord, rejoice and give Him glory, knowing that it’s done. <em>“Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them”</em> (Mark 11:24).</p>

<p><em><strong>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth (Philippians 2:9-10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If as a Christian, you find that you’re always crying and begging God in prayer for your needs, you’re not living in the Name of Jesus. We don’t beg in His Name. Don’t beg Him for your health or for anything. It’s a slap on His face. It’s like a child begging a responsible father for breakfast or dinner. He loves you more than that.</p>
<p>Do you think God doesn’t know that you have pain in your body? You think He doesn’t know that you’ve been experiencing migraine headaches? Or that you’re behind in your bills? He’s aware. But He wants you to change things! You have a weapon, an instrument; the Name of Jesus! Use it to effect a change in your body, in your finances, and any other area of your life. You can tell yourself, “I’m not going into 2020 in this condition or situation; I demand and effect a change, in the Name of Jesus!”</p>
<p>“Wake up and be who I’ve made you; realise the power in my Name and use it to make your life ever-glorious!” That’s what the Lord is saying to you, even now! Get rid of the pain and come out of that distressing situation. In His Name, you have a right to refuse anything that’s not of God in your life. Every sickness, disease and circumstance bows to that name.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what troubles you; you don’t need to cry for help; speak forth words in His Name, and you’ll be amazed at how quickly things will turn around in your favour.  Practise using that Name, and build your faith on it through the Word. It’s a lifestyle. You’ve got to grow in it. It’s an environment to live in. Use it for every area of your life. That’s what the Bible tells us: <em>“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him”</em> (Colossians 3:17). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Meditate on these things; give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all (1 Timothy 4:15 NKJV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the problems that some Christians have bemoaned is the disparity between their personal experiences and the message of the Gospel that they “believe” and even preach. How do you preach healings and miracles as the works of God, and then get sick; or preach about financial prosperity, and are in deep financial difficulties? It shows that there’s a missing link.</p>
<p>Some may think the solution to this is intense prayer and fasting so they can “clean” up their lives and get rid of whatever may be hindering their “blessing.” “Perhaps, if I try to be a better Christian, things might change for good,” they’d say. But that’s not it; the Lord never asked us to try to be good or better; He already made us His righteousness.</p>
<p>It’s not about what you’ve done or didn’t do; it’s about Christ and your understanding, and appropriation of His substitutionary work to, and in your personal life. You can live your whole life preaching the Gospel, without really knowing what it is. For example, as popular as John 3:16 is, a scripture many people quote by heart, they’ve never had a grasp of the power and reality of those words. It says, “<em>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</em></p>
<p>Many see this scripture as a promise, but it’s a law; a sovereign declaration of the Almighty God, that anybody who believes in Jesus Christ, is separated, or severed from perishing; from suffering. It doesn’t end at that: such a person has everlasting life. Everlasting means imperishable, indestructible and incorruptible. That’s the life you’ve received.</p>
<p>How can anyone understand, and be aware of this kind of truth and live an ordinary life? You couldn’t know this and be a victim in life; it’s impossible! Meditate on the realities of the Gospel. It’ll make you think, talk and walk differently; your life will be an expression and manifestation of the message and blessings of the Gospel. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me (Psalm 23:3-4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day you were born again, your destiny in God began. You were set on a preordained path of righteousness as we read in our opening scripture. Some people are living amiss, living outside of God’s destiny, because they’re not living in and by the Word. They’re in places they shouldn’t be, living in houses they shouldn’t live in; their whole life is subject to chance, and that’s sad.</p>
<p>But with you, it’s different; predestination is at work in you. You don’t go anywhere or meet anyone by chance. Your life has a purpose with God; He leads you by His Spirit that lives in you. And in that path that He’s set for you to walk is everything you’ll ever require to fulfil all that He’s called you to do, and meet those that He’s planned for you to meet. Some of them may not like you or even want to see you, but because they’re put there by God, whatever they do would only turn out as blessing and promotion for you.</p>
<p>Read what Ephesians 2:10 (AMPC) says about you: <em>“For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].”</em> Blessed be God!</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re reading this and feeling you might have missed your way with God; you may have strayed from His purpose for your life. It’s not too late. That’s the reason the Word is coming to you now. The Bible says, <em>“And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left”</em> (Isaiah 30:21). It’s not too late to retrace your steps in God, through His Word. Make up your mind to walk in the light of His Word, and you’ll experience His glory in your life like you never thought possible.</p>
