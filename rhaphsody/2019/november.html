<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word (Acts 10:44).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luke tells a beautiful story in Acts 10, of an event in the house of Cornelius, a Roman centurion. Even though he was a devout man, he wasn’t saved. An angel of the Lord appeared to him and instructed him to send for Peter, who’d tell him words through which he and his household would be saved (Acts 11:13-14). While Peter was in Cornelius’ house, preaching the Gospel, something extraordinary happened: <em>“…the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word”</em> (Acts 10:44).</p>
<p>Notice the word, “fell”; it’s translated from the Greek “epipipto,” and it means to fall like rain; an outpouring. It also means to fall on someone in an embrace. As Peter spoke those gracious words of salvation, the Holy Ghost embraced everyone in Cornelius’ household, and they were all recreated and filled with the Spirit. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This is what happens when we minister through the Spirit; our hearers are enraptured in the Father’s love! They bask in the Spirit’s embrace and get convicted in their hearts for salvation because our words aren’t mere words. Our testimony of Christ and witness of His salvation is like Peter’s; out of our bellies flow gushers of living water (John 7:38). As such, your words cease to be persuasive words of man’s wisdom, but words delivered in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</p>
<p>Many who thronged Jesus experienced the embrace of the Spirit. Luke 5:17 tells us, <em>“…as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.”</em> There was something in the air as Jesus spoke; His words were loaded with divine energy. Glory to God!</p>
<p>God’s power to save, help, deliver and bless is in the Gospel, which you must convey and communicate by the power of God’s Spirit. That’s why you must always be filled with the Spirit, like Paul admonished in Ephesians 5:18-20.</p>
<p>Being filled with the Spirit, His divine glory and presence are transmitted through you in the words that you speak. There and then, faith and a deep conviction is stirred in the hearts of your hearers, leaving salvation, deliverance, and untold blessings in its wake! Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people (2 Corinthians 6:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God vacated the temple in Jerusalem when Jesus was crucified. While He was still on the Cross for three long hours, the Bible says there was darkness in the earth; the rocks began to split, and the earth began to quake (Read Matthew 27:45-51).</p>
<p>The presence of God had been in the Holy of Holies in the temple, separated from the Holy Place with a thick curtain: 40 feet long, 20 feet high, 4 inches thick. But when Jesus said on the Cross, “It is finished”; the Bible says, that thick curtain was cut from the top to the bottom, and the Holy of Holies was open, and God’s presence vacated the building.</p>
<p>Prior to that day, only the High Priest could enter the presence of God. But when the divine presence returned through the Holy Spirit, the Church was born; the human body became the living tabernacle of God. Now, He lives in us. Glory to God!</p>
<p>You’re the temple of the living God. Every day you walk in this earth, have the consciousness that you’re God’s mobile headquarters. With this consciousness, you can never be defeated, because you understand that greater is He that’s in you than he that’s in the world. You’re full of life, from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet. Blessed be God!</p>
<p>Being the temple of God means your lungs, kidneys, heart, and every organ and system of your body is filled with the Spirit of God. You’ve been perfected in Him. This is the consciousness you must carry every time, no matter the challenges that come your way. 1 John 4:4 (NKJV) says, “You are of God, little children, and have overcome them because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.” Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty (Psalm 91:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Jesus was born, the Bible tells us that King Herod staged a manhunt for the young child, to kill Him. But an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and commanded him to take the child and His mother, and flee to Egypt (Matthew 2:13-14).</p>
<p>Joseph did as he was instructed; but think for a moment: we’re not talking about just any child; we’re talking about Jesus, the Saviour. “Shouldn’t He be protected by all angels? Why flee with Him to Egypt?” you might ask. First, understand that there was no deception whatsoever in the angel’s instruction to Joseph; there was a real threat to Jesus’ life, and Herod actually could have killed the young child if Joseph hadn’t followed that instruction.</p>
<p>Also, notice the angel of the Lord didn’t say, “…Flee to Syria.” The instruction was clear: <em>“…flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word...”</em> (Matthew 2:13-14). If Joseph had gone to Syria, he would have encountered another trouble. It’s important that we are where God wants us. His protection isn’t everywhere; His protection is in His instruction to you.</p>
<p>There’s a similar example in Exodus 12. As a result of Pharaoh’s persistent defiance and hardheartedness to let God’s people go, the death angel was assigned to wreak havoc in Egypt. However, the Lord instructed each household of the children of Israel to kill a lamb and mark their doorposts and lintels with the blood of the slain animal. But they were to stay indoors!</p>
<p>The houses of the Egyptians weren’t marked, and the death angel, in a swoop, struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, whether man or beast. But you see, there were other strangers in Egypt who weren’t Jews, who knew about this and marked their houses, and just like the children of Israel, they too were protected. We know this to be so because the Bible says when Israel went out of Egypt, <em>“…a mixed multitude went up also with them...”</em> (Exodus 12:38). They escaped that havoc because they obeyed God’s principles for protection. Some people feel they can do whatever they want, and choose whatever way they want to go, and then think God is supposed to see to it that they’re shielded and protected from evil. It’s not so!</p>
<p>God gives instructions and directions; you’re divinely protected in following those instructions and guidance that He’s given you. You’re shielded from all the attacks and evil that destroy others when you stay in His Word. He’s the boss; when He tells you what to do and where to go, comply. When you align yourself with His perfect will, you’ll permanently dwell in safety. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine (2 Timothy 4:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re different holidays people enjoy within a calendar year, but when it comes to soul winning, there’re no holidays. Satan isn’t on holiday in destroying men’s lives; he’s hell-bent and more vicious than ever in his quest to stop men from hearing the truth of the glorious Gospel. But our passion for their salvation is greater and stronger.</p>
<p>Utilise every opportunity at your disposal to win souls and bring sinners to Christ. Make every moment count; maximise the time as God’s ordained agent of salvation, to turn sinners from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God! Remember, this glorious Gospel of the blessed God has been committed to your trust (1 Timothy 1:11). So, we must preach it with the urgency and passion that it deserves. Just to think that we’re the custodian of His message of salvation is simply sublime; something that even the angels wonder at. But it’s our calling.</p>
<p>It shows how much God trusts us, because the value of trust is in the responsibility that’s committed to you. He trusted us with the most important news and message in all the world, for every generation: the Gospel of Jesus Christ. What a blessing!</p>
<p>Let the fire of the Gospel burn passionately in your heart every day. Make up your mind that no matter the cost, you’re going to be at the fore of propagating this message and haul lost souls into the Kingdom.</p>
<p>His message that we bear is potent, filled with divine energy to save and transform men’s lives. Therefore, preach it day in, day out: <em>“Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching</em>” (2 Timothy 4:2 ESV).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God (Acts 20:24).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gospel is the power of God unto salvation (Romans 1:16). The Scriptures declare that there’s no other way. Be resolute about this. There are many groups who stake their lives to promote their cause. Many of us don’t believe in their cause, but they stake their lives on a cause that we know isn’t right. But our cause is right; how much then is it worth?</p>
<p>In my early teenage years, I made up my mind that since my cause was right, I was going to go all out for it. I made a decision that nothing on earth was strong enough to stop me; no offers on earth would distract me from the Gospel. It was a cause worth more than life, and it didn’t matter to me what became of me for preaching it.</p>
<p>Back then, I’d pray, “Lord, if I have to walk through the valleys, and the hills, and the mountains of this world, never having a place to stay, I don’t care; this Gospel is worth everything.” It made no difference if I had to preach to the poorest of the poor and live among them so as to bring them to the light of the Gospel; I was ready!</p>
<p>The stakes have never been higher than they are today. Therefore, in your commitment to the Gospel, be like Paul; read again his inspiring resolve in our opening verse. You’re the one that God is trusting with everything to save men’s lives; to save them from hell, and carry the bloodstained banner of Jesus Christ around the world. This is the only way.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that there’s no other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved (Acts 4:12). If this is true, and thank God it is, then there’s too much at stake. Everything about our lives, everything we say and do, should be filled with passion for Christ and His eternal message of salvation for mankind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined (Psalm 50:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these prophetic words, Zion refers to the Church, for it is God’s dwelling place. It’s revealed in God’s Word as the perfection of beauty, from where God shines forth. But King James Version and a few other translations didn’t quite render the scripture above correctly. In the original Hebrew, the latter part of the scripture gives a connotation of continuity. It’s rendered thus, “Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth”; His glory goes forth.</p>
<p>In Psalm 90:17, we see the passionate cry of Moses, the man of God, as he prays: <em>“…let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us….”</em> What a prayer! He was talking about that divine aura on you as a child of God that produces excellence; a special beauty.</p>
<p>But thanks be unto God! That prayer has been answered in us. We’re His crowning beauty (James 1:18). There’s something about your life; you carry the glory of God everywhere you go, and that beauty brings pleasantness, favours, promotion and increase to your life.</p>
<p>Always be mindful that you’re dressed with the ornament of God’s beauty; drenched in the rains of the Spirit. He sent the prophet Isaiah to tell the children of Israel He’d give them beauty for ashes (Isaiah 61:3); ornaments of beauty.</p>
<p>Instead of allowing circumstances cause you to question the presence of God in your life, learn to see God’s beauty. Thank Him for your beautiful life. Never allow circumstances change who you really are. You’re God’s beauty, His icon, His express image, and the outshining of His glory. You radiate His splendour. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expression, “The everlasting Father” is often interpreted by many to mean “Father of eternity”; but that’s not what it means. Let’s review it in a way that’s easy to understand: imagine a young man whose father was a strong, powerful man. The young man depended much on him. Then his father died.</p>
<p>Now, following the vacuum and subsequent difficulties his father’s demise created, he laments, “If my dad were here, I know things would have been different; perhaps I won’t be going through all these. I know he’d have helped me, and counselled me; he’d have been there for me!”</p>
<p>Now, here’s what that young man needs to know: His father may be dead, but there’s One who’s always there; He’s your everlasting Father! You’re not going to miss Him, ever, because He’s alive and always with, and in, you by the Holy Spirit. His Name is Jesus!</p>
<p>You may say, “Life has been so difficult for me since I lost both parents and became an orphan”; don’t despair. Read the words of Jesus; He said, “<em>I will not leave you as orphans [comfortless, desolate, bereaved, forlorn, helpless]…”</em> (John 14:18 AMPC). You’re not fatherless; the Holy Spirit is the Father in you, and He’s your helper. He’s everything, and all the help you need in life.</p>
<p>Jesus said, <em>“…the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works”</em> (John 14:10). Like Jesus, you go everywhere with your Heavenly Father; He lives in you. This should be your consciousness always. You’re not alone; you’re in the Father, and the Father—your everlasting Father—is in you. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? (Luke 24:38).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many hardly take the time to review their own thinking process; how their minds work. A mind that’s not renewed with the Word will often come up with some of the weirdest thoughts. Such minds are filled with negativism.</p>
<p>For example, there’re people who always think that when a law or new policy is introduced, it’s to their disadvantage; they see themselves as victims all the time. Therefore, they carry the burden of mistrusting everybody, because that’s the way their minds work.</p>
<p>Even in Church, you could find a member who stops attending services because he thinks the Pastor’s sermon is usually about him. Meanwhile, someone else who heard the same sermons says, “I came to church and that day, the sermon was just about me. I mean I identified with everything the Pastor said, and have made up my mind to make improvements.”</p>
<p>Notice that one decided to stay in church and grow, while the other decided to leave the same church. It’s about their way of thinking. Your thoughts can keep you perpetually in the road of success or keep you in failure. It’s the reason we’re to keep renewing our minds with the Word of God (Romans 12:2).</p>
<p>Until you change your way of thinking, your life and circumstances won’t change. You’ve got to choose the character of your thoughts. Take charge of your thoughts. God gave us the ability to monitor our thoughts; to accept or reject the wrong thoughts. So, always, be sure that your thoughts are wholesome: <em>“Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things”</em> (Philippians 4:8 ESV).</p>

<p><em><strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a difference between your thinking process and your mindset. What’s a mindset? It’s a habitual or characteristic mental attitude that determines how you interpret and respond to situations.</p>
<p>Each one of us has a mindset, but the important thing is the origin of your mindset. The Word of God must frame and shape your mental attitude and disposition to life; otherwise, you’re sunk. Studying and meditating on the Word of God will give you a peculiar mindset; the mindset of the righteous.</p>
<p>Having the mindset of the righteous isn’t a gift; you have to develop it. You can’t pray and say, “I receive a mindset”; no, it doesn’t work that way. You have to suffuse and inundate yourself with the Word, studying and meditating on it daily. Then, you’d find that your thinking processes have been altered; your mental attitude and mental appreciation of things have improved. Whereas you used to think defeat, poverty, sickness, etc., you’d discover you’ve given up those thoughts of negativity, and received divine thoughts of love, victory, faith, dominion, health, and strength. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners (1 Corinthians 15:33).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word translated, “communications” above is the Greek “Homilia” and it has to do with such conversation or communion that’s coming from companionship; those you associate with. The effect, in the context of our opening verse, shows the importance of being mindful of your associations; those you listen to and relate with; they can corrupt your life.</p>
<p>When you study the verses preceding our theme verse, the Apostle Paul gives us the picture of certain people who had been teaching others that there isn’t going to be a resurrection. Listening to such false teachings, the Bible says, can give a corrupt mindset.</p>
<p>Don’t just listen to any preacher or teacher because they seem to be saying something religious. Don’t receive counsel from just anyone, neither should you read every book and listen to every preacher you see on TV. The Bible says to prove every doctrine; it’s the reason you must study and know the Scriptures for yourself, so you’re not tossed around by every wind of doctrine. Your behaviour, your life, would be greatly affected by their communication (Ephesians 4:14).</p>
<p>You may think the communication or information being passed to you is harmless. But it’s akin to somebody sowing the wrong seeds in your garden, while you simply look on. Those seeds would certainly grow. You may say, “I’m just listening or reading the book; I really don’t believe the message.” Don’t be deceived; they’re sowing seeds into your life that’ll reproduce.</p>
<p>Let the wisdom of God guide you in choosing your friends; those you move with; those who inspire you to greatness and excellence; those who inspire the best in you to fulfil God’s purpose for your life. If someone, whom you may even respect, tells you something you know isn’t consistent with the Word, reject it. Accept only that which is consistent with the word of righteousness in Christ Jesus.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (Mark 16:17-18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’d learn to use the Name of Jesus in your life, in everything you do, you’d be amazed at the victories and extraordinary blessings you’d experience every day. His Name is an instrument, a great blessing for us in the New Testament. The Word tells us to use the Name of Jesus in all things. Colossians 3:17 says, “<em>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.”</em> You couldn’t fail or lose in His Name! His Name is the key that unlocks every door!</p>
<p>What many have lacked is the consciousness of the power and authority of His Name. But thanks be unto God! The Church is marching on; knowledge is increasing, and many more are discovering who they are in Christ, and their place of glory and dominion in His Name.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:9-11 tells us that God gave Jesus the Name that’s above every name. He vested all authority in His Name and passed it into law in heaven, in earth and under the earth. Therefore, when you make demands in His Name, He sees to it that it happens (John 14:14).</p>
<p>When someone is sick in your home, don’t run helter-skelter, looking for help; take charge and declare, “In the Name of Jesus Christ, I rebuke the pain; I rebuke the affliction!” Mention the sickness and command it to go! He told us to heal the sick; so, it’s our responsibility to do it in His Name; and His Name never fails!</p>
<p>Even now, rebuke the infirmity. Declare that every storm is stilled in your home, office, school, or environment. Affirm that you’re in abundance and the lines are fallen unto you in pleasant places. Use His Name to effect the changes you desire and create blessings for yourself and others.</p>

<p><em><strong>For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring (Acts 17:28).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being born again, the Almighty God lives and walks in you, through the Holy Spirit. 2 Corinthians 6:16 says, <em>“And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”</em> This is neither an assumption nor a promise; you’re the temple of the living God; He lives and walks in you.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:16, the Apostle Paul asks, <em>“Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?”</em> The word translated, “temple” is the Greek word, “Naos,” which also means shrine; the shrine where the God-presence is. That’s who you are—God’s shrine; His mobile headquarters. Everywhere you go, He goes. When someone asks, “Is God in this place?” your answer should be an immediate “Yes” because He’s in you. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This is your guarantee of a life of greatness, dominion, excellence, health, and unending victories: Christ in you (Colossians 1:27)! Because He lives in you, you’re not trying to overcome; you’ve already overcome all things: Satan, the world, and its failing systems: <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”</em> (1 John 4:4). It’s about the greater One that lives in you. That’s the assurance that you’ll forever be successful, and walk in His glory.</p>

<p><em><strong>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth (John 4:24).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all things, it’s important to know God’s will and be sure you’re serving Him the way He wants, and not according to your own opinions or the ideas of men. He wants us to serve and worship Him according to His plans and purposes in His Word.</p>
<p>Recall the story of Cain and Abel. Abel brought to God the sacrifice that God demanded, while Cain brought the sacrifice he chose to give to God (Genesis 4:3-7); these are two different things.</p>
<p>In walking with God, you must follow His prescribed order. He said to Moses, <em>“…make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle…”</em> (Exodus 25:8-9). It always has to be according to His plan. Jesus said, <em>“God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth”</em> (John 4:24).</p>
<p>It’s clear how you’re to worship God: it’s by the Spirit and in accordance with His Word. To do it any other way would be to deviate from His plan. It’s like what happened when David needed to move the ark of God into the city of David. He got a new cart, and two men, Uzzah and Ahio rode in the cart together with the ark (2 Samuel 6:3).</p>
<p>As they journeyed, suddenly, the oxen pulling the cart stumbled and the cart shook. Uzzah tried to stop the ark from tipping over and when he did, he died instantly. David was terrified by what happened and in his quest for answers, he found out in the Scriptures that only the priests were qualified to carry or touch the ark of God in the Old Testament (1 Chronicles 15:2).</p>
<p>David realized the error and enlightened the people, saying to the priests, <em>“For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order”</em> (1 Chronicles 15:13).</p>
<p>God’s things are to be done God’s way; follow His plans and you’ll experience His grace and blessings in your life and ministry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name (Matthew 6:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Jesus walked the earth, He prayed on several occasions, and His prayers are recorded for us in the Scriptures. His disciples observed that He always had results when He prayed; and so, they said to Him, <em>“…Lord, teach us to pray…”</em> (Luke 11:1).</p>
<p>Thus, He gave them a format for prayer. He said, *“After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name” (*Matthew 6:9). Many Christians have misconstrued this to be “The Lord’s Prayer.” They insist it’s the prayer Jesus asked us to pray, and that we must pray so.</p>
<p>They further base their argument on Luke’s writing in Luke 11:2, which reads, <em>“And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heaven….”</em> What they fail to realize, however, is that the Greek word for “say” in the foregoing verse is “lego.” It doesn’t mean “to say something”; rather, it means to ‘systematically lay forth.’ Jesus laid forth a format or pattern for prayer for His disciples. He didn’t say we should quote or recite those words in prayer, which is what many do today.</p>
<p>The real Lord’s Prayer is in John 17; read the entire chapter and you’ll be so inspired. Moreover, this model for prayer that He gave His disciples was before He went to the Cross. He taught them to pray in expectation of the Kingdom of God. At that time, He hadn’t died for the whole world, and the world was still being dominated by another kingdom, which is the kingdom of darkness.</p>
<p>However, being born again, we’ve been delivered from the kingdom of darkness and translated into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son (Colossians 1:12-13). In this kingdom, we have our needs supplied according to His riches in glory. So, today, it doesn’t quite make spiritual sense to recite the words in Luke 11:2-4; it’s not a New Testament prayer. In the New Testament, prayer is based on our new relationship with the Father; a divine fellowship. This is what Jesus made possible. Now we pray through the Spirit and worship in the Spirit. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee (Isaiah 60:1-2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s so much evil, wickedness, and persecution in the world today, and many are troubled as a result. But it’s actually a fulfilment of the Scriptures; the Bible says, <em>“This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come”</em> (2 Timothy 3:1). The ensuing verses 2-5 enumerate some of the evil that’ll characterize these last days: <em>“People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—having a form of godliness but denying its power…”</em> (2 Timothy 3:2-5 NIV).</p>
<p>Now, while all these are happening, something even bigger will be taking place as well. The Bible says, <em>“For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light…”</em> (Isaiah 60:2-3).</p>
<p>Notice the underlined portion, and then recall what we read in our opening scripture. Irrespective of the darkness and evil in the world in these last days, you’re to shine ever so brightly.</p>
<p>He says, “...the Gentiles shall come to thy light”; this is much more than God’s light shining upon us, and His glory seen in us. Rather, it’s us bringing forth a new season; a new day. Think about it this way: when Jesus came, He brought forth the new creation; He raised sons of God; that was His purpose.</p>
<p>Then He said concerning us, <em>“Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid”</em> (Matthew 5:14). So, what’s happening is, while there’s darkness in the world, we’re not waiting for the light of God to shine; rather, we shine, for He’s made us His light in a dark world. How do you shine? It’s by acting out God’s Word; living out the Gospel; doing the works of God. Matthew 5:16, <em>“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”</em> Glory be to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me (John 14:30).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible teaches that demon spirits are real, and they can influence, torment and even possess anyone who gives them the chance. That’s the reason you must not give the devil room or opportunity in your life (Ephesians 4:27), and the way to ensure that is living in the light of God’s Word.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that you’re a church member, a pastor or senior minister; there’re no “no-go” areas for demons. They only bow to God’s Word. If the Word isn’t in you, that’s a slippery slope. God’s Word is light, and light repels darkness. The Bible admonishes that we walk in the light, as He is in the light. When you walk in the light of Christ, Satan has nothing in you. In our theme verse, Jesus said, <em>“…the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.”</em> It’s important that you check your life—you look into the mirror of God (His Word)—to examine yourself.</p>
<p>Anger, malice, bitterness, etc., are all from Satan, and if you have them in you, you’re giving him a foothold in your life: <em>“When angry, do not sin; do not ever let your wrath (your exasperation, your fury or indignation) last until the sun goes down. Leave no [such] room or foothold for the devil [give no opportunity to him]”</em> (Ephesians 4:26-27 AMPC).</p>
<p>Anger is a spirit; bitterness is a spirit; hatred is a spirit. These aren’t just emotions. Just as every part of God has His personality, every part of Satan has his personality. So, refuse to accommodate anything from the devil; rather, walk in the love of Christ; be gracious and kind. Yield your faculties—your entire being—to the Word, and to the Holy Spirit for the glory of God and life of righteousness to be seen and revealed in you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen (Mark 16:20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always, we tell people to preach the Word, because it’s an instruction from the Master. The Apostles preached the Word; Jesus Himself preached the Word. We’re mandated to preach the Word. However, that someone is preaching or talking about God doesn’t mean he’s preaching the Word. So, what is the Word?</p>
<p>The Word is that message from God that reveals or communicates His works, will, thoughts, plans, purposes and pursuit; to bring men into or promote fellowship with Him in love. It’s His message of truth with content and power to build His image into the life of the hearers. Its content is the embodiment of Christ’s revelations, provisions, perfections and instructions— profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction or training in righteousness.</p>
<p>This is what Jesus preached. He didn’t preach politics or His own opinion; He preached the Word. If the Word Himself would preach the Word, how much more should you and I? Being born again, you’re a minister of the Gospel; you’re called to voice God’s message; the Word is His message that reveals His works, will, purpose and character.</p>
<p>A true preacher of the Word is one who preaches God’s will, God’s thoughts, God’s plans, purposes and pursuits, and constantly brings men into fellowship with God or promote their fellowship with God. The more they listen to you, the more the image of Christ is revealed in them and to them. Glory to God! Be a true preacher of the Word.</p>

<p><em><strong>Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ (Colossians 2:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as we all have different mindsets, we all also have different world views. A world view is a comprehensive conception or apprehension of the world, especially from a specific standpoint. So, when we talk about your world view, it refers to your own appreciation, conceptualisation or apprehension of the world.</p>
<p>However, what’s more important is the origin of your world view. For a lot of people, their world view is formed by what they read or hear in the news media. They’ve never done a study in the Bible to know why certain things are happening in the world today, what the future holds, and what their stand should be.</p>
<p>For example, some Christians come up with political ideologies and inclinations that are not Word-based. There’s nothing wrong with having political inclinations as a Christian, but they must be of spiritual influence or origin. Many think the Bible has nothing to say about politics, but they’re wrong.</p>
<p>God gave us His Word to show us what our political inclinations should be, what views we should hold. His Word is given to guide us, to give us understanding and point us in the right direction in all things.</p>
<p>Live and see from God’s perspective only. His Word is light; the light in which you must live. That way, irrespective of the decadence in this present world, you’ll live in continuous victory and prosperity, and joy, because you’re living from the mountain top. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King. God is known in her palaces for a refuge (Psalm 48:2-3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scripture above is a popular song among Christians. The underlined portion says, “God is known in her palaces for a refuge.” In the citadels of Israel, God is known to grant refuge to His own. The citadels are strongholds of protection in times of war, but the people trust in the power of God, and not the high or thick walls, as their defence.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty”</em> (Psalm 91:1 NKJV). The secret place of the Most High isn’t a building or temple built with hands; it’s Christ, and that’s where you live. He’s your protection. The Bible says your life is hid with Christ in God (Colossians 3:3), which means you have twenty-four-hour protection! It’s round the clock. You’re protected in Him, because He’s become your citadel in which you live. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The presence of God, and His light where you live, is a high place—far above all the evil and darkness in the world. Therefore, walk through life with boldness, knowing that no weapon fashioned against you shall prosper. You have God’s mighty protection. This was David’s confidence when he declared, <em>“He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday”</em> (Psalm 91:4-6).</p>
<p>Never find yourself apologetic, intimidated or reluctant to express your convictions about Christ and the message of the Gospel. Be mindful of your divine protection in Him. The Bible says, <em>“As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever”</em> (Psalm 125:2).</p>
<p>Nothing and no one should prevent or keep you from proclaiming Jesus as Lord, for He’s greater than any government, institution or mob. He rules and reigns over the universe! Glory to His Name forever!</p>

<p><em><strong>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the original Hebrew rendering of the underlined portion of the scripture above, there’s no punctuation between the words “Wonderful” and “Counsellor.” Moreover, the Hebrew word translated “wonderful” actually means mighty acts and deeds; miraculous works that cause wonder.</p>
<p>Also, the word, “Counsellor” in the Hebrew, doesn’t mean someone who’s giving you a piece of advice; it refers to one who counsels you for battle; a strategist. It thus refers to the Holy Spirit being our extraordinary strategist! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter where you are in your life today or what’s in front of you; you can always know what to do to win, if you’d consult the extraordinary strategist. He lives in you. This is what makes us invincible! How can you fail when the extraordinary strategist lives in you! You only need to take advantage of His presence and ministry in your life.</p>
<p>Another interesting phrase in our opening scripture is, “The mighty God”; EL GIBBOR, and this is talking about His greatness, His superior Almightiness! In Jeremiah 32:27, He said, <em>“Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?”</em> Absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>It makes no difference how hopeless the situation may seem; He knows what to do. He’s never confused, even when you seem flustered. He knows the way out of every crisis you face. He knows how to make you a success. He has the best strategies for your business, your job, your ministry, and your finances. All you need is to depend on Him for direction. Follow His Word and the counsel He gives you from within.</p>

<p><em><strong>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body (1 Corinthians 11:29).</strong></em></p>
<p>When people don’t understand the reality of the Word of God, they go into errors and as a result, their lives are in jeopardy. In Matthew 22:29, Jesus said, <em>“You err, because you don’t know the Scriptures and the power of God.”</em></p>
<p>Take our opening verse for example; it reveals something striking about the Holy Communion: the wine isn’t just a drink; it’s the communion of the blood of Christ, just as the bread represents His body. To drive this point home, the Apostle Paul said, <em>“…the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils (demons)”</em> (1 Corinthians 10:20).</p>
<p>When the Gentiles offer sacrifices to idols, they’re actually offering them to demons. This means that those sacrifices are connected to demons. Anyone who partakes of those sacrifices in any way, comes into fellowship with demons, and some have attracted demons to themselves that way. Some people have become sick as a result, and even mentally troubled, unable to do anything for themselves.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Bible says when we take the cup and eat the bread, we’re in fellowship with God. Blessed be God! 1 Corinthians 11:26 tells us categorically that taking the Communion is participating in the blood, and body of Christ. It’s the reason we’re admonished to discern the Lord’s body; be mindful of its power and significance. Many have trouble today in their physical body, while some have even died, for not discerning the Lord’s body.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 11:30 says, “<em>For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.”</em> What cause is the Spirit referring to? It’s the failure to discern the body of Christ. Therefore, examine yourself and relate properly to the Church of God. Don’t treat the local church carelessly or with disdain. Walk in love always, and honour God’s people.</p>

<p><em><strong>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ (Ephesians 4:11-12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From our theme verse, it’s clear that it’s God who appoints or calls people into these ministry offices. You don’t just look at yourself and say, “What gift do I have?” and then apportion a name for yourself. It doesn’t work like that.</p>
<p>Back then, as we were growing up as spiritual adolescents, there were those who thought they had a ministry. I remember some who were called prophets, and some apostles; they distributed among themselves one office or the other. But some of those people today aren’t even Christians anymore; they left the faith years ago.</p>
<p>What they needed to understand was, there’s a growth to this thing. Even Paul who was called to be an apostle didn’t start out as an apostle. The Bible says there were certain prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch, and Paul (who was also called Saul) was named as one of them (Acts 13:1). He wasn’t yet called an apostle, even though he was called into the apostolic ministry.</p>
<p>The callings are at different levels. At a certain level of your life, it’s being formed, but don’t go faster than the Lord would want you to. The Bible says, <em>“And no man taketh this honour unto himself…”</em> (Hebrews 5:4). Don’t take the honour upon yourself. After all, does it matter if people don’t call you by the title you love? Isn’t it better to just do the work? It makes more sense, because if they call you by the title and then you don’t fulfil it, that’s not a good thing.</p>
<p>It’s not right to be respected for something you’re not. Never let such things bother you. What matters to God is the state of your heart; not the title by which you’re addressed. Greatness isn’t in your title or in the recognition you enjoy from men; it’s in the quality of your personality; who you are with God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom (Psalm 90:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Bible, God shows us it’s important to plan. If you read in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, you’d see that God numbered days; He gave numbers to certain days.</p>
<p>For example, in Numbers 1:1, God fixed <em>“...the first day of the second month, in the second year...”</em> while instructing the children of Israel on their departure from Egypt. Having plans for special days was normal with God. In our opening verse, Moses wanted God to teach us how to do it; so he said, <em>“...teach us to number our days….”</em> He didn’t say, “Teach us to count our days.” The word “number” there is an accounting word. It means that you’re accounting for the days; you’re scheduling or organizing your days. For example, you say, “On the 25th of January, 2020, I’m going to do such and such.” That’s planning or scheduling.</p>
<p>Some people don’t plan their days. Many have regrets about their lives because they wasted time doing insignificant things. I remember the prayer of a dear minister years ago, who said, “Lord, you know I only have one life to live; don’t let me waste it; help me live it for you.” What a prayer!</p>
<p>It ought to be your conscious thought that you have only one life to live. Time is an asset, which you must learn to invest wisely. Investing your time wisely means investing your time in spiritual things. Remember, the Word declares: <em>“...To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace”</em> (Romans 8:6).</p>
<p>Make every day count, by doing only those things that’ll advance the Kingdom of God, and improve your life. As you study the Word and fellowship with the Holy Spirit, He’ll tell you the things He wants you to do, how He wants them done, and when you should do them.</p>

<p><em><strong>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and  meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work (2 Timothy 2:21).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work (2 Timothy 2:21).</strong></em></p>
<p>Being a Christian, you’ve been commissioned to preach the Gospel; to take the message of God’s saving power to your world and beyond. The Bible says you’ve been enriched by Him in all utterance (1 Corinthians 1:5), letting you know that you’re equipped for the job. Nevertheless, as a preacher or one ordained to bear His message of divine life, the way you deliver it has a lot to do with the quality of your personality, such that the result is either positive or negative, impactful or unimpactful.</p>
<p>Our opening scripture says, <em>“If a man therefore purge (sanctify) himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour….”</em> To be “sanctified” means to be separated or set apart unto God for His sacred use. It begins with the sanctification of the messenger; sanctifying the vessel. If the heart and mind of the one who bears the message aren’t renewed and purified by the Word, it doesn’t matter what message he’s carrying; it’s corrupted. Soon enough what influences his personality will come to the fore, and the Christ-nature will be hidden behind the “ugly” frame.</p>
<p>This is why you must be fully yielded to the Word of God to mould your life and character. None of us was made for “dishonour”; each one of us has been raised for His glory, but you can decide if you’re going to be a vessel of honour or a vessel of dishonour, by the kind of life that you live.</p>
<p>But thanks be unto God! He’s granted each of us the ability to lead a life of righteousness and true holiness, and qualified us to be effective ministers of the Gospel of His grace: <em>“[It is He] Who has qualified us [making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient] as ministers and dispensers of a new covenant [of salvation through Christ], not [ministers] of the letter (of legally written code) but of the Spirit; for the code [of the Law] kills, but the [Holy] Spirit makes alive”</em> (2 Corinthians 3:6 AMPC). Therefore, live up to your calling.</p>

<p><em><strong>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How wonderful this is! Jesus is our Prince of Peace; the champion of peace. You can’t find peace anywhere else, no matter how you try, except in Christ Jesus. In John 14:27, He said, <em>“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”</em></p>
<p>The foregoing words of Jesus are just so comforting! He makes it clear that under no circumstances should you allow your heart be troubled, because He’s filled your life with His peace. He wasn’t just referring to the peace of being quiet from disturbance, but peace without agitation, full of rest and prosperity; dominion over the crises of life!</p>
<p>Notice He didn’t say, “my peace I will give unto you” No! He said, <em>“My peace I give unto you.”</em> You have His peace now. You have what the governments of this world can’t provide; not even your family and friends can give you lasting peace, happiness, and joy; only Jesus.</p>
<p>In your life, no matter what happens, be unperturbed; be full of confidence, because the Champion of Peace is in your life. Remember what He did to the raging, tempestuous sea? He hushed it to sleep. There’s no crisis in your life that’s beyond Him.</p>
<p>Don’t be flustered by whatever may be going on around you; you have the peace of Jesus Christ in your heart. Irrespective of the turmoil, speak forth His Word, and there’ll be “a great calm.” Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…the common people heard him gladly (Mark 12:37).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way the Lord Jesus preached and taught the Word is so inspiring and intriguing. He communicated the Gospel so simply. Our opening verse says the common people heard Him gladly. The word, “heard” doesn’t just mean to hear sound; rather, it means to understand the meaning of the sound.</p>
<p>You may preach what you might call an erudite sermon, but if those to whom you preach or minister can’t understand what you’re saying, then you’ve really not communicated effectively. T.L. Osborn once said, “When you teach, if the people haven’t learnt, you haven’t taught.” How true!</p>
<p>Preach and teach the Gospel with clarity. Take a cue from the Master; large crowds stormed His meetings and yearned to hear His beautiful, Spirit-filled words. They came, and kept coming, because they understood His words. Mark 8 reports how an immense crowd gathered to hear Him speak for three days. On another occasion, He prepped His disciples to have a boat in readiness for Him in case He was crowded off the beach, so He could preach to the people from the boat (Mark 3:9). How they loved His words!</p>
<p>His messages were neither vague nor laden with confusing thoughts. Even some of His detractors acknowledged that no one ever spoke like Him (John 7:46). He knew the category of people that thronged His meetings, and He gave the precise illustrations that drove home His point.</p>
<p>Once, as He walked by the sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother who were fishermen, and said to them, <em>“…Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men”</em> (Mark 1:17). His illustration was apt; something they could easily relate with.</p>
<p>The same should be said of you as you preach, teach or express the truths of the Gospel. Don’t use ambiguous, incomprehensible words; preach with clarity. This was something on the heart of Paul the Apostle. He desired to preach the message with clarity. In Colossians 4:4 (NLT), he said, <em>“Pray that I will proclaim this message as clearly as I should.”</em> What a desire! Have this in mind always.</p>

<p><em><strong>For I never shrank or kept back or fell short from declaring to you the whole purpose and plan and counsel of God (Acts 20:27 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 Samuel 8, we read about the children of Israel asking Samuel to appoint a king to lead them like other nations. The prophet, obviously displeased at their request, took it before the Lord. Then the Lord said to Samuel, <em>“…Hearken unto their voice and appoint them a king…”</em> (1 Samuel 8:22 AMPC).</p>
<p>Even though the prophet Samuel wasn’t comfortable with their request, he told the children of Israel exactly what the Lord had said, not his own opinion. Thereafter, the Lord appointed Saul to be king over Israel. Samuel knew it was the Lord who called the shots; so he quickly executed the Lord’s directives in appointing Saul to be king (1 Samuel 10:1).</p>
<p>That’s the right attitude for every true messenger of Christ; you follow the Lord and His Word, not your emotions or opinions. As long as God has given the Word, you ought to say, “Yes Sir,” because He’s the Boss. It’s not about you, it’s about Him; you voice His will, plans and purpose, not yours or anyone else’s.</p>
<p>Irrespective of your opinions, the Word of God is forever true! So, if the Word says it, you’re going to have to do it, even if it doesn’t align with your culture. We’re God’s messengers; we preach for God, not for ourselves.</p>
<p>1 Peter 4:11 (NKJV) says, <em>“If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God. If anyone ministers, let him do it as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.”</em> Consciously train yourself to think like Him. Train yourself to speak His Word, not your ideas. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many aren’t as effective as they should be in their faith-walk with God, because they have a different mindset from the Word of God. The Word of God is given to us to mould and shape our character; to culture our lives.</p>
<p>There’re some today who stir up arguments about how Bible instructions are outdated, and how irrelevant the Scriptures are today. What a terrible way to think! The Bible is, and will always be relevant. That’s because the Word of God transcends everything, including every human culture. The Word gives you the Kingdom culture; the Kingdom lifestyle.</p>
<p>Christianity isn’t a way of life, but surely produces a way of life. It shows you how to build Kingdom-consciousness. God’s Word, studied meditatively, will definitely help anyone imbibe a way of life that’s different from the rest of the world; a Christ-consciousness. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>If you’re still moulded by the ideologies of academic professors, your life will be in jeopardy. Get into the Scriptures and begin to study meditatively, asking the Holy Spirit to guide you and grant you insight and understanding. I’m not talking about merely leafing through the pages from Genesis to Revelation just like the religious scholars who only taught maxims, and didn’t have the Word in their spirit. That won’t do you much good.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 3:6 says, <em>“…the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”</em> When the Word is in your spirit, it would produce in you the Kingdom culture. This is important for you as a Christian, otherwise, you’d be a “hybrid.” By that, I mean even though you’re born into a glorious spiritual kingdom, and have the life and nature of God, your mentality and way of life will be like those of the world.</p>
<p>Our Kingdom is a real Kingdom which exists now. It’s a Kingdom that has a King, and principles to live by. So, there’s a culture in this Kingdom. As you study the Scriptures, you consciously learn the way of life; the culture of the Kingdom of God. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God (Revelation 19:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often, when a sinner is led to Christ, some say there’s a great party in heaven, because of what Jesus said in Luke 15:10: <em>“…there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.”</em> Even though the Bible doesn’t quite say there’s a party in heaven when a sinner comes to Christ, it does talk about a great party in heaven that we’re all going to be a part of; it’s the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.</p>
<p>We’re going for a party in heaven. Don’t you like that? And it’s going to be the party of all parties! So, all those who think heaven will be a boring place are misguided; they’re not thinking right. Read the Bible! Papa God is organising a big party and we’re coming from every generation for the massive celebration. We’re not going to heaven, panting and saying, “Thank God; we barely made it!” No; we’re going to be “high-fiving” ourselves, excited in ways words can’t describe as we’re celebrated by the Father and the holy angels.</p>
<p>It’s the reason we’re preaching and teaching God’s Word all around the world, so many more can be reached and brought in for this great jamboree in God’s presence; a shindig of praise, worship and adoration. Read it in the prophetic words of John in Revelation 19:6*: “And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.”* Glory to God!</p>
<p>Are you getting ready for the party? Our work and labour of love aren’t in vain; whatever you’re doing for the Lord, keep at it. Put your whole life into it, because we’re going to be rewarded and crowned. Everything you do or sacrifice for the sake of the Gospel is being recorded, and on that day, besides the blessings you’ve received and enjoyed on earth, He’ll say to you, <em>“...Well done, thou good and faithful servant...”</em> (Matthew 25:21).</p>

<p><em><strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our opening verse is a strong admonition for us to distinguish ourselves as God’s people and live an excellent life. Don’t live like the rest of the world; follow Christ.</p>
<p>There’re people who inherit bondage and darkness; they’re going to go in the same direction as their natural parents, towing the same line of anger. But if you’re born again, never allow such in your life. Tell yourself, “I’m a new creature in Christ; anger has no place in me.”</p>
<p>If as a Christian, you find that people say you took after your grandfather in certain uncomplimentary behaviours, don’t just shove it aside. Consciously use the Word of God to culture and reprogramme yourself. Remember, in Matthew 23:30, the people said they’d never be like their fathers who did wicked things; but Jesus said to them*, “Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city”* (Matthew 23:34).</p>
<p>They didn’t believe the words of Jesus, but they did exactly the same thing their fathers did. But thanks be unto God! Through the Word of God, our minds can be transformed to go in the way of Christ; the right direction only.</p>
<p>Stay focused on the Word. You have a responsibility now that you’re born again to make sure your life is as the Word says. Let the Word have dominion over your mind, your spirit, your thoughts, and over your opinions.</p>
