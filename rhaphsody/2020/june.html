<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned (Matthew 12:37).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A major reason some Christians have never really enjoyed the spiritual splendour and glory of Christianity is that they’ve never truly understood the importance of words. Even though they’ve been born again for long, they’ve struggled for the most part. Some eventually give up after many years of struggling to live the Christian life because they don’t understand the foundational principle of the Christian life. It’s about words!</p>
<p>We function in the realities of the new creation through words. This is the spiritual principle that makes salvation possible in the first place: “<em>That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation”</em> (Romans 10:9-10).</p>
<p>Our salvation is only activated when we vocalize our faith in the Lordship of Jesus. Salvation is the beginning of all the blessings in Christ; and if this principle works for salvation, it’ll work for everything else in Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, during His earthly ministry, was an absolute success because He spoke the Father’s words and lived in them. In John 12:49, He said, “<em>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.”</em> Hebrews 13:5-6 makes reference to the same principle. It says, <em>“Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.”</em></p>
<p>The foregoing scriptures imply that our confessions should be in accordance with the Word of God, because we’re children of the Word. We live by words. Recall the words of Jesus in our opening verse: <em>“For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”</em> It’s about your words: the right words coming out of your lips.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith (1 John 5:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s so much negative information in the world today and this has instilled fear in the hearts of those who aren’t rooted and grounded in the Word. These may indeed be perilous times, but the Lord Jesus referred to this in Luke 21:25-26 in describing some of the signs of the end of the age. He said, <em>“...There shall be...distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth....”</em></p>
<p>In Luke 18:8, He asked a thought-provoking question: <em>“...when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?”</em> You’re to stand your ground in faith, irrespective of the circumstances around you, and happenings in the world today.</p>
<p>The Word says in Ephesians 6:16, <em>“Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.”</em> With your shield of faith, you have the ability to neutralize ALL (not some) of the fiery darts of the enemy. The Lord Jesus already destroyed the works of the devil (1 John 3:8). He paralyzed Satan, demolished his works, and made an open spectacle of him and his demons in hell (Colossians 2:15).</p>
<p>Today, Satan and the powers of darkness are under your feet; therefore, you have nothing to fear. Irrespective of what happens around you, speak the Word in faith.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and IF THEY DRINK ANY DEADLY THING, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (Mark 16:17-18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above scripture is extraordinary; it reveals something striking about you—the Christian— the new creation: you’re superior to sickness, disease, and infirmities. You have a life that can’t be infected by any disease pathogen. You can’t be poisoned or destroyed. It makes no difference that you were told that a certain poison or virus has gotten into your system; it shall have no power over you. In Luke 10:19, Jesus said, “<em>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”</em> This is either true or false, but thank God it’s true!</p>
<p>Live with the consciousness that you’re a partaker of the divine nature. Don’t join the bandwagon of those who are flustered and rattled by the spread of infectious diseases; the life in you is divine; it’s not sustained by blood but by the Spirit of God who lives inside you: <em>“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you”</em> (Romans 8:11).</p>
<p>The foregoing verse isn’t a promise but a vital reality now that the Holy Spirit lives in you: He’s the life of your physical body. Maybe you’ve even been diagnosed with an incurable disease as you read this; declare the Word until the divine life in you gains the ascendancy. With faith in your heart, keep affirming, “The same Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead lives in me and has invigorated my physical body. I have the life of God in me; that life destroys sickness and disease. I walk in divine health. I refuse to be sick!”</p>
<p>Christians are people who have come from death. They’re a different breed. That’s why the Bible says, <em>“But ye are a chosen generation…”</em> (1 Peter 2:9). The word “generation” is the same word for “breed.” You’re a special breed, superior to anything that’s of the devil.</p>
<p>Take charge of your life from the realm of the spirit and subdue your world and your environment. Even now, declare that you live victoriously through the Word, and by the Spirit, over and above sickness, disease and death. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak (2 Corinthians 4:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 3:1 admonishes that in the last days, perilous times shall come. Nevertheless, Romans 8:35-37 lets us know that in spite of the tribulation, distress, famine, peril, and pandemics that would characterise the signs of the end of the age, you have nothing to fear. This is because you’re more than a conqueror: <em>“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword...Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us”</em> (Romans 8:35-37).</p>
<p>What you need is to hold on to God’s Word; know and have it in your consciousness and establish it through speaking. The power is in affirmation. For example, the Word says, <em>“No weapon fashioned against you shall prosper”</em> (Isaiah 54:17). Jesus said in Luke 10:19, <em>“...nothing shall by any means hurt you.”</em> Then in John 16:33, He also said, <em>“These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”</em> Believe and affirm these truths.</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t overcome the world for Himself but for you. He overcame the world and all the evil, darkness and negativities therein, and gave you the victory. What you’re required to do now is to establish and maintain that victory in your life with your faith-filled confessions.</p>
<p>He said in Mark 11:23, <em>“…whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.”</em> The Word of God in your mouth is a creative force. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building (1 Corinthians 3:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the things that must be paramount to you in life is being an active part of God’s agenda, promoting the Gospel and seeing to it that the knowledge of salvation covers the earth as the waters cover the sea. This should be your driving force and purpose in everything you do.</p>
<p>The reason you’re in that business or working in that company or organization is so God can use you in that “chariot” to transform lives and be a blessing in your world. That’s our main purpose for being in the earth; otherwise, immediately after you’re born again, the Lord would have taken you to heaven. But He left you in the earth to carry out His purpose, to take His message to others while you develop character and spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>Have a plan for the Gospel, for you’re the Lord’s partner in spreading the good news of His saving power around the world; you’re His co-labourer (1 Corinthians 3:9). A dispensation of the Gospel has been committed to your trust. This was what made Paul say, <em>“…necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel”</em> (1 Corinthians 9:16). </p>
<p>You’re Christ’s ambassador, His minister of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:19). Live with this consciousness—winning souls and changing lives around the world. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed (John 6:55).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re those who are always crying to God to “quench their thirst” and fill them afresh. They misunderstand the words of Jesus in John 7:37, where He said, “<em>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.”</em> This doesn’t mean that when you’re “thirsty” for God, you go to Jesus.</p>
<p>Also, don’t be confused by what the Spirit penned through Paul in 1 Corinthians 10:4, saying, <em>“And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.”</em> In the Old Testament, they drank water from the rock, and that rock was Christ. Today, you don’t need to “go” to Jesus anymore to get that drink; you’re in Him, and He’s in you! He said, <em>“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water”</em> (John 7:38).</p>
<p>What did He mean by “rivers of living water”? The 39th verse explains it. It says, “(<em>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified</em>).” This water is the Holy Spirit. 1 Corinthians 12:13 NIV says, <em>“For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.”</em> In other words, when you received the Holy Spirit, you got the drink of the Spirit. He’s quenched your thirst!</p>
<p>We don’t cry to God to fill us when we think we’re thirsty; we get ourselves filled with the Spirit; and the Word shows us how: <em>“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs</em>(songs of the spirit; singing in the spirit)<em>, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord”</em> (Ephesians 5:18-19). This is the way to stay perpetually filled and drenched in the Holy Ghost! It’s by ministering to yourself in the spirit—singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life (John 6:63).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over the years, many scientists have experimented with words, trying to understand the effect they have on natural things. A certain researcher grew two plants of the same kind, under identical conditions. Then he decided to speak words of love and kindness to one, while he spoke words of hate and abuse to the other.</p>
<p>Every day, he subjected the plants to this constant barrage of words, and a few weeks later, he noticed the plant he’d been speaking to nicely grew luxuriantly, but the other plant became frail. He continued with the same pattern of speaking and, eventually, the plant receiving positive words bloomed, but the other one being pelted with negative words withered away.</p>
<p>If you’re going to live the glorious life that God has planned for you to live, you must learn to speak the right words. Whether you flourish or fail, live or die, depends on your words. You’re created in the image and likeness of God; you look like Him, and function like Him. That means, like Him, your words are spirit and they’re life; they produce the message they bear or communicate.</p>
<p>Everything in creation responds to spoken words. If a book got completely burnt, for example, it doesn’t cease to exist. It simply transmogrifies from a compressed form to an expanded form. And though it’s no longer visible to the optical eye, its particles still exist, with specific sound codes in them. If you could release the appropriate codes through your words, you could recall the seemingly varnished particles and bring back the material into its compressed, tangible form.</p>
<p>This lets you know you can talk to anything, no matter how dead, and bring it back to a blossoming state. You can make progress from glory to glory and flourish evermore through the words that you speak, for your life is the result of your words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him (1 John 2:15).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a type of spirit that many Christians are oblivious of, and the Bible talks about it in 1 Corinthians 2:12; it’s “the spirit of the world”: <em>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.”</em> This spirit is responsible for worldliness amongst Christians. That’s the spirit that tries to set trends—the trends of the world.</p>
<p>When Christians aren’t careful, they find themselves moving with those trends of the world; what the world says, how things are done, not realising they’re being swayed by the spirit of the world into worldliness. We can use certain things in the world without following what the Bible calls “The fashion of this world” that passes away (1 Corinthians 7:31).</p>
<p>The fashion of this world refers to the trend of this world, and it’s under the spirit of the world. Remember that Satan is the god of this world’s system. So, when our theme verse says, <em>“Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world…,”</em> that’s what it’s talking about. Refuse to be controlled or influenced by the systems of this present world. Jesus said you’re in the world, but not of the world. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Some people today are drifting; they’re born again, but they’ve been conquered by the world. They don’t have the Gospel-motive. Your motivation in life should and must be Christ Jesus and the purpose for which He died. Don’t let your focus be on the transient things of this failing world, for none of its so-called “trends” can give you true joy.</p>
<p>Paul said in Galatians 6:14, <em>“But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.”</em> This is the attitude that you must have.</p>

<p><em><strong>I pray that Christ may make His home in your hearts through your faith; so that having your roots deep and your foundations strong, in love, you may become mighty to grasp the idea (Ephesians 3:17 WNT).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result of ignorance of the Word, some Christians sing certain songs that aren’t consistent with the New Testament. For example, some would sing, “Holy Spirit, fall afresh on me.” That doesn’t make any sense, because the Holy Spirit lives in you. He’s not in heaven; so, where is He going to “fall” from?</p>
<p>They could sing such a song and get so emotional and cry, thinking they’re getting blessed. But the truth is, they’re not really getting blessed; rather, such songs create a certain kind of unbelief that’s difficult to cure, resulting in their faith getting weaker and more and more ineffective.</p>
<p>How could a Christian be asking the Holy Spirit to fall afresh on him when the Holy Spirit is with us and in us forever? Jesus said, <em>“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever”</em> (John 14:16). Since the Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost, He hasn’t gone back, and He’ll never leave us. It’s a painful thing in the body of Christ to see God’s children in search of what they already have.</p>
<p>This isn’t unconnected with the reason for the Apostle Paul’s prayer in our theme verse: “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith….” “Wasn’t Christ already dwelling in their hearts?” you may wonder. Yes, you’d notice he didn’t say, “Our hearts”; he was praying for the spiritually immature in Christ.</p>
<p>That’s how we pray for young converts, because they haven’t recognized the indwelling Christ. Sadly, many, including those who have been Christians for a long time, still require this prayer today because they haven’t recognized the indwelling Christ. They’re still in search of what’s right inside them. They want something to come from Heaven; yet, everything they could ever ask for has been granted them (2 Peter 1:3). Colossians 1:27 says, <em>“Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</em> Recognize Him in you. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life (Proverbs 4:23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Word is so important. With the Word, you’ll build your life; you’ll build your spirit; you’ll build real success within you, because success starts first from the human spirit. If you have it inside you, no circumstance in life can take it away from you. But if you don’t have it in you, your life will depend on circumstances, and circumstantial success isn’t true success.</p>
<p>This has happened to far too many people. Their lives depend on how good things are in their country, in their finances, in their job, in their place of work, etc. And so, you have a lot of people drifting around, looking for some greener pastures. But that shouldn’t be you. Success is built into your spirit. You’re the seed of Abraham; that means your life’s journey should be in one direction only: upward and forward.</p>
<p>Your success is independent of circumstances. That’s how God designed it, because He Himself is independent of circumstances. You’re born in His image and likeness. The nature He’s given you is one of ever-increasing glory and greatness; always making progress. This has to be your mindset; otherwise, you’ll be like everyone else whose life is dependent on circumstances; who keeps praying that things will be all right.</p>
<p>But a child of God who understands the Word doesn’t live like that; he brings forth success from within. The Bible says from your heart are the issues of life (Proverbs 4:23). The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 12:35, <em>“A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things….”</em> Success and all the good things of life are in you; bring them forth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you, I speak not from myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works (John 14:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the active agent of the Godhead; He’s the power of God; He carries out the acts of God. Man was created and formed by the Holy Spirit; everything God does outside of His throne is done by the Holy Spirit. Nothing works without the Holy Spirit; there’s no life without Him.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, in the days of His earthly ministry, did nothing without the Holy Spirit. In our opening verse, He identifies the Holy Spirit as the Father that dwells in Him and does the work. That’s a fact to recognize in your life as a Christian.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in your life is your key to extraordinary and absolute success. None of those who walked with Him as revealed in the Scriptures were ever defeated; none was a failure. Everyone who received Him gained the mastery and became the champion. Many in the Church today need to know for sure who the Holy Spirit is and His ministry in their lives. He is Himself, God.</p>
<p>If you were to carry out any task for the Lord in your local Church, for example, until and unless you execute it by the power of the Spirit, there’ll be no impact. You can further understand Paul’s submission in Colossians 1:29 in describing his total dependence on the power of the Spirit for effective ministry work. He said, <em>“Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.”</em> It should and must be the same for every one of us.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “<em>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure”</em> (Philippians 2:13); that’s referring to the Holy Spirit. You can’t do God’s work or even live the Christian life without the Holy Spirit. Zechariah 4:6 says, <em>“…Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.”</em> It’s for the same reason that He wants us perpetually filled with the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:18). The Holy Spirit is God at work in you, building you, and building others through you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it (1 Peter 3:10-11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God’s plan for you is that you live a glorious life, happy and excited every day, irrespective of the happenings around you. This takes living by the Word. The Word of God unveils the fundamental principles of success that you can act upon for a God-centred fulfilling life.</p>
<p>For example, our opening scripture is very instructive on how to have a blissful life. In The Living Bible translation, it reads, <em>“If you want a happy, good life, keep control of your tongue, and guard your lips from telling lies. Turn away from evil and do good. Try to live in peace even if you must run after it to catch and hold it”</em> (1 Peter 3:10-11).</p>
<p>The admonition is clear: do you want a wonderful life? It’s up to you! Eschew evil and do good; live peaceably with all men. Practise this. God is giving you the recipe for a successful life, a life that’s filled with joy and good things.</p>
<p>Your life will be beautiful, fulfilling, inspiring and excellent if you’d live by the Word. His Word is so simple, yet has the power to produce what it says. It’s your instruction manual for life, the light that guides you in righteousness, glory and victory. 1 Thessalonians 5:16 says, <em>“Rejoice evermore.”</em> Put this to work in your life. Be full of joy always, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Do all things without murmurings and disputings: That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain (Philippians 2:14-16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the underlined portion of our theme scripture: “Holding forth the word of life”; in holding forth the Word of life, you’re presenting Jesus to the world, for He is the living, incarnate Word and He is life. Your life continually reflects Jesus as you meditate on His Word and live it daily.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 3:18 says, <em>“But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”</em> As you look into God’s mirror (His Word), where the beauty of Christ is expressed, you’re transfigured into the same image of glory that you see in the Word. Then you discover that you’re not the weak, struggling person that you thought you were; you’re not the fearful, vengeful or arrogant person that others had described. You’re the glory of God. Christ is your beauty, wisdom and righteousness. You’re the effulgence of His glory as He (Christ Jesus) is the effulgence of the Father’s glory, for as He is, so are you, in this world (1 John 4:17).</p>
<p>This is why it’s important that you meditate on the Word. The Word reveals your origin, identity and inheritance in Christ. Make studying God’s Word part of your conscious routine, not something you do casually. It’ll build your faith and help you grow in grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world (John 16:33).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine you were on a flight that was experiencing some turbulence and you were beginning to get worried. Then you heard the captain say, “Please be informed there’s some turbulence in the air, but it’s not a problem at all. So, sit back and relax; we’re fine.” You’re most certainly going to feel a sudden calm; the anxiety will disappear. Why? The captain says the turbulence doesn’t matter!</p>
<p>This is the kind of assurance we have from Jesus in our theme verse. He said, <em>“…be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”</em> Such powerful, comforting and uplifting words! In the midst of the trials, temptations, troubles; in the midst of the persecution and hatred, He wants you to be of good cheer, because everything is going to be all right. Never allow sadness and unhappiness in your life as a result of whatever you may be going through. You’re a victor in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Even when things don’t seem to be going right, be unflustered. The Word says, <em>“Count it all joy when you go through diverse tests”</em> (James 1:2). That challenging situation is for your promotion and testimony. You live on the mountaintop, because you’re seated together with Christ in the place of glory and dominion. Therefore, when you face distressing situations, turbulent times, live above them.</p>
<p>Christ has made us masters over circumstances. Now He wants you to display extraordinary courage in fulfilling His dream for you. Philippians 4:6 says, <em>“Do not be anxious about anything…”</em>(NIV). It makes no difference what’s going on; don’t lose your cool! It’s been written about you already that you won:  <em>“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith”</em> (1 John 5:4). Cheer up, for your future is greater than your past. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full (John 10:10 NIV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as divine health, prosperity, forgiveness, justification, sanctification and righteousness aren’t promises from God for the new creation, even so is eternal life not a promise! Eternal life isn’t life in heaven or life you receive when you get to heaven; it’s in you now.</p>
<p>Jesus would never have needed to come if all there is to eternal life is going to heaven. After all, Enoch went to heaven before Jesus came (Genesis 5:24). Also, Jesus said God isn’t the God of the dead, but of the living; He’s called the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Read Luke 20:37-38); meaning that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are alive and in heaven.</p>
<p>Even Elijah was carried to heaven with a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11); he didn’t need Jesus to have come first. This proves that eternal life isn’t about living endlessly in heaven. Jesus didn’t come to give us something that was already available; He was the manifestation of the life which God promised before the world began. God’s plan for man was to live like God, live in His image, live as His reflection in this world. But man lost out on God’s plan due to Adam’s transgression.</p>
<p>However, through Christ Jesus, eternal life—the life and nature of God is now available to anyone who believes in Him. There’s animal life, plant life, human life, and then you have the God-life, which you receive when you’re born again. That’s the life Jesus spoke about in our theme verse. It’s indestructible and untainted.</p>
<p>That eternal life controls everything about your life now; it vitalizes your physical body. It destroys sickness, disease, infirmity and everything that’s not of God in your physical body. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing (Genesis 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God expects that when we receive His Word, we should live accordingly. When we have words in Scripture that show us principles of life or that give us definite instructions from God, we have to take heed; we have to take such words seriously and live by them. His instructions make great.</p>
<p>Life becomes challenging, a labyrinth of confusion for those who don’t follow God’s Word but would rather act on human wisdom and intelligence. Take for instance, the experience of Isaac in Genesis 26. He received an instruction from the Lord not to leave his country to Egypt, because of the famine in his country. People were migrating to Egypt at the time for greener pastures so it made sense (human wisdom) that Isaac sought to leave Gerar to seek relief in Egypt.</p>
<p>However, the Lord instructed him, saying*, “… dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father”* (Genesis 26:2 -3). Isaac followed the Lord’s instruction and the result is penned for us in Genesis 26:12-13: he grew, waxed great and became very great, so much so that the Philistines envied him in the same land that was impoverished by famine.</p>
<p>Follow the leading of God’s Spirit for your life. There’s no other way to greatness and a successful life besides following God’s plan, His instructions, will and purpose for your life. It makes no difference the pressure you’re under, yield to the Spirit for answers; don’t make impulsive decisions that’d most certainly worsen the situation. Consult and trust Him for guidance.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit knows and has the blueprint for your greatness and prosperity. Your greatness is His plan and His idea. He said to Abraham, <em>“…I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing”</em> (Genesis 12:2). Never suppose that your greatness is dependent upon your works or anyone. As the seed of Abraham, greatness is in you, harnessed and brought to the fore as you follow God’s instructions and fulfil His purpose for your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret (1 Corinthians 14:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, as a young teenager, I was preparing, alongside my friends, for a crusade; so, we met often, praying and fasting, with words of prophecy. One day, I arrived early to pray ahead of the others. While I was praying, speaking in tongues, I had the intuition that I was saying things in the Spirit that had to do with the crusade, but the words were coming out in tongues and I didn’t have the interpretation. None of my friends, two of whom had the gift of interpretation of tongues, had come.</p>
<p>I continued speaking in tongues and I was still feeling the unction so strong. Then, I said, “Lord, I need the gift of the interpretation of tongues so I can know what the Spirit is bringing to my understanding.” As I continued praying and speaking in tongues, suddenly, I received the interpretation and began to speak them out in English Language. Oh, how elated I was!</p>
<p>Then I took my journal and began to write. I spoke the words and interpreted. And guess what? Those things that were brought to my understanding about the crusade all came to pass. Praise God! Interpretation of tongues is so important. Tongues and interpretation of tongues equal prophecy. And prophecy brings edification.</p>
<p>As you speak in tongues in prophetic utterance, you can trust the Holy Spirit to bring the message to your understanding. If you thought you were blessed speaking in tongues, wait until you receive the interpretation. The experience will bring you such unspeakable joy! If you don’t have the interpretation, the Lord says to ask for it, and it’s His desire to grant it, through the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 2:10-11, Paul said, <em>“To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ; Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.”</em> Here, the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, highlights the importance of forgiving others, so that Satan doesn’t take advantage of the situation. It’s the way to allow the peace of Christ to rule in your heart. </p>
<p>You may have a reason to be offended or angry, but Ephesians 4:26 says, <em>“Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath.”</em> Some have left the church because they were angry, and others have quit their jobs because of anger. Some have accommodated anger against others for so long, without realizing its destructive effect on their own lives.</p>
<p>Practise the Word. Don’t retain anger in your heart; give it up quickly. You may say, “But what so-and-so did against me caused me terrible pain”; it makes no difference. When you’re filled with the Spirit, your heart is ruled with peace and you live joyfully and in love, irrespective of the actions of others.</p>
<p>Read what the Word says in James 5:13: <em>“Is any among you afflicted? let him pray...”</em>; he didn’t say, “Let him fight or be vengeful”; neither did He say, “Let him tell the whole world about it.” The word “afflicted” in that verse also means to be aggrieved or offended. He says if that happens to you, pray about it. Don’t get troubled and become bitter.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “Be anxious about nothing; in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God” (Philippians 4:6), and His peace will rule in your heart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name (John 20:31).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without eternal life, man is lost. He’s an eternal spirit that won’t just dematerialize and be forgotten. He goes to hell! The Bible says hell is the place of condemnation, the place of death*, “... prepared for the devil and his angels”* (Matthew 25:41).</p>
<p>When Adam sinned against God, all men died. In Romans 5:12, the Bible says, <em>“Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”</em> Sin brought death. That’s how death came to be in everything; it’s in all of nature. It’s the reason everything in the natural world degenerates. It’s the reason things get old and go extinct.</p>
<p>Men live and become weak, grow old and they pass on. It’s all because of the response of nature to the curse of death. Death is the elimination of life, the cessation of the functionality of life. God understood and saw all of these from the dateless past and planned that man should have eternal life; the indestructible life!</p>
<p>Everyone, including all of nature, has been looking forward to eternal life! They needed life, because there was death in everything. Romans 8:20 says, <em>“For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope”</em>; what hope? The hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began (Titus 1:2)!</p>
<p>Then John brings the good news, which we read in our theme verse. 1 John 5:11 says, <em>“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.”</em> You have eternal life now, meaning you’re in the ageless zone; you’ve passed from death to life. Whereas death works in the world, life works in you and everything that’s connected to you. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour (Titus 1:2-3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice what we just read: God manifested His word of promise for eternal life through “preaching”; preaching to who? To every creature, not just people. Jesus said in Mark 16:15, <em>“...Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”</em> The problem is that we’ve only been preaching the salvation message to human beings; consequently, we’re living in an environment that’s working against us.</p>
<p>Environmental degradation is on the rise, because we’re not preaching to all creation. This is the reason Paul cries out: <em>“For the earnest expectation of the creature</em> (creation) <em>waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God”</em> (Romans 8:19). The whole creation is groaning in pain, because the creation is in bondage, waiting to be liberated into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</p>
<p>I first discovered this truth as a teenager and taught it even to my parents. I’d say to my dad, “Everything in life has intelligence; therefore, you can talk to your belongings; talk to your cars and they’ll never be grounded or immobile. Preach to them.” When I said those things, I sounded weird. But this is what we’ve been commissioned to do.</p>
<p>You can preach to your clothes, furniture, etc. Everything in life is waiting for your manifestation; waiting for you to liberate them. And when you do this, you’ll discover that in your life, you’re always new, always advancing; you see life working in everything around you. The supernatural becomes an everyday occurrence, because you’re manifesting eternal life. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How beautiful and inspiring this is; it shows that predestination is at work in us. As God’s children, our lives have been prearranged; we’re acting out a script written by the best and greatest Scriptwriter of all time—the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It reminds of the words of Jesus referenced in Hebrews 10:7; He said, <em>“…Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.”</em> His day-to-day life when He walked the earth was a fulfilment of that which was written concerning Him before the world began. In many places in the Scriptures referring to Jesus, you’d find statements such as, “That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the Prophet.” Jesus acted out the script that was already written about Him. It’s the same with us today.</p>
<p>Everything that happens to you, whether good or bad, isn’t an accident; there’s nothing happening to you today that’s a surprise to God. He fashioned all things to work out together for your good (Romans 8:28). As read in our theme verse, your path has been prepared ahead of time. There’s neither defeat nor failure in that script. And the script isn’t going to change.</p>
<p>Yours is to simply play your role, and not try to rewrite the script. Don’t try to make God “do” something; He’s already done everything and given you everything you require for an excellent life. That’s what the script (His Word) shows. Live your life according to the script. Accept and declare what He’s said concerning you and you’d live a glorious and excellent life of purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours (1 Corinthians 3:21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Money is a deception and a distraction in the world. Not many realise this, but it’s the truth. When God made this world, there was no such thing as money. Money was an evolution; the world didn’t start out with money. But today, we act like money “fell” from heaven and God said, “Thou must use money.” But it’s not so.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can easily understand this deception: when you deposit money in the bank, you’re aware that there’s no special store created to store the money, with your name on every bill. Where then is all the money that the bank is keeping for you? They only have a record against your name in figures as proof that you have money there. That should tell you something: money is an illusion; it exists only in the mind of the poor.</p>
<p>Your real quality and value have nothing to do with the bills in your pocket or safe-deposit box. If you can build, not your bank accounts, but your mind and your heart—the quality of your personality—it’ll control how much money responds to you.</p>
<p>Take your mind beyond money and focus on God’s purpose. His purpose for your life is that no matter what happens to the financial systems and operations of the world, you’ll always win. You’re bigger than inflation and the economy of the nation where you live. You’re bigger than this world! You’re the seed of Abraham, meaning you own the world. Believe this and you’d be free from the power and intimidation of money.</p>
<p>Your dream in life shouldn’t be where to get money or how to get money. The first and most vital element is your mind. Put it to work, and money will respond to you always.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s so much “inadequacy syndrome” amongst many in the Church, and it has lasted so long that it now looks and sounds normal. For example, you hear such statements as, “Fill me, Lord; I’m hungry for you!” They think that the more they cry about their hunger for God, the quicker He’d respond to them. But such declarations aren’t consistent with the Word, with who we are and what we have in Christ.</p>
<p>Think for a moment: how much more of Him do you want when He lives in you in His fullness? You’re in the Father, and the Father is in you. Become fully conscious of this reality. Quit trying to reach out to Him or acting like a stranger and a foreigner; you’re one with Him. Hallelujah! The problem with many is their ignorance of the Word.</p>
<p>The Bible says, Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:27). It isn’t a part or an aspect of Him that lives in you; it’s the totality of His person! You’re full of Him. The Bible says you’re the temple of the Holy Spirit; you’re God’s house, His living tabernacle. God isn’t more in heaven than He is in you; you better believe this, for it’ll get rid of the dependency and inadequacy syndrome.</p>
<p>It’s a mistake to think the more we confess our weakness, the greater He is in us. No, don’t talk against the Word. Your confession of inadequacy destroys your faith and your effectiveness in Christ, and it’s contrary to everything that Jesus came to do for you. For example, how could anyone read what we have in our theme verse and still pray, “Oh Lord, help me to overcome”? Or like some would say, “We shall overcome someday.”</p>
<p>The Word says you’ve overcome; notice it’s in past tense; it’s not a promise, but a done deal, a present-hour reality. Your confession, irrespective of how you feel or what’s happening around you, should, and must be what the Word says concerning you. Don’t confess your feelings of inadequacy; confess the Word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son… (Romans 1:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oftentimes, when the Lord gives you a responsibility or an assignment to carry out for Him, it’s usually not because you’re an expert. He gives you that assignment and expects you to be diligent. He expects you to put in your best, but the most important of all is that He expects you to do it by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>No assignment in the house of God should be carried out by people who are not full of the Holy Spirit. This is because there’s nothing you can do for God that’ll be acceptable to Him without the Holy Spirit. Hebrews 9:14 tells us that Jesus offered Himself as a sacrifice through the Holy Spirit. It’s always been so with God.</p>
<p>Even in the Old Testament, when the Lord wanted Aaron’s garment (the Priest’s garment) to be made, just because the design was given by God, Moses had to get only those whom the Lord had filled with the Spirit to get the job done (Exodus 28:3). Think about it: He would only allow His priests wear clothes that were made by Spirit-filled individuals! Likewise, craftsmen that were to work in the tabernacle had to be filled with the Spirit to do the work.</p>
<p>On one occasion, the Lord said to Moses, “Get seventy leaders of the children of Israel, so they can assist you with the work.” Then God said, “I’ll take of the Spirit that’s upon you and put upon them” (Numbers 11:16-17). In other words, without the Spirit, He wasn’t going to let them do the work. That’s how important being filled with the Spirit for service is in the house of God.</p>
<p>It makes no difference the capacity in which you serve in church; perhaps, you’re a worship leader or music minister, an usher, a cell leader, outreach fellowship coordinator, a pastoral staff, or your role is cleaning the pews and opening the doors to the auditorium; it must be done through the Spirit.</p>
<p>This is where fellowship with the Spirit is so important. Before you set out to do anything, get filled with the Spirit; spend time in fellowship with the Holy Spirit, and He’ll guide you on how to do God’s things, God’s way, so your service would be accepted of Him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me… (1 Corinthians 9:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years back, I had some friends who were also in ministry. Though they loved the Lord, they were a little troubled by what they called my “extremes,” because I was always up and about for the Gospel. I was holding crusades in villages, in schools, organizing several programmes and seminars in churches; I was always on the go for the Gospel.</p>
<p>They thought somewhere along the line, I’d find that my extreme positions and actions were misdirected, and I’d learn my lesson and come down to their level. But the years have come and gone, and I’ve had no regrets serving the Lord that way. Had I not understood the Scriptures, I’d probably have tried to be “moderate” in my service to the Lord, to satisfy such people; and the impact we’re making today wouldn’t have been there.</p>
<p>Many have been dissuaded like that; so, be different. Remain focused. Serve the Lord with undivided attention. When you catch the vision to stand out from among your peers, in your passion for and sponsorship of the Gospel of Christ, stay focused. That’s the way. Be like Paul; commit to the Gospel as though it rested on you alone to evangelize the whole world! When you do, the grace of God is released upon you to achieve His dream.</p>
<p>Remember, it’s His work; He’s the One seeking to do it through you. You’re just His “suit”; He’s the One inside, talking through you, looking through your eyes, working through your hands. He said in 2 Corinthians 6:16: *“…I will dwell in them, and walk in them….”*Hallelujah! All He wants is for you to say, “Yes, Lord! I’m ready.” Then He’ll take over and fulfil His purpose through you. Keep your passion for the Gospel ever-burning; refuse to allow anything or anyone dissipate your zeal for the Lord and His work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified (Acts 20:32).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the world today, it’s obvious that there’re lots more poor people than there are rich people. But according to God’s plan, purpose, principles, and according to the Bible, this world was designed to have more rich people than poor people. Most of the world has never known this truth, but that was God’s plan from the beginning. His Word shows us that there’s more than enough for everybody in this world!</p>
<p>Read our opening verse again; it says God’s Word is able to deliver your inheritance into your hands. The Word doesn’t discriminate. Act on it, and it’ll produce results in you and for you. There’s an inheritance for you in Christ Jesus. It makes no difference that you were born in the most squalid region of the earth, with the poorest forebears; in Christ, no one is poor.</p>
<p>Even if you were poor and you came to Christ, the Bible says, <em>“He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory…”</em> (1 Samuel 2:8). Where are you in your life today? The Word of God can bring you an actual transmutation, a change of state, a change of quality and a change of character; a real transformation. That’s the way God accomplishes His purpose in us; it’s through His Word.</p>
<p>You can literally take the Word of God, meditate on it and begin a process of change for yourself, and determine how far you’re going to go in life. It doesn’t matter where you grew up; it doesn’t matter what obtains in the country where you live; the Word of God can deliver to you your inheritance in Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? (1 Corinthians 14:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally, to bless means to invoke the power of God into something or into one’s life, resulting in promotion, increase, furtherance, strength, etc. But there’s another aspect of blessing. For instance, the Bible talks about us blessing the Lord; how do you bless Him? And when we say, “Bless your work,” how do you do it? Also, our theme verse talks about blessing in the spirit; that is, blessing in other tongues; how do you do that?</p>
<p>But then, reading the concluding part of the verse gives us a clue: it says, “How does the one who doesn’t understand what you’re saying, say “Amen” at your giving of thanks?” He equates “blessing” to “giving of thanks.” In Matthew 26:26, the Bible says, <em>“And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it….”</em> How did Jesus bless the bread?</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, explained it in 1 Corinthians 11:23-24 which says, <em>“For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks, he brake it….”</em> Matthew said Jesus took bread and blessed it; then Paul gets the revelation and tells us exactly how Jesus did it: it was by giving thanks.</p>
<p>This lets you know how to bless your food when next you’re at the table for a meal. It’s not by saying, “Oh God, bless this food for Christ’s sake”; it’s by giving Him thanks for the food. That’s how Jesus blessed the bread. Likewise, when we say, “Let’s bless the Lord,” it means to give Him thanks; you’re thanking Him for who He is, for what He’s done in your life and for all His mighty works. This is what you should do always.</p>
<p>When you learn to thank or bless God for something, you receive a wholeness of whatever it is you’re thanking Him for, because thanksgiving brings about wholeness. Glory to His Name forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection (Luke 8:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word “perfection” in the scripture above, which is from the Greek, “telesphoreo” is a compound word, and it appears in only that verse of the Bible. It means to bring to fruition, to come to a ripened state, to come to a mature state where it triggers a result.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the verse above actually refers to someone who didn’t bring fruits unto perfection. But it gives us God’s plan, His idea, which is the fact that He wants us to be ever fruitful and productive—bringing our fruits to perfection.</p>
<p>There’re lots of people who start something and never finish. They’re always stopping in the middle of something; they just never get through. They always have a story to tell as to why they didn’t finish. Their projects are aborted, and processes truncated. But your story is different. You’re a fruitful vine, bearing fruits, and carrying your projects to perfection. Whatever it is that you do, the Spirit of God is at work in you to bring it to fruition. Affirm this about you always. As you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word, there’ll be no aborting of your ideas or even of physical pregnancy. This is your heritage as a child of God.</p>
<p>Another beautiful thing about this is that you produce fruits in and out of season. You’re ever fruitful and productive, <em>“…standing firm like a flourishing tree planted by God’s design, deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss, bearing fruit in every season…never dry, never fainting, ever blessed, ever prosperous”</em> (Psalm 1:3 TPT). What a life! Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds; (2 Corinthians 10:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re those who, even though they claim to be Christians, are antagonistic to the Gospel, because their understanding of the Gospel is corrupted by the theories of men. Some of them may have even been raised in church, and chosen of God, like Saul of the Old Testament, but instead of moving on with the Word, they used their senses to interpret God and lost out completely on God’s plan for them.</p>
<p>Such people are described in the Bible as belonging to the house of Saul; the arm of flesh. They’re ruled by the flesh and not by the Spirit. But then, there’s the “house of David”; the Bible says, <em>“… there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker”</em> (2 Samuel 3:1).</p>
<p>The “house of David” symbolises the Spirit; those who walk in the Spirit; those who speak and live according to God’s Word. There’s still that raging war today, where those who walk in the flesh try to act like they’re in charge, but the wisdom given to us of God is something they can’t resist or gainsay.</p>
<p>When you come in contact with such people, use and speak the wisdom of God, knowing that all they have are mere theories and words that come out of their natural minds. Ours are words too, howbeit, words of divine wisdom; so it’s words against words. They speak the wisdom of this world that comes to nought; but we speak the wisdom of God that produces undeniable results in our lives, circumstances and situations, and in the lives of others. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts (2 Peter 1:19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As God’s children, we’re not trying to win in life; whatever trouble comes to us isn’t “Live”; we’re only acting out a script. In that script, it’s written that you won. You’re only going to have a problem if you don’t follow the script. The script is God’s Word.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what comes at you when you follow the script—the Word—you’d boldly declare, “Nay, in all these things I’m more than a conqueror!” You’ll always be unmoved. Why? You already have the sure word of prophecy that no matter your experiences, the Word is more dependable!</p>
<p>Read our theme verse again; it reveals the secret of keeping afloat, the secret of winning continually, growing always and ever making progress. No matter who you are, no matter what your experiences may have been, it says, “Take heed to the Word of God as a light that shines in a dark place.”</p>
<p>Let’s suppose you’re currently in a dark place in your life and your experiences are so terrible; everything seems to be completely against your knowledge of the Word of God. You’re praying and it’s like nothing is changing; God says, “Look at that word of prophecy which may be like a flicker of light, and hold on to it! Hang in there, unwavering, until the day dawns, and the day star arises in your heart.” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>As you hold on to the Word, you’d hear the voice of the Spirit telling you, “Relax, everything is all right.” Hallelujah! In that seemingly dark place, God’s Word is there; the challenge came to pass. Therefore, refuse to give up or be dismayed.</p>
