<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>That which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How powerful this is: our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son, Jesus Christ! This is the greatest thing about Christianity—our fellowship with divinity. Christ’s purpose was to produce associates of the God-kind; a special class of being with the life and nature of God, thus making it possible for us to fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 1:9 says, <em>“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.”</em> As a result of this divine fellowship, anything that belongs to the Father belongs to us. Oh, the blessedness of our oneness with the Lord! It’s deeper than association; it’s greater than being in a covenant! He sees Himself in us. He’s never satisfied until we’re satisfied; our joy is His joy, and vice versa. No wonder, the Apostle Paul, writing to Timothy said, <em>“…be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus”</em> (2 Timothy 2:1). We’re to take advantage of His grace in our fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>You need to know that God truly loves you, so much so, that He made you one with Himself. Anything that concerns you, concerns Him. You don’t function aside or apart from Him. Become conscious of this. It’s the reason you should never be perturbed about anything in life. Think about it: how could you be in lack when you’re in league with the Monarch of the universe? We’re sons of God; heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ! Glory to His Name forever!</p>
<p>Take full advantage of His love in your life and enjoy the blessed fellowship that He’s brought you into. Walk with Him, talk with Him and live fully in Him. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever (1 Peter 1:23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you understand what it is to be born again, it’ll put springs in your steps. To be born again is to have the very nature of God in your spirit; it is to have the active life of Christ in every fibre of your being—in your spirit, soul and body.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</em> Recall the words of the Lord Jesus in John 3:3, <em>“...Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”</em> Then in verses 6 and 7, He said, <em>“That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.”</em></p>
<p>Until, and unless a man is born again, what he has is the depraved, fallen human life which is susceptible to sin, defeat, sickness, disease and death. But at the New Birth, the human life is supplanted by God’s divine nature. What great honour to become partakers of His life, carriers of His glory, dispensers of His grace and the expression of His righteousness! We have become sons of God (1 John 3:2), now that we’re born again.</p>
<p>We’ve become God’s begotten children just like Jesus. James 1:18 says, <em>“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.”</em> Jesus is the head of this new species, being the head of the body, the Church. He’s the first to be born again, among a special race of super-beings. 1 Peter 2:9 says, <em>“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.”</em> This is who you are now that you’re born again. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him (2 Corinthians 5:21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you received Christ into your heart, eternal life was imparted into your spirit, and with it came righteousness. Righteousness is the nature of God that produces in you the rightness of God, and gives you right-standing with God. It’s God’s gift to you in Christ; a gift of grace delivered to you by Christ Jesus. John 1:17 says, <em>“For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”</em></p>
<p>Romans 5:17 says, <em>“…they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.”</em> In other words, those who take a hold of that righteousness shall reign; that is, exercise dominion in life. So, it’s your responsibility to take a hold of your righteousness in Christ by being conscious of it! Being conscious that you’re the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus gives you boldness and confidence to pray and expect answers. It gives you mastery over the devil, his accusations, and the circumstances of life.</p>
<p>This is so beautiful, because it has nothing to do with your works or “performance” before God. Your righteousness is simply the result of Christ’s vicarious suffering and triumphant resurrection. Therefore, it makes no difference how wicked or wayward you think you’ve been; it makes no difference how far you think you’ve gone away from God; all you need is to embrace His righteousness.</p>
<p>Accept the gift that He’s made available to you, and say, “Blessed Jesus, you’re my righteousness. I believe you died for me and that God raised you from the dead for my justification.” Hallelujah! Remember, you didn’t ask Him before He gave you His righteousness. And His righteousness can’t be improved upon, being the righteousness of the man, Christ Jesus, the only sinless one to walk the face of the earth. Thus, we’re not going to be more righteous in heaven than we already are in Him.</p>
<p>So, in God’s presence, we’re at liberty; no fear, no condemnation, no inferiority! We’re free to express ourselves and to be ourselves as we worship and fellowship with Him, because we have right standing with Him. All these and more are the result of His superabundant grace; the gift of His perfect righteousness. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking (Matthew 6:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people believe what they need when they’re in a dire situation is a powerful prayer, but what exactly is a powerful prayer? To some, it has to do with the multiplicity of words or how loud they’re able to shout when they pray. But really, what produces result isn’t the intensity of your shout or multiplicity of your words; rather, it’s your faith in the Lord and His Word—your confidence in the One to whom you pray.</p>
<p>This makes prayer not only exciting, but also something to keep simple. That’s the essence of the Master’s admonition in our theme verse. He said, “Don’t pray like the heathen, who erroneously think they’ll be heard for using vain repetitions.” God isn’t hard of hearing. The Bible says He already knows what you need before you ask Him (Matthew 6:8). Therefore, learn to pray like Jesus. He prayed and acted simply. Recall the simple way He prayed at the tomb of Lazarus. The Bible says, <em>“...And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth”</em> (John 11:41-43).</p>
<p>Jesus said in Mark 11:23-24, <em>“For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”</em> That’s it! So, make your prayers simple. Pray with faith, confident of the Father’s love for you and the guarantee of hearing that you have in His presence.</p>

<p><em><strong>And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens... (Hebrews 11:32-35).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Christian isn’t born after the first Adam, but after the second and last Adam, Jesus Christ. The first Adam was a failure, but the second Adam, in whose image we’re born, and whose likeness we share, is an eternal victor. He heads up a new lineage of champions. When you grasp this truth, you’ll never consider failure in anything you do. This is because the life He’s given us, the life you have in you, can’t fail. The word, “Can’t” isn’t even strong enough: It DOES NOT fail! Failure isn’t consistent with it.</p>
<p>Think about it this way: Cats don’t bark, because it’s not consistent with their nature. So, even if we found one that could, it’s wrong. Likewise, if you found a Christian that failed, it’s unnatural. We don’t give up! It doesn’t matter how low in the valley we get; we get back on the mountaintop. You can’t knock us out, because we’re a chosen breed; a peculiar people. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>You belong to the generation of “more than conquerors”; therefore, even now, declare out loud: “I know who I am. I’ve found my place in Christ and my inheritance in Him. I’m a success forever. Sickness, poverty, discouragement and fear aren’t consistent with my nature. I have, and exercise, dominion over all circumstances and the adversities of life. Blessed be God!”</p>
<p>Jesus didn’t die for nothing. He didn’t die to produce failures, weaklings and victims. He died to raise a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, and a peculiar breed of victors. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me (Philippians 4:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Matthew 17:20, Jesus said, <em>“...nothing shall be impossible unto you”</em>; in other words, you can do anything. The Apostle Paul lends credence to this in our opening verse. Also, in 2 Corinthians 3:5, he takes it a step further, saying, <em>“Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.”</em> This isn’t talking about your human sufficiency or ability, but of God’s ability in you; you’re to look beyond yourself.</p>
<p>When you were born again, you received the very life and nature of God, meaning you have, and are to function with divine abilities. This is what gave Paul the boldness to say, <em>“I can do all things through Christ!”</em> It’s the same with every one of us. But many haven’t been able to look beyond themselves and their seeming inadequacies; hence, they concede to failure and to defeat. But not so with you; you’re born of God and therefore up to any task.</p>
<p>Read 2 Corinthians 3:5 in the Amplified Classic translation; it puts it in a better light: <em>“Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us, but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God.”</em> You’re to look beyond what your physical ability can do, now that Christ is in you. Your sufficiency is a God-sufficiency. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This was David’s mentality when he confronted Goliath. He eye-balled the giant and said, “I’ll cut your head off your shoulders today and feed your carcass to the birds of the air” (1 Samuel 17:46). How could David, a mere stripling, make such a boast? He had learnt to look beyond himself, unto the Lord. He said to Goliath, “I come against you in the Name of the Lord of host, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied” (1 Samuel 17:45). David was saying, “I may be the one standing before you, but God is actually the One standing against you, because I’m standing in His Name, not in my name. I’m functioning in His might, not mine!” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Have the same consciousness, because even better than what David had, the greater One lives in you today. He speaks through you, heals the sick through you and blesses through you. You have all His power and limitless resources domiciled in your spirit. Glory to His Name forever!</p>

<p><em><strong>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh (Luke 6:45).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Christians would say, “The greatest thing that happened to me was when I was born again.” But in the actual sense, nothing “happened” to you when you were born again; you were the one that “happened” on the scene! You came alive in the spirit. When a baby is born, you don’t say something has happened to that child; it’s the child that “happened” or came into this world.</p>
<p>It’s important that you understand this, for it’ll give you an idea of how God wants you to think and live as a Kingdom person. You’ve been brought into Christ—a place where nothing should “happen” to you; rather, you make things happen; you bring forth good things. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>God’s training in our lives through the Word and the Holy Spirit is for us to take absolute charge of our lives and be independent of circumstances. He wants you to control the good things that come to you, and make a choice not to let bad things in, because your spirit produces righteousness only. Read our opening verse again: Jesus said, <em>“A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.”</em></p>
<p>Notice that He didn’t say, “Good things happen to the good man,” but that the good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings forth good things. You’re to bring forth your prosperity, your promotion, your joy, and every blessing you want to enjoy in life from within; they’re all in you. No wonder the Bible says He has set eternity in our hearts. Then in John 7:38, He said, <em>“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>…God; Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling…according to his own purpose and grace…manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel (2 Timothy 1:8-10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blessed be God! Where in the world would you ever read something like what we just read in the latter part of our theme scripture? Who would think that such a statement would ever be made on this earth? I want you to notice the tenses; it doesn’t say, “Who shall abolish death”; rather, it says, “Who hath abolished death.” When something is abolished, it means it’s eradicated, obliterated, ended, stopped, or eliminated!</p>
<p>Jesus put an end to death! And I don’t mean spiritual death; the concluding part of the statement shows that He’s referring to physical death, for it says, <em>“...and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.”</em> This is supreme! He didn’t just abolish death; He brought life and immortality in its place. What does it mean to be mortal? It means to be human; to be subject to death. But being born again, mortality has been swallowed up by immortality. Your humanity has been supplanted by the God-life; you’re now the God-man; a divine being that has passed from death to life.</p>
<p>You may ask, “If this is true, if Jesus has truly abolished death, why are people still dying then, including Christians?” God said, <em>“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”</em> (Hosea 4:6). We can choose to lay down our lives. Think about Paul: the one who, by the Spirit, wrote the verses we read; he left this world knowing he was ready to go. He laid his life down, like Jesus. Paul said, “I have finished my course; I fought a good fight; I have kept the faith” (2 Timothy 4:7). He completed his ministry and laid down his life during the great persecution.</p>
<p>The primary reason people die is because of the consciousness of death, and the fear of death. Don’t think death. Don’t fear death. Don’t talk death. Death is an enemy—a defeated enemy that has also been abolished! It has no power over you. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord (Romans 6:23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some don’t understand it when we say Jesus didn’t die for Christians. The salvation that He brought wasn’t for Christians; it was for everybody in the world. Those who believe, and have made that salvation real in their lives through the proclamation of the Lordship of Jesus, become Christians. In the mind of justice, the whole world has been legally saved by Jesus Christ, because He paid the price for every man’s sin, thus making eternal life possible and available to everyone. Nonetheless, vital salvation must be actuated through individual faith in Christ.</p>
<p>Because many don’t know this, they walk on in darkness, living the depraved human life instead of the divine life in Christ. Romans 10:9-10 shows us how anyone can activate this glorious blessing of eternal life. It says, <em>“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”</em></p>
<p>This is why He sent us to preach and teach the Gospel around the world; it’s so the world may know and activate the life of God that’s available in Christ. The human life is degenerate, broken, and God knows it; that’s why He provided another life—the God-kind of life—so that human beings may transcend the ordinary human, mortal life and come into immortality; the life and nature of God.</p>
<p>John 3:16 says, <em>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life”</em>; that’s the God-life! It ’s for everyone who believes. If you’re reading this, and you have never been born again, turn to the Prayer of Salvation on page 72, and pray accordingly, meaning it with all your heart. Instantly, eternal life will be imparted to your spirit, supplanting the human life with which you were born of your parents. Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men (John 1:1-4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you study the Bible, you’ll be enthused to discover who Jesus truly is. When He walked the earth, He looked as ordinary as everybody else, yet He was Himself God. Jesus was the God that spoke to Moses in the burning bush. He was the One that called Abraham out of Haran and said, “Walk before me, and be thou perfect; I am the Almighty God” (Genesis 17:1). He was the One that stood before Moses and said, “Take your shoes off your feet for where you are standing is holy” (Exodus 3:5).</p>
<p>Jesus was God in a human body, but the people didn’t know. You might then ask, “Why is He called the Son of God if He’s Himself, God?” Many ask that question because they don’t understand the true meaning of the expression, “Son of God.” “Son of God” doesn’t mean one that’s born of God; rather, it means God in a human body. Jesus is Adonai; the Lord, God.</p>
<p>He was the One that said to Moses, “Your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob knew me as El Shaddai, but I’m Jehovah” (Exodus 6:3). Jehovah is Yahweh. This is why the Jewish people had difficulty accepting Jesus Christ ordinarily, because everything written about Jesus in the Scriptures and the things He said of Himself, show that He is Adonai. Now you can understand why His Name has all power.</p>
<p>Think about it: that seemingly ordinary man of Galilee was actually God Almighty, walking the streets of Israel, but they didn’t know it, to the point they even killed Him. John says, <em>“He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not. He came unto his own; and his own received him not”</em> (John 1:10-11). Who is he talking about here? Jesus, the incarnate Word! The Apostle Paul tells us that in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead, bodily (Colossians 2:9). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And the Word was made (became) flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth (John 1:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, I try to imagine what it was like being with Jesus when He walked the earth. What was Jesus like? John says He was full of grace and reality. When you came to Jesus, your search ended. When you came to Jesus, you arrived; you were home; you didn’t want to go anywhere else. It brings to mind the two disciples of John the Baptist who came to Jesus and asked, “Master, where do you live?” (John 1:38), and they followed Him home, listened to Him all evening until it became too late for them to leave. They stayed with Him through the night and the Bible specifically records that they never went back to John.</p>
<p>When you come to Jesus, you’re at home; you’re fulfilled! Glory to God! There’s just something extraordinary about Him. He’s peace personified. He’s love untainted. He’s joy indescribable. He’s the embodiment of life! In Him, you find rest. He said in Matthew 11:28, <em>“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”</em> Quit the struggle. Stop the fear. Fix your gaze on Jesus. His divine presence in you, with you, and around you is your advantage over the crises and challenges of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, celebrate Christ in you. Celebrate His life in you and your oneness with Him. Love Him lavishly and prove it by your commitment to His Word. He said, <em>“If ye love me, keep my commandments”</em> (John 14:15). The proof of your love for Him is acting on His Word; that way, He’ll cause you to sail through life’s troubles triumphantly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately (Luke 8:47).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God always wants us to testify of His goodness. When you testify of what God has done in your life, you’re connecting yourself to greater works of God for your future. Think about what we read in Luke 8 of the woman with the issue of blood who touched the hem of the Master’s garment! The Bible tells us <em>“...she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague”</em> (Mark 5:29).</p>
<p>After she received her healing, she was going to sneak away, but Jesus said, <em>“Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me”</em> (Luke 8:46). Then she came out of her hiding and <em>“...declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.”</em> Why didn’t Jesus keep quiet and let her go without testifying? It’s because, through your testimony, you preserve what God gives to you.</p>
<p>She could have lost her miracle on her way home, or shortly afterwards; but Jesus wanted her to retain the miracle, because confession brings possession. When God does something for you, the way to keep it is to tell it; that’s the principle of the Word of God.</p>
<p>We see another example when Jesus healed the demon-possessed man at Gadara. The Bible says, <em>“The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him…”</em> (Luke 8:38 NIV). But Jesus urged him saying, <em>“Return home and tell how much God has done for you. So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him”</em> (Luke 8:39 NIV).</p>
<p>Always testify to what the Lord has done and is doing in your life, your church, ministry, your family and in the lives of those around you. Testify to yourself. Testify to the angels. Testify everywhere you go! The Psalmist says, <em>“One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works”</em> (Psalm 145:4-5). Declare the Lord’s goodness—His glorious works in your job, business, and finances. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But just as you excel in everything-- in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us--see that you also excel in this grace of giving (2 Corinthians 8:7 NIV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every Christian is supposed to be passionate about God’s work, and put their resources into the push and spread of the Gospel around the world. But there’re usually those who are more passionate than others. They’re the ones Paul referred to in our theme scripture: they excel in the grace of giving.</p>
<p>Giving is a grace; it’s one of the spiritual gifts in the Bible. What makes it spiritual is that it’s God who gives the ability. Romans 12:6-8 says, <em>“Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith…he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity….”</em> Remember, He already said that upon receiving the Holy Spirit, we would all prophesy:</p>
<p><em>“And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy…”</em> (Acts 2:17). However, the Word also says, <em>“…to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom”</em> (1 Corinthians 12:8), even though the Holy Ghost enables everyone to prophesy and to see visions.</p>
<p>In the same way, everyone is enabled to give, but the grace of giving is also a gift. And the Bible says, <em>“… earnestly covet the best gifts...”</em> (1 Corinthians 12:31). So, it’s okay to covet and desire to excel in the grace of giving. In every gift of God, you get better by practice. So, practise giving your best; it comes with its myriads of blessings and promotions of the Spirit. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea (Exodus 14:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once, while still a young secondary school student, I was ministering at another school to some 500 young people. Standing in front of them, I said, “How many of you want to receive the Holy Spirit?” Everybody’s hand went up. So, I said, “Alright, in the Name of Jesus, receive the Holy Spirit!” I waited, but nothing happened. I prayed again and I waited; yet, nothing happened. At this time, I needed to know from the Lord, what exactly I was supposed to do. So, I asked everyone to talk to the Lord in prayer, and while they were at it, I too was consulting with the Lord.</p>
<p>I said, “Lord, I just prayed that they receive the Holy Spirit, and nothing has happened. What am I supposed to do?” Then, very quickly, He said to me, “Pray again, and touch the person closest to you”; and I said, “Thank you, Lord!” Then I calmed the congregation, and said, “Receive the Holy Ghost!” and went ahead to touch the person closest to me. Straightaway, the entire hall of young people went under the power, and were filled with the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues everywhere!</p>
<p>Here’s the lesson from that experience: God’s power is directional. As read in our theme verse, God said to Moses, <em>“…stretch out thine hand over the sea….”</em> Why? It’s because the power of God can be directed. Also, when Peter and John ministered to the man at the gate of the temple called Beautiful, the Bible says Peter set his gaze on the man (Acts 3:4); he directed the power of God at him, and a miracle ensued.</p>
<p>Whenever you’re required to stretch your hands in a certain direction or God’s people stretch their hands towards you in prayer, never take it lightly. There’s something about our hands. When we stretch our hands towards nations, cities, people or even situations and circumstances, there’s a profuse effusion of divine power, emitting from us like missiles. If it’s towards an individual, there’s an impartation of special grace, healing or whatever blessing we’re imparting at the time. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen (Mark 16:20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There have been those who were once actively involved in the Gospel, putting in everything they’ve got, but at some point, they started feeling discouraged, for one reason or the other. Some gave up altogether. It reminds of a similar case with Jesus’ disciples. They left everything, including their businesses and careers, to follow Jesus. They were having the time of their lives, going everywhere with the Master, preaching the Gospel. Then Jesus was crucified and buried! Though He resurrected, they didn’t see Him every day as they used to.</p>
<p>With time, their zeal began to dissipate. They thought it was all over. Some went back to their businesses, including Peter, the great Apostle. The Bible says, <em>“Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee…”</em> (John 21:3). But guess what? Jesus showed up on the shore one day, and after He had performed another miraculous sign, He said, <em>“...Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep”</em> (John 21:16). In other words, He was saying to Peter, “Leave these other things; go and do what I sent you to do.” But first, they were to receive the Holy Spirit, who would enable them.</p>
<p>Afterward, they became more vibrant, preaching the Gospel, because it became clear to them that the Master was more with them now through the Holy Spirit than ever before: He was in them. Our theme verse says, <em>“And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.”</em></p>
<p>It’s the same with us today; we’re not working alone. So, never be discouraged; remain passionate in preaching the Gospel, knowing that the Lord Himself is working with, in, and through you. Glory to His Name forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth… (Deuteronomy 8:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ecclesiastes 2:26 (GNB) says, <em>“God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness to those who please him, but he makes sinners work, earning and saving, so that what they get can be given to those who please him. It is all useless. It is like chasing the wind.”</em> This is the description of the so-called prosperity of the heathen; he’s nose-to-the-grindstone, struggling and toiling to make more money; but God says, “It’s all useless. It’s like chasing the wind.”</p>
<p>However, to the righteous, He gives wisdom, knowledge and joy; wisdom for wealth. Wisdom gives you the power to get wealth; wealth without travail. The word, “get” in our theme verse is the Hebrew, “asah” and it means power to produce, create, or make wealth. That means there’s power to do it. There’s a difference between the wealth made by sinners and the wealth produced through the power of God’s Spirit. It’s the reason you should never be envious of non-Christians who seem to have lots of money, because the wisdom of God—the power for wealth—is available to you and guides you in true prosperity.</p>
<p>Become wisdom-conscious. 1 Corinthians 1:30 says Christ has been made unto you wisdom. Love and embrace wisdom, and He’ll show you visions of the businesses and things you should do to multiply your resources. Suddenly, you’d find that the thoughts that come to you are thoughts that beat the economics and economies of this world, because they emanate from the active wisdom of God deep within your spirit.</p>
<p>That’s what the Bible says: <em>“For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment: That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures”</em> (Proverbs 8:11-12; 18-21). Blessed be God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away (Matthew 24:35).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, there’re those who are working for the Lord, giving their time, expending energy, and resources, and then they think it’s not yielding any result in their lives. They look at their lives and think they’re not making commensurate progress. Never allow such thoughts arise in your heart. The results of your labour of love in the Gospel may not be immediately obvious to you, but others are surely being impacted by it.</p>
<p>Think about it: many prophets of old, for example, didn’t see the result of their own prophecies. But we’re today enjoying some of the prophecies they gave. In their day, there must have been those who thought their prophecies were false, because some of the prophets lived and died, and their prophecies weren’t fulfilled in their day. But the truth is, in many cases, some of those prophets weren’t speaking of their days.</p>
<p>For instance, Joel said, <em>“And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy…”</em> (Acts 2:17). Those alive in his day didn’t know what the last days were. They may have considered Joel’s prophecy as false. But at the appointed time, that prophecy was fulfilled. The Bible says in Acts 2:1-4 that the apostles were all sitting in one place, in one accord; then suddenly, there was a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and cloven tongues like fire sat on each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost. Glory to God!</p>
<p>It took many years for the prophecy to come to pass, and the Spirit alerted Peter, who confirmed it, saying, <em>“But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel”</em> (Acts 2:16). Hallelujah! Never think your service in the Lord and in the Gospel is worthless, just because you think His Word to you hasn’t come to pass. Don’t be distracted; the results are there. Even the ones you’re yet to see will still happen. It doesn’t matter what anybody says or what circumstances show; remain focused and fervent, serving the Lord. Keep your gaze on Him. His Word is true and never fails.</p>

<p><em><strong>…much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once, I was about to minister to someone who’s been sick and confined to a wheelchair for years. I asked him, “Will you be healed today?” He said, “Yes, of course.” Then I said, “What will happen when I pray for you now?” He said, “I’ll walk and I’ll run.” So, I placed my hands on him and said, “You’re healed.” Immediately, he jumped out of the wheelchair, staggered a little and was perfect. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Now, when I said to him, “You’re healed,” he didn’t wait for anything more; he received instantly. That was his role: to receive. Giving is one thing, but receiving is another. Many don’t seem to know how to receive. Receiving is by faith; it’s with your spirit, and it’s not something you do passively. The Greek word is “lambano,” and it means to take active possession; to reach out, take a hold of something and make it yours.</p>
<p>In Acts 3:6, Peter addressed a man who was crippled from birth and said, <em>“...silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.”</em> In verse 7, we read that Peter took the crippled man by the hand and yanked him up. The Bible says, <em>“…immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. And he leaping up stood, and walked…”</em> (Acts 3:7-8). The man could have said to Peter, “Please don’t pull me up, my legs are too feeble to carry me”; no! He received. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>We’ve been given all things that pertain to life and godliness; all spiritual blessings that exist in Christ Jesus. Receive. If there’s no receiving from your end, it amounts to nothing. Your response to God and His Word is the proof that you’ve received. And that is what faith is: the response of the human spirit to the Word of God. The change you desire in your life, finances, health and family have already taken place; receive and act accordingly.</p>

<p><em><strong>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal (2 Corinthians 4:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Man is primarily a spirit being; and the spirit has its inner senses. But for most people, their inner senses are untrained. So, you find that most are only used to what they can see and perceive in this earth-realm, because they’ve only been trained to describe things with their natural senses. How limiting that is!</p>
<p>Don’t live your life to the limits of your natural senses. God tells us in His Word that there’s more than the human senses can comprehend. He said, <em>“...I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions…”</em> (Acts 2:17). When He said the young men shall see visions, He was talking about the ability to see beyond the ordinary; the ability to see with, and from your spirit; your inner senses. That’s why they’re called visions, because what you see at that realm, the natural man calls invisible.</p>
<p>Take young David’s encounter with Goliath for example. He was so sure he could take down Goliath, even though others were afraid of him. Why? He saw differently. He saw through the Word that the man, Goliath, standing in front of him couldn’t in any way defeat the armies of Israel. So, he said, <em>“…who is this uncircumcised Philistine…”</em> (1 Samuel 17:26). He saw what others couldn’t see, and that’s what we read in our theme verse: we don’t look at the things which are obvious to the natural eyes, for such things have no foundation.</p>
<p>Stop looking at how much you have in the bank. Stop looking at the situation you’re in or what people are saying about you. See the invisible! Train yourself to see beyond this world, beyond the walls and the barriers. See through the Word. See by the Spirit, at a higher level. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven (Psalm 119:89).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joshua 1:8 reveals the power of the spoken Word. It says, <em>“This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth….”</em> This is God’s recipe for success: success in every area of your life—job, finances, health, family, academics, etc.—is in your mouth. Jesus said in Mark 11:23, <em>“For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain… and…shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.”</em> He placed the premium on words.</p>
<p>With the mouth, you catapult yourself into that thing that you’ve believed. The Bible says the Word of God is living and active (Hebrews 4:12 NIV), but not on the pages of your Bible. The Word is living and active on the lips of a believing Christian! Imagine the victory of David over Goliath: it happened because of the words David spoke. He had known from the Word given to Israel that it was impossible for them to be defeated, because anyone at war with Israel would have their chief ally—God Almighty—to contend with.</p>
<p>However, David understood that having the knowledge wasn ’t enough; so, he followed it with proclamations. He said to Goliath, <em>“This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel”</em> (1 Samuel 17:46). David was talking! He said again and again what would happen to Goliath, and it happened exactly as he had said!</p>
<p>That’s the power of the spoken word. If you don’t say it, it won’t happen. God needs your words to act upon, because you represent Him in the earth. His Word is forever settled in heaven; however, it’s your responsibility to settle it in your life and in the earth through your faith-filled affirmations. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all (1 Chronicles 29:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read and meditated a lot on the verse of scripture above in my teenage years. I thought, “If it’s with God to do all these wonderful things, then they shall be fulfilled in my life!” I had no doubt about it, and it’s been so. Riches and honour come from God; it’s with Him to make great and to give strength. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Without Abraham asking, God said to him, <em>“I’ll make you great”</em> (Genesis 12:2) and He did. He’s the One that makes great. This is why I tell Christians and ministers of the Gospel to not be afraid of criticism and persecution, for they’re springboards for promotion. It makes no difference what is said or published about you or against you; be unperturbed. The Bible says, <em>“No weapon fashioned against you shall prosper”</em> (Isaiah 54:17). Nothing, and no one can dishonour you.</p>
<p>They may try to dishonour you by saying and writing unwholesome things about you, but how could they take from you the honour they didn’t confer on you? It’s not possible. The Lord glorified you with Himself! He has made you great and no one can undo it. There’s no institution or government in the world, powerful enough to disrepute you, because your reputation is Christ.</p>
<p>Every so often, affirm that your life is excellent and full of glory, crowned with honour and greatness, and the pleasure of the Lord is prospering through you. Give no room to distractions and detractors. Let all that matters to you be to please the Lord. All majesty, dominion, greatness, power, honour and glory belong to Him, and you’re the focus of His love, and a joint-heir with Him. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things (1 John 2:20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Christian, if you’ve received the Holy Spirit, His grace is on your life; there’s an “unction” on you. That word “unction” is the same as the anointing. 1 John 2:27 says, <em>“But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.”</em></p>
<p>This means whatever problem you’re faced with as a child of God, be it financial or in your job, health, family—whatever it may be—the Holy Spirit can teach you what to do. If you’d listen to Him in your heart, you’ll hear His voice! You’ll hear Him tell you what to do, because it’s His will and desire to guide and lead you from glory to glory, in the path of triumph!</p>
<p>No Christian should walk in darkness or confusion in life. You should never be at crossroads or make the wrong choices and investments in life, because you have a “Teacher” inside you, who has sanctified your mind to think excellently so you can make quality and intelligent decisions.</p>
<p>Read the words of Jesus in John 14:26: <em>“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”</em> By the Holy Spirit, you can know how to run your family, job, business, finances, academics, and everything you need to know about life. Always be conscious that you’re not an ordinary person. You’re blessed and anointed of God, with insight into the mysteries and secrets of life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest (Ezekiel 37:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your journey of faith, there could be times of difficulties, when you face serious challenges. But at such times, don’t loathe yourself or gripe that you’re going through such tough times; refuse to be discouraged. Don’t make the mistake of running helter-skelter, seeking help from man, no; talk your way out of it.</p>
<p>This was what the Lord told Ezekiel to do in the valley of dry bones (Ezekiel 37:4). Ezekiel found himself in a valley full of dry bones and the Lord asked him, “Can these bones live?” That was an impossible situation, but God told Ezekiel to “prophesy to the bones.” As he prophesied, a great miracle took place: <em>“…there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone”</em> (Ezekiel 37:7).</p>
<p>If you’ve found yourself in a situation where everything around you seems “dry,” there can be a change; and you’re the one to effect that change with your words. Remember, words are “things,” they have energy and spiritual tangibility. What you say, becomes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenges you face are your opportunities to demonstrate your faith in the Lord, and prove His Word. Rather than being overwhelmed in the hour of crisis, declare your health, success, prosperity, and victory in Christ Jesus. The Word in your mouth is a creative force; it’ll bring forth miracles. God’s Word created everything, and as such can create anything. Use faith-filled words to frame your world, and programme your spirit for success and victory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life (Romans 6:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Christianity were all about salvation from sin, there wouldn’t have been the need for Jesus to rise from the dead. His death on the Cross would have been enough; it paid for all our sins and guaranteed complete propitiation. However, that’s redemption, and not Christianity!</p>
<p>Redemption refers to saving someone by paying a price. When Jesus died, He paid the price for man’s redemption with His own life; He did that for all humanity; not for Christians. The Christian isn’t the man that Christ died for. Look at it this way: when Jesus hung on the Cross, in the mind of God, we were all hanging there too (in Him), for He was our representative. When He cried out, “It is finished,” and gave up the ghost, we also died in Him.</p>
<p>Now, here’s the big thing, which Satan didn’t see coming and the angels still marvel at and seek to look into: Christianity is based on the resurrection of Jesus, and not on His death. The resurrection of Jesus Christ gave us something far beyond redemption; it ushered us into a newness of life. We’ve been raised up together with Christ (Ephesians 2:6).</p>
<p>Romans 10:9 says, <em>“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.”</em> It lets us know that salvation comes by believing in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the subsequent confession of His Lordship. A Christian is one who identifies with the resurrected Christ. The Christian has no past, for the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:17: <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature...”;</em> meaning that he is a new species, one that never existed before.</p>
<p>No wonder James declares that <em>“Of his</em> (God’s) <em>own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures”</em> (James 1:18). Being born again, therefore, you’re not the “redeemed”; you’re the fruit of the redemptive work of Christ. Redemption was consummated with His death, but Christianity came from the resurrection. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the Lord Jesus, the Apostle Paul had no consciousness of lack. He understood the message of the Gospel that as new creations in Christ, we’re heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ. We’re not in lack or want. Why then did Paul pray, saying, <em>“But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus?”</em> He was addressing the spiritually immature.</p>
<p>Paul didn’t include himself in the prayer. He didn’t say, “My God shall supply all our needs.” When you’ve come of age, you’ll realize that in Christ, we don’t have any unmet needs. Matthew 6:33 says, <em>“…seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”</em> When you seek the Kingdom of God first, every good thing you could ever wish for is added—“annexed” with it—without having to ask. You won’t need to pursue the things that the Gentiles seek: fame, money, recognition, acceptance, etc.; they’re packaged in the Kingdom that you’ve inherited.</p>
<p>Remember the words of Jesus; He said in Luke 12:32, <em>“Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom”</em> and He’s done it. He said in Luke 17:21, <em>“...the Kingdom of God is within you.”</em> If you have the Kingdom, then you have everything. No wonder Peter exclaimed in 2 Peter 1:3, <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”</em> Blessed be God! Paul’s climactic submission on the subject is equally so surreal; he said in 1 Corinthians 3:21, <em>“...all things are yours!”</em></p>
<p>In your life, never look at what you may consider a need; rather, see what God already lavishly made available to you in Christ. You possess all things, being a joint-heir with Christ. Christ owns the whole world, and you’re one with Him; called into partnership with Him (1 Corinthians 1:9). Since this is true, what in the world could you ever be in need of? Nothing! Affirm God’s Word in your life. He has said all things are yours; declare the same, and live accordingly. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not (Galatians 6:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people get troubled, almost to the point of despondency when it seems they haven’t been able to achieve their goals for success within a given time frame. Don’t be that way! When you get under pressure because of what you want to accomplish within a certain time, you become a slave to time. Use and invest your time wisely, but don’t be a slave to time.</p>
<p>Moses had this in mind when he prayed to the Lord to <em>“...teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom”</em> (Psalm 90:12). Each day you live is an opportunity to accomplish so much, so schedule your day properly. Live your best every day. Do what you must do in pursuit of your God-given purpose, and trust the power of God’s Spirit to put you over. But while at it, be conscious that you live in eternity—God’s realm of life where time is an interruption.</p>
<p>Furthermore, success is relative; in other words, it’s measured at different stages. So, don’t become miserable just because you haven’t seen all the results you want. Review where you are at the moment and make the necessary adjustments; imbibe the required learnings and forge ahead.</p>
<p>Success is also by grace; therefore, be more conscious of the grace-advantage; God’s divine ability to cause you to excel beyond your dreams. Psalm 37:4-5 says, <em>“Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.”</em></p>
<p>Nothing is too difficult for, or impossible with, the Lord (Jeremiah 32:27). Therefore, trust Him; He’s a restorer of time and of wasted years (Joel 2:25). Trust His ability to make you all He desires for you to be. He’s more passionate about your success than you could ever be. He can do for you or cause you to achieve in a second, what naturally should have taken you five or ten years to achieve. Therefore, stand firm on His Word and refuse to gripe or panic about your goals and dreams.</p>

<p><em><strong>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal (2 Corinthians 4:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God loves you and cares about you. He always wants to see you win and live happy every day. Jesus said, <em>“...In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world”</em> (John 16:33). Never allow circumstances frustrate you; train your faith. Regardless of what you face, tell yourself, “All things are working together for my good” (Romans 8:28).</p>
<p>2 Timothy 3:12 says, “Doubtless, all that’ll live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution”; it’s part of the deal. But the beautiful part is that you’ll always win, because you’ve been called into the triumphant life. Things might not exactly be going as you’ve expected, but maintain your composure and confession of the Word. Don’t accept defeat. Don’t give in to sickness or anything that hurts. Don’t say, “I’ve been infected,” just because you noticed some symptoms in your body. You belong to the “new creation” breed.</p>
<p>Symptoms or the doctor’s diagnosis shouldn’t change your confession. Keep the Word in your mouth. How you feel or the figures in your bank statement don’t change who you are. The things you see with your physical eyes are temporary; that means they’re subject to change. Therefore, set your faith on course. Your faith is the victory that overcomes the world (1 John 5:4).</p>
<p>Every adversity you face is your opportunity to experience and manifest the glory of God: <em>“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory”</em> (2 Corinthians 4:17). No matter what you go through in life, it’ll turn out for your good, as long as you turn your eyes away from the conditions or circumstances, to the Word. Hebrews 12:2 says, <em>“Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith….”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek (Romans 1:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve received the mandate to take the Gospel to the ends of the earth; it’s a calling for all who are in Christ, and it’s something you’re to do with courage, conviction and faith. Only the Gospel can catapult the sinner into salvation and righteousness. It’s only through the preaching of the Gospel that the righteousness of God can be unveiled and embraced.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the only message that when received, makes sinners sons of God in a moment of time. Therefore, be ever so passionate about leading others to salvation. The Bible says those that turn many to righteousness shall shine as stars forever (Daniel 12:3). Light up your world with the Gospel. Let it be what you live for.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:15 says, <em>“And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.”</em> If you truly believe that Jesus died to save you, then you must continually live for His glory and lead others to salvation. We’re in the last days, and the time is short. This isn’t a matter of convenience. There may be peculiar times, occasions, and places where you may need to be tactful in preaching the Gospel, but your focus must always be to lead people everywhere into salvation in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>We’re His co-labourers and partners, working together with Him to reach the lost and bring salvation in Christ to every man. In your sphere of contact, be a burning and a shining light. Devote your life to reaching others with the Gospel. Keep influencing and impacting your world positively through the power of God that works in you. He’s counting on you for the salvation of many in your world. Therefore, be faithful in leading others to Christ and bringing them to church.</p>

<p><em><strong>But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen (2 Peter 3:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your most exciting times should be when you’re in fellowship with the Word. God’s Word is everything; it’s what you need to be all that God has destined you to be in life. Having come to Christ, you must have a strong desire to grow in your spirit and spiritual growth is through the Word. Just as a new-born baby is fed with natural food to enhance its growth and wellbeing, so also does God expect you to feed on the Word.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”</em> (1 Peter 1:23). We’re born of the Word. 1 Peter 2:2 says, <em>“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.”</em> Nothing else will make you grow spiritually, except the Word. God’s Word will build you up in every area of your life, making you sound and balanced.</p>
<p>Relish God’s Word. Delight yourself in it. The Psalmist said, <em>“I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil”</em> (Psalm 119:162). Cherish God’s Word. Know it for yourself; it’s the way to multiply grace and peace in your life: <em>“Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord”</em> (2 Peter 1:2). As you consciously meditate on the Scriptures, you’re programmed to only think God’s thoughts, and influenced only by His character, ideas and opinions.</p>
<p>The Word of God in your consciousness will cause you to walk accordingly. Upgrade your life with the Word. Take charge and subdue your world and your environment, living victoriously every day through the Word and by the Spirit.</p>
