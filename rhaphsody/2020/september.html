<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live (Deuteronomy 30:19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re Christians who’re fretful about the rapture, uncertain about their eternal security. The Lord doesn’t want us to live in such fear or anxiety. The truth is, eternal security is real for the one who’s born again, but it’s conditioned on your living the Christ-life, living in His righteousness until the end.</p>
<p>If, for example, someone who’s been born again changes his mind later about following Jesus, such a person is in trouble, because his eternal security with God is in jeopardy. When you’re born again, you’re born into God’s presence; you live in God’s presence. He’s your Protector. He keeps you, and no one is able to pluck you out of His hand, according to the Scriptures.</p>
<p>However, life is full of choices. You’re the one to make a choice to live for Him continually. When God guides us, He presents us with the options, and then He also tells us what to choose. But He doesn’t force us in the choices we make, though He lets us understand the consequences of making the wrong choices.</p>
<p>What you must do, therefore, is to live according to His Word. That’s the simplest thing ever. When you’re born again, living for Christ is the most natural thing to do with your new nature in Christ. Living right is so natural to you that you have to be tempted to do wrong. This is also where the ministry of the Holy Spirit comes in. The Holy Spirit helps you live the Christian life, and with Him in your life, you never have to worry about missing your way.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Bible says*, “Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy”* (Jude 1:24). As you live for the Lord, serving Him passionately with absolute conviction, He’ll fulfil His purpose and ministry in your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him (Luke 8:25).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus was with His disciples in the boat one day, and a tempest arose. The disciples became afraid and the Bible says, <em>“…they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm”</em> (Luke 8:24).</p>
<p>The Master turned to the disciples and asked them a very pertinent question: “Where is your faith?” That’s the big question in life. With your faith, you can do anything; you can move mountains; you can achieve great results. Faith is a tool. Use it. If you’d learn to use your faith, you’ll live triumphantly every day.</p>
<p>Stop crying for help! Use your faith to make your life glorious. With your faith, you can destroy cancer, diabetes or heart trouble. You can change the circumstances of your life! So, build your faith. Make a choice to feed your faith by learning and living on God’s Word.</p>
<p>The Bible is a compendium of divine revelations from God’s Prophets and Apostles; the message has been proven again and again. Irrespective of the issues in your health, family, finances, job, academics, or ministry, you can prevail gloriously by growing your faith in the Word and putting it to work every day. Remember, our faith is the victory that overcomes the world (1 John 5:4).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you (Jeremiah 29:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord called us to pray because He planned to answer. It’s therefore important that you have a plan for prayer. If you don’t have a plan for prayer, you’re most unlikely to pray. There’re lots of activities that could occupy your time and prevent you from praying. You have to make deliberate efforts to have a prayer culture and discipline; you could set an alarm system for reminders. Never be too busy to pray.</p>
<p>Prayer isn’t only when you want something from God. Prayer is that fellowship with the Lord where you talk to and with Him, and you give attention to Him in your spirit, to hear what He has to say to you. Every Christian must have such times.</p>
<p>If you’ve had challenges doing this consistently, you can ask the Lord to guide you in planning your personal prayer schedule. Don’t neglect it. There’re corporate prayer times where you participate in prayer programs and services, maybe in your church or cell group, but that’s different from having your personal prayer schedule.</p>
<p>Someone may say, “Well, I pray once a week, not every day.” No, that’s not good enough. Have a prayer schedule for every day, because it helps you have a spiritual consciousness every day. You may then wonder, “How long should I pray?”</p>
<p>It’s not for anyone to determine for you how long you should pray, but you’ll know if or when you’re not praying enough, because it’s a relationship between you and the Lord. If you think you’re not praying enough, then add more time. The truth is, the more time you spend in prayer, the more helpful it is to you, because apart from the fact that you’re talking to the Lord, there’s the edification of your spirit that you get from praying. Not only that; there’s also the education of your spirit. No one educates you like the Holy Spirit. In that atmosphere of prayer, He teaches you; He brings you information that enlightens and guides you. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit (Romans 8:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our opening verse, the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul isn’t telling us that there’re two groups: those in Christ Jesus who walk in the flesh, and those in Christ Jesus who aren’t walking in the flesh. That’s not the essence of His communication; rather, He’s holding out a picture of who you really are. </p>
<p>When you study and understand the New Testament, you’d observe what’s called the “Mirror Principle”; God’s Word is a mirror. You’re what you see in the Word (2 Corinthians 3:18). Therefore, don’t read our theme verse and assume you’re not free from condemnation or that you’re still “walking in the flesh” because you err sometimes; no!</p>
<p>Read the 9th verse of the same chapter; it clarifies it by saying, <em>“But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you…”</em> (Romans 8:9). That’s God talking! When He describes those in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit, He’s referring to you.</p>
<p>Therefore, see yourself through the Word. Now that you’re born again, there’s no condemnation for you. When you understand this and live accordingly, you’ll never again struggle with sinful habits, bad thoughts or works of the flesh. The Bible says, “Sin shall not have dominion over you” (Romans 6:14); see yourself thus, for that’s how God sees you.</p>
<p>God knows that if you saw yourself the way He sees you, you’d act accordingly. Accept who He’s made you—His righteousness in Christ Jesus—and walk in that light. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair (2 Corinthians 4:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Christianity that we have today didn’t come to us on a platter of gold. If you read about Christian martyrs, you’d find that many were killed, beheaded, for their testimony of Christ. On one occasion, over six thousand men were slaughtered for their faith in Jesus Christ, and they were soldiers. They believed the Gospel with all their hearts, and nothing was going to stop them from transferring to the next generation the same faith that they had received.</p>
<p>All the years that you’ve probably had liberty to worship the Lord, to praise Him in the church, attend crusades and participate in life-transforming meetings, that liberty came through the deep struggle, prayers, sweat, tears, blood, faith, determination and passion of other men and women who staked their lives on the Gospel. They weren’t only persecuted, many were buried alive. Some were sawn in two; violently killed, for their faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Persecution of Christians is still happening in several countries today. Some countries have concentration camps where Christians are subjected to harsh and heinous treatments for their faith in Jesus. A very recent report officially shows that Christians are the most persecuted group in the world.</p>
<p>I’m bringing this to you so you understand that the faith of Jesus Christ that we have, the message of Christ that we’ve believed, is worth everything. In spite of the persecution, those before us maintained their faith and stayed true to the Gospel. It should and must be the same in our day.</p>
<p>No matter what’s happening in your city or nation, stay true to Christ. Don’t vacillate. As read in our theme verse, we don’t give up; we don’t quit. Preach the Word in and out of season. Nothing should be terrifying or intimidating enough to keep you quiet, for greater is He that’s in you than all the adversaries and adversities in the world. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matthew 16:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Matthew 13:44, Jesus said, <em>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.”</em> Jesus bought the whole field because of the treasure in the field. The treasure is the Church, and the field is the world.</p>
<p>Jesus bought the whole world with the price of His own blood, because of the Church; He gave everything. This tells us what Satan wants. When he creates or inspires crises in the world, his eyes are on God’s children, the Church. His end game is always to go after the Church of Jesus Christ. He’s completely averse to God’s people serving and worshipping God freely. But he’s a failure.</p>
<p>Why is Satan so much against the Church? It’s because the Church—you and I—have what Satan lusted for from the very beginning. He had said, <em>“…I will be like the most High”</em> (Isaiah 14:14), but he couldn’t. Rather, he was kicked out of heaven. Then he found out the Church, which Jesus created, would share God’s Name, share God’s throne—His seat—with Him!</p>
<p>Today, we’re one with God by virtue of Christ’s love. Jesus said, I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. That’s a truth that can’t be broken. Hallelujah! There’s no force in the universe that can stand against the Church. Don’t see the Church as a mere organization; it’s the sacred body of Jesus Christ—His pearl of great price.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the Spirit, the Apostle Paul got the revelation of the rapture of the Church and said, <em>“Behold, I shew you a mystery…”</em> (1 Corinthians 15:51). This is why many don’t understand the Rapture; it’s a mystery; divine revelation. He said, <em>“...We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, <strong>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye</strong>, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed”</em> (1 Corinthians 15:51-52).</p>
<p>The underlined portion shows how fast the Rapture will happen; it’ll be so fast there’d be no time for those who weren’t prepared, because it’s something for which you should have been prepared all your life.</p>
<p>In our theme verse, we find an expression that’s synonymous with the term, “Rapture”; it’s the phrase, “caught up” which is from the Greek word, “harpazo.” It means to seize, catch (away, up), pluck, pull, take by force.</p>
<p> At the Rapture, it makes no difference where you are, the power of God will snatch you away from this world. Christians who had died will be resurrected, and together with them, we’ll be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord. What a day that will be!</p>
<p>When is this going to take place? It’s closer than ever; it’s going to be anytime soon. Your responsibility is to be prepared by living your life for the Lord, every day. Keep walking in love, and your faith activated to be caught up to be with the Lord at His appearing.</p>
<p>The Bible says He’s coming for a Church without spot, wrinkle, blemish or any such thing (Ephesians 5:27). Live every day, every moment of your life in His righteousness, producing works and fruits of righteousness.</p>

<p><em><strong>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you (John 15:19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the days of Esther, the Jews had become comfortable in a strange land; a land of their captivity. They enjoyed liberty in the land and were at ease, until Haman, an influential but wicked man in the kingdom (also a friend of the king) sought to exterminate them.</p>
<p>Esther, the queen, who had been completely oblivious of Haman’s hatred and quest to destroy the Jews received a touching message from her uncle, Mordecai, about Haman’s wicked plot. She quickly intervened and called for prayer and fasting across the land (Esther 4:16). Of course, God heard their prayer and delivered them from the hand of wicked Haman.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you can so enjoy liberty on earth that you forget you’re in a “strange land,” a pilgrim in the earth. This has happened to many; they’ve focused on the journey more than the destination. Some Christians have become complacent, carried away and distracted by the things of this world. Yet, Jesus said, <em>“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul”</em> (Mark 8:36).</p>
<p>Let your heart be on the Lord; let the weightier matters of the Kingdom inspire you to action. Win souls. Watch and pray as Jesus said to do. Pray for your nation that the Gospel will spread by free course and be embraced.</p>
<p>There’re certain nations where the Gospel thrived years ago, but today those same nations now disallow the preaching of the Gospel, with Christians under so much persecution. What happened? The answer is simple: the Christians in those nations didn’t do what Jesus said to do: <em>“Watch and pray…”</em> (Matthew 26:41).</p>
<p>We must remember our purpose; our reason for being here, and it’s for a time. We’re ambassadors of Christ, sent from the heavenly Kingdom for the salvation of souls in the earth. Therefore, like the Bible says, <em>“…seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth”</em> (Colossians 3:1-2).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>BUT ALSO [in those days] there arose false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among yourselves, who will subtly and stealthily introduce heretical doctrines (destructive heresies), even denying and disowning the Master Who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction (2 Peter 2:1 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same way there’re false brethren and false prophets who create problems in the house of God, there’re also false teachers. These are people who arrogate to themselves the teaching ministry, even though they weren’t called to be teachers, thereby exposing themselves to demons, and promoting false doctrines. They indoctrinate with errors, usually inspired by the spirit of deception.</p>
<p>For example, some false teachers teach that the coming of Christ has already taken place, and thus mislead a lot of people. Some others say the Holy Spirit’s ministry ended with the apostles. Some come with dream interpretations, telling people how different sleeping positions affect their dreams, and teach the effects of eating in dreams.</p>
<p>Some go as far as telling you it’s a relative of yours that’s responsible for your life’s problems, and create enmities between relatives. Yet, the Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood (Ephesians 6:12). But sadly, some have been deceived by such false teachings.</p>
<p>It readily brings to mind the words of Jesus when He said, <em>“...Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures…”</em> (Matthew 22:29). Know the Word for yourself, and no one will deceive you. Make studying the Scriptures a priority in your life.

<p><em><strong>When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him  (Mark 9:25).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him  (Mark 9:25).</strong></em></p>
<p>If you ever wanted to know how to cast out devils, Jesus demonstrated it clearly in the verse above. He addressed the spirit responsible for the condition. He said, <em>“...Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.”</em> He didn’t just say, “I rebuke you”; He said something that was the rebuke. He addressed the particular devil by name: dumb and deaf spirit. Andof course, the devil went out.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to say, “Satan, I bind you.” Satan is a generic name for the devil. What’s the particular devil or demon you’re dealing with at that particular time? You can know by the type of affliction, problem, or else, by the Holy Spirit revealing it to you. In carrying out their work, demons manifest the character of their being, and this can help you identify them and address them appropriately. Through the manifested character of a devil, you can know what his name is, because a name is a description of character. Demons are named according to their character, as seen in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>For example, if you identify an unclean spirit, then you don’t need to be wondering what the name of that demon spirit is. You address him by that name and say, “You unclean spirit, I command you to come out in the Name of Jesus!” No devil can resist when you order them out in the Name of Jesus.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“…at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth”</em> (Philippians 2:10). Mark 6:7 says He gave us power over unclean spirits to cast them out. In Matthew 10:8, He was emphatic when He said, <em>“Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils....”</em> Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light (1 Peter 2:9 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As God’s children, we’re called to display the virtues and perfections of Christ; this is our ministry; this is our life. Jesus said, <em>“I am the vine, ye are the branches…”</em> (John 15:5). The branches are the fruit-bearing part of the vine. We bear His fruits, His virtues.</p>
<p>Hatred, bitterness, rage, lying, and the likes aren’t God’s virtues. Therefore, they aren’t part of the make-up or features of your recreated spirit. Rather, you’re to display God’s kindness, love, compassion, patience, meekness, gentleness, wisdom and excellence. Exude excellence in your home, school, place of work, and everywhere. Let it show in everything about you.</p>
<p>Furthermore, display His virtues and perfections through your gracious, soul-lifting and faith-inspiring words, full of life and power, converting the soul.</p>
<p>He’s made us wonders in this world; vessels to show forth His glory and righteousness. Through you, He expresses His love to others, establishing His Kingdom in the hearts of men. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world (1 John 2:15-16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s no doubt, the coming of the Lord is nearer than ever. But the Bible says, <em>“…for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition”</em> (2 Thessalonians 2:3). The Amplified Classic puts it thus: <em>“…for that day will not come except the apostasy comes first [unless the predicted great falling away of those who have professed to be Christians has come], and the man of lawlessness (sin) is revealed, who is the son of doom (of perdition).”</em></p>
<p>This means there’d be people who had professed to be Christians, but they’ll fall away from the Faith; there’ll be an apostasy—people giving up their faith in Jesus, by choice. This is already happening, and the major reason is the cares of this world; the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust for other things. So, what’s God looking at, and how should you walk in these last days? What choices should you make?</p>
<p>His counsel is what we read in our opening verse. Stay in Christ! Focus on the things of the Kingdom, and not on the transient pleasures of this world. Colossians 3:1 captures it beautifully. It says, <em>“If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.”</em></p>
<p>Focus your energies on fulfilling God’s dream, His vision of Kingdom expansion and world evangelisation. Refuse to be among those clinging to the things of the world, concerned only about their personal gain and comfort. They’ve been conquered by the spirit of the world. Jesus said, <em>“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”</em> (Mark 8:36). It’s so important that you live your life established in Christ, deeply rooted and founded in Him. Remain steadfast, unmoveable, doing the work of the Lord with joy. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God (Colossians 4:12).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God (Colossians 4:12).</strong></em></p>
<p>In the verse above, the words, “perfect” and “complete” could have been interchangeably used. In other words, in the place of “perfect” above, you could also have “complete,” and vice versa. </p>
<p>“Perfect” here is dealing with standing strong; unmoveable. It also means “mature”; to come to a state of perfection or maturity, to be “full grown.” It’s a place of fullness; fullness of understanding, wisdom and knowledge; fullness of the Spirit. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Thus, Epaphras, through the Spirit, was praying for the Colossian Christians to come to that place of maturity, standing strong, complete and perfect in Christ. God wants that in your life. He wants you to be a full-grown Christian, mature to do the things of God.</p>
<p>The more mature you are spiritually, the more you can actually fulfil God’s dream for your life. Therefore, set a goal for yourself for spiritual growth. Say to yourself, “I’m going to grow; I’m going to come to a place of maturity, where I only think spiritual, think mature in Christ, and full of God’s Word”; and proceed to achieve it.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:12-13 says God gave ministry gifts to the Church for this purpose: <em>“…the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.”</em></p>
<p>If it weren’t possible for us to attain the measure of the fullness of Christ, God wouldn’t tell us to go for it. This is His dream. Therefore, go for it by studying and meditating on the Word voraciously, and yielding yourself to the ministry of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways (Proverbs 23:26).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People are the same, irrespective of their condition. That is to say, the poor and the rich, for example, are exactly the same, except there’s a transformation in their hearts. If a man is poor and wicked, he won’t be different when he becomes rich. While poor, he doesn’t have the resources to carry out the wickedness in his heart. So, when he becomes rich, he’s able to prosecute the wickedness in his heart with his resources.</p>
<p>Money amplifies character. People only carry out the good or bad in their hearts, depending on their resources. Jesus said, <em>“Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt…”</em> (Matthew 12:33). This means people aren’t different from how they are inside. So, what does God want? He wants a change in your heart; a transformation inside.</p>
<p>That’s why He sets up His kingdom first in your heart. He puts His love first in your heart. Your heart is where He seeks to work; that’s where all His blessings are. Then from your heart, they can flow out to others. Being born again, you have the life and nature of God in your heart; and now in Christ, you’re a life-giver.</p>
<p>The transformation and glory evident in your soul and body are the result of the impact and influence of the life and nature of God in your spirit. In our theme verse, He says, <em>“My son, give me thine heart….”</em> If you’ve never been born again, this is your moment; give Him your heart. Turn to the Prayer Of Salvation page at the back of this devotional and pray that prayer, from the bottom of your heart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you (John 14:16-17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comforting and soul-lifting words above were spoken by Jesus prior to His ascension. He knew the disciples would miss Him; so He said, “Relax! I’m going to the Father, and I’ll ask Him to send you the Holy Spirit (another Comforter). When He comes, He’ll live in your heart, and you won’t have to look for me or feel my absence. Instead of walking in the streets with you, I’ll walk in the streets in you.” Glory to God!</p>
<p>Jesus fulfilled His promise and the Father sent the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost (read Acts 2:1-4). Now that you’re born again, you never have to look for Jesus; you never have to cry, “Lord, where are you?” He’s in you now! That means the presence of God is in your heart! I don’t know what your perception of God and Christianity has been prior to now; but know this, if you’ve received the Holy Spirit, you have God inside you. No wonder John said, “Ye are of God little children, and have overcome “your adversaries,” because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world” (1 John 4:4). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Irrespective of what you may be facing in your life, there’s a new revelation; it’s the revelation of divinity in you! Paul called it the mystery which was hidden in the past generations, but is now made manifest to God’s saints, which is <em>“...Christ in you, the hope of glory”</em> (Colossians 1:26-27).</p>
<p>Adam didn’t know it. Abraham didn’t know it. Isaac didn’t know it. None of the patriarchs of old knew this mystery. This is greater than “Emmanuel” (God with us); this is Heaven in you! The fullness of the Godhead fully tabernacled in you, and expressed through you! Blessed be God forever!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage (Galatians 2:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible tells us about these three groups: false teachers, false prophets, and false brethren. It also clearly shows us the different things they’ll do in these last days. Could there really be false brethren in churches? Absolutely! False brethren are those who come in amongst God’s people, not for their love for Jesus Christ, but for a different purpose.</p>
<p>Our opening verse says they come in unawares, to spy out our liberty in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage. They present a false image, in order to gain some advantage. The Bible says, <em>“And in their covetousness (lust, greed) they will exploit you with false (cunning) arguments…”</em> (2 Peter 2:3 AMPC).</p>
<p>False brethren always look for ways to make money off other brethren. Meanwhile, they’re the ones who neither tithe nor give in church. Their goal is to make merchandise of the brethren. They can do anything for money, including betraying their Pastor, leader, or even the church. They’re the ones who take church matters to the public or report to the authorities or news media for pecuniary reasons. The Bible says they’re among us to spy on us, hoping to get some matter of accusation against us.</p>
<p>It may not be so easy to identify false brethren because of their pretentious ways. But Jesus said, <em>“Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them”</em> (Matthew 7:20). One of the identifying signs of false brethren is that they despise authority. They’ll try to convince others on why they shouldn’t believe or do everything the Pastor or leadership of the church says. If they heard you wanted to seek pastoral guidance for something personal to you, for example, they’ll ridicule the idea and make you feel you’re being naïve.</p>
<p>God’s counsel to us concerning false brethren is that we mark, and not associate with them, because of their corrupting influence. Many true Christians have fallen away from the Faith because of such unwholesome association. Therefore, do what the Word says: “Withdraw yourself from every brother or sister that walks disorderly” (2 Thessalonians 3:6).</p>

<p><em><strong>Say a quiet yes to God and he’ll be there in no time. Quit dabbling in sin. Purify your inner life. Quit playing the field. Hit bottom, and cry your eyes out. The fun and games are over. Get serious, really serious (James 4:8-9 MSG).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ephesians 5:15-16 is an apt admonition for us especially in these last days. It says, <em>“See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise. Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. ”</em> The stakes are very high. You can’t live your life carelessly as a child of God. You belong to Jesus Christ; therefore, serve Him with your life. Live for Him.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s”</em> (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). God has a purpose for your life which you must fulfil. That’s the most important thing for you: discovering your purpose in Him and fulfilling it.</p>
<p>Life isn’t about your personal dreams, plans, aspirations or ambitions. The Bible says, <em>“Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness”</em> (2 Peter 3:11). It makes no difference what beautiful structures you see in this world or the earthly fulfilment of men; everything shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>It reminds of King Solomon who built God the most beautiful temple ever. It was greatly celebrated, and of course, God was happy with him and blessed him. But our God doesn’t live in temples made with hands. When they went into idolatry and began to serve Baal, the beautiful temple was destroyed; a resultant punishment for not walking in line with His Word.</p>
<p>God doesn’t care about earthly things. Everything you’ll ever have in this world came from something that was already here, and if that’s true, why don’t you live your life for the One who made all things originally? Serve Him with your life. Get serious, really serious with your service of the Lord.</p>

<p><em><strong>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you (James 4:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Christian, it’s important that you know how to take the life that God has given you seriously, and how to respond spiritually when certain things happen around you. This is why prayer is important. When we pray, something happens. He never told us to pray in vain. Whenever you have that urge to pray, don’t ignore it.</p>
<p>Everyone who has the Holy Spirit would have the urge to pray from time to time, because He Himself is the Spirit of prayer. He teaches us to pray, and He prays through us. He stirs our hearts to pray and even puts words in our mouths with which to pray. As long as you’re living a Spirit-led life, you’ll always have the urge to pray. Otherwise, how do you resist the devil?</p>
<p>The devil is a spirit being; we don’t resist him with muscles or physical might. We don’t resist him with earthly things; we resist him with our faith. The Bible says resist the devil and he’ll flee (James 4:7); he has no option. He’s terrified of us because of the Name of Jesus.</p>
<p>When you come to understand the enormous power given you to paralyse Satan’s activities—whether in your life, the lives of your loved ones, your city or nation—you’d love to pray! Don’t sit idly by and watch the devil run rampage around you. Pray. Use the Name of Jesus against him.</p>
<p>As you fellowship with God in prayer, the Holy Spirit will show you things to pray about and how to pray. He’ll teach you how to handle matters in the realm of the spirit and prevail. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you read in the verse above, <em>“…as he is, so are we in this world,”</em> it’s not talking about us being like Jesus before He died, but the resurrected Jesus with eternal life. We have the same life with Him now. The Bible says, <em>“He that hath the Son hath life…”</em> (1 John 5:12). If you have Jesus, you have eternal life—the God-life; it’s not the biological life with which you were born of your parents.</p>
<p>That’s why Jesus said, <em>“...Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God”</em> (John 3:3). And when He said your biological life can’t see the Kingdom of God, He wasn’t talking about just going to Heaven; He was talking about the reality of the Kingdom of God; the dominion of God in the world; the life and nature of God experienced in this world.</p>
<p>When you’re born again, you experience the kingdom of God now in this life; it becomes your everyday experience; your everyday walk. This is what Christianity is. Christ is literally alive in you; you’re inseparably one with Him. 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, <em>“But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.”</em> </p>
<p>Having become so mingled with the Lord in one spirit, how could you be bothered about viruses, bacteria, germs or anything that ravages the world? This is why John wants you to know what you have. He says, <em>“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life…”</em> (1 John 5:13).</p>
<p>When you understand who you are in Christ, you’d realise it’s impossible for you to be sick. Once you recognise and become conscious of your life in Him, you have nothing to fear in this world, because you’re indestructible. What a life He’s given us! Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s (1 Corinthians 6:20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 11:25, the Bible records that Jesus <em>took “...the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.”</em> His blood represents His life; He gave His life for us that we may live. It just lets you know how important you are to God. The Bible says we weren’t bought with silver or gold or precious stones but with the blood; the precious blood of Jesus Christ, Son of the living God (1 Peter 1:18-19).</p>
<p><em>“For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich”</em> (2 Corinthians 8:9). In your life, the most important thing you should have your mind on is that His blood, which represents His life, is your true value. And because of that blood, you’re protected. You’re God’s property; therefore, you’re not left to the dictates of your adversaries or the dominion of sin.</p>
<p>His blood speaks your righteousness. You’re purified and preserved by His blood. The Bible says, <em>“Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us”</em> (Hebrews 9:12). Thank God for the precious blood of Jesus Christ! Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life… (Revelation 22:19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many have assumed that when someone gives his heart to Christ, that’s when his name is written in the Book of Life. But that isn’t what the Bible teaches. It’s never really about your name being written in the Book of Life; the problem is about being removed from the Book of Life.</p>
<p>In Exodus 32:32, Moses said to God, <em>“…blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.”</em> Moses knew about the Book of Life; it’s not the book where your name is written when you’re born again, because Moses wasn’t “born again.” So, what’s the Book of Life? It’s the book where God registers everyone who was ever born into this world.</p>
<p>Read our theme verse again; it was a warning to everyone. God’s plan originally was to have every one of us with Him. The Bible says He’s <em>“...not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance”</em> (2 Peter 3:9). Everlasting fire was never prepared for human beings (Matthew 25:41), but for the devil and his angels. But God gave man the power of choice.</p>
<p>Whoever doesn’t find their names in the Book of Life eventually, have themselves to blame. God’s reply to Moses in Exodus 32:33 that we read earlier was, <em>“...Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book”</em> (Exodus 32:33). What this simply means is that you live your life unto God.</p>
<p>Walk every day in love and in righteousness, and your name will remain in the Book of Life. Live a life that glorifies Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:15 says, <em>“And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a certain day, as Jesus taught in one of the synagogues, He noticed a woman who was bent double; she couldn’t straighten herself. She had been in that condition for eighteen years. Then, Jesus said to her, <em>“...Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God”</em> (Luke 13:12-13).</p>
<p>Although the religious leaders present were indignant that Jesus healed the woman on a Sabbath day, the Master’s response revealed something striking. He said, <em>“…ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?”</em> (Luke 13:16).</p>
<p>The Master stated clearly that it was Satan who kept the woman in that condition through “a spirit of infirmity.” And as soon as He dealt with the spirit, the woman straightened up; she was made whole by the power of God.</p>
<p>Jesus understood the spirit world. He knew life was spiritual, and demon spirits are real and responsible for a lot of the infirmities that people suffer from. And through the Scriptures and insight He grants us by the Holy Spirit, we understand how to identify Satan and his works.</p>
<p>If you don’t know the Scriptures, you could be a victim of Satan’s devices. Study and meditate on the Word often; speak in tongues every day; be filled with the Spirit, and your spiritual alertness and sensitivity will always be at its peak. There’re spiritual dimensions to life. You need to know what God initiates, and what the devil instigates. The Bible says <em>“...we are not ignorant of his</em>(Satan’s) <em>devices”</em> (2 Corinthians 2:11).</p>

<p><em><strong>So then, just as you have received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in Him (Colossians 2:6 NIV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before we review Paul’s amazing submission in the verse above, let’s read what he said in the 20th verse: <em>“Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances”</em> (Colossians 2:20). Notice his amazing communication; he says the Christian doesn’t live in this world, in this natural plane of life. Where then does the Christian live? He lives in Christ!</p>
<p>Christ is the home and new environment of the one who’s born again. Notice 2 Corinthians 5:17; it says, “If any man <strong>be in Christ</strong>…”; Christ is a place. You’re not supposed to be affected, ruled or influenced by the rudiments of this world, because you live in a different environment. In that environment, everything is perfect; there’s no failure, weakness, defeat, sickness, disease, poverty or anything of darkness. We only have God’s glory and righteousness.</p>
<p>Now you can better understand what we read in our opening verse; <em>“just as you have received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in Him.”</em> Living in Christ is living in the kingdom of heaven in the earth, with absolute mastery over circumstances, shielded, nourished and protected by His divine power. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid (Matthew 5:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This present world is a world in spiritual darkness. It was the same in the days of Jesus. Recall at His arrest, He said, <em>“…this is your moment, the time when the power of darkness reigns”</em> (Luke 22:53 NLT). After Jesus ascended to heaven, the world remained in darkness. But you’re the solution to that darkness. We read in our opening verse that you’re the light of the world. You have to shine ever more brightly in these last days, through the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Our world isn’t for the devil; it’s for the Lord. He put us here to run this world with His light and righteousness from the realm of the Spirit. As you walk in faith, putting the Word to work and insisting on your divine rights and heritage in Christ, you’re making your light shine.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter the darkness in the world—the sickness, disease, poverty and insecurity ravaging this world—you’ve been empowered to rule and reign in Christ, through the Word. Others would see you and understand who a true Christian is; they’d see the glory and excellence of Christ in you.</p>
<p>Isaiah 60:1-2 says*, “Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.”* This is your moment to shine as the light in a dark world by walking in righteousness, prosperity, health, soundness of mind and body as guaranteed in the Word of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard... (Daniel 10:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re in a very special dispensation in God’s Kingdom. Through the knowledge of the Word, we’re guided by the Spirit to walk in accordance with His plan and timing.</p>
<p>For example, in Daniel 9, the Bible tells us that Daniel, while in exile with the children of Israel, understood God’s timing as he studied the writings of Jeremiah the Prophet. He found out they were meant to be in that captivity for seventy years and had almost exhausted their time in captivity. However, as nothing seemed to be changing, Daniel decided to seek the Lord in fasting and prayer to bring God’s programme into reality.</p>
<p>In the closing days of Jesus’ ministry in Israel, He wept over Jerusalem because they didn’t know the “time” of their visitation. The Lord whom they had been waiting for had come to them, but they didn’t know it. Many are like that today.</p>
<p>Make it your priority to be in sync with God’s will and timing for your life. Study the Scriptures avidly, and give time to prayer. We’re sent by God to enforce His will in the earth, using the Name of Jesus and the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>But if you don’t know God’s will and timing, things will happen in the earth that are neither in your interest nor in the Lord’s interest. This is why you must pray in the Spirit for the nations, for the Church of God, and for ministers of the Gospel around the world. Pray as though the kingdom depended on you, for it does. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world (1 John 4:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many don’t understand the Spirit’s language in the verse above when it says, “Ye are of God…”; it means you hail from God; you’re born of Him. This is what makes the Christian a divine being, and not a mere human person. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This is where some have missed it; their lack of consciousness of who they really are in Christ. The Apostle John, addressing this, said in 1 John 5:13, <em>“These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life….”</em> God wants you to have the conscious, active knowledge that His life is in you. You’re a divine life-carrier; a God-conveyor.</p>
<p>Referring to the Lord Jesus, the Bible says <em>“…in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him…”</em> (Colossians 2:9-10). Notice the expression, <em>“And ye are complete in Him….”</em> This means all of divinity resides in you as it does Jesus. No wonder Peter calls us “Associates of the God-kind”; partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4).</p>
<p>You’re filled or replete with God. That’s what it means to be “complete in Him”; nothing else needs to be in you to make you divine. This is why sickness, disease and infirmity can’t be a part of your life. If you’d meditate on the God-life in you, you’d never be sick another day of your life.</p>
<p>You were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:13). The same life that makes it impossible for God to get sick, be defeated or have anything “happen” to Him is what you have in you. Your consciousness of this reality will make you eternally triumphant and walk in dominion every day of your life. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding (Proverbs 3:5).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being trusting isn’t the same as being gullible, and recognising this distinction is essential because there’re gullible people who think they’re trusting. To be gullible means to be easily deceived. But children aren’t easily deceived; they’re usually trusting. They trust your character. Adults, however, can be gullible. An adult will try to reason out whatever he’s told before he trusts it, and he may not give much concern to the character of the one he’s trusting.</p>
<p>If you hold out a child from the balcony, for example, and ask someone else whom the child trusts to stay at the ground-floor and catch him, the child will be ready to let go because he trusts the one at the ground floor. The child may not know if the fellow downstairs has the power or ability to catch him, but he believes he wouldn’t let him fall. That’s the kind of childlike faith you’re to have towards God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus admonished in Matthew 18:3 (AMPC) that we be like little children, <em>“…[trusting, lowly, loving, forgiving]….”</em> He wants you to trust the character of God. His character is made plain in the Word; He never fails. Boldly place your confidence in Him to fulfil His purpose in your life.</p>
<p>Sometimes, many try to “help” God out in doing what He intends. Perhaps, He’s given you a vision or ministered some ideas to you relating to your purpose, and you’re so excited and eager to see everything work out, which is good! But if you’re not trusting and yielded to the Holy Spirit, you may try to play “God.” You may be playing His role by trying to help Him in your own wisdom. But the end result won’t be pleasant.</p>
<p>The best of all is to trust that He alone knows and has the blueprint for your life. Take a cue from Abraham who trusted and followed the Lord even though He didn’t know where God was leading Him. The Bible says, <em>“By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went”</em> (Hebrews 11:8).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water (John 7:38).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isaiah 12:3 says, <em>“Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.”</em> Wells of salvation refer to all the blessings of Christ inherent in the deep recesses of your spirit. The Bible says out of your spirit are the issues of life. You carry within you a fountain of blessings.</p>
<p>Now, the devil always seeks to block up “the wells.” Think about it in line with what happened in Bible days: whenever an invading force came into a city, they blocked up the wells in that city with dirt to frustrate the inhabitants. The wells were the people’s source of water—a spring of life, as it were.</p>
<p>Isaac suffered a similar ordeal in the hands of the Philistines. In Isaac’s case, the Bible records, <em>“For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth…And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham…”</em> (Genesis 26:15,18).</p>
<p>In the same way that the Philistines stopped the wells of water belonging to Isaac (in order to frustrate him), Satan seeks to clog the wells of living water in your spirit by ensuring the joy of Christ isn’t expressed in your life. He also wants to keep you from ministering the same joy to other people.</p>
<p>His tools for clogging your “wells” include bitterness, jealousy, hatred, resentment, unforgiveness, fear, and judgmental attitude. Don’t allow Satan plant such “dirts” in your life. He knows you can’t live happily, enjoy life or bless your world effectively when you’re angry, resentful and malicious.</p>
<p>Choose rather to let the joy and love of God radiate from within you to others every day and the devil will have no foothold in your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness. For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come (1 Timothy 4:7-8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exercising yourself unto godliness means exercising your human spirit, which is the real you. And one sure way to exercise your spirit is praying in tongues; it keeps your spirit aglow and afire for God. Jude 1:20 says, <em>“But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost.”</em> 1 Corinthians 14:4 says, <em>“He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself….”</em></p>
<p>Christians who regularly pray in tongues are more attuned to the things of the Spirit. They’re more sensitive and responsive to the leading and guidance of the Holy Spirit; no slothfulness in them. When you pray often in tongues, your spirit is trained and ready for dynamic evangelism.</p>
<p>Cultivate the habit of starting out your day speaking in tongues. Then at regular intervals during the course of your day, pray in tongues. The beautiful thing is, you can speak in tongues under your breath even while at work or conducting your business. It’s the fastest way to activate and energize your spirit.</p>
<p>There’re people who are more concerned about keeping their bodies fit than paying the most attention to exercising their spirits. As you train yourself to pray often in other tongues, apart from the many other benefits it has on your life, it’ll open your spirit to receive and understand God’s Word and enhance your walk in the divine life.</p>

<p><em><strong>...Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour (Matthew 8:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a certain occasion, after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples as they rounded off a fruitless fishing mission. The disciples had toiled all night and caught nothing. Then Jesus said to them, <em>“...Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you shall find...”</em> (John 21:6). The Bible says, <em>“…they threw the net out and could not pull it back in, because they had caught so many fish”</em> (John 21:6 TEV).</p>
<p>Imagine if they had argued with Jesus! They had faith in His Word and that’s where the fish came from— the Word of God. The Bible says, <em>“Through faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God...”</em> (Hebrews 11:3). The fishes were framed by the Word of the Master. Jesus set a precedence for us on how to live triumphantly every day, how to experience the miraculous through faith in the Word.</p>
<p>Consider this: A certain Centurion’s servant was sick and dying. Then the Centurion sent the elders of the Jews to beseech Jesus to come heal his servant. The Master agreed, but almost immediately, the Centurion sent words back to Jesus saying, “You don’t have to come under my roof; just say the word, and my servant shall be healed” (Luke 7:2-7).</p>
<p>When Jesus heard the words of the Centurion, the Bible says He marvelled at his faith and said, “I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.” When the messengers got back to the Centurion’s house, they found the sick servant perfectly whole at the word of Jesus (Luke 7:9-10).</p>
<p>What’s your desire? In which area do you require a change or a miracle? Act your faith in God’s Word. The Word of God is the answer to every trouble. You don’t have to become suicidal because you lost your job or business. You can trust the Lord for something better. He’s the God who quickens (gives life to) the dead. He can give you back, and much more, all that you thought you lost.</p>
<p>Even now, act on His Word. He said in John 14:14, <em>“If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it”</em>; ask whatever you will, knowing He’s bound by His Word and never fails.</p>
