<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth (Philippians 2:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A certain lady called her daughter who lived in the United Kingdom on the phone and said, “I’m coming to see you with two dangerous friends, because in the cult that I belong to, it’s my turn to sacrifice my own daughter. So, the three of us are coming to see you.” Now, they lived in a different continent, but she said, “We’d come into the house through the front door as insects—like tiny grasshoppers.”</p>
<p>Then, she warned the daughter, “I’ll be in front, the other two will be behind, but you have to kill them immediately, because their mission is to kill you.” On the day appointed, her daughter was waiting in the UK, and sure enough, these three insects came through the door, one after the other. Even though she was scared stiff, she did as her mother had instructed. When she killed the last two insects, the first one (her mother), disappeared. Soon afterwards, there was news in their home country that the two ladies suddenly died.</p>
<p>This isn’t a mere story. If you study the Scriptures, you’d observe that demon spirits are real and have come into people’s homes and lives through animals, birds, insects, etc. Recall that in the Book of Genesis, Satan came in through the serpent. What does this tell you? Not every insect or animal is normal. Some people got a bite from an insect and they ignored it, not knowing that the insect was just the clothing for the real spirit that was behind it. A legion of demons requested permission of Jesus to enter into a herd of swine (Mark 5:11-13).</p>
<p>Life is spiritual. There’re things you just can’t ignore or take lightly, including seemingly “little pains”; deal with them with God’s Word and the Name of Jesus. Some of the eventually serious problems many have suffered came from something they thought was minor. They never used what Jesus gave us: His Name, His authority; consequently, their condition became debilitating and deadly.</p>
<p>Be discerning and bold to cast out devils, in whatever form they may come. Before you start thinking about “medicine” due to pain or a symptom you noticed in your body, rebuke the devil, who is more likely to be the culprit. Remember, Jesus said we would cast out demons in his name (Mark 16:17).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me (Psalm 187:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Sun of Righteousness; when you focus on Him, you’ll not see the debilitating and crippling influences around you. Too many people focus attention on challenges and problems; they keep thinking about the troubles and hardships in the world when they ought to focus on Christ. Christ is your all; Christ is your life; Christ is the solution to every problem. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>What this means, therefore, is that if you’re in Christ, that is, if you’re born again, you have nothing to fear; you need not worry about problems, tests, trials, and adversities. That’s because in Christ you’re a victor. The Bible says, count it all joy when you go through diverse tests (James 1:2). Colossians 1:27 says, <em>“Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</em> What does this mean? It doesn’t mean that you should hope for glory because Christ is in you; rather, it means you have a guaranty, a certainty that everything in life will produce glory for you because Christ is in you.</p>
<p>Christ in you is your assurance or certainty that divine health is yours. Christ in you is your confidence that you’ll never be defeated, broke or despondent in life. Christ in you is your assurance that your life will forever be excellent and full of glory. This is the reason you have to be Christ-conscious at all times. Focus on Christ. Romans 8:10 says, <em>“And if Christ is in you, though your body be dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.”</em></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what happens or has happened to your body, Christ is the answer! Christ in you makes you excellent and sound. Meditate on Christ. Think about who He is to you, who you are in Him and His ministry in you today. 1 John 4:4 says, <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”</em> His presence in you makes you an over-comer and more than a conqueror.

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust (1 Timothy 1:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Apostle Paul took personal responsibility for the Gospel. His words in our theme verse show, that to him, the Gospel was a sacred trust. In 1 Corinthians 9:16, he said, <em>“…necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!”</em> Again, in 1 Timothy 1:12, he declared, <em>“…I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry.”</em></p>
<p>Your conviction about the Gospel must be absolute. Think about it: the salvation of lost souls is God’s number one passion; it’s all that heaven stands for. Yet, God committed such a great commission and responsibility to you and me. This is something to be hallowed; too sacrosanct to take likely.</p>
<p>In Mark 16:15, Jesus said, <em>“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature”</em>; this is the Great Commission. The question is, “Can God trust you to fulfil it?” Are you about His business, or you’re still busy pursuing your own dreams? Let the Gospel, and its spread around the world, mean more to you than anything else in this world. Be committed to it, irrespective of the oppositions you might face.</p>
<p>Take a cue from Paul; even when the Holy Spirit expressly testified that he’d suffer severe afflictions and be imprisoned if he went to preach in Jerusalem (Acts 20:22-23), he was undaunted. His response was: <em>“…none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God”</em> (Acts 20:24). Talk about burning your bridges? That’s it!</p>
<p>Be an activist for the Gospel. None of the adversities that you face can defeat you if you stand your ground and refuse to quit. Remember that God counted you faithful and committed the Gospel to your trust; He believes in you. So, be an effective witness of the Lord Jesus Christ, and do it passionately with joy. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints (Ephesians 6:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, there’re those who wonder what the Spirit meant when He said through the Apostle Paul, <em>“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit.”</em> But it’s very clear. Another translation says, “With every kind of prayer.” He’s saying to you, “I want you to pray in the spirit with every kind of prayer.” In other words, there’re different kinds of prayer. Now, whether it’s a prayer of faith, a prayer of thanksgiving, a prayer of intercession, a prayer of agreement, the prayer of dedication or consecration or prophetic prayer, add to it, praying in the spirit.</p>
<p>Praying in the spirit is one kind of prayer, but he’s telling us that with all the different kinds of prayer, we should pray in the spirit. Don’t say, “I’m not praying in the spirit today, because I’m praying a prayer of intercession.” No, we can’t leave out the spirit when it comes to prayers; we must pray in other tongues. That’s what praying in the spirit is; it means that the prayer is coming from the inspiration of your spirit, uttered in other tongues.</p>
<p>For instance, when you want to pray the prayer of faith, you may start by speaking in tongues, before going ahead to release those declarations of faith. It’s like saying to you, “With every food, take water”; meaning whether you’re eating a protein meal or vegetables, irrespective of the type of food, drink water along with it. The Apostle Paul, while communicating this truth to the Corinthian Church, said, <em>“For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also”</em> (1 Corinthians 14:14-15).</p>
<p>Take this seriously; pray always in the spirit, and your life will be so upgraded to enjoy ever-increasing glory; you’ll be vibrant and exuberant with praise at all times; more effective in your Christian walk, and circumstances will be under your feet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold (Proverbs 8:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spiritual instructions may come to you in the most unexpected or unusual way, but be quick to carry them out. Proverbs 4:13 says, <em>“Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.”</em> Sometimes, what you need for your next level isn’t so much a “big idea,” as it is heeding a simple instruction.</p>
<p>Consider the Lord’s instructions to Joshua for instance. He was instructed to take over and subdue Jericho (Joshua 6:2-5). From the human standpoint, that was an impossible venture, because Jericho was one of the most fortified cities at the time. But Joshua followed the Lord’s instructions and the result was victory for the children of Israel.</p>
<p>Some people would give anything for secondary factors such as money, human connections and uncertain philosophies in their attempt at success. But they ignore the surest measure for guaranteed progress in life: following God’s Word—doing things God’s way. His instructions convey His wisdom, which if followed would lead to success, victory, excellence and glory. Realise that in life, your victories are, and would be, entirely dependent on divine strategies given to you by God through the Spirit and His Word. Therefore, consciously practise fellowship with the Holy Spirit and the Word. That’s where you receive His instructions and guidance that put you over circumstances and the adversities of life.</p>
<p>Every instruction of the Spirit is entrenched in the infallible principles of God’s Word. Such instructions may not be spectacular, but they always produce the supernatural. Therefore, always act on the instructions of the Spirit in divine wisdom. When you do, it’ll make no difference the “wall” you’re faced with in your life; it could be the wall of sickness or financial trouble, but they’ll crumble before you. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera (Judges 5:20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A certain Pastor was posted to a Church for a new assignment; the Church hadn’t grown for many years. So, when he resumed, he decided to fast and pray. One day, while he was praying in the church building, he saw a huge animal, a beast, and as he turned to it, the beast said, “I will not allow you take my people from me. I’ve been in charge of this church for many years.” In response, the Pastor said, “They’re God’s people; they’re not your people and you will leave this Church today, and never return.”</p>
<p>The animal got infuriated and charged toward him; but unafraid, the Pastor declared, “In the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, get out NOW!” The beast fell down, and scampered out of the church, to never return. The very next service, when the people came to church, they worshipped and praised God like they’d never done. It was obvious that there was a new move of the Spirit, and the church began to experience unprecedented growth. The devil had been taken out.</p>
<p>Members of the church didn’t know there was an evil force affecting the people inside the church. But thanks be unto God that the Pastor knew exactly what to do. We’re not to negotiate with the “adversary”— that’s one of Satan’s names (1 Peter 5:8). It tells you something; he is one who withstands you in anything. Don’t tolerate or accommodate him around you; get on the offensive.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:12 says, <em>“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”</em> Notice that it says, “We wrestle not against…,” not “We wrestle not at all.” Many struggle in life, unable to actualize their dreams, not realizing they’re in a warfare. When the forces are up against you, there’s something behind it. Therefore, use what you have; use the name of Jesus. Don’t fold your arms and watch things go wrong; operate in the spirit; rebuke the adversary and maintain that which the Lord has given you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Take with you words,</strong></em> <em><strong>and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips (Hosea 14:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Words are the greatest assets in the world, far more valuable than gold and diamonds. There’s nothing else that could change your life and situation, and give you permanent victory in life, more than words—the right words. Anyone who understands and functions in this truth is made for life. Study the Bible: all the great characters we read and admire were made with words.</p>
<p>What created or gave rise to a David? Words! What helped David defeat Goliath? You may say, “Five smooth stones,” no; it was words. When he picked the stones, he relied on words; study the account in 1 Samuel 17. He was sure of defeating Goliath because he put his faith on words.</p>
<p>Words are things; they’re latent with spiritual energy. The whole world was created with words. And who is Jesus Himself? The Word! (John 1:1). Jesus is the result of words spoken by God. In the Scriptures, Moses was described as a man mighty in words; so was Jesus likewise described.</p>
<p>Invest your life in words. Much more than you’d look for gold and want to test the quality to be sure it’s the right one, go for words. Fill your heart, your mind and your life with the right quality of words. Don’t store every kind of words in you, for words kill and words make alive. Colossians 3:16 tells you the kind of words to store up in you. It says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly...”;</em> keep them (God’s words) in the midst of your heart (Proverbs 4:21).</p>
<p>Never be too busy to study the Bible to learn and store up God’s Word in you. It’s what you’d need in the day of adversity, and for an extraordinary life of success. Our opening verse says, “Take with you words”; you can’t take with you what isn’t in you. So, keep investing in the greatest asset: words! When you face crises, don’t cry. Don’t panic. Speak words. Jesus said you shall have what you say (Mark 11:23); so, speak and effect a change. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing (Genesis 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Christian, you must have the consciousness of a blessed person. Affirm always that you’re blessed and highly favoured everywhere, at all times and in every situation. When you have this consciousness, even if you applied for something or went somewhere and were rejected, you’ll be unperturbed. That’s because you know who you are, and those who rejected you don’t. If they knew you, they wouldn’t reject you.</p>
<p>Imagine Jesus at the well of Samaria: when He asked the woman for water, she refused. She said, “You’re not supposed to be asking me for water because you’re a Jew, and I’m Samaritan” (John 4:9). She rejected Jesus! Why? She didn’t know she was addressing the messiah; but, the Master wasn’t offended. He simply said to her, <em>“If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water”</em> (John 4:10).</p>
<p>Jesus knew who He was; so, He wasn’t moved by that rejection. A child of God can be rejected, his true nature in Christ is unknown. He too may not even know himself. But when you discover that you’re an heir of God, a sanctified conveyor of divine verities, things will change. You’ll go everywhere with boldness, and if they turn you down anywhere, it’ll mean nothing to you. You’ll only say, “If only they knew me!”</p>
<p>God said to Abraham, “I’ll bless you and make you a blessing.” You’re the seed of Abraham; that means because of your presence in any place, such places are blessed. The divine influence comes upon the places you go, and the people with whom you interact. There’s something that follows you; it’s called, “the blessing”; grace! When you walk into a building, salvation comes into that house! Blessings begin to manifest. Blessed be God!</p>
<p>That you were denied a job offer or business contract doesn’t make you a loser; far from it! Your work or business is an opportunity for you to bless your world; your door to the world, to express yourself and the perfections that God has put within your system. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine (Psalm 50:10-11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as in our opening verse, in Haggai 2:8, the Lord asserts His sovereignty over the earth’s resources saying, <em>“The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.”</em> David minced no words about this either, as he profusely acknowledged the Lord as the creator and owner of all things: <em>“The earth is the LORD’S, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein”</em> (Psalm 24:1).</p>
<p>What does this mean for us? It means we’re as much the possessors of the earth’s riches and wealth as God almighty, because we’re His heirs. Romans 8:17 says, <em>“And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ….”</em> Sadly, in spite of this truth, many Christians still find themselves struggling financially, unable to prosecute their dreams. The problem, for the most part, is ignorance. They’re ignorant that God, who is their source, lives in them, and that as a result, all the prosperity, wealth or finances they’ll ever need, will spring forth from within them.</p>
<p>2 Peter 1:3 says, <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness….”</em> Your wealth is within you; bring it forth. Jesus said in Matthew 12:35, <em>“A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things….”</em> Don’t lament that the reason you’re unable to execute your projects is due to unpaid allowances and remunerations. Those are channels, but God is your source. And He’s made all you require available to you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Refuse to limit your finances to anything that you see, or the so-called earthly sources. The truth is, there’re no earthly sources; they’re all channels, and you must look beyond these channels! Your one and only true source is your heavenly Father, and you’re plugged into His eternal supply, where you never run dry. He’s the Great Provider, and He lives in you. If you wanted a facility for your business or funding for your projects, first bring it forth from within! Look beyond the government, men, and your employer and family members when it comes to your finances. Hallelujah! They may be channels, but your source is the Lord.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God… (Hebrews 11:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Greek word “aion,” translated, “worlds” above refers to “course of life”; the structure and administration of one’s life; how things go with you and how they work around you from day to day, including how they affect your hopes and aspirations. Our opening verse shows that with your faith and through God’s Word, you can frame the course of your life to be consistent with God’s plan and be everything you want to be.</p>
<p>Read our opening verse again; it says through faith, the world’s system, with respect to socio-economic structures and environmental management, were programmed through words that came out of the mouth of God. This is the power of prophecy! Today’s world was shaped by prophetic words of years ago.</p>
<p>Now, if the successive ages of men and societies were framed by God’s prophetic words, and we’re born after Him, it, therefore, shows the right we have to determine what should happen in our lives and in our world. You’re to reprogramme your life and create your future with the words you speak. If you haven’t been doing this, begin today to frame your life, your world, and your times! What kind of life do you want to have in the next ten, twenty or thirty years? It all depends on you.</p>
<p>Many who are in debt, defeat, despondency, sickness and frustration today, framed their lives that way many years ago with their words. If that has happened to you, here’s the good news: you can begin to re-programme your life with the Word, and it starts first, by changing your way of thinking. The Apostle Paul said in Romans 12:2, <em>“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”</em></p>
<p>Through the ministry of the Word, you experience a metamorphosis —a transformation in your life and circumstances from glory to glory. You’re able to scrutinize and disallow illegal transactions and imports such as sickness, poverty, death, defeat, etc., from your “aion”—your course of life. Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. (Psalm 87:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re many beautiful and glorious descriptions of the new creation in the Scriptures. It’s one of the reasons you must study the Bible to know more about the glorious things spoken and written of you in the Word. What name has God called you? Answer that name, for you’ll cheat yourself if you don’t.</p>
<p>In Genesis 17:5, God spoke to Abram and said, <em>“Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.”</em> “Abram” meant exalted father, but God had a different plan for him and called him the “father of many nations.”</p>
<p>Abraham immediately adjusted to his new reality and identity, introducing himself by his new name. Some must have made jest of Abraham when he changed his name. Recall also that Sarah, his wife was barren; another hopeless case.</p>
<p>But Abraham was fully persuaded by God’s Word, and called himself what God had called him. In the same way, you have to learn to agree with God and His Word. Accept your new identity and reality in Christ. He’s called you holy, righteous, prosperous, victorious, more than a conqueror, etc. Walk in agreement with God, with His description and perception of you.</p>
<p>When Paul wanted to address the Christians at Ephesus, he referred to them as saints, and the faithful (Ephesians 1:1). That’s your description as well. If you aren’t a saint, then it means you’re not born again, because saints are those who are born again. In Colossians 1:22, He calls you holy, unblameable and unreproveable. Accept and walk in the light of these truths and you’ll be ever productive in your faith-walk of righteousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it (Numbers 13:30 NKJV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Numbers 13 tells the story of how God, instructing Moses to send a man out of every tribe to spy out the land of Canaan. These twelve men were to infiltrate Canaan and report back to Moses. However, when they returned to the camp with the feedback of their surveillance, they all confirmed the land of Canaan to be a magnificent country—a land flowing with milk and honey—and even presented some of its fruit as proof.</p>
<p>But quite sadly, ten out of the twelve spies bewailed their weakness, and how the inhabitants of Canaan were fierce, and how huge and well fortified their cities were. Worse yet, they lamented how fear gripped their hearts on sighting the descendants of the giant, Anak in the land. Read their distressing report in Numbers 13:31, 33.</p>
<p>This news of gloom of how the land devours its inhabitants aroused discouragements in the hearts of the Israelites. But two of these spies— Caleb and Joshua—spoke differently. They saw victories and possibilities; therefore, they interrupted the people saying, <em>“…Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it”</em> (Numbers 13:30). They further charged the assembly, <em>“Just don’t rebel against GOD! And don’t be afraid of those people. Why, we’ll have them for lunch! They have no protection and GOD is on our side. Don’t be afraid of them!”</em> (Numbers 14:9 MSG).</p>
<p>Never be intimidated by your detractors and adversaries. If you’re a business person for example, don’t wallow in deep thoughts about how influential your competitors are or get intimidated by the high-rise conglomerates close to you. Don’t become unsettled at the many blue-chip multinationals you have to contend with. You’re the seed of Abraham; therefore, you have the advantage.</p>
<p>See and talk differently. See through the eyes of the Spirit. See through the Word. Irrespective of the daunting challenges that may stare you in the face, see your victory, success, your triumphs and your advancements. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>And have clothed yourselves with the new [spiritual self], which is [ever in the process of being] renewed and remolded into [fuller and more perfect knowledge upon] knowledge after the image (the likeness) of Him Who created it (Colossians 3:10 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Greek word translated “renewed” above is the verb “Anakainoo,” and it means a qualitative difference, in terms of newness and quality.  It’s  a  word  that  describes  a  keyword  in  2 Corinthians 3:18: <em>“But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”</em></p>
<p>The Greek word translated “Changed” is “metamorphoo”; a change in state, form, kind, quality or glory; a continuous transformation. But how is it done? It’s through knowledge, full and exact knowledge (Greek: “epignosis”). This isn’t just the knowledge of mere or distant acquaintance, but one that relates with that which is known. You  ’re being renewed in this full knowledge of God which you gain through meditation and revelation.</p>
<p>In “Epignosis,” you become what you know; the knowledge that’s granted you transforms your life. As you receive God’s Word into you, your spirit is renewed, refreshed, polished anew; you glow more and more! It’s the reason you must let the Word of God dwell in you richly, because the more you know Him, the more the glory, grace, wisdom and effectiveness of the Spirit are manifested and increased in your life.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63, “<em>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.”</em> It’s only God’s Word that can impact, transform, brighten and glorify the human spirit.</p>

<p><em><strong>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak (John 12:49-50).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak</strong></em> <strong>(John 12:49-50).</strong></p>
<p>Jesus tells us in the verse above that His words are the Father’s commandments; everything He said came from the Father. In other words, the Father gave Him a commandment of what He should say or what He should speak. What He said in the next verse is even more inspiring. He said, <em>“And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak”</em> (John 12:50). Amazing!</p>
<p>In John 20:21, Jesus said, <em>“…peace be unto you. As my Father had sent me even so send I you.”</em> Notice that He wasn’t only talking to James, John, Peter or the other Apostles, but to us today. Thus, the same way He spoke the Father’s words, we’re to speak heavenly words; divine words. We’ve been given a commandment of what we should say, and what we should speak.</p>
<p>In Christianity, we don’t live for ourselves; we live for Him. We don’t speak for ourselves or from ourselves; we speak for Him, and from Him, just like Jesus. We have words given to us to speak. Hebrews 13:5-6 says <em>“…for he hath said…So that we may boldly say….”</em> Speak heavenly words. Speak heavenly words like Jesus, and live the life of heaven on earth.</p>
<p>God designed divinity to be released through words! Words are unlimited and eternal; they go into the realm of the spirit. You can speak from your closet and it will have impact anywhere in the world. Therefore, when you have a situation to deal with, meditate on the Word; soak your spirit in the Word until only the Word comes out of your mouth; divine words from heaven. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them (2 Corinthians 4:3-4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our theme scripture is quite instructive; it reveals the reason certain people find it difficult to give their hearts to Jesus Christ; Satan is behind it. Once, I ministered to someone who was willing to give his life to Christ, but he was reluctant to confess the Lordship of Jesus. I knew what the problem was. So, I said, “In the Name of Jesus, you lying devil, come out of him!” Instantly, he opened his mouth and made the confession of the Lordship of Jesus Christ, and he was born again. Glory to God!</p>
<p>There’re people who won’t give their lives to Jesus Christ because demon spirits wouldn’t let them. That’s why it’s important to intercede for the lost, rebuking the devil and the darkness in their hearts, so they’d receive the glorious light of the Gospel of Christ. Think about the fact that a fellow left his house, willing to go to church, but as soon as he approached the entrance of the church, he wouldn’t go in. The brethren tried every way to persuade him to enter the church, but he wouldn’t budge. An evil spirit that had followed him all his life would let him go anywhere else, but church.</p>
<p>However, while he was at the door, the Word of God was being taught inside the church. And suddenly, he became calm, and entered for the service. As those who had tried to persuade him began to wonder at the sudden change of mind, he said to them, “A spirit walked out of me.”</p>
<p>Imagine how many people want to come to church or give their lives to Christ, but are being hindered by the devil. But that’s where we come in. Jesus gave us authority to cast out devils (Mark 16:17); it’s one of the signs of our divinity. So, in preaching the Gospel, when you find people who seem to be resisting the message, intercede for them, that the devil would lose his grip on them. Don’t give up on anyone, for anyone can accept the Gospel of Christ and be saved.</p>

<p><em><strong>And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it (John 14:13-14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prior to His ascension, the Lord Jesus said, <em>“All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost”</em> (Matthew 28:18-19). All authority in heaven and earth has been given to Jesus. Everything that exists in this world and beyond is subject to the Name of Jesus. What does this mean? It means everything is subject to you, because you live in His Name. His Name belongs to you.</p>
<p>When you speak in His Name, your words carry the same power and authority as though Jesus Himself were the one speaking. His Name has power everywhere. It has power over governments, devils, principalities, and powers. Hallelujah! Use that Name.</p>
<p>Read our opening scripture again. This is talking about making demands in the Name of Jesus and bringing all things into subjection to you. Peter acted on this when he said to a man who was crippled from birth, “In the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.” He then got the crippled man by the right hand, pulled him up, and his ankle bones received strength; healed by the power of God (Acts 3:6-8).</p>
<p>You have the greatest blessing and gift of all times; the Name of Jesus; use it every day, and everywhere. When you make a demand or decree a thing in His Name, He sees to it that it happens. His Name is the solution to every problem. It makes no difference the predicament you’re in; declare, “In the Name of the Lord Jesus, I’m more than a conqueror. Everything is subject to me. Blessed be God!” With His Name, you can never be defeated; you have dominion over Satan and the powers of darkness. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ (Galatians 3:27).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This verse refers to two different phenomena. Firstly is baptism into Christ, and secondly, putting on Christ. Baptism into Christ is like water into water; inseparable oneness. Putting on Christ is living in His new environment and character. You’ve been completely immersed in Him that Christ is all there is about you and seen in you.</p>
<p>This is your reality now; you’ve put on Christ by virtue of the New Birth; you’re in Him and He is in you: <em>“…we dwell in him, and he in us…”</em> (1 John 4:13). Colossians 3:3-4 says your life is hid with Christ in God, and Christ is your life. Hallelujah! Make this your consciousness and confession. Every so often, you say, “Christ is my life. Christ is my dwelling place. I live in the environment called Christ.”</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 says, <em>“If any man be in Christ….”</em> That’s the place; it’s the habitation of glory. Sickness, disease, infirmity, fear, unbelief, and darkness of any kind can’t be found in Christ. When you came into Christ, the depraved, defeated, and broken human life was supplanted with the God-nature; you came into righteousness, honour, peace and glory. You were dead, but came alive in Him.</p>
<p>Think about it: since you’re immersed in Christ, and everything about your life is Christ, how then could you be said to have an incurable disease? How could you have a blood or heart condition? It’s not possible! The problems, the darkness, misery, pains and challenges that were associated with your natural human life, have all passed away in Christ.</p>
<p>The latter part of 2 Corinthians 5:17 in NKJV says, <em>“… behold, all things have become new.”</em> God wants you to see, reckon, and have the consciousness that you’re in a new enclave, a new home called Christ, where everything about your life is transcendent; excellent and full of glory! Therefore, walk boldly and fearless, full of faith and confidence, because you’re in Christ; divinely protected from all evil and made victorious. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away (Matthew 24:35).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God’s Word is ever sure; surer than your experiences. Psalm 18:30 says, <em>“As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.”</em> One of the things that you have to consciously practise is taking God at His Word; acting on His Word, no matter the circumstances or situation you find yourself in. His Word has integrity.</p>
<p>He said in Isaiah 55:11, <em>“So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”</em> Maybe it’s a health crisis you’re confronted with; the Word guarantees your divine health. There’s no need to cry and beg God for healing; He already gave you something better than healing—His life in you. That’s your right and assurance for a life of dominion over sickness, disease and infirmities.</p>
<p>Have faith in God’s Word. Accept that whatever He says is true, and then act accordingly. The entire Scriptures chronicle everything that  ’s involved in Christ’s redemptive work, the implication of all that He accomplished in your behalf, and the testament sealed in His death. Not only are these accounts authentic and trustworthy, they were delivered to us to live by.</p>
<p>Therefore, it makes no difference what you feel, hear, see or what your experience has been; the Bible says, <em>“We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts”</em> (2 Peter 1:19). There’s something more trustworthy than your experience; than the pain you may be going through; it’s the Word of His grace. Hold on to God’s Word. Things may not seem to be changing on the outside, but keep affirming the Word concerning that situation, until faith rises in you like a giant. Faith accepts and exalts the Word above the natural circumstances of life. This is why it’s vital for you to regularly meditate on the Word and build your faith strong. When your faith is strong, it doesn’t matter what you see, hear or feel—it doesn’t matter how negative or impossible things may look in the natural—you’ll always win.</p>

<p><em><strong>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places (Ephesians 6:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the challenges that some people are faced with in life are caused by demons, especially the ones the Bible describes as the rulers of the darkness of this world. They’re largely responsible for the anger, frustration and depression that people experience in their lives. Most don’t know it, but anger, especially uncontrolled anger, often leads to regrettable extremities. In many cases, a demon is behind uncontrollable anger.</p>
<p>It’s clear from our opening verse: flesh and blood, that is, fellow humans aren’t your problem. Any horrible experience or action against you by someone is often the result of whatever evil spirit or force influencing that person or the situation. So, the real culprit is the devil. What you’re supposed to do is to cast the devil out, and you can do that even without confronting the person. Demons will hear and obey you even from afar as distance isn’t a factor in the exercise of spiritual authority.</p>
<p>As a Christian, don’t be casual with, or ignorant of demonic activities. Stay in God’s Word and be quick to exercise your dominion in Christ. If you’re a parent for example, it matters where your children go to school or even the hospitals they visit. Take authority over such places and be spiritually perceptive.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you even find pastors and ministers of the Gospel who are having challenges with demonic forces in their ministry. They gather people, and suddenly, demons stir up some trouble, and the church is left in disarray; then they start all over again. Things like these happen to people, causing them frustration because they haven’t understood, and therefore, aren’t doing what Jesus told us to do, which is to cast out devils.</p>
<p>Notice that it’s the first thing Jesus said we would do in His Name, letting us know the importance. So, once you notice Satan’s activities in anything concerning you, knowing that oftentimes he acts incognito, cast him out. Don’t pray against people; deal with the spirit behind it and you’ll see remarkable changes.</p>

<p><em><strong>The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me… (Psalm 138:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scripture above should give you absolute confidence in life, because it shows that your future is secure. Think about the fact that the Lord Himself is the One who perfects all that concerns you! That means you have nothing to worry about. I was so delighted to make this discovery as a young lad many years ago. It made me know that my future was secure. He that owns tomorrow perfects my life and all that concerns me. Hallelujah! Make that your daily confession.</p>
<p>Acts 14:17 AMPC declares that the Lord gives you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons; He satisfies your heart with nourishment and happiness. Blessed be His Name forever! Trust the Lord with your life. Don’t say, “Well, I don’t know what tomorrow holds; life is full of ups and downs.” Don’t talk like that! Your tomorrow is settled.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah 29:11, He said, <em>“For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.”</em> There’s an expected end; the script has been written: you’ll forever be a victor! You already won, because everything in life has been programmed for your advantage (Romans 8:28).</p>
<p>Read Isaiah 54:17 and notice how the Lord brags about your invincibility and the fact that you have nothing to fear. He said, <em>“…No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn….”</em></p>
<p>Your life is for the glory of God. Nothing in this world can defeat you or put you under. There’s nothing to struggle with or try to overcome, because you have triumphed already in Christ; refuse to think otherwise. Don’t allow the circumstances rob you of your joy, fulfilment and peace.</p>
<p>Peace is a consequence of trust, and trust is a product of knowledge. This is why you must get to know the Lord for yourself in such a personal way, through study and meditation on the Word. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made (John 1:1-3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just as no other apostle gave us the revelation of the Church like Paul, no one gave the Church the revelation of the Person of Jesus, the incarnate Word, like John. He tells us the story of the Word, and starts from the beginning. In John 1:10-14 He says, <em>“He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not…. And the Word was made (became) flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.”</em> Hallelujah</p>
<p>He was in the world, but the world knew Him not; who was that? The Word! We read in verse 14, <em>“And the Word was made</em> (became) <em>flesh, and dwelt among us…”</em>; John is letting you know the origin of Jesus. While the other Gospel writings (Matthew and Luke) began their account by tracing the earthly genealogy of Jesus, John’s Gospel declares His divinity, giving us the actual origin of the man Jesus—who He really is.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the Word that pre-existed creation and by whom all things were created (John 1:1-3). He was <em>“the Voice of the Lord God” that Adam and Eve heard walking in the garden”</em> (Genesis 3:8). He is the Wisdom that David and Solomon wrote so passionately about. His birth was such a marvel to the hosts of heaven; it was a miracle beyond what they had ever seen (Luke 2:13-14).</p>
<p>Suddenly, they were looking at the Creator of the universe, the Ancient of days, wrapped in swaddling clothes; the Word in heaven had visited men in the flesh! Every step Jesus took was the Word of God in motion. He was the Word personified. Glory to His Name forever!</p>

<p><em><strong>…we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us (2 Corinthians 4:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is so profound! There’re treasures in you; divine treasures. Hallelujah! It brings to mind the words of Jesus in Matthew 12:35: <em>“A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things….”</em> Every good thing you require in life is already in the treasure domiciled in your spirit; it’s in you. What many haven’t learnt is how to bring forth that which they require from within. Jesus said out of your belly shall flow rivers of living waters (John 7:38); He didn’t say they shall flow from heaven. So, how do you activate the treasure in you?</p>
<p>Philemon 1:6 gives us an important insight; it says, <em>“That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.”</em> There’re three keywords in that verse. The first is “communication,” translated from the Greek word “koinonia,” and it means fellowship or participation. The second word is “effectual,” which derives from the Greek word “energes”; and it means to become active or operative. The Lord wants your participation or fellowship in the faith to become active, to produce results through the acknowledging of every good thing, which is in you in Christ Jesus. That’s the third key word, “acknowledging,” and it’s from the Greek word “epignosis.” “Epignosis” is full discernment and recognition of spiritual truths. This means that your participation or fellowship in the Gospel of Christ will become effective through your full and absolute knowledge of every good thing that you have in your spirit by virtue of your oneness with Christ. Beyond recognizing who you are in Christ, your inheritance and heritage in Him, you must affirm them to become your vital experience in life.</p>
<p>Study the Word to know more about the divine treasures in you. God has imparted amazing blessings to your spirit, but through knowledge and affirmation, you activate these and other blessings to produce results in your personal life. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I say also unto thee…I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matthew 16:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words above came from the very lips of the Master; He’s personally responsible for building His Church. But how’s He doing it? We know that the Lord Jesus is in heaven, but the Holy Spirit is with us, and in us, continuing His ministry here in the earth. So, He builds His Church through the ministry or instrumentality of God’s Word.</p>
<p>The Word of God is everything; that’s what gave birth to you, and therefore it’s what will sustain you. 1 Peter 1:23 says, <em>“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.” James tells us the same thing: “Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures”</em> (James 1:18). The Word is your life, therefore you must yield yourself to the Word to build and nourish you. Study the Word voraciously. Meditate on the scriptures. That way, you’re submitting yourself to the Lordship of the Word.</p>
<p>The Word is the only ingredient that can transform and build our lives on all three levels: spirit, soul and body. When the Word of God gets into your spirit, it produces in you what it talks about. For example, the Word of salvation, which is the very first step. Romans 1:16 says, <em>“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth….”</em> That means God’s power to save anyone is in the Gospel of Christ—His Word of salvation.</p>
<p>In Acts 20:32, Paul writes, <em>“And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.”</em> Make the important decision to keep improving your life by being a student of the Word. It’ll cause you to have an effectual life of success and constant victories. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>True success is spiritual, and based on spiritual principles. If you’re going to be successful in anything, you must learn to take charge from the realm of the spirit, and the primary way to do that is through prayer. When you learn to bow your knees and discipline yourself to pray, there’ll be nothing you can’t change or achieve.</p>
<p>Some Christians think life is a joke; they pray three minutes and they’re done. Even while they’re praying, they’re distracted by everything else; then at the end of the day, they wonder why certain things happened that has made them victims in life. Discipline yourself to pray; make it a conscious part of your routine. Your nightmares will be over once you discover the efficacy of prayer. When you take charge and change things in the realm of the spirit, they’ll manifest in the earth-realm. When Deborah and Barak fought against Sisera and his armies, the Bible says, <em>“They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera”</em> (Judges 5:20).</p>
<p>The spirit realm is where you set the circumstances of your life to control whatever happens in the natural world, and laugh your way through. You become like David—a mystery and a wonder to your world! Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>We, however, are citizens of heaven, and we eagerly wait for our Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, to come from heaven (Philippians 3:20 GNB).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we say every promise in the Word of God has already been fulfilled in us the new creation, there’re those who ask, “What about heaven? Isn’t that promised us?” Heaven isn’t a promise, because we were born there: <em>“But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven…”</em> (Hebrews 12:22-23).</p>
<p>Also, read again our opening verse: it says, “We <strong>are</strong> citizens of heaven,” not “We <strong>shall</strong> be citizens of heaven. You’re a bonafide citizen of heaven NOW. Recall the words of Jesus in John 8:23; He said to the Jews, “I’m from above”; referring to His heavenly origin. Then concerning us, He said, “You’re not of this world,” even though we live in this world. That’s because the Christian lives in two worlds contemporaneously.</p>
<p>Look at it this way: perhaps, you’re a citizen of the United States, living in the United Kingdom. The fact that you’re not living in the United States doesn’t nullify your American citizenship, neither does it make your American citizenship a promise. Therefore, that you’re in the earth doesn’t preclude you from enjoying all the blessings, rights and privileges of your heavenly citizenship.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, heaven is our home; it belongs to us now. We were born there, and live there NOW! Psalm 87:4-5 talks about it. It says, <em>“I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there. And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.”</em> When you study the context, you’d observe that he’s referring to the new creation who is born in Zion, which is the heavenly Jerusalem in Hebrews 12:22.</p>
<p>In the new birth, we were translated into the Kingdom of God’s Love Son (Colossians 1:13). This isn’t a promise; it’s already done. This is a heavenly kingdom, and operates from heaven. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked (Ephesians 6:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the fiery darts of the wicked is fear. Therefore, as a child of God, under no circumstances are you supposed to yield to fear. When the spirit of fear throws a dart at you, respond and say, “No! I’m a child of God! I refuse to fear!” Proverbs 3:25 says, “<em>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.”</em> Refuse to be intimidated by devils, men, circumstances, lack or want.</p>
<p>When things happen or circumstances arise that tend to stir fear against you, affirm the Word. If it’s the fear of lack that’s trying to get a hold of you, declare boldly, “The Lord is my Shepherd; I refuse to lack! I’m plugged to His eternal and unfailing supply.” You have to confess your boldness in Christ. If, for instance, you’re in a dark or lonely place and you hear some strange sound, be unmoved; rather, declare, “Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil: for greater is He that’s in me than he that’s in the world!”</p>
<p>When you make that declaration, the devil will chicken out, because the truth is, he’s afraid of you. So, when he throws his darts in your direction, neutralize them with your faith-filled confessions. Be bold about the Word of God. Be bold to affirm what God has said about you. Every so often, declare boldly, “I’ll always be a success. I’ll forever walk in divine health. I refuse to fear.” Such declarations are statements of distinction, showing that you’re not of this world.</p>
<p>2 Timothy 1:7 says, <em>“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.”</em> It makes no difference what the enemy tries to use to intimidate you; refuse to budge! Stand your ground in the Word!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:25).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a spirit world that’s greater than this physical world. The physical world is a region or part of the spirit world. The Bible says God is a Spirit, and He created all things; meaning that there’s a spirit connection to everything that God made. Nothing is detached from Him. In the realm of the spirit, He created a region for the physical man, even though man himself is a spirit being.</p>
<p>God gave man a physical body to live in, while in the physical region of His spiritual world. The earth isn’t a separate entity from God’s realm. Remember, in Genesis 1:2, the Bible says the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. The Spirit of God incubated over the chaotic mass, which means the earth was within the coverage or reach of the Spirit, and governed by the Spirit. Many, because they don’t realise this, and because they haven’t understood the importance of it, limit their lives to the earthly region of this world. They don’t realise that there’s a greater play in the spirit world.</p>
<p>For every one of us that’s born again, the Bible tells us to walk in the Spirit. How do you walk in the Spirit? It’s walking in the light of God’s Word; walking according to Kingdom principles. Become conscious that you live in, and are from another realm, a heavenly realm that’s greater than this world. That consciousness will put you over the elements, failures, frustrations, darkness and corruption in this physical world.</p>
<p>Life is spiritual, and we live in two worlds. But most people, every day, are only conscious of the physical realm. This is why many go through pain and affliction; victims of incurable diseases, because they’re unable to control life from the spirit. The Bible says you’re in the world, but not of the world. You’re born after Christ, the man from heaven; you bear the image of the heavenly. You’re from the Kingdom of God’s Love Son. Hallelujah! And in that Kingdom, we play by divine principles; the strategies and weapons of our warfare are not of this world (2 Corinthians 10:4). We reign by grace through righteousness, and we prevail with, and through the Word. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Give us this day our daily bread (Matthew 6:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a child of God, the government of your country isn’t supposed to decide your prosperity. There’s a higher government—heaven’s government—and you belong in that government. Under heaven’s government, your financial prosperity is for all-time; there’s supply for you every day!</p>
<p>Unlike the governments of this world, there’s no “welfare” system or pension program with God. He’s bigger and does better than that. He has a glorious plan for your life and has made provisions for your future. You never have to live your life on some pension, charity, or benefit from the government or anyone. The Bible says He has given you all that pertains to life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3); all that you need, to require no aid or support. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>God’s purpose is that you’re big enough to help others. He didn’t intend for you to be the one needing help. The Bible says saviours shall arise from Mount Zion (Obadiah 1:21); that’s you and me. We’re heirs of God, and through us He blesses and makes many rich. There’re many around us who are in dire need, and we must heed their cry for help.</p>
<p>We read in our theme verse how Jesus taught His disciples to pray. Part of the content of that prayer format was, “Give us this day our daily bread.” He was letting us know that there’s a daily provision, and your name is on it! The provisions you never claimed have accumulated, waiting for you.</p>
<p>It’s time to lay claims to them. It’s about time you said, “Father, I’m ready; all your daily provisions for me that I never claimed, I receive them now!” Have the boldness to call them forth. Don’t wait to get to heaven and discover there was so much you could have had that you never took advantage of. Claim what’s yours. Your salary or pension or profit from business aren’t your source. God is your source, and He has provision for you EVERY DAY. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God (Ephesians 6:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 Corinthians 10:3 says, <em>“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh.”</em> We’re not into a physical battle; it’s spiritual, and our weapon is the Word of God; the sword of the Spirit. As you release God’s Word—the rhema of God—you’re getting on the offensive in the realm of the spirit; power is released that shatters the enemy. This is the reason for meditation.</p>
<p>God’s Word is powerful in your mouth, after meditation—voracious meditation. During this kind of meditation, your whole attention is on the Word; you allow no distraction whatsoever. This is what makes the difference between someone that’s quoting scriptures from the head and someone that’s quoting scriptures because it has become resident inside him. This was what distinguished David from the rest of the Israelites. They were all circumcised and knew about the covenant, but they trembled before Goliath. None of them could face the giant.</p>
<p>But when David showed up, he wondered why everybody was afraid of Goliath and said, <em>“…who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?”</em> (1 Samuel 17:26). He was saying, “We’re circumcised, and by circumcision, we’re in league with God. But this guy is uncircumcised; he doesn’t have God on his side!” The circumcision meant something to David that others didn’t know about.</p>
<p>That’s what happens when the Word is in your spirit. Jesus said out of your belly shall flow rivers— gushers, floods—of living water (John 7:38). Colossians 3:16 says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly….”</em> Become voracious in your study of, and meditation on the Word. Have the Word in your heart and in your mouth; it’ll make you a wonder and give you the winning mentality. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course (Psalm 82:5).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many who are victims in life are actually not victims of the devil but of ignorance. In Hosea 4:6, God said, <em>“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge….”</em> He didn’t say His people are destroyed by the devil.</p>
<p>Think about it: what would you do or how would you live if you discovered that no sickness could actually fasten itself to your body? If you found out that you have a life that’s incapable of failure, a life that can’t be defeated or destroyed; how would that affect your mentality? It’ll most certainly change your appreciation of yourself. These were my discoveries in the Word of God many years ago. But many aren’t acquainted with these truths, and as a result, they measure their lives on the basis of the flesh; what they perceive with their natural senses.</p>
<p>Your life is based on the information that you have. Your standard of life is limited to your knowledge. No one ever lived beyond the level of his knowledge. If you have the knowledge of God’s Word, it’ll make the difference in your life. Our theme verse says, <em>“They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness….”</em> This is the reason some of God’s children are suffering and struggling in life. They don’t know who the new creation really is.</p>
<p>When the reality of the Word and who you are in Christ dawns on you, you suddenly come to a place of absolute confidence and independence, where you realize that the world doesn’t determine what happens with you. You become like Jesus, who had no sense of need. That’s the life He came to give us; and as you study and meditate on the Word, not only do you discover your inheritance in Christ, you also receive the faith to relate with, and enjoy all that God has made available to you in Him. Glory to His Name forever!</p>
