<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest (Joshua 1:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Courage is the ability and will to do or stand for what is right or necessary even in the face of adversity or opposition. It’s the ability to face danger and opposition fearlessly and affirm your faith in Christ no matter the adversaries or adversities that you face. It’s a virtue everyone in Christ has been granted, but not every Christian manifests it.</p>
<p>A person of courage understands that every opposition is an opportunity for progress and victory. Courage is what got the Church of Jesus Christ to where it is today. Had the apostles and prophets of old not exhibited courage by standing for what was right in spite of opposition, the Gospel may never have gone around the world and got to us at the time it did. They weren’t afraid of kings and despots, and they sure weren’t afraid to die. They were strong and very courageous.</p>
<p>Paul, in his letter to the Church in Thessalonica, recounted how he and some others demonstrated great courage to preach the Gospel despite fierce opposition. He said, <em>“You know how badly we had been treated at Philippi just before we came to you and how much we suffered there. Yet God gave us the courage to boldly repeat the same message to you, even though we were surrounded by enemies”</em> (1 Thessalonians 2:2 TLB).</p>
<p>People of courage keep their focus on what they believe in, and nothing is too big for them to give or do in pursuit of their convictions. Therefore, set your mind on the Lord and His Word, and be ever ready to do anything for the furtherance of the Gospel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption (1 Corinthians 1:30).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Christians get very excited when they read our opening verse, and then get confused when they read James 1:5 which says, <em>“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.”</em> Since Christ has been made unto us wisdom, why then should one still ask for wisdom? they wonder.</p>
<p>Those two references aren’t contradictory at all; rather, it’s about levels of maturity in Christ. As you study the Scriptures, you’ll find that there’re different instructions for different groups of Christians on the basis of their maturity. Some are addressed to the babes in Christ; others, to the maturing in Christ, and then there’re instructions for the “fathers” or the spiritually mature in Christ.</p>
<p>The one who’s still a babe in Christ may quote and confess that Christ is his wisdom, yet he hasn’t really caught it. His words and actions may still be incongruous with the Word and wisdom of God. He isn’t yet manifesting wisdom, which is a fruit of righteousness. He still acts and thinks like the rest of the world, like those without wisdom. So, James admonishes those in that class to ask for wisdom.</p>
<p>Remember, it’s “children” that ask for things. Jesus said, “...Ask, and it shall be given you”; He related it to children asking their father for bread (Luke 11:9-12). The spiritually mature don’t ask for anything, because they lack nothing in Christ.

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end (Jeremiah 29:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord Jesus specified some of the agonizing signs that’ll signal the end of the age. He said, <em>“And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity… Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth…”</em> (Luke 21:25-26).</p>
<p>Much of these are already happening and many have become despondent; livelihoods, businesses and economies have been decimated. Many aren’t sure about their future anymore. But as a Christian, don’t be agitated about the future; be at peace. The government or society might promise you a great future; don’t hope on their promises.</p>
<p>God’s plan is the best; your role is to discover that plan and walk in the light of it. The New International Version of our theme verse says, <em>“For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”</em> Never allow the troubles in the world get you depressed. Jesus knew you’d encounter crises in this world; so, He said, <em>“These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world”</em> (John 16:33).</p>
<p>Be of good cheer, irrespective of what’s happening around you or to you. Be strong. Be courageous. Don’t give in. Maybe it’s your business, job, family, whatever it is; the trouble is only for a short time. The Apostle Paul called it “light affliction.” He said, <em>“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory”</em> (2 Corinthians 4:17). As long as you’re in Christ, you’re in safety; your future is secured. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>…I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen (Matthew 28:20 NKJV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, when people go through difficulties, they wonder if God is with them. They hope and pray that He’ll be with them. But the truth is, He never leaves you. Jesus said*, “...I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Amen”* (Matthew 28:20 NKJV). What a blessing! He’s with you through the power and presence of the Holy Spirit. He didn’t say, “I’ll be with you”; it’s not a promise. It’s a fact.</p>
<p>God’s Word is a statement of truth, and our responsibility is to line up with His truth and live accordingly always. When He said, <em>“...I am with you always, even to the end of the age”</em>, it’s exactly as powerful as when He said, <em>“...I am the way, the truth, and the life…”</em> (John 14:6). So, think, talk, and live with the consciousness, confidence and assurance that the Lord is in you and with you, for He truly is!</p>
<p>This means you’re forever in safety. He’s the ever-present help in time of need, the friend that sticks closer than a brother, and He never fails. Trust Him. In Isaiah 41:10, He said, <em>“Fear thou not; for I am with thee….”</em> He’s in you and with you everywhere, in every place, and in every situation.</p>
<p>It makes no difference what the situation is; be conscious that you can neither fail nor lose; you’re attended by the presence of God. Oh, what confidence you should have in life! No wonder He said*, “No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper…”* (Isaiah 54:17). Have the attitude of victory in everything, every day of your life, for the greater One is with you and He lives in you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them (Ephesians 2:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has a purpose for your life; He has a purpose for everything that He does. In John 10:10, Jesus said, <em>“...I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”</em> 1 John 3:8 says, <em>“…For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”</em> Then in Luke 19:10, He said, “...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.” His purpose was clear: He came to do the will of the Father.</p>
<p>Understand, you were born for a purpose; you came to do the will of your heavenly Father. In Acts 26, we read about Saul of Tarsus, who on his way to Damascus had an encounter with the Lord. The Lord called him by name and said, <em>“<strong>…I have appeared unto thee for this purpose</strong>, to make thee a minister and a witness…”</em> (Acts 26:16). God doesn’t do anything without a purpose. The reason He appeared to Saul, who later became Paul, was to make him a minister and a witness, so that he (Paul) would take the Gospel to the Gentiles (Acts 26:17).</p>
<p>Have you discovered your purpose? Do you know why you were born? If you haven’t found out, you can do that today! Be bold to ask the Lord; He’ll tell you. He’ll guide you to that purpose as you walk with Him, and do the things He’s called you to do.</p>
<p>You weren’t born for nothing. You were born for the glory of God. You were born to walk with Him and bring Him honour. He planned from the beginning that you’d serve Him and live unto Christ. Let that purpose become established in your heart and you’ll experience tremendous growth and success in your life, and in all that you do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation (2 Corinthians 5:18-19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Living for Jesus Christ and making yourself relevant in the ministry of reconciliation are the things that count the most in life. Your life should be about soul winning. Refuse to make the lesser things of life your focus; be all out for the Gospel.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 9:16, Paul said*, “…necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!”* He lived to fulfil God’s dream of making the Gospel known to the Gentiles. You’re an ambassador and a steward of the mysteries of Christ. You’re a soldier in Christ’s army and must therefore remain militant in bringing God’s Word to those in your world, touching them with the love of Christ and the glory of His grace.</p>
<p>Don’t ignore sinners around you; the end of all things is near, and the Bible says it’s not the will of God that any should perish (2 Peter 3:9). He wants them saved, and He’s counting on you for their salvation.</p>
<p>He said in Romans 10:13-14, <em>“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? <strong>and how shall they hear without a preacher?</strong>”</em> You’re the preacher, sent of God to those in your world who haven’t yet known the Lord. Don’t let them keep living without hope, and without God in the world. Take advantage of every opportunity to preach the Gospel to them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus (1 Timothy 2:5).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Man doesn’t know reality until he finds Jesus, the Son of the living God. But who exactly is Jesus, the man of Galilee? First, He’s the Word-incarnate. This is an amazing truth. Think about it: Your word is the expression of who you are. It’s the expression of your views, opinions, thoughts, emotions, and ideas.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Word of God is the totality of God’s thoughts, ideas, opinions, will, and emotions. John 1:14 NKJV tells us that God’s Word was personified, and the result was the man, Jesus: <em>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us….”</em></p>
<p>His laughter was God laughing; His smiles were the smiles of God. When He stretched out His hand, that was God stretching out His hand. When He loved, it was God’s love manifested. Everything He did was the expression of God.</p>
<p>Secondly, He’s the character and essence of God. The Bible tells us something beautiful about Him in Hebrews 1:3: <em>“Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person….”</em> He’s the perfect personification of the abstract idealisation of God.</p>
<p>In the world, the term “God” doesn’t convey a person; it conveys an idea. God doesn’t make sense to the human mind, because they can’t find or define Him. The Bible, however, presents Jesus as God’s perfect imprint, the icon of the unseen God.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Jesus Christ is the glory of the Father. He’s the outshining of the Father’s glory, the radiance of the Father.</p>
<p>The world doesn’t understand why we can be so passionate about the man, Jesus. Until you know Jesus, God will only be an idea to you. Your search, however, stops when you meet this awesome, glorious, Lord of heaven and earth. That’s why we tell people, “Discover Jesus!” When you discover Him, you discover reality; you discover life.</p>

<p><em><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God is good; God is kind, and God is love! He’s our great heavenly Father who, long before we came on the scene, prepared a wonderful and exciting life for us: a life of success, victory, peace and prosperity. He didn’t create you to suffer or struggle your way through life. He prearranged a good life of blessings for you.</p>
<p>That’s like what He did when He created Adam; He first created a beautiful garden where everything Adam would require was made available. Then He created Adam and put him in the garden to inhabit it and enjoy the goodness therein. God brought you forth at such a time as this, and planned ahead for you like every caring father would. Therefore, always acknowledge and profess in agreement with Him that indeed, you’re the blessed of the Lord, walking in preordained pathways of greatness, excellence and productivity.</p>
<p>The Lord cares so much for you, up to the strands of hair on your head: <em>“Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows”</em> (Matthew 10:29-31). That’s why He doesn’t want you worried or fretful over anything in life.</p>
<p>He’s aware you require money, clothing, food, shelter and all the necessities of life, and has already made them yours. He said in 1 Corinthians 3:21, <em>“...All things are yours”</em></p>
<p> Believe and accept it, for it’s true. Live with the consciousness that God has truly made everything you’d ever require for a triumphant life available to you in Christ Jesus. Indeed, He’s gracious and kind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith (1 John 5:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s so much negative information in the world today, and this has instilled fear in the hearts of those who aren’t rooted and grounded in the Word. The Lord Jesus referred to this in Luke 21:25-26 when He described some of the signs of the end of the age. He said, <em>“…there shall be …distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring; Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth….”</em> In Luke 18:8, He asked, <em>“…when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?”</em></p>
<p>You’re to stand your ground in faith, irrespective of the challenges and hardships in today’s world. Train your faith with the Word to prevail against the odds and adversities of life. Refuse to give up or give in to the pressures around you. Ephesians 6:13-16 says, <em>“…having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.”</em></p>
<p>Keep your switch of faith turned on, by staying your mind on the Word. When Satan throws the dart of fear at you, refuse it, because the greater One lives in you!</p>
<p>It makes no difference that the world is experiencing severe economic slump as a result of the recent global crisis; you’re the seed of Abraham! You’re a joint-heir with Christ; never talk or live as one who’s disadvantaged; affirm God’s truth!

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>...be thankful in all circumstances. This is what God wants from you in your life in union with Christ Jesus (1 Thessalonians 5:18 GNB).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words “Thank you” are two of the most powerful words to utter. They convey heartfelt appreciation and gratefulness which, when rightly expressed, leave an indelible impression of your sincere gratitude and evoke joy in the hearts of the recipients.</p>
<p>Also, when you make someone glad, it’ll relax your nerves and gladden your spirit! Therefore, every so often, ask yourself, “Who am I going to appreciate today?” Let it be part of your daily plan. Someone, somewhere, should get a call, a visit, a card or a gift from you to say, “Thank You!” I like it when I’m able to call someone to say, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Some people find it difficult to express gratitude even when occasion warrants it. But the counsel of the Lord is clear: express gratitude always and in all things. When you go out and an attendant offers you any form of assistance, don’t forget to say, “Thank you.” </p>
<p>In church, or at the theatre or some event, when the usher shows you to a seat, don’t sit down without saying, “Thank you.” When a cab driver takes you safely to your destination, don’t alight without saying, “Thank you!” All these are simple everyday situations that we experience, and sometimes, we don’t realize we ought to be thankful for these things.</p>
<p>If you’re a parent, learn to say “Thank you” to your kids when they do something nice. As a couple, say “Thank you” to your spouse for the things you do for each other. When people do things for you, be it a favour or even something they’re obliged to do, practise saying, “Thank you.” You’ll be amazed at the joy and fulfilment you’ll experience as a result.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work (John 4:34).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we earnestly look forward to the Rapture of the Church, it’s important that your focus be on the achievement of the “greater goal.” What’s this greater goal? It’s winning the unsaved to Christ. </p>
<p>Jesus and His disciples were on a journey from Judaea to Galilee, and they stopped in a Samaritan village. The Master needed to catch a breather while His disciples went to get some food. While Jesus sat at the well, a woman came to draw water, and Jesus began to preach the Good News of the Kingdom to her.</p>
<p>Much later, when His disciples returned with the food, and Jesus wouldn’t eat. When they wondered why He didn’t want to eat, He replied, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about; the food that keeps me going is that I do the will of the One who sent me, and finish His work” (John 4:32-34).</p>
<p>This is the example He left us to follow. Doing God’s work was number one to Jesus. Nothing should be more important to you than ensuring the spread of the Gospel in your world and around the world. You must realize that your earthly job, business, education or other career are your opportunities and vehicles for transporting the Gospel.</p>
<p>When you commit your life to soul winning, you discover the satisfaction and fulfilment nothing else in life can give you. You declare like Jesus, “My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish His work.” Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them… (John 17:22).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being born again, you’re not an insignificant speck in the dust; you have honour and glory in Christ. This glory refers to the perfections of beauty, the excellence of divinity and it’s expressions, the honour of God, etc.</p>
<p>Jesus is the express image of God’s person, the brightness, effulgence (outshining) of the glory of God. The Bible says God gave Him His excellent glory (Hebrews 1:3). Now, here’s the most remarkable part: Just before He was crucified, He prayed a very touching prayer to the Father on our behalf. He said: <em>“And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them…”</em> (John 17:22).</p>
<p>He gave us the same glory the Father gave Him, so that we’d be one with Him and the Father, just as He and the Father are one. Today, you have the glory of God the Father, the same glory He gave to Jesus. You may be thinking right now, “Can someone like me who has done so many wrong things have the glory of God in his life?” Sure, you do, now that you’re born again!</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”</em> (Romans 3:23-24). Before Jesus came, everybody was labelled a sinner. Jesus, however, dealt with the problem of sin once and for all. Therefore, if because of sin we came short of the glory of God, now that the problem has been dealt with, we’re no longer short of the glory of God. We’re His glorified ones, according to Romans 8:30: <em>“Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ (Ephesians 3:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It makes no difference how and where you were born; now that you’re in Christ, you’re separated unto God and His glory. Poverty isn’t part of your life. When you understand this and discover who you are, suddenly, there’ll be a change in your mentality; you become bigger than your job, your business, and your income or salary; you become big on the inside!</p>
<p>The Amplified Classic version of our opening scripture says, <em>“To me, though I am the very least of all the saints (God’s consecrated people), this grace (favor, privilege) was granted and graciously entrusted: to proclaim to the Gentiles the unending (boundless, fathomless, incalculable, and exhaustless) riches of Christ [wealth which no human being could have searched out].”</em></p>
<p>The Word is for the man or woman who steps into it. So you’re to affirm, “I have access to the unending, boundless, fathomless, incalculable, and exhaustless riches of Christ —wealth which no human being could have searched out.” You were born into inexhaustible wealth, for you’re the seed of Abraham, an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ. Your wealth is like the bread that Jesus distributed to the multitude (five thousand men; women and children not counted). As they distributed it, it multiplied (Matthew 14).</p>
<p>This is how you should think about your resources; refuse to be lack-conscious. Always give. The more you give, the more your resources are multiplied to be unlimited. This should be your consciousness and confession. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him (Hebrews 2:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If anything should be precious to you in this life, especially in these last days, it must be your personal salvation. Our theme verse says, <em>“How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation….”</em> Your salvation is the number one thing in your life. Protect it. See that you’re walking in the light of God, in the totality of salvation. He said, <em>“…work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”</em> (Philippians 2:12).</p>
<p>No matter your accomplishments in life, they’ll all be a waste without your salvation. Jesus said in Mark 8:36, <em>“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”</em> It doesn’t matter how many conferences you held or attended or how many people you helped; without your salvation, they’ll mean nothing.</p>
<p>Don’t trade your salvation for anything. We’re surrounded by hawks and beasts that don’t spare the flock; they’ll do anything for their personal gains. Don’t let them deceive you, and don’t lead yourself astray. Stay in Christ, in His Word, and keep expressing His love and righteousness to your world.</p>
<p>Remember, not only are you here for your salvation, you’re here also to help others receive salvation. When you really understand what salvation is, you’ll not only protect it with your life, but you’d also be eager to share it with others. The Apostle Paul said, <em>“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek”</em> (Romans 1:16). The only way you can help others receive salvation is to share the Gospel with them. So make this a vital part of your daily routine and pursuit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee (Genesis 17:5).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever name you answer has a direct bearing on your destiny; your name gives meaning to your destiny. This explains why God changed the names of certain individuals in the Bible in line with their destinies in Him. A good example is Abraham, who was formerly named Abram. Abram meant exalted father or assumed father. In the process of time, he had no child, though many servants were born in his house.</p>
<p>But one day, the Lord spoke to him and said*, “… behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee”* (Genesis 17:4-5). Abraham believed God, and immediately started answering the name Abraham, “the father of many nations.”</p>
<p>Another important example is Jacob; he was named Jacob because at birth he held on to his brother’s heel. Jacob means swindler or deceiver; and true to his name, he deceitfully obtained his brother’s birthright, with the aid of his mother.</p>
<p>However, when he encountered the Lord and asked to be blessed, He wouldn’t bless him until his name was changed from Jacob (the deceiver) to Israel, a prince with God (Genesis 32:28); and his destiny was transformed for good.</p>
<p>Consider the Apostle Peter; before he came to Jesus, he answered the name, “Simon,” meaning a reed shaken by the wind, unstable. As Simon, he was inconsistent. But one day, Jesus said to him, <em>“...thou art Peter,</em> (Greek: Petros*) and upon this rock* (Greek: Petra) <em>I will build my church…”</em> (Matthew 16:18).</p>
<p>If the meaning of your name isn’t consistent with the Word of God, you’ve got to change it. It makes no difference that you’ve answered the name all your life; if its meaning isn’t consistent with the revelation of who you are in Christ, respond to God’s Word and change it as an act of faith.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his (Hebrews 4:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you study the account of creation in Genesis 1, you’ll observe God created man on the sixth day, after He had created everything else. Satisfied, He rested from all His works on the seventh day: <em>“And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested…”</em> (Genesis 2:2).</p>
<p>Man’s first day in the earth was God’s day of rest. Adam didn’t meet God working; he met Him resting. It wasn’t that God rested so that Adam could finish the rest of the work, no; God finished all the work before Adam was formed. Adam was thus born into rest. This was God’s purpose and intent for man at the beginning. Christ is our rest. When you come into Christ, you’re free from struggles, hassles, anxieties, turmoil and hardships. No wonder we’re counselled by the Spirit, in Philippians 4:6 NKJV to <em>“Be anxious for nothing...”;</em> have no worries.</p>
<p>If you’ve found yourself toiling and stressed out, despite being born again, it’s time for a change. First, cultivate a new mindset and realise that God made you for His pleasure; He created you to be pleased and happy about you and for your life to glorify Him. Then, you say, “I refuse the hard life and embrace the life of peace, abundance, joy and success in Christ. I’ve been given all things richly to enjoy; I don’t lack anything, because ALL things are mine.”</p>
<p>Your life in Christ is one of immeasurable grace, glory, dominion, joy and righteousness; it’s an extraordinary life of glory from a position of rest. So, keep dominating and subduing your world from a position of rest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Giving thanks unto the Father… Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12-13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would to God that all of God’s children would understand how powerful the above scripture is! It says we’ve been delivered from the domain of darkness and transferred into the Kingdom of the Son of His love. That’s where you are now! But a Christian who doesn’t have this understanding will be living the life of darkness, thinking the thoughts of darkness, from where he’s already been transferred.</p>
<p>Darkness represents sin, death, evil and all the negative things that are associated with Satan. You’ve been brought out of everything that’s of the devil, into God’s Kingdom of light. Remember, darkness can’t overcome light. So, if you say, “I’m experiencing demonic oppression in my life,” the question would be, “Where are you? Where did the demons meet you?”</p>
<p>If you don’t live as one who has been translated into the Kingdom of God’s dear Son, you can’t walk in the authority of God’s dear Son. You’ve got to understand, recognize and live as one who knows that he’s been delivered from the domain of darkness and translated into God’s marvelous light.</p>
<p>Galatians 5:1 says*, “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”* Refuse to be entangled by the yoke of bondage. Relocate yourself; change position by saying, “From this day, I refuse to be under the influence or control of the darkness that rules this present world; I’m seated with Christ in power, glory and majesty, with dominion over Satan and the cohorts of darkness.” Blessed be God! No wonder Peter declared, “<em>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light”</em> (1 Peter 2:9).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For we walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romans 9:8 says, <em>“...They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God....”</em> The children of the flesh are ruled by their senses. Instead of walking by faith, they’re controlled only by that which they can physically see, hear, touch, taste, or smell. But Christianity is a walk of faith; it’s life beyond the senses.</p>
<p>Spiritual realities can’t be perceived with human senses. This is the reason the natural man doesn’t understand the things of the Spirit; they’re foolishness to him (1 Corinthians 2:14). Romans 9:8 lets us know that the children of the flesh—those who are sense-ruled—are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. The children of the promise are the children of the Word.</p>
<p>Paul’s climactic submission in 2 Corinthians 5:7 AMPC is quite profound: He said, *“For we walk by faith [we regulate our lives and conduct ourselves by our conviction or belief respecting man’s relationship to God and divine things, with trust and holy fervour; thus we walk] not by sight or appearance”*Don’t live by sight or appearance; like those who say, “Seeing is believing,” no! That’s contrary to faith. Recall what Jesus said to Martha in John 11:40. He said, <em>“…if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest <strong>see</strong>the glory of God.”</em> You believe to see; that’s faith.</p>
<p>Hebrews 11:1 (AMPC) says, <em>“NOW FAITH is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses].”</em> You can’t please God until you’ve learnt to apprehend and call real, things that your physical senses can’t perceive, but are revealed in God’s Word. That’s Christianity; it’s a walk of faith.</p>

<p><em><strong>Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come (John 16:13).</strong></em></p>

<p>Being born again, the Spirit of God lives in you, and He guides you by the Word, in the way that you should go. His Word is your sure guide in life. It’s the reason we encourage conscious study and meditation on the Word. Getting yourself acquainted with the Word is the way to know the counsel of God and walk in His will. He counsels you from within, in line with the Word.</p>
<p>No other personality in this life can lead you in success, victory and rest as the Holy Spirit would. His delight is to guide you to make accurate and excellent decisions, go to the right places at the right time, and do the right things at the right time, for God’s glory. Recognise His ministry and person in your life. Talk with Him often. Listen to Him as well, for He’s always talking to your spirit. He cares about everything you do; He takes interest in the minutest detail of your life. It’s His pleasure to successfully guide you through all your endeavours from day to day.</p>
<p>Many have made grievous mistakes in their lives for not listening to Him and following His guidance. His counsel and guidance are always in sync with the Word. Your life will be the expression of God’s glory, beauty, wisdom and grace as you yield to Him and follow His Word. Through the Word, He guides and leads you from glory to glory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life (Romans 5:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under the Old Testament, God’s blessings for the children of Israel were preconditioned on their obedience to the Law. For example, God had desired that they walk as kings and priests before Him, but their obedience was a prerequisite for the blessings to take effect in their lives. In Exodus 19:5-6, He said, <em>“Now therefore, <strong>if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant</strong>, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation....”</em></p>
<p>However, they broke His laws and couldn’t enjoy the fullness of His blessings and promises. But that isn’t the case with us today in the New Testament. Colossians 1:12 says, “<em>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.”</em> We’ve been qualified to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the Kingdom of light.</p>
<p>We’re sharers and participants in the blessings and benefits of the Kingdom-life reserved for all of God’s saints. This didn’t happen by your obedience, but by Christ’s obedience (Romans 5:19).</p>
<p>Jesus Christ fulfilled the Law, and then abolished it. You’re the fruit of His obedience. By His obedience, God’s gift—His blessing of righteousness was bequeathed to you. Today, it’s no use trying to “obey” the Law for God to bless you; you were born blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ (Ephesians 1:3).</p>
<p>Nowhere in the New Testament are we told to “obey” to be blessed; rather, we’re called His obedient ones (1 Peter 1:14). We’re described as having “obeyed” God’s Word of truth from the heart (Romans 6:17). So your blessings, your inheritance in Christ, are the results of Christ’s redemptive work in your behalf. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him (Matthew 17:5).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When God said concerning Jesus in the verse above, <em>“...This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him,”</em> He was talking to all of creation. All of nature, animate and inanimate— everything in heaven, on earth, and under the earth—is subject to Jesus. The rocks, wind, trees, water, fish, angels, demons, etc., are under His dominion and charge.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:9-10 says, <em>“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.”</em> Now you understand why everything Jesus said came to pass. He talked to a tree and it withered (Mark 11:12-22). He spoke to a raging tempest and it hushed (Mark 4:35-39). He talked to bread and fish and they multiplied and became more than enough to feed multitudes (Matthew 14:17-21, Matthew 15:32-38). He talked to corpses and they revived (Luke 7:11-15, John 11:32-44).</p>
<p>At His word, maimed limbs grew back, blind eyes opened, deaf ears were unstopped, and demons scuttled in terror (Matthew 15:30), because they were commanded to hear and obey Him. Now, the most beautiful part is how this connects with us. 1 John 4:17 says, <em>“…as he</em> (Jesus) <em>is, so are we in this world.”</em> Then in Matthew 28:18-19, He said*, “...All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth….”* Then on the basis of that authority, He charged us to preach the Gospel to every creature, and tame this world.</p>
<p>He gave us the authority to act in His stead, the power of attorney to use His Name. Therefore, our words have the same power. Everything in life is subject to you as they’re subject to Him, because you’re one with Him. You can speak to anything in His Name and have the results you desire. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil (Ephesians 5:15-16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you ever meet someone who had no regard for your time? I’m sure you didn’t enjoy it. Now, if you didn’t enjoy it, then you ought to always regard the time and schedule of others in your dealings with people. If you could take the time to plan your day and prioritize your activities, you ought to expect that those you meet would have done the same.</p>
<p>Don’t shift or postpone appointments haphazardly; it could mess things up for someone else. There’re certain things in life that aren’t in unending supply; they’re limited; one of them is time. There’s joy and fulfilment you get when you respond to people promptly and see the look of gratitude on their faces for saving their time. When people meet you, they ought to be glad they did; they ought to leave you happier, and one sure way of ensuring this is by valuing their precious time.</p>
<p>If you were to schedule an appointment at work, for example, try as much as possible not to make open-ended appointments. It’s better to say, “See me at 5.15 pm” and be ready at that time, than to say, “See me between 5 and 5.30 pm,” and keep the person guessing when exactly to show up. And if for any reason, you know you wouldn’t be ready at the time you planned, reach out ahead of the agreed time to cancel or reschedule, tendering your apologies.</p>
<p>Do your best not to destabilize other people’s day. Of course, there’s the flip side to this; you could be the one who’s supposed to see someone, but you’ve fixed the same time to see five other people across the city! You’re definitely going to keep at least one or more of them waiting for you, and that’s not okay. Even as the boss in the office, be sensitive to the schedules of your subordinates. Successful people are time-conscious.</p>

<p><em><strong>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen (2 Corinthians 13:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your highest calling as a Christian is fellowship with the Lord. Without fellowship, nothing you do on earth is esteemed in Heaven. To fellowship with Jesus is to fellowship with the fullest revelation of the essence of deity. But you see, you can’t fellowship with Him except through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>That’s why I often wonder why some people think they don’t need the Holy Spirit. There’s nothing more void than a life without the Holy Spirit, because He’s the author of life. Without Him, all you have will be darkness. He’s the One who gives you light and quickens the Word of God in your heart. God’s Word won’t mean anything to you without the insight and revelation the Holy Spirit gives.</p>
<p>The Bible says His words are life to those that find them (Proverbs 4:22); and the way to find them is through the Holy Spirit. Your desire should be to fellowship more with the Holy Spirit every day; I mean fellowship with participation, where you’re actively engaged with Him in a romance of righteousness.</p>
<p> The glorious thing about this is that, for all the successes that you achieve through the guidance and wisdom you receive as you fellowship with Him, He gives you the credit. Another beautiful impact of your fellowship with Him is that you become so mingled with Him that your body becomes His body; your tongue becomes His tongue, your hands, His hands, and your feet, His feet. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>In this kind of relationship, every limit and barrier is taken off your way; you experience nothing but progress in life. You’re so full of His glory and wisdom that they overflow from you to others. He takes over your life and you experience unprecedented manifestations of His power that causes many to wonder at you. These and more are what fellowship with the Holy Spirit will bring to you. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered (Proverbs 11:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine that you carried and were playing with your neighbour’s one or two-year-old child and he suddenly inflicts a bite on your hand. You see the bite wound but shrug it off as nothing, because he’s only a child. Then while walking away, someone walks up to you and says, “I saw that child bite you; but did you know the child is HIV positive?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, your demeanour changes; you start speaking in tongues and making confessions. In your mind, you think you’re putting your faith to work, whereas you’re actually demonstrating a lack of understanding of who you are in Christ. God doesn’t want you at that level.</p>
<p>If you have the knowledge of God and recognise what you have inside you, and who you are in Christ, you’ll remain unmoved, in spite of the new information about the child. This was what the Apostle Paul knew that made him so different. In Acts 28:3-6, the serpent that bit Paul was a venomous one, and those who were around him were expecting him to swell and die right there. But they were baffled to see Paul unharmed. He didn’t even pay attention to it; the Bible says he shook it into the fire and went on discussing the Gospel. Hallelujah!</p>
<p> Someone may say, “Oh, if only I have the kind of faith that Paul had!” No, it wasn’t faith that Paul demonstrated; it was the knowledge of God at work. He had the knowledge of who Jesus said the Christian is. In Mark 16:17-18, Jesus said, <em>“And these signs shall follow them that believe…if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them….”</em> If any poisonous substance ever finds its way into your system—whether by accident or by intent— it’ll have no effect on you.</p>
<p>What you need is the accurate and adequate knowledge of God’s Word; this is what puts you over in life. Many don’t have a faith problem, for every one of us has faith (Romans 12:3). The issue is their lack of understanding of who they are and what belongs to them in Christ. The knowledge of God’s Word gives you an undeniable conviction of the transcendent life of victory and dominion. This is why you’ve got to study and meditate on the Word every day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus (Romans 3:24).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In John 15:25, Jesus said, <em>“But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, <strong>They hated me without a cause.</strong>”</em> The expression, “without a cause” is “dorean” (Greek), meaning freely, needlessly, for nothing, or in vain. In other words, Jesus did nothing wrong to warrant their hatred. Even though His expression of love towards them was unparralled, they hated Him still.</p>
<p>But then, as indicated in our opening scripture, God, in His infinite love, decided to respond in line with His own character by justifying man freely by His grace. The word, “freely” is the same Greek word, “dorean.” He’s letting us know that just as Jesus didn’t do anything to deserve the world’s hatred, you didn’t have to do anything to be justified by God.</p>
<p>To be justified is to be declared not guilty; it’s to be acquitted, declared righteous. Hallelujah! And it happened without you having to do anything to qualify for it; it was without a cause, but by the faith of Jesus Christ: <em>“Therefore being justified by faith…”</em> (Romans 5:1).</p>
<p> It’s not about your works or self-righteous acts. The Bible says, <em>“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast”</em> (Ephesians 2:8-9). Oh, how glorious to know that all that’s necessary is to submit to God’s righteousness! Now, you can reign in life: <em>“For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ)”</em> (Romans 5:17). Blessed be God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make no mistakes about it, the time left before the Master’s return is shorter than many realize. What we’re expecting right now is the Rapture of the Church, the “catching away” of all those who are born again and walking in the light of God. Suddenly, we’ll disappear from this world to meet the Lord in the air.</p>
<p>Someone may ask, “How is that going to be possible? Imagine that the driver of a commuter bus or pilot of an airplane filled with people is born again, but the passengers aren’t; are you saying the driver or pilot will be raptured while the vehicle or airplane crashes?”</p>
<p>First, people who ask such questions haven’t understood what’s about to befall the world. The Rapture itself is judgement for the world. In Luke 17, Jesus said the day Noah entered into the ark, the floods came. Also, the same day that Lot went out of Sodom, fire came from Heaven and burnt up the city; judgement began immediately.</p>
<p>At the Rapture, cars and planes crashing with people onboard is all part of the judgement for the rejection of Christ. At that point, the hour of His grace would have been over. If any Christian is left behind, it’s because he or she wasn’t living the life of a Christian. They’ll be amongst the ones who’ll go through the Great Tribulation that’s to take place after the Rapture. And among them, a multitude of people will eventually be saved.</p>
<p>But you don’t want to be in that group. Jesus said, <em>“Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man”</em> (Luke 21:36). Prepare yourself for the “first flight.” Each day that passes takes us a day closer to His glorious appearing. Live for Him, and get others in your world ready for that day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace (John 1:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before Jesus came, the Holy Spirit only came upon men in part and for a temporary purpose, after which, the unction lifted. For instance, the Bible says, <em>“And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him</em> (Samson)<em>, and he rent him</em> (a young lion) <em>as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand…”</em> (Judges 14:6). It was the same with David; the Old Testament folks didn’t have the fullness of the Spirit.</p>
<p>With Jesus; the Bible says, <em>“For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell”</em> (Colossians 1:19). The word, “fullness” is from the Greek, “pleroma” which means repletion or completion; the total or complete content of a vessel in its maximum capacity and entirety. That means everything the Father is, and has, is in Jesus. Colossians 2:9 says, <em>“For in him (Jesus) dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”</em> When Jesus walked the streets, God Almighty, in His fullness, was in Him. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The most amazing part of this is that as read in our opening verse, we’ve received this same fullness. That means everything the Father is, and has, is in you, because He lives in you. Have this consciousness. Colossians 2:10 says, <em>“And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.”</em> There’s nothing of God that’s supposed to be in you that’s not in you.</p>
<p>Your humanity has been supplanted by the life and nature of God. This is the difference between you and the one who isn’t born again; you’re a God-carrying vessel. Through you, He manifests Himself-His life, wisdom, grace, righteousness, excellence, glory and perfection-for He lives in you in His fullness. Glory to God!<br>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the Lord, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever (2 Chronicles 20:21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the ways to activate the power of God is worship. Throughout the Scriptures, we find inspiring accounts of how God delivered His people from destruction and dire situations when they activated His power in praise and worship. A good example is when three nations-Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir-came against Judah. King Jehoshaphat, by the wisdom of God, gathered all Judah to seek the Lord in prayer and fasting. When they prayed, God revealed to them the exact location of the enemies’ camp, and gave them the strategy to defeat them.</p>
<p>2 Chronicles 20:22 says, <em>“...when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.”</em> When you face daunting challenges, don’t panic or fret; worship the Lord instead. Like Jehoshaphat, have a “praise party!”</p>
<p>Don’t wait until you feel like singing before making melodies in your heart, singing praises unto the Lord. Whether you’re happy or not, praise Him all the same; worship Him and give Him glory. 1 Thessalonians 5:18 says, <em>“In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.”</em></p>
<p>Recall Paul and Silas; for preaching the Gospel, they were tortured and incarcerated in a Roman prison. But at midnight, they prayed and sang praises unto God; and as they did, the power of God was activated and they were supernaturally set free (Acts 16:25-26). This miraculous encounter led to the salvation of the prison warden with his entire family.</p>
<p>You may be faced with a difficult situation today for which you’ve prayed and confessed that it’s all working out for your good, yet nothing seems to have changed; don’t give up; worship and praise the Lord, for His mercy endures forever.</p>

<p><em><strong>Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen (Ephesians 3:21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oftentimes, in prayer and songs of worship, some Christians would say, “O Lord, glorify your Name in all the earth.” It sounds okay, but it puts us in a position of expecting God to glorify His Name. And that’s not His idea; we’re the ones to glorify Him. Recall the words of Jesus in John 17:4 <em>“I have glorified thee on the earth….”</em> This is what we’re expected to do.</p>
<p>Our theme verse says, <em>“Unto him be glory in the church…,”</em> meaning that He expects the Church to give Him glory. Your life is for the glory of God. He’s glorified as you consistently live out His Word, bearing fruits of His divine life and nature in you. As you walk in health, prosperity, and impact your world with His righteousness, greatness, beauty and wisdom; as you produce Word-based results, the Lord is glorified.</p>
<p>No wonder Jesus said in Matthew 5:16, <em>“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”</em> He’s glorified by your works of righteousness. In John 17:4 that we read earlier, the latter part shows that Jesus glorified the Father by doing what the Father wanted Him to do: <em>“I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.”</em> This is one of the reasons you must study the Word to know what He wants, so that every day, and in every place, you glorify Him by living out His Word. Praise God!</p>
