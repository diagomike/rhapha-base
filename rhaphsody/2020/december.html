<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? (Mark 8:36-37).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a new model of a product or device is advertised with far better features, oftentimes, the value of the current one drops; especially if it’s to be phased out. Generally, all who are interested in the product start preparing for the new one, while losing value for the old.</p>
<p>This is how you should view this current world; it’s going to be burnt up and destroyed. A new Heaven, and a new earth that’ll take its place have been advertised in the Scriptures. Revelation 21:1 says, <em>“And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.”</em> The 4th verse says, <em>“And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”</em> And verses 18-19 say, <em>“And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones….”</em></p>
<p>The 23rd and 25th verses take it even further: <em>“And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.”</em> What a description! What a place to look forward to! Your focus shouldn’t be on this present world which will soon pass away.</p>
<p>Recall the words of Jesus in our theme verse: <em>“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”</em></p>
<p>This world, with all it represents, isn’t worth the loss of your soul; so, live your life for the Lord. Let your passion be all about the Gospel of Christ as we await His glorious return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge… (Hosea 4:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re Christians whose experiences in life are an antithesis of their faith and the Word of God. For example, they may believe that as Christians, they’re not supposed to be oppressed by Satan, yet they experience continual satanic attacks and manipulations. They believe they aren’t supposed to be sick or have infirmities in their bodies, yet they’re hardly in good health. Something is wrong.</p>
<p>There’re two important areas to examine in dealing with such inconsistencies. First is the accurate understanding of the Word. In Matthew 13, Jesus emphasized the importance of understanding when He taught on the parable of the sower (Matthew 13:3-9).</p>
<p>In His interpretation of the parable, He explained that the seeds that fell by the wayside represent those who hear the Word of God and don’t understand it. Due to their lack of understanding, Satan comes immediately and steals the Word from their hearts (Matthew 13:19). An accurate understanding of the Word is so important. When you understand the Word, you’re able to apply it rightly to produce results for you. Proverbs 4:7 says, <em>“…with all thy getting get understanding.”</em></p>
<p>The second thing is your communication; the words you speak. If your words are inconsistent with the Word of God, your life, which is the outward manifestation of your words, will also be inconsistent. The Psalmist said, <em>“…my tongue is the pen of a ready writer”</em> (Psalm 45:1). Your tongue is the pen that writes God’s Word on your heart. What you say is written on your heart, and out of that abundance, your mouth speaks.</p>
<p>Always study and listen to the Word; bombard your mind and your spirit with the Word, and then speak accordingly! Your life will be the manifestation of the Word. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this (Isaiah 9:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>David prophesied of a king who will rule over the nations of the world. He said in Psalm 72:8, <em>“He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.”</em></p>
<p>Our opening scripture says concerning that King, <em>“Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end….”</em> The Lord Jesus heads the Kingdom of God, of which we’re a part. It’s a real Kingdom; a functional spiritual kingdom. Our consciousness of the Kingdom is important; we can’t focus our minds on this earth as though everything ends here; there’s a world that’s greater than this.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:1-2 says, <em>“…seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.”</em> How? By being <em>“...stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord”</em> (1 Corinthians 15:58).</p>
<p>These are the last days; fix your gaze on the Lord and His Kingdom. Make Him your focus. Be on fire for the Lord all the time; be instant in season, and out of season, proclaiming His truth.</p>

<p><em><strong>Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart (2 Corinthians 3:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing the Word in your heart is very important. This is done through meditation and constant confession of the Word. The more you do this, the more the glory of the Word is manifested in your life. We’re admonished in the Scriptures to be filled with the knowledge of God’s Word, for out of that abundance, our words will come forth.</p>
<p>Your words must be consistent with God’s truths; otherwise, you’ll have trouble. The adversary will take advantage of your own words to put you in bondage. Proverbs 6:2 says, <em>“Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.”</em></p>
<p>Many today are trapped, struggling to come out of one predicament or the other, which they may have created through their own words. Jesus said in Mark 11:23 that you shall have what you say. In Matthew 12:37, He said, <em>“For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”</em></p>
<p>You have to make a determination to talk God’s Word; talk Kingdom-talk. You’re in the Kingdom of God, and it’s a Kingdom run by words, where we rule and prevail by our wholesome, faith-filled words. Remember the Lord’s admonition in Joshua 1:8, <em>“This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth…”</em>; it’s about the Word in your mouth!</p>

<p><em><strong>And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it (Colossians 4:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You were born for God’s glory. You were created to live an extraordinary life that pleases God, and you can’t live such a life without making an impact. So, go ahead and make a difference in your world through the Gospel. It’s the most significant and impactful message in all the world, saving and changing lives everywhere. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Romans 8:19 says, <em>“For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.”</em> Then in Matthew 5:16, Jesus said, <em>“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.’’</em> Your true purpose in the earth is to manifest the glory of God and establish His Kingdom in your home, street, place of work, school and in your sphere of contact.</p>
<p>It makes no difference what your age is; you can make a difference in your world. You have what it takes—the Holy Spirit! As you fellowship with Him and function in the Church, you’ll discover what He wants you to do—your specific purpose in Him, and how exactly He wants you to live. He’s raising people He can trust; He’s building them on the Word. Be one of them.</p>
<p>He may not start you out with something big; but remain faithful with whatever He commits to your hands. When you’re faithful in little, He’ll account you to be faithful in much. Remember, you’re His ambassador in this world, with the God-ordained purpose to illuminate your world and impact others with the Christ-life! That’s your calling; that’s your purpose; that’s your life! Christ in you, the hope of glory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time (Daniel 7:25).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase “wear out” in the verse above is translated from Aramaic into English. It means to afflict, to constantly harass. One of Satan’s strategies in these last days is to foment so much evil in the world that could provoke God’s people to a compromise. He seeks to wear out the saints. This opening verse shows that during the Great Tribulation, the antichrist would wear out the saints. There’ll be so much evil that many will acclimatise to sin. Wickedness will become a normal lifestyle for a whole lot of people.</p>
<p>The Bible gives us an account of a righteous man named Lot, Abraham’s nephew, who lived in Sodom and whose soul was vexed daily by the wickedness of the people. <em>“And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, <strong>vexed</strong> his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds)”</em> (2 Peter 2:6-8).</p>
<p>The underlined word, “vexed”, means the same in Greek as the Aramaic for “wear out” which we read earlier in our theme verse. It means to harass with evil, afflict, make trouble for, treat until one is used to a certain situation. Lot was vexed with the filthy manner of life of the wicked. This is what Satan would have many do in these final moments of the Church, to adjust to the ways of darkness.</p>
<p>But you must say, “No” and walk in righteousness, in the light of God, in spite of what’s going on around you. Never succumb to evil; rather, let your light shine, for you’ve been sanctified by the Spirit, separated to God for His divine use—holy and undefiled.</p>

<p><em><strong>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed (1 Corinthians 15:52).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Rapture, not everyone will hear the sound of the trumpet. It’ll be audible only to the Christians who died in Christ already and those alive at the time. Everybody else won’t hear it, because the sound of the trumpet would only be heard by faith. It’s not something you’re going to make an effort to hear, because as a Christian, you already live by faith. Everything about your life and your relationship with God is by faith; therefore, you’re going to hear it.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found…”</em> (Hebrews 11:5). He was raptured by faith. So, with your faith in Jesus Christ, you have nothing to worry about; trust that when the trumpet sounds, you’re going to hear it.</p>
<p>As read in our theme verse, the sound of the trumpet will happen faster than the snap of your finger. In a twinkling of an eye, we’re out of here, and suddenly, we’re in heaven. Every Christian ought to go at the rapture. It therefore means that anyone who doesn’t make the “first flight” hasn’t been living for the Lord.</p>
<p>Keep your faith alive, and live for the Master every day. Walk in love and in righteousness. Focus on getting others ready for the Rapture and into the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p><em><strong>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also (John 14:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many don’t understand what Jesus was talking about in the scripture above. Some have speculated that He was talking about the Second Coming or the Rapture, but that’s not what He was talking about in that verse. To understand what Jesus meant, you’ll have to stay in the context, and understand His message with your spirit, not with your senses. He continued this interesting discourse till He got to the 16th verse where He said, <em>“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.”</em></p>
<p>The term “another Comforter” is the Greek phrase “Allon parakleton,” meaning “another of same kind.” So, Jesus introduced the Holy Spirit at that point. Then He said, <em>“…ye know him; <strong>for he dwelleth with you</strong>, and shall be in you”</em> (John 14:17). How did the Holy Spirit dwell with them at the time? Wasn’t He supposed to come on the Day of Pentecost? That tells us something. He wasn’t talking about the Holy Spirit alone; He was also referring to Himself!</p>
<p>To drive that point home, He went back to what He said in our theme verse, saying, <em>“I will come again, and receive you unto myself...”</em> Then in verse 18, He said, <em>“I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”</em> How and when was He going to come to them?</p>
<p>In the 20th verse, He said, “<em><strong>At that day</strong> ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</em>” What day was He talking about? Evidently, He was talking about the day when the Holy Ghost comes! So, when He said, “I will come to you,” He was saying, “I’ll come to you in the Holy Spirit!” And on the Day of Pentecost, He fulfilled that precious promise: “<em>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance</em>” (Acts 2:4). He’s in you today in all His fullness. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much (James 5:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A minister once told a story of two women in his church who were quarrelling for a long time. One of them had a goitre for several years, and in spite of his prayers for her, it wouldn’t heal. The second woman couldn’t receive the Holy Spirit; she just couldn’t speak in other tongues, even though he had prayed for her several times to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning, while he was sitting on the platform during the service, one of them arrived and found a seat, but soon as she noticed the very next seat was occupied by the other lady, she stood up to change her seat. At that point, the Pastor flounced off the platform to meet them, and said to them, “I’m not having any more of this; you either get together as sisters, or get out!” Suddenly, both women broke into tears and began to apologise to each other. Both of them were ready to take the blame, as they cried and hugged each other. Right there, before their eyes, the goitre disappeared, and the other woman was filled with the Spirit and speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>Evidently, those grudges had prevented the manifestations of these blessings in their lives for years, without them realizing it. All they needed to do was to admit their faults to each other. That’s what we read in our theme verse: <em>“Confess your faults one to another….”</em> It means admitting your faults; refusing to keep a grudge.</p>
<p>Even when you think you’re not the one at fault, it makes no difference; put the matter to rest. Do what the Word says. Don’t insist on your own way. The Bible says to rather allow yourself to be defrauded (1 Corinthians 6:7) than to hold a grudge against your brother or sister in the Lord.</p>

<p><em><strong>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses (1 Timothy 6:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not many people understand what it is to fight, and by that I don’t mean physical combat; I’m talking about the fight of faith. The fight of faith is the conflict between our earthly transient temporal circumstances and our spiritual realities. It is the unleashing of our faith on the rebellious circumstances of time to compel changes to correspond with our stubborn faith proclamations. It’s not a fight with the devil; it’s the fight in your heart to overcome the challenges that you face in life. And it’s a fight you must win.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul calls it a good fight, because it’s most honourable and you win. When He tells you to fight the good fight, he’s telling you to hold onto God’s Word, maintaining your confessions in the face of staggering opposition. There’s an adversary working on things and trying to ensure that things don’t fall into place for you. The world itself is hostile to your faith; hostile to the Kingdom of God. But Jesus said, <em>“…be of good cheer; I have overcome the world”</em> (John 16:33); and because He overcame the world, you have to keep the world in that position with your faith. That’s the real fight.</p>
<p>You’re not trying to overcome the world; He already did. So, you walk by faith in the victory that Christ wrought in your behalf. He said, <em>“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy…”</em> (Luke 10:19). No matter where you are, you’re triumphant; you know it and you insist on it.</p>
<p>You can do what others say is impossible. It doesn’t matter what you’re currently faced with; whether it has to do with your health, finances, business, job, family, academics; you say, “I’m a victor in the Name of Jesus! It’s impossible for me to fail. All I think is winning, and I only win, in the Name of Jesus!”</p>
<p>Walk in the glory and strength of Christ and with the boldness of the Spirit. Take advantage of His grace and the power of His might as you unleash your faith against rebellious circumstances and compel them to align with your stubborn faith proclamations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free (John 8:32).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were created by God’s Word, and His Word is truth; that means we were created by truth. This is why truth has an eternal effect on your spirit; it has an eternal effect of success, victory, prosperity, health in your life, because truth is your source. That’s why falsehood, deceit, deception, lies and lying destroy the human spirit.</p>
<p>Lying isn’t consistent with your nature. Some people tell lies out of fear of punishment, while others do it for plain deception. Whatever your excuse might be, train yourself to tell the truth at all times. Our theme verse says, <em>“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,”</em> because man was created by God to be free, to be at liberty to serve Him; he can’t be bound, because truth is his true nature.</p>
<p>Before you were born again, you didn’t have the ability to live the truth and live in truth, because you were under the dominion of sin. But now, the Bible says, <em>“For sin shall not have dominion over you…”</em> (Romans 6:14). You have the ability to do away with the habit of telling lies. You don’t need to cry or even ask God to take it away from you. Simply make up your mind to put away lying. The Bible says, <em>“If you want a happy, good life, keep control of your tongue, and guard your lips from telling lies”</em> (1 Peter 3:10 TLB).</p>
<p>Proverbs 6:16-19 says, <em>“These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.”</em> Truth is in your spirit. You can live in truth; it makes you triumphant; your spirit glows. It doesn’t matter in what situation you may find yourself; truth will put you over, because truth is eternal. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you (2 Thessalonians 3:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Acts 12:1-2, the Bible says, <em>“...Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.”</em> When the Church heard that James had been arrested, they must have thought, “James arrested? Nothing will happen to him; he’s a man of faith.” But once James was killed, it got their attention. </p>
<p>“Where was God? How did God allow it to happen?” some may have wondered, trying to put the blame on God. But it’s not God that allows such things to happen. Jesus said, <em>“And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you”</em> (John 16:23).</p>
<p>Then in Matthew 28:18, He declared, “...All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me”; and on the basis of that authority, He said, “...go and make disciples of all nations…” (Matthew 28:19). Jesus gave us His authority; He gave us His Name. So, it wasn’t Jesus that let them kill James; it was the Christians that didn’t do their job by exercising their authority in prayer.</p>
<p>When Peter was arrested next, the Bible says they (the church) prayed without ceasing; God intervened and Peter was released (Acts 12:5-7). So, every time you pray, you’re making it “legally” possible for God to intervene in some ways that He wouldn’t have, had you not prayed.</p>
<p>This is why we must pray for ministers of the Gospel, and advancement of the ministry of reconciliation in these last days. The Apostle Paul wrote to the Christians in Colossae, <em>“Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds”</em> (Colossians 4:3). Since God already told them to go and preach the Gospel, why did they need to pray to God to open for them a door of utterance? It tells you that there’re adversaries in the world. So always pray for the churches of Christ around the world.</p>
<p>Several reports confirm that Christians are the most persecuted group in the world. Many are in dire distress, made to face the most inhuman treatments because of their faith in Jesus Christ. Through your prayers for them, they’ll be strengthened; the Lord will intervene in their situations. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest (Joshua 1:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the day I received the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, I’ve never ran out of inspiration. The key is fellowship with the Holy Spirit! That’s the secret of ALWAYS being inspired and afire for the Lord. The Holy Spirit should be your number one driving force in life. Without Him, life is a drag; dull, empty and vain!</p>
<p>Christianity without the Holy Spirit is mere religion. In fact, it’s very difficult to win souls without the Holy Spirit. As a child of God, being filled with the Holy Spirit every day isn’t negotiable. You have to know Him, walk in Him and with Him. He has to become a constant part of your life.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly….”</em> Your understanding of the Word will drive you to live every day of your life for the expansion of God’s Kingdom; nothing else will make sense to you in this world, except the things of Christ. With the Word of God in your spirit, and coming forth from your mouth, you can serve the Lord faithfully and bring Him glory now, and in the ages to come. Have a wild and voracious appetite for the Word.</p>
<p>Your love for the Master will compel you to tell the world of His saving power. 2 Corinthians 5:14 (NIV) says, <em>“For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.”</em> The Apostle Paul is showing us the motivational force behind his overwhelming passion for the Gospel; it was the love of Christ. You can’t love Him and not be propelled to tell the world about it. You’ll wake up every day inspired and aflame to serve God. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour (Titus 1:2-3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve got to preach the Word; we’ve got to tell the untold, or they’ll never have the chance to believe it and be saved. Romans 10:13-14 says, <em>“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?”</em></p>
<p>Without a preacher, they can’t hear the Gospel. This is why we’re compelled to preach the Gospel everywhere. The Apostle Paul said, <em>“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek”</em> (Romans 1:16).</p>
<p>There’s no salvation without the Gospel. The power of God to bring someone out of trouble, distress, sin and death is in the Gospel of Christ. We read in our theme verse that God promised eternal life before the world began; and now, He has fulfilled His promise, manifested His Word, and made eternal life available through the preaching of the Gospel.</p>
<p>See how blessed we are to be the custodians and bearers of the divine order; ambassadors of divine realities! They’re not going to get the Gospel any other way, until we preach it to them. Put your whole life into this, as it’s all that truly matters. Ensure the Gospel gets to as many as have been ordained to receive it in your world and in the regions beyond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Lean on, trust in, and be confident in the Lord with all your heart and mind and do not rely on your own insight or understanding. In all your ways know, recognize, and acknowledge Him, and He will direct and make straight and plain your paths (Proverbs 3:5-6 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever asked yourself, “Is my life in alignment with God’s perfect will for me?” It’s important to be sure. Jesus said, “If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine…” (John 7:17). So, if you’re willing to do His will, He’ll teach you. </p>
<p>But sometimes, there’re those who are afraid to let God have His way in their lives. They think He’ll change their dream that they’ve so nursed all their lives. They feel He might lead them to become something they don’t want. Well, that’s because they don’t know Him; if you don’t know Him, you can’t trust Him. But if you ever get to know Him, you’d learn to trust Him.</p>
<p>All He ever wants is the best for you. He’s more ambitious for your success than you could ever be. The day I discovered this truth, I said, “Dear Lord Jesus, now I trust you with my life.” I wanted to be a success for Him, but He was more ambitious for my success than I could have been. I found out He loved me more than I loved myself; wiser than I could ever be, and I became bold and focused!</p>
<p>Remember, He created the whole world, including you. He knows everything inside you. Not only does He know everything about you, He knows everything about life. All He wants is that you say, “Yes, Lord, I’m ready.” He’s experienced in dealing with all kinds of people, and He knows exactly what to do with someone like you.</p>
<p>Trust Him with your life. Stay at the centre of His will, and you’ll never lose. 1 Peter 2:6 says, <em>“… he that believeth on him shall not be confounded”</em>; that means you’ll never be disgraced or put to the blush for trusting in Him. Therefore, be confident in the Lord with all your heart and mind and submit to His dream for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called (1 Timothy 6:20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word “trust” in the scripture above is an interesting Greek word, “parakatatheke” and it means a deposit, the investment of your personality. Something has been deposited in you. You have to come to the realization that the Gospel, the same message that saved your life, has been committed to your trust.</p>
<p>Paul knew it. In 1 Timothy 1:11, he affirmed*, “According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.”* What a consciousness! He took personal responsibility for the Gospel. It should be the same with you.</p>
<p>Your co-workers, business associates, schoolmates, family members, co-tenants, friends and all those He ever connects you with are all hanging on to the trust committed to you by God. He holds you responsible as their witness; you’re the witness to your generation. You’ve got to be committed to bringing salvation to those in your world. That’s what success is. You become a fruit-producing branch, fulfilling what Jesus said in John 15:5: <em>“I am the vine; ye are the branches....”</em></p>
<p>Always declare, “I’m a fruit-bearing branch, in the Name of the Lord Jesus! I bear fruits of righteousness and manifest works of righteousness.” Declare it, and act accordingly. That’s what the Apostle Paul was communicating to the young minister, Timothy, in our theme verse—the consciousness of what was committed to his trust.</p>
<p>You carry the seeds of the Kingdom of God inside you. That’s your number one ministry in life. Remember the words of Jesus: <em>“But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you”</em> (Matthew 6:33). Now that you’re in His Kingdom, make it your priority, and His glory will be manifested in and through you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also (John 14:2-3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people interpret the above scripture to mean that Jesus went to Heaven to construct our mansions. So, they think when someone gives his or her life to Christ, God starts building a mansion for that person in Heaven. But they forget that the Bible says <em>“…the works were finished from the foundation of the world”</em> (Hebrews 4:3). Heaven is a beautiful place, and it’s already been built. So, what place was Jesus talking about then?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: The Bible says Jesus was victorious in hell, and when He came to the disciples in Galilee, He said, <em>“...All hail”</em> (Matthew 28:9). Then He went into Heaven and was given a place! That place isn’t a chair beside or close to the Father; no, He got the Father’s seat! He’s set on the Father’s throne of Majesty in the heavens. It’s the place of the highest authority.</p>
<p>Then the scripture says, <em>“If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God”</em> (Colossians 3:1 NKJV). Everything Jesus did was for us. The place He went to prepare for us is the place at the right hand of the Father; He got us a place in, and with Himself in glory. Now we’re seated together with Him in the heavenly realms.</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:24 says, <em>“For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.”</em> As long as Jesus is in Heaven, we’re well represented in heaven. He represents us there! That’s why He told us to live in His Name. Colossians 3:17 says, <em>“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus….”</em> This is because He’s there in our Name, and we’re here in His Name. We reign and rule over Satan and the cohorts of darkness, in His Name. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen (Revelation 1:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase, “kings and priests” in the scripture above is also rendered “a kingdom of priests” in other translations. The reader tends to assume that “a kingdom of priests” is referring to a kingdom where there’re priests. But the accurate expression is “king-priests.” He’s made us king-priests, which is a fulfilment of prophecy!</p>
<p>In Exodus 19:5-6, God had said to the children of Israel, <em>“Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine: And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.”</em> The word translated “kingdom” is the word “royal.” So, when God said to the Israelites, “I’m going to make you a kingdom of priests,” He meant, “You’ll be royal priests or king-priests.”</p>
<p>Peter knew that the fulfilment of that prophecy had taken place in Christ Jesus. The Bible says, “For all the promises of God in him are yes…” (2 Corinthians 1:20). Therefore, He’s got a royal priesthood: <em>“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light”</em> (1 Peter 2:9 AMPC).</p>
<p>As a king-priest, your primary responsibility is kingly intercession, with prayers and supplications. God has given you the dominion and the authority to alter the course of events in the earth, using the Name of Jesus. So, side with God in bringing His will to pass in the earth; in your family, in the lives of those around you, in your city and country. Learn to direct the influence of God’s power towards them in prayer until you have a note of victory in your spirit. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid (Matthew 5:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In John 8, we read of a certain woman who was caught in the act of adultery and was to be stoned to death. But it turned out she knew where Jesus was and ran to Him. The mob came after her, and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, for what this woman has done, we’re supposed to stone her to death; do you have any objections?” (John 8:4-5). Jesus said, “Well, no objections, but get started with any one of you who’s without sin.”</p>
<p>The Bible says they all dropped their stones and went away, crestfallen. Then in the 12th verse, after mollifying the woman, He made an astounding statement; He said, <em>“...I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”</em> What’s the connection between this statement and what He did for that woman? If we understand it, then we can begin to understand what He expects of us.</p>
<p>In John 9, He came across a man who was blind from birth. Again, Jesus repeated that statement: <em>“As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world”</em> (John 9:5). And the next thing, He performed a miracle. <em>“...he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay”</em> (John 9:6).</p>
<p>The adulterous woman was at the verge of death, and Jesus stepped in and said, “I’m the light of the world,” and saved her! Then He saw a blind man who didn’t even have eyes, and He said, “I AM your light!” Glory to God! Jesus was saying to them, “I am what you need me to be. If you need deliverance, I am your deliverance. If it’s salvation, I am your salvation. If it’s healing, I am your healing.” That’s the meaning of “I AM.” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Now, He turns to us and says, “Ye are the light of the world.” Suddenly, His expectation dawns in our spirits! That means as you step out today, a change will take place in someone’s life because of you. If someone were blind, through you, he could have his eyes restored! Someone who was sick could be healed. A lame person could walk. Why? You’re the light of the world, just like Jesus. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Each of you must take responsibility for doing the creative best you can with your own life (Galatians 6:5 MSG).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Christians try to blame God for what actually is their responsibility. Oftentimes, when something unpleasant happens, they conclude that it’s the will of God; otherwise, “Why did He let it happen?” they muse. What we need to realise is that the authority to change things on earth, and make our lives as beautiful as we desire, has been given to us. You can make your life glorious by living out God’s Word.</p>
<p>In Matthew 17:20, the Lord Jesus was emphatic when He said, <em>“...verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.”</em> He makes it clear that you can create your victories by acting your faith on the Word of God. He already gave you the measure of faith you require to effect the changes you desire.</p>
<p>In Mark 9:23, He said, <em>“...all things are possible to him that believeth.”</em> The question is, do you believe? If you do, then you have before you a life of endless possibilities. Put the Word to work in your life, and you’ll always be victorious.</p>
<p>Don’t “wait” for His Word to come to pass in your life; rather, <em>“…work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”</em> (Philippians 2:12). You’re to work out the Word in your life and make it produce results. Using your faith, you can be what you want to be, change what you want to change, and achieve whatever you want to achieve!</p>
<p>God has already given you the dominion and ability to make your life prosperous. He said in Joshua 1:8, <em>“This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.”</em> It’s about what you do with the Word! You have to meditate on it and live accordingly, and the glory of God will be manifest in your life.</p>

<p><em><strong>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels (Mark 8:38).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re some people who are ashamed to be identified with Jesus and His Church; how tragic that is! Your oneness with the Lord is the greatest, most sublime and royal identity ever. Celebrate it at every opportunity. Seize every moment to glorify Jesus Christ. Let your love for Him be loud and unequivocal.</p>
<p>If you’re ashamed to let the world—your friends, family members, colleagues, etc.—know that you belong to Jesus Christ and are a member of the household of faith, the Master also will be ashamed to acknowledge you before the Father and the angels.</p>
<p>Irrespective of anyone’s perception of Christ and of Christianity, you’re in the most dignified, honourable and transcendent union there is. You’re an associate of the God-kind, a God-carrying vessel, a bearer of the divine order and conveyor of eternal verities.</p>
<p>Be unapologetic in declaring your oneness with Jesus Christ and your unalloyed commitment to Him, His Kingdom, and the Church. Nothing, and no one, should ever make you distance yourself from Christ or repudiate your faith in Him. Even the fiercest threats or persecution from the adversary shouldn’t get you to cower. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned (Mark 16:15-16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, it’s important to realize that His glorious return is imminent, much closer than many realize. Therefore, we must intensify our efforts in reaching the lost, in telling the untold in our world and in the regions beyond that He is the way, the truth, and the life. Only through Him can men be saved and brought into God’s class of being and realm of life.</p>
<p>Until and unless a man is born again, his life will be the expression of all that’s happened to him, beginning from his lineage: where he was born, his nationality, locality, education, government, etc. All of these factors would form what becomes of his life. That means he’ll be limited to the environment and earthly lineage; how sad.</p>
<p>But when you’re born again, old things are passed away (2 Corinthians 5:17). Suddenly, you’re brought into a life that’s beyond the earthly plane, where you’re not limited by any factor or the elements of this world. You now live in a new environment by a new principle of life, which is God’s Word. You’re now a partaker of the divine nature, no longer subject to sin, sickness, disease and death, because you received the God-life.</p>
<p>What a message to herald to the world; that God sent His son Jesus to the world that we may have His life, and also be the dispensers of that life. Tell the untold; reach the unreached; tell the nations, the farthest islands, that He lives, and the life He brought is available to everyone who believes: <em>“…and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life…”</em> (1 John 5:11-12).</p>
<p>As you celebrate this season, be strengthened in your spirit, and propelled to tell the world that the Lord is God; and He’s brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel. Anyone who’s born again receives the same life with Him. This is the message He’s charged us to preach and spread to the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly (John 10:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christmas is about who Jesus is, and what He came to do. He didn’t come to establish a religion. He didn’t come to merely show us how to do good things; He came to give us life; God’s life. God made us, and He wanted us to have His kind of life, and His plan was that Jesus would be the one to give us that life.</p>
<p>He also planned that we would receive that life through faith, because His kingdom is inapparent to the senses. Hebrews 11:6 says without faith, it’s impossible to please God. The Christmas carol: “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing” puts it succinctly in its verse: “…Born that man no more may die; born to raise the sons of earth; born to give them second birth.” How beautiful!</p>
<p>However, the biggest thing is Christ born in your heart. The Bible says, <em>“Christ in you, the hope of glory”</em> (Colossians 1:27). We’re talking about the Lord, the One who was raised from the dead and ascended into heaven; the Son of the living God—taking up His abode in the quarters of your heart!</p>
<p>This means He’s become one with your spirit. No wonder Peter said we’re associates, comrades of the God-kind (2 Peter 1:4). Christmas means you’re in Christ and Christ is in you; you have the life and nature of God in you NOW! Hallelujah! If you haven’t yet received that life, you can do so right away. Turn to the Prayer Of Salvation on page 76 and pray that prayer. Say those words and mean them with all your heart and your life will immediately become the manifestation of His goodness, glory, grace and love.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? (John 14:8-9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though Christmas, which is the celebration of the birth of Jesus, is inarguably the most popular holiday in the world, there’re still many who don’t know who Jesus really is. To some, He’s a great religious leader. But Jesus isn’t a mere religious leader or reformist; He’s Himself, God. You have to study the Word of God to discover this. In John 5:39, Jesus said, “…search the Scriptures, for they testify of me.” </p>
<p>The Scriptures testify of Jesus as Deity. John 1:1 says, <em>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”</em> Verse 14 says, <em>“And the Word was made (became) flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.”</em> This refers to Jesus; so in celebrating Christmas, you’re celebrating the living and incarnate Word.</p>
<p>Study the Bible for yourself, from Genesis to Revelation, and you’ll come to one conclusion: Jesus Christ is God! Recall His words in John 10:30, <em>“I and my Father are one.”</em> In our opening verse, He said, “If you have seen me, you have seen the Father.” He’s one with the Father.</p>
<p>You’ve got to come to that point in your life where you recognise that Jesus is the fullness of Deity. The Bible declares that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (Colossians 1:19, 2:9). He’s the complete embodiment of Deity. This is the “Christ” of Christ-mas; we’re celebrating God who came to us in the body of Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew]...[living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus was born that men may have, and live the good life, as our theme scripture reveals. In John 10:10 AMPC, He said, <em>“…I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows).”</em></p>
<p>You weren’t born to merely live, but to live the good life which He prepared for you ahead of time—an excellent life. Now, you can be full of enthusiasm, joy and strength, doing great things, blessing your world every day. It can be Christmas for you every day! That’s God’s plan and His Word to you even now; and His Word to you is all that matters.</p>
<p>You have something to celebrate, not just this season, but every day: His life in you; His Word in your spirit. No matter where you are in this world, no matter the challenges you may have faced, you can shout, “I’m free” because Jesus gave you a life that’s beyond this world, a life that’s superior to the decadence and corruption of this failing world; a life that’s divine; untainted and immune to sickness, disease and infirmities; a life that’s indestructible. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve been living in fear because of an unfavourable diagnosis from the doctors about your health; the life in you is superior to sickness. You’ve arrived in the place where sickness and disease have lost their grip on you. Let go of the fears. Walk in the truth; live in the truth.</p>
<p>The truth is that you have the God-life in you; you’re an offspring of the Word. Greater is He that’s in you than any sickness that may attempt to fasten itself on you. You’ve overcome diabetes, heart trouble, chest pain, cancer, fibroid, or whatever health challenge it may be! The strength of God is in you now. So you can live and enjoy your life in sound health, prosperity, peace and joy EVERY DAY; that’s what Christmas means. That’s why Jesus came (John 10:10 AMPC). Blessed be His Name forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth (John 1:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christmas means the Word has come; the Word is born. The Word became flesh and walked the streets; they beheld His glory until He was slain. But God raised Him up and showed Him openly to be alive with many infallible proofs. Now, He abides in you. Praise God!</p>
<p>They waited for the Word, expected His glory that the prophets spoke about; they expected His light, for gross darkness had covered the world and ignorance had gained the mastery. But then the Word came, born of a virgin and walked this earth, full of glory, grace, and truth that all men might see and believe.</p>
<p>But many didn’t recognize Him. He asked His disciples, “Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?” Sadly, they didn’t know Him, but Peter spoke up and said, <em>“Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God”</em> (Matthew 16:16). John calls Him, “the Word made flesh”; He gives us the actual origin of the man, Christ Jesus—He’s the Word that pre-existed creation and by whom all things were created (John 1:1-3). </p>
<p>His birth brought joy to the world, a pure marvel to see the eternal Word of God wrapped in swaddling clothes; to be with, and walk amongst men! No wonder they called Him “Emmanuel” (God with us) (Matthew 1:23). He was born “Emmanuel,” but today, He’s the Word alive in you.</p>
<p>Every step Jesus took was the Word of God in motion; the Word personified. And the day you received Him to live in you, you became the Word in motion, for as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17). No wonder Paul calls us the Epistle (Word) of Christ (2 Corinthians 3:3). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory... (2 Corinthians 3:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, it’s possible to look at yourself and not seem like what God says you are. Even in this season of celebration, especially after all that has happened this year, you may think through your life and wonder, “What’s really there to celebrate? Life has been so hard.” When you think or talk like that, you’re going in the wrong direction. Stop looking at circumstances; look at the Word.</p>
<p>Our theme verse says as you behold the glory of God in a mirror, which is the Word of God, you’re metamorphosed into the same image that you see in the Word. The more you look into (meditate) on God’s Word, the more you know who you are, see what you have, and your ability and glory in Christ Jesus. The circumstances of life are mere shadows; you don’t look at your shadow to determine who you are and what you look like; you look in the mirror.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Christ in you, the hope of glory”</em> (Colossians 1:27). It makes no difference what your experiences have been; Christ is in you. That means there’s glory in your life! That’s what the mirror shows. This is what Christmas is about! Christmas means Christ has taken up His abode in you; He’s the glory of your life. He came for you, to live in you and through you. Hallelujah! Accept this truth! Accept what God has said about you and made you, and meditate on that! Be bold to affirm, “Now that Christ lives in me, I’ll never fail; I’m forever victorious and I express the glory and righteousness of His glorious kingdom every day and everywhere.” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Throughout this season, meditate on God’s truth; who you are and your inheritance in Him. You’re a success. You’re in prosperity, health, peace and safety. He’s given you an extraordinary life of ever-increasing progress and greatness. Believe this, speak and live accordingly.</p>

<p><em><strong>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success (Joshua 1:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, having several Bible translations and the emergence of Bibles in electronic devices has made it increasingly difficult for many to memorise Scriptures. Very easily, you can search and locate verses, and in different translations, at the click or push of a button. But this shouldn’t take the place or relegate the importance of memorizing scriptures as part of your personal spiritual growth.</p>
<p>Memorising Scriptures helps you exercise your mind to retain the Word of God. Your mind is the doorway to your spirit (2 Corinthians 4:4). The Word of God has to be in your consciousness to produce results in your life. When it’s in your consciousness, it’ll be in your mouth; and the Word in your mouth is a creative force.</p>
<p>As you read your Bible, pick out striking verses and recite them repeatedly by heart. This is the beginning of meditation, and the more you do this, the more the Word will gain the ascendancy in your spirit.</p>
<p>Set the target to memorize a verse of scripture per day and measure your progress in it. You’d be amazed at the impact of the Word in your life.</p>

<p><em><strong>And be constantly renewed in the spirit of your mind [having a fresh mental and spiritual attitude], And put on the new nature (the regenerate self) created in God’s image, [Godlike] in true righteousness and holiness (Ephesians 4:23-24 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being born again, you have the life and nature of God. You were recreated in righteousness and true holiness, to express the will and nature of the Father. Your spirit was recreated in the image and likeness of God. In other words, you were created to be like Him, and to function like Him.</p>
<p>It’s thus possible for you to express His will and nature, His life and divine attributes that are in your spirit. The Spirit’s admonition in our opening verse to “Put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness” simply means to express His life of righteousness in you. In every matter, in every place, at every opportunity, let His righteousness be expressed through you. In anything that you’re involved in, you bear testimony by your life, actions and words to the character of God! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>You’re His expression and extension to your world; this has always been His dream: to express Himself fully in, and through you. Only through you can He show forth His goodness, grace, wisdom and excellence to the world. The natural or unregenerate man can’t know who God is until they meet you.</p>
<p>Make it your life’s work that through the Holy Spirit, everywhere you are, you’ll manifest Christ; you’ll manifest His glory; you’ll express the God-life, for that’s your calling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For God, the Faithful One, is not unfair. How can he forget the work you have done for him? He remembers the love you demonstrate as you continually serve his beloved ones for the glory of his name (Hebrews 6:10 TPT).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is as inspiring as it’s comforting! Everything you do for the Lord is recorded, and He rewards you for it. He’s mindful of your work and labour of love. You may have been told you were wasting your time or being foolish for preaching the Gospel and serving the Lord as you do, but God cares about your work. Therefore, keep at it.</p>
<p>He said in Revelation 22:12, <em><strong>“And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.”</strong></em> What a day that will be! What a day to look forward to! So I urge you with the same words of the Spirit by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:58, “Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”</p>
<p>There may be times that you’re about the Lord’s work and there seem to be adversities on every side; don’t despair. At such times, always remember that the Lord isn’t unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love. He’ll reward you for all that you do, and have done in and for His Kingdom.</p>
<p>He knows about your tears in intercession; your passion in prayer for lost souls. He’s aware of all your financial contributions to the spread of the Gospel, and your personal evangelical efforts to win souls for Christ. He’s aware of all the sacrifices you’ve made for His Name’s sake; the time, money, family, friends and relationships you gave up for Him! He hasn’t forgotten.</p>
<p>Your blessing isn’t deferred but begins here on earth (read Mark 10:29-31). You’re never a fool for your devotion to Christ. Your faith, hope and love are not in vain. Keep doing all that the Lord inspires you to do for Him; keep spreading His glory through your works of righteousness in your world, and in the regions beyond.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich (2 Corinthians 8:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse above isn’t referring to spiritual riches and spiritual poverty. When you study the entire chapter in context, you’d understand Paul was dealing with financial and material prosperity. For our sake, Jesus laid down His reputation, His riches and wealth; He laid down everything and identified Himself with us, and took our place. He became us. Everything He did was for our sake. He wasn’t poor, but He became poor for your sake. In the same way, you weren’t rich, but now in Him, you’ve been made rich, just as in Him you’ve been made righteous.</p>
<p>An understanding of this truth will cause you to walk in your heritage in Christ; your wealthy place in God. Your trust shouldn’t be in the government, the society or in the job that you do. Your trust shouldn’t be in any banking reform. Your trust has to be in the Word. He already became poor so that you, through His poverty, might become rich. Now, you’re to step into what He’s done for you and who He’s made you. You’re to walk in the glory that He’s brought you into. That was the essence of His suffering: <em>“…the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow”</em> (1 Peter 1:11). The glory now follows. Hallelujah!</p>
