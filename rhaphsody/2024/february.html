<p><em><strong>Giving thanks unto the Father, which  hath made us meet to be partakers of  the inheritance of the saints in light  (Colossians 1:12).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 1:12</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Did you know that living a life of thanksgiving is one of the ways to keep yourself in perfect health? There’re those who believe that nobody can be perfectly healthy, and they’re wrong; perfect health is the right of every Christian. That’s what the Bible teaches.</p>
<p>Notice what we read in our opening verse: <em>“Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.”</em> He wants your life to be a life of thanksgiving always, because the Father has qualified you to be a partaker of the inheritance of the saints in the Kingdom of light.</p>
<p>Part of that inheritance is the divine life which comes with divine health. Divine health has been granted you in Christ Jesus and He wants you to maintain it through a life of thanksgiving. So, every day and every month of this year, live the life of thanksgiving; constantly give thanks for all things. It’ll keep you in health always. Hallelujah! </p>

<p><em><strong>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord  unto all pleasing, being fruitful in  every good work, and increasing in the  knowledge of God (Colossians 1:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord  unto all pleasing, being fruitful in  every good work, and increasing in the  knowledge of God (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 1:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s so much to learn from this prayer of the Spirit through the Apostle Paul. It gives us an idea of a true and balanced Christian life—an excellent life. It says that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God. </p>
<p>That&#x27;s extraordinary; it reveals God’s will for you as a Christian. He wants your daily life to be worthy of Him— walking in His righteousness and pleasing Him in all things. Jesus always pleased the Father; He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:29</a>, <em>“And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.”</em></p>
<p>It should be your life’s work to always and only do those things that please the Father. Along with this, he says, “being fruitful in every good work.” Think about the kind of life where you’re fruitful in every good work. That’s what we have in Christ Jesus—an excellent life. It reminds of the words of the Psalmist in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 1:3</a>: <em>“...he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.”</em></p>
<p>That’s not all; as you’re walking worthy of the Lord, pleasing Him in all things and fruitful in every good work, He also wants you to increase in the knowledge of God. There’re people who, even though are doing well in their work, aren&#x27;t increasing in the knowledge of God. No! He wants your life to be balanced.</p>
<p>Don’t let it be that your job or business distracted you from giving time to prayer, studying the Scriptures, and growing in the things of God. A true and balanced Christian life is walking in righteousness, pleasing the Lord in all things, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God. Hallelujah! </p>

<p><em><strong>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:57&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 15:57</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>

<p>It’s still very early in the year, and it’s important to be decisive as to how you’re going to live. Be determined that you’re going to win every day; you’re going to put the Word to work and there’ll be no limit to your success.</p>
<p>Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 11:23</a>, <em>“For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.”</em></p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2017:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 17:20</a>, He said, <em>“…If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.”</em> This means that with your faith, you can be anything, you can have anything, and you can do anything. You have infinite possibilities!</p>
<p>The question is, are you putting your faith to work? Use your faith to deal with the crises of life every day. Act on the Word. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:22</a> says, <em>“But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.”</em> So produce victories and triumphs in all situations and circumstances by acting on the Word. Hallelujah! </p>

<p><em><strong>But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201:20&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Jude 1:20 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>God’s plan is for you to consistently make progress, and progress means advancement, moving forward. Progress must be measurable; otherwise, it’s not progress. You must have goals; if you don’t have definite goals, you may not be able to really measure your progress. </p>
<p>In making progress, there’re certain things you must consider. First, locate your present position in any area of your life in which you desire to make progress. Is it in the area of your health, finances, job, business, or family? Whatever it is, locate your present position. Secondly, envision what the next level will be for you. </p>
<p>Thirdly, determine what you must do to get to your next level. That means your input in terms of effort, time, and resources. Resources could refer to money, materials, information, etc. Fourthly and finally, take action; do what you need to do to get you the results you want. Otherwise, your visions, goals and aspirations will fail and come to nothing.</p>
<p>You should already have clear-cut goals for the year; stay focused on your goals. Every now and then, pray in the Holy Ghost about your goals; this is so important because it’ll guarantee your progress in achieving your goals. Our opening verse says, <em>“But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit.”</em></p>
<p>This year, you’re going to make progress and move forward in your life like never before, irrespective of what’s been happening with you or around you. The Spirit of God will inspire and guide you to take the necessary actions that’ll cause you to have evident and unprecedented growth, increase, and prosperity in Jesus’ Name.</p>

<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2067:2&amp;version=TLB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 67:2 TLB</a>, David passionately prayed to the Lord, <em>“Send us around the world with the news of your saving power and your eternal plan for all mankind.”</em> David’s prophetic desire is today fulfilled in the words of the Master that we read in our opening verse. He’s charged us to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature; tell the Gospel story everywhere.</p>
<p>Intensify your efforts in reaching the lost, in telling the untold about Christ and His eternal plan of salvation for all mankind. Only through Him can men be saved and brought into God’s class of being and realm of life.</p>
<p>Until and unless a man is born again, his life will be empty and meaningless. But in Christ Jesus, anyone who believes is brought into oneness with God, into a life that’s beyond the earthly plane, where you’re not limited by any factor or the elements of this world. You become a partaker of the divine nature, no longer subject to sin, sickness, disease and death, because you received the God-life. </p>
<p>That’s the message He wants us to herald to the world. Tell it everywhere that Jesus came, lived, died and resurrected so that we may have His life, and also be the dispensers of that life. Tell the nations and the farthest islands that He lives, and the life He brought is available to everyone: <em>“… and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:11-12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 5:11-12</a>). </p>
<p>Be strengthened in your spirit, and propelled to tell the world that the Lord Jesus has brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel. Anyone who’s born again receives the same life with Him. Glorious news! Let’s tell it everywhere. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Giving thanks unto the Father…Who  hath delivered us from the power of  darkness, and hath translated us into  the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12-13).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Giving thanks unto the Father…Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:12-13&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 1:12-13</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In some parts of the world, people desire to “relocate,” maybe to some other country or city where they believe they might have better opportunities. When you received Christ as Lord of your life, you were relocated to the best and most glorious place possible: the Kingdom of God’s Love-Son. </p>
<p>Read the second part of our theme verse again; it says, <em>“Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us</em> (that means transferred or relocated us) <em>into the Kingdom of His dear Son&quot;</em> This means that you’re currently located in the Kingdom of God’s Love-Son where you prosper and all your needs are met. That’s where you are NOW. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s got to be your consciousness that you’re a Kingdom person, and you live the life of the Kingdom. That way, you’ll enjoy the blessings and privileges of the Kingdom. In this Kingdom where you live, there’s no lack or want; only surplus and abundance. David said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2023:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 23:5</a>, <em>“...My cup runneth over.”</em> That’s superabundance. Hallelujah! </p>
<p>Here&#x27;s another thought: your divine relocation was out of the domain—jurisdiction—of darkness, into God’s marvellous light: <em>“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:9</a>). Blessed be God! </p>
<p>Satan, or darkness, has no control or jurisdiction over you; you’re not under their influence. You’re in Christ, in His glorious Kingdom, and in Him there’s no darkness at all (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 1:5</a>). </p>
<p>So enjoy your place in Christ. Enjoy the life of righteousness, dominion, victory, glory and joy in the Holy Ghost. That’s the life of the Kingdom into which you’ve been relocated: <em>“For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 14:17</a>).

<p>Did you know that the Name of Jesus is your ticket to every blessing? It represents more than you could ever imagine or desire. Ponder a bit more on what we just read in our opening scripture. It says, <em>“… Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.”</em></p>
<p>Everything you could ever ask or desire is fulfilled in Christ; all you need do is declare they’re yours in His Name. Every so often, declare, “I’m an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ, a partaker of the inheritance of the saints; all things are mine, in the Name of Jesus!” When you make such declarations, nature responds to you. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Due to ignorance of the finished works of Christ, many still beg Him to bless them, to heal them, to deliver them, etc. It gives them some sort of satisfaction to approach Him with a beggarly attitude. But no! God doesn’t want that, not after all that Jesus accomplished in your behalf through His vicarious sacrifice! He brought you into oneness with divinity. By Him, you have boldness and access by the Spirit to the Father and all the blessings of heaven. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Have you ever pondered on the fact that God is greater than everything He made? He sure is. Now, this same God, not only did He give you all things, not only has He blessed you with ALL spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, He also gave you Himself. Nothing could be greater. That’s the meaning of Christ in you.</p>
<p>The Bible says <em>“To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:27</a>). Christ in you is everything. Christ in you is God in you. Hallelujah! The implication of our position in Him and our oneness with Him is that we use His Name, we have His Name, and we live in His Name. His Name has exactly the same power that He has as a person. His Name represents everything that He is. And that Name has been given to you.</p>
<p>Christians who don’t understand this are the ones who pray, “O God! Please help me with this or that; give me this or give me that.” Praying like that is pointless because He gave you His Name, and you’re a joint-heir with Him, meaning you own the world with Him. </p>
<p>As read in our theme verse, He gave you everything. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:32&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 12:32</a> says, <em>“Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father&#x27;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom”</em>; and He’s done it! He’s given you the Kingdom. There’s nothing of Him that you don’t have; nothing He hasn’t given you.</p>
<p>He gave you His life, His Name, and His wealth, and you’re seated together with Him in the heavenly realms. What more do you want? Take your place of dominion, reigning and ruling with Him. Amen.</p>

<p><em><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our  Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us  with all spiritual blessings in heavenly  places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Did you know that it’s pointless to ask God for any more blessings? The Word says He has blessed us with ALL spiritual blessings in heavenly places. Prosperity is a blessing. Divine health is a blessing. Joy is a blessing. Strength is a blessing. Success is a blessing. All these and more are already yours in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>The Bible says God is a Spirit; therefore, all the blessings He has must be spiritual. The material world came out of the spirit realm. So, when God says we have been blessed with all spiritual blessings, it means every physical blessing you can imagine is already yours because spiritual blessings are greater than material blessings; the lesser is included in the greater.</p>
<p>So, whatever you would have asked of God is included in what He&#x27;s already blessed you with because He blessed you with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly realms. Think about that! God doesn&#x27;t have any more blessings except the ones He blessed you with. He&#x27;s blessed you with all that He&#x27;s got. Blessed be God! </p>
<p>But the key is that you’ve got to be in Christ; the blessings are in Christ and for those in Christ. And thank God you’re in Christ for in Him you have EVERYTHING— you have all things that pertain to life and godliness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3</a>). In Christ, all things are yours (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). In Christ, your glory life is guaranteed. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But we all, with open face beholding  as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are  changed into the same image from glory  to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord  (2 Corinthians 3:18).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 3:18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Never be deterred by the adversities you face. There’re no circumstances or situations in life that are set to your disadvantage. Even when things appear to become hard and there’s pressure on every side, don’t despair; look at the Word. Keep your focus and meditation on the Word.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:17-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 4:17-18</a> says, <em>“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.”</em></p>
<p>Recall what we read in our theme verse; as you behold the glory of God in a mirror, which is the Word of God, you’re metamorphosed! You are transfigured from one level of glory to another. The more you look into or meditate on God’s Word, the more glorious your life becomes. You suddenly realize that the circumstances of life are mere shadows; they’re not real and therefore shouldn’t define you. </p>
<p>So, it makes no difference what your experiences have been; you’re a victor forever because the greater One lives in you. The Bible says, <em>“...Christ in you, the hope of glory”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:27</a>). That means there’s glory in your life, and it’s an eternal glory that’s ever-increasing as you meditate on God’s truths: who you are and your inheritance in Him.</p>
<p>You’re a success. You’re in prosperity, health, peace and safety. He’s given you an extraordinary life of ever-increasing progress and greatness, to express the glory and righteousness of His glorious Kingdom. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus is set far above “all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.” This is extraordinary. Then in the concluding part, it says God put ALL things under the feet of Jesus for the benefit of the Church. </p>
<p>There’s nothing God didn’t put under the feet of Jesus. No wonder the Bible says nothing is exempt from His rule. There’s only One who has authority over all things in heaven and in the earth; He rules over all. His name is Jesus.</p>
<p>The Message translation says He’s <em>“…in charge of running the universe, everything from galaxies to governments, no name and no power exempt from his rule. And not just for the time being, but forever. He is in charge of it all, has the final word on everything”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:21&amp;version=MSG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:21</a>). When it says “all things,” that includes all nations, all sicknesses, all demons, and every name that can be named—not only in this world but also in that which is to come. </p>
<p>Now, Christ’s dominion over all things is for the benefit of the Church. The Lord Jesus is the head of the Body, the Church. That means all things are therefore under the feet of the Church. Can you see why you must live as a victor every day of your life? </p>
<p>All things are under your feet, including Satan and his cohorts of darkness. Death, hell, the world, circumstances, living and non-living things are under your dominion. Christ’s authority, reign and dominion are for your benefit. You reign through Him and can do all things in His Name.</p>

<p>As a new creation in Christ, you only have one nature—the Christ-nature. Your recreated human spirit is made in the image and likeness of Christ. Therefore, in all you do, and at all times, live your Christ-nature.</p>
<p>When you talk, let Christ be heard. Let His love emit and effuse from your words and actions. Let His wisdom and righteousness overwhelm the hearts of your hearers as you speak only gracious and lifting words; let Him talk through you. Let Him see through your eyes. Let Him work with your hands.</p>
<p>The real essence of Christianity is Christ in you, manifesting and expressing Himself in and through you. The Christian is one who expresses, exudes and demonstrates the life, nature, character and righteousness of Christ. </p>
<p>For example, in times of provocations, when you’re offended, what’s revealed in you? You ought to let Christ be revealed in you. In appraising your spiritual growth, one of the things you check is how much your actions, attitude and character express or depict the righteousness or character of Christ.</p>

<p><em><strong>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 1:14</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening verse refers to Jesus, the incarnate Word; they beheld His glory as He walked the streets until He was slain. But God raised Him up and showed Him openly to be alive with many infallible proofs. Now, He abides in you. Praise God!</p>
<p>They waited for the Word and expected His glory that the prophets spoke about. But then the Word came, born of a virgin and walked this earth, yet many didn’t recognize Him. He asked His disciples, “Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?” </p>
<p>Sadly, they didn’t know Him. But Peter, by revelation, spoke up and said, <em>“...Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 16:16</a>). John calls Him, “the Word made flesh”; He gives us the actual origin of the man, Christ Jesus: He’s the Word that pre-existed creation and by whom all things were created (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:1-3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:1-3</a>). </p>
<p>It was thus a pure marvel to see the eternal Word of God, born of a virgin and wrapped in swaddling clothes, grow and walk amongst men! No wonder they called Him “Emmanuel,” &#x27;God with us&#x27; (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%201:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 1:23</a>). He was born “Emmanuel,” but today, He’s the Word alive in you. </p>
<p>Every step Jesus took was the Word of God in motion. He was the Word personified. And the day you received Him to live in you, you also became the Word made flesh, being born of the same Word of God: <em>“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 1:23</a>). </p>
<p>So, like Jesus, you’re the Word in motion, for as He is, so are we in this world (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:17</a>). Now you understand why we’re called the Epistle (Word) of Christ (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:1-3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 3:1-3</a>).

<p>Many people desire the leading of the Holy Spirit in their lives but don’t know how to yield themselves to Him. Do we yield ourselves by bowing our heads and kneeling before Him? You may bow to Him physically in reverence, but this won’t give the guidance and leading you desire. </p>
<p>In yielding to the Holy Spirit, you must submit to His Word. You give yourself to what He tells you to do and let the Word of God live through you. The Holy Spirit is the author of the Scriptures, and the primary way He leads is through the Word. </p>

<p>As you study the Word, the leading of the Holy Spirit in your life will increase, for you’ll be able to recognize His voice. The Word of God and the Spirit of God bear witness to Jesus as the Living Word. He said, <em>“Search the scriptures…they are they which testify of me&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:39&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 5:39</a>). </p>
<p>He also said, <em>“But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 15:26</a>). The more you let the Word of God dominate your mind, your decisions and your outlook on life, the more the Holy Spirit controls your life and leads you from victory to victory. Even now, declare that God’s Word has power over your life, to lead you, control you and guide you in all that you do. </p>

<p><em><strong>Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016:6-7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 16:6-7</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Paul and his companions decided to go to certain regions to preach the Gospel, but the Holy Spirit prevented them from going at that time. How did they know it was the Holy Spirit who didn’t want them to go? They were so acquainted and yielded to Him that they could recognize His voice. As a result, the Spirit led and instructed them to go to Macedonia instead, to preach (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016:8-9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 16:8-9</a>). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit has a voice, and He speaks to you from the Word. Whenever He speaks, He speaks wisdom, for the Word of God is the Wisdom of God! That’s why it’s so important for you to learn and know God’s Word. He never says anything outside the Word. Whatever He tells you is always in sync with the written Word and consistent with God’s will for your life. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 16:13</a> says, <em>“Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.”</em> If you’re acquainted with the Word, you’ll know whenever the Holy Spirit talks to you, for He bears witness to the Scriptures. </p>
<p>When He tells you to do anything, don’t question it. You can’t follow His leading and lose. He’ll lead and guide you from success to success, and from glory to glory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This book of the law shall not depart out  of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate  therein day and night, that thou mayest  observe to do according to all that is  written therein: for then thou shalt make  thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt  have good success (Joshua 1:8).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Joshua 1:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%204:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 4:15</a>, Paul said to Timothy, <em>“Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.”</em> When you study our opening verse in the Greek Septuagint, it actually says that not only will you have good success from meditating on the Word, you’ll also become perceptive. The Greek word is “suniami” and it means that you become sagacious or perspicacious; your intelligence rises to a very high level. You’ll find that you’re acutely insightful and penetratingly perceptive. </p>
<p>It reminds of what the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119:98-99&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 119:98-99</a>, <em>“Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me. I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.”</em> He’s talking about the Word of God.</p>
<p>You might as well say, “Thou, through thy Word, hast made me wiser than mine enemies….” That becomes your confession. The Word of God gives you the perception, the wisdom, and the ability to put ideas and concepts together. Notice the latter part: <em>“...I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation....”</em></p>
<p>God’s testimonies refer to God’s declarations, His declarations about Himself, about us, about His Kingdom etc. These are His testimonies, and because you meditated upon His testimonies you have more understanding than all your teachers. Glory to God. </p>
<p>In verse 100, it says, <em>“I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.”</em> This is part of what the Word of God will do in your life if you’d give it attention. In your dealings with people, in your dealings in business, in your dealings in finances, you become wise; divinely circumspect.</p>
<p>That means no room for failure in your life because the Spirit of God, through the Word, gives you an extraordinary amplitude of mind. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Revelation 21:1</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 21</a>, the Apostle John tells us about a new heaven and a new earth. He gives us a description of the holy city, the New Jerusalem: <em>“And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:2-4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 21:2-4</a>).</p>
<p>Verses 18-19 further describe the beauty of the city. Imagine a city of pure glass-gold! <em>“And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones….”</em></p>
<p>The 23rd and 25th verses take it even further: <em>“And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.”</em> What a place to look forward to!</p>
<p>Your focus shouldn’t be on this current world that’ll be destroyed. Rather, let your passion be all about Christ and the spread of His righteousness around the world as we await His glorious return.</p>
<p>Remember His words, <em>“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208:36&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 8:36</a>). This world, which will surely be destroyed and replaced with another, isn’t worth the loss of your soul; so live your life for the Lord.</p>

<p>Our opening verse refers to the eternal reign and dominion of our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of kings and Lord of lords.

<p>Our Lord Jesus heads the Kingdom of God which we’re a part of. It’s a real, functional spiritual kingdom. Therefore, be Kingdom-conscious and focused. Don’t focus your mind on this earth as though everything ends here; there’s a world that’s greater than this.</p>

<p><em><strong>But without faith it is impossible to  please him: for he that cometh to God  must believe that he is, and that he is a  rewarder of them that diligently seek him  (Hebrews 11:6).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Hebrews 11:6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Everything in the Kingdom of God operates by the principle of faith. So nurturing your faith is so important. Even for the Rapture, your faith would be required because not everyone will hear the sound of the trumpet. </p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:52&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>). The sound of the trumpet will be audible only to the Christians who died in Christ already and those alive at the time.</p>
<p>Everybody else won’t hear it because the sound of the trumpet would only be heard by faith. But it’s not something you’re going to make an effort to hear because as a Christian, you already live by faith. Everything about your life and your relationship with God is by faith; therefore, you’re going to hear it. </p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 11:5</a>). He was raptured by faith. So, with your faith in Jesus Christ, you have nothing to worry about; trust that when the trumpet sounds, you’re going to hear it. </p>
<p>Every Christian ought to go at the Rapture. It therefore means that anyone who doesn’t hasn’t been living the life of faith and living for the Lord. Keep your faith alive, and live for the Master every day. Walk in love and in righteousness. Focus on getting others ready for the Rapture and into the Kingdom of God.</p>

<p><em><strong>And if I go and prepare a place for you,  I will come again, and receive you unto  myself; that where I am, there ye may be  also (John 14:3)</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also</strong></em> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>(John 14:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Many still grapple with what the Lord Jesus meant in the verse above when He said, <em>“...I will come again, and receive you unto myself....”</em> Some think He was referring to the Second Coming or the Rapture, but that’s not what He was talking about in that verse.</p>
<p>To understand what Jesus meant, you’ll have to stay in the context and understand His message with your spirit, not with your senses. When you study the full chapter you’d observe that He continued the same interesting discourse till He got to the 16th verse where He said, <em>“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.”</em></p>
<p>The term “another Comforter” is the Greek phrase, “Allos parakletos,” meaning another of the same kind. Jesus introduced the Holy Spirit at that point. Then He said, <em>“…ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:17</a>). How did the Holy Spirit dwell with them at the time? Wasn’t He supposed to come on the Day of Pentecost?</p>
<p>That tells us something. He wasn’t talking about the Holy Spirit alone; He was also referring to Himself! To drive that point home, He went back to what He said in our theme verse, <em>“...I will come again, and receive you unto myself....”</em> Then in verse 18, He said, <em>“I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.”</em> How and when would He come to them? </p>
<p>In the 20th verse, He said, <em>“At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.”</em> What day was He talking about? Evidently, He was talking about the day when the Holy Spirit comes. So, when He said, “I will come to you,” He meant “I’ll come to you in the Holy Spirit.” </p>
<p>And thanks be unto God! On the Day of Pentecost, He fulfilled that precious promise: <em>“And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 2:4</a>). He’s in you today in all His fullness. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free (J</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:32&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>ohn 8:32</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were created by God’s Word, and His Word is truth; that means we were created by truth. This is why truth has an eternal effect on your spirit; it has an eternal effect of success, victory, prosperity and health in your life because truth is your source. That’s why falsehood, deceit, deception, lies and lying destroy the human spirit. </p>
<p>Our theme verse says, <em>“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,”</em> because man was created by God to be free, to be at liberty to serve Him; he can’t be bound because truth is his true nature. </p>
<p>Before you were born again, you didn’t have the ability to live the truth and live in truth because you were under the dominion of sin. But now, the Bible says, <em>“For sin shall not have dominion over you…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:14</a>). </p>
<p>You have the ability to do away with the habit of telling lies. You don’t need to cry or even ask God to take it away from you. Simply make up your mind to put away lying. The Bible says, <em>“If you want a happy, good life, keep control of your tongue, and guard your lips from telling lies”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:10&amp;version=TLB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 3:10 TLB</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%206:16-19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 6:16-19</a> lists six things that the Lord detests and one of them is <em>“a false witness that speaketh lies.”</em> Truth is in your spirit, and whenever you live in truth, you’re triumphant, and your spirit glows. It doesn’t matter in what situation you may find yourself, truth will put you over because truth is eternal: <em>“The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2012:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 12:19</a>).

<p><em><strong>And for me, that utterance may be given  unto me, that I may open my mouth  boldly, to make known the mystery of the  gospel, For which I am an ambassador in  bonds: that therein I may speak boldly,  as I ought to speak (Ephesians 6:19-20).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:19-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 6:19-20</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In our opening verse, Paul referred to himself as an ambassador of the Gospel. Did you know that the same is true of every one of us? We’re ambassadors of divine verities; we’re preachers of righteousness. The preaching of the Gospel has been committed to you according to the commandment of God our Saviour (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%201:2-3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Titus 1:2-3</a>).</p>
<p>We’ve got to preach the Gospel; we’ve got to tell the untold, or they’ll never have the chance to believe it and be saved. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:13-14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 10:13-14</a> says, <em>“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they…hear without a preacher?”</em></p>
<p>This is why you must passionately preach the Gospel every day and everywhere. The Apostle Paul took it personally. He said, <em>“According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%201:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 1:11</a>). As far as he was concerned it behoved him to preach the Gospel to the whole world even if he had to do it alone.  </p>
<p>Now you can understand why he said, <em>“…necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>). There’s no salvation without the Gospel. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus%201:2-3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Titus 1:2-3</a> tells us something beautiful; it says, <em>“In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour.”</em></p>
<p>God promised eternal life before the world began, and now, He has fulfilled His promise and made eternal life available through the preaching of the Gospel. We’re blessed to be the custodians and bearers of the divine order. Make this your priority, as it’s all that truly matters. Ensure the Gospel gets to as many as have been ordained to receive it in your world and in the regions beyond. </p>

<p>You’re the witness to your generation. Therefore, be committed to bringing salvation to those in your world. That’s where your fulfilment in life lies.

<p>You’re a fruit-bearing branch, bearing fruits of righteousness and manifesting works of righteousness. You carry the seeds of the Kingdom of God inside you. That’s your number one ministry in life. Remember the words of Jesus: <em>“But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:33</a>).</p>
<p>Make the expansion of His Kingdom in the earth your priority, and His glory will be manifested in and through you. You have to come to the realization that the Gospel, the same message that saved your life, has been committed to your trust. </p>
<p>Paul knew it. Hence he declared in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%201:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 1:11</a>, <em>“According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.”</em> Take personal responsibility for the Gospel and you’ll live an absolutely fulfilling and impactful life.</p>

<p>There’re many who don’t understand the purpose for life. So, they think a great life is when you’ve amassed a lot of wealth or earthly possessions; no. Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 12:15</a>, <em>“…Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man&#x27;s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.”</em></p>
<p>He also taught about a rich man who had such a bountiful harvest that he needed to tear down his storehouses and build new ones to store his crops. He was excited to have laid up so much supplies for himself. </p>
<p>But while he was relishing the thought of all that he had amassed, God came into his room and said, <em>“...You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:20&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 12:20 NIV</a>).</p>
<p>What’s the purpose for your life in this world? Why are you here? It’s to make sure the Gospel of Jesus Christ goes to the ends of the earth. Our Lord Jesus said, <em>“...Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:15</a>). In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 28:19</a>, He said, <em>“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations….”</em></p>
<p>Personalize your role in the Gospel and say like the Apostle Paul, <em>“According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%201:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 1:11</a>). Recall what the Lord said to him in Acts 26:16, <em>“…I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 26:16</a>).</p>
<p>We are His witnesses; it should be what excites you. You may not be a pastor, evangelist, teacher, prophet or apostle, but you’re a minister of reconciliation, called to be a soul-winner. So, live your life for Christ unreservedly. Come what may, stand for Jesus Christ and His Kingdom. Preach the Gospel no matter what. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:10 AMPC</a>, Jesus said, <em>“…I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows).”</em> You weren’t born to merely live but to live the good life which God prepared for you ahead of time—an excellent life.</p>
<p>It’s the reason you should always be full of joy and strength, doing great things and blessing your world every day. He’s given you a great life; a life of purpose, power and abundance. It doesn’t matter the challenges you face; you’re victorious in Christ Jesus. </p>
<p>Jesus gave you a life that’s beyond this world, a life that’s superior to the decadence and corruption of this failing world; a life that’s divine. Glory to God! Maybe you’ve been living in fear because of some diagnosis from the doctors about your health; the life in you is superior to sickness.</p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:10&amp;version=ESV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:10 ESV</a>, <em>“But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.”</em> You’ve arrived in the place where sickness and disease have lost their grip on you. Therefore, let go of the fears. </p>
<p>Greater is He that’s in you than any sickness that may attempt to fasten itself on you: <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:4</a>). You’ve overcome diabetes, heart trouble, chest pain, cancer, fibroid, or whatever health challenge it may be! Live and enjoy your life in sound health, prosperity, peace and joy unspeakable and full of glory. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Every good gift and every perfect gift  is from above, and cometh down from  the Father of lights, with whom is no  variableness, neither shadow of turning (James 1:17).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>James 1:17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Something is wrong when someone who was once doing very well financially suddenly starts experiencing unimaginable, protracted financial trouble. Until and unless that individual discerns that that isn’t God’s plan for any of His children, he may blame circumstances, the government or other people around him for his predicament. </p>
<p>He might even blame himself for taking certain actions that he shouldn’t have. But the question is: Does he really know the truth? It’s important that you know who you are, who God is, what you have in Him, and who He is to you. God is your source.</p>
<p>The Bible says we’re heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ. In Christ, your prosperity is stable and ever-increasing. It’s from glory to glory. We don’t go up to come down. It makes no difference the level of inflation and how unstable the world’s economy gets; when you recognize that your true source is the Lord, you’ll be independent of circumstances, unruffled by the state of the world’s economy.</p>
<p>The Bible declares what the one who’s blessed of the Lord shall be like: <em>“For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2017:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 17:8</a>). This tells you something about the consistency of the prosperity of God’s people, following God’s plans.</p>
<p>Part of your new creation heritage is that you’re plugged into an unending supply. Your source never runs dry. Your source isn’t the government, society, job, business, family or anyone else for that matter; it’s the Lord. Look to Him and trust Him for your finances as you act on His principles for financial abundance.</p>

<p><em><strong>According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:4-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:4-6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Consider the tenses in what we just read! Look what we’ve got! It’s part of the reasons you should never think weakness, failure, defeat, poverty or sickness. Your life was preordained and carefully planned by God for the praise of His grace. He planned ahead of time to bring us up in Christ for the praise of the glory of His grace so that when people see us, they say, “Wow, God is great!”</p>
<p>It parallels something similar that the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:10 AMPC</a>: <em>“For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].”</em> He preordained you for an excellent life. Glory to God. </p>
<p>That means there’s no room for frustration, sadness and gloom in your life. There&#x27;s no need to be jealous or envious of anyone. You were fashioned for an excellent life. He had everything about your life well thought out; none of us is a mistake. </p>
<p>There&#x27;s nothing about your life that God didn&#x27;t know was coming; no surprises. And all these are based on His excellent wisdom. Read our theme scripture further to the 8th verse; it says, <em>“Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, there&#x27;s nothing about your life that&#x27;s outside the framework of God&#x27;s conception. He’s already done everything He needed to do for your life to be a continual stream of testimonies. Therefore, live joyfully every day, praising Him. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For sin shall not have dominion over you... (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 6:14</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our opening verse says sin shall not have dominion over you; this is because the man or woman who’s born again is born sin-free. In a previous verse, the Apostle Paul, talking about our righteousness, salvation and the grace that we’ve received from God and how they came about, asked a thought-provoking question, <em>“...How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:2</a>).</p>
<p>Paul wasn’t referring to himself and the other apostles alone but to all of us; we’re dead to sin. That means sin has no power over you because the nature of sin was supplanted with the nature of righteousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:56&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 15:56</a> lets us know that the strength of sin is the Law, but the very thing that gave life to sin, which is the Law, has been abolished by Jesus. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:14-15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:14-15</a> says, <em>“For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us; Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances….”</em></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus has given us victory over sin, death and the grave! We’ve been made, not just righteous, but the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. See yourself in this light. The unregenerate man, the person who isn’t born again, on the other hand, is a sinner by nature and enslaved to sin. He can’t but sin, even when he doesn’t want to, because he has the nature of sin. </p>
<p>But this isn’t the case with you; you’re righteous by nature. God made it so. Your righteousness is a gift from God (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:17</a>), and that righteousness gives you the ability to do right and live right.</p>
<p>There’s nothing you could have done on your own, through your own human perfection to become righteous. Likewise, there’s also nothing you can do or not do that’ll make you less righteous before God. You’re as righteous as Jesus is righteous because He substituted His righteousness for your sin-nature.</p>
