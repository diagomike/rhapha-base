<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And God is able to make all grace  abound toward you; that ye, always  having all sufficiency in all things, may  abound to every good work  (2 Corinthians 9:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 9:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening verse says God is able to direct all the grace you require for an excellent life towards you. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 4:6</a> says, <em>“...he giveth more grace...”</em>; He endows you with the competencies, special skills and abilities required for excellence in all things. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>It brings to mind the words of the Apostle Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:5&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 3:5 AMPC</a>: <em>“Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us, but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God.”</em> Blessed be God! This is the life God has given you. He’s made you so efficient, effective and capable of any good work.</p>
<p>This should give you the mindset of endless possibilities. You have grace to excel in your job, academics and daily pursuits. You’re up to any task. So, like Paul, you can boldly affirm <em>“I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 4:13</a>).</p>
<p>Once you’re chosen for something, there’s an assurance that it would turn out excellently. You make great things happen, because you’re specially graced to produce excellence. Read the words of the psalmist in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 1:3</a> (NKJV). It says, <em>“He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper.”</em> That’s you; glory to God! Then <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:10</a> says, <em>“That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>That ye may be blameless and harmless,  the sons of God, without rebuke, in the  midst of a crooked and perverse nation,  among whom ye shine as lights in the  world (Philippians 2:15).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Philippians 2:15)</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 5:14 NKJV</a>, the Lord Jesus said, <em>“You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.”</em> It bears comparison to what we read in our opening scripture. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2060:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 60:2</a>, the prophet prophesied, <em>“For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.”</em></p>
<p>In Christ Jesus, the glory of the Lord is resident in us, so much so that the Word declares that we are His glory! We’re the light of His righteousness in a dark and cynical world. Hallelujah! It makes no difference what the darkness and problems in the world are; you’re the hope and the solution that the world needs.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%209:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 9:5</a>, <em>“As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</em> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:17</a> says, <em>“…as he is, so are we in this world.”</em> The problems and hardships in the world today are your opportunities to shine and manifest the glory and light of His righteousness.</p>
<p>As long as you’re in the world, you’re the light of the world. Light gives direction. You’re the one to show the world how to live, what to do, and how to be successful in the midst of the darkness. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:12</a>, Jesus said, <em>&quot;...I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&quot;</em> </p>
<p>Again, it brings to mind the words of the Prophet Isaiah, <em>“The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%209:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 9:2</a>). Yes, through you, they’re seeing this great light. That’s your ministry—to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 26:18</a>). </p>
<p>There’s no greater light than the light of His righteousness and we’re the bearers of His righteousness—taking the light of the Gospel to the ends of the earth. Praise God! </p>

<p><em><strong>But God commendeth his love toward  us, in that, while we were yet sinners,  Christ died for us (Romans 5:8).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 5:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>How God loves man; think about what we just read! It brings to mind a related message in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; it says, <em>“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them….”</em> Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Certain folks don’t like it when we preach and teach about the love of Christ and how God isn’t holding anyone’s sins against them. They say we’re giving people a license to do wrong; but how could that be? The love of Christ never gives anyone liberty to sin.</p>
<p>The truth is that the more you learn about the Lord, the more you love Him; to know Him is to love Him. And the more you love Him, the less you want to do anything that’s offensive to Him. That’s the fact! The Bible says, <em>“Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 2:4</a>).</p>
<p>Notice that it doesn’t say, “The judgments of God make men repent and love Him.” All He ever does is love, help and bless us. It’s that love that we reciprocate. The Bible says, <em>“We love him, because he first loved us”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:19</a>). So, it’s not true that the love of Christ makes people want to do wrong and think they can get away with it. No! He enjoins us to take advantage of His grace and love, but not against Him; not to do wrong. His Word demands that you abstain from sin. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:1-2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:1-2</a> says, <em>“…Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?”</em></p>
<p>No one deliberately hurts or offends the one who loves them genuinely. God said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2031:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 31:3</a>, <em>“…Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.”</em> Think about that! The result of His love for us is that we love Him in return. And because we love Him, we keep His Word; we do what He wants. That’s what Jesus said: <em>“If you love Me, keep My commandments”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:15&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:15 NKJV</a>). No one gets to truly know Jesus, how loving He is, without loving Him. </p>
<p>The Bible says we know He loves us from the message He sent to us, and we received that message and came into fellowship with Him. Now that you’re in fellowship with Him, all you want to do is to walk worthy of Him, pleasing Him in all things.</p>

<p><em><strong>For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 2:10 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>You can live in God&#x27;s perfect will for your life as you follow Him in and through the Word. You can know and walk in His preordained paths for you. Some people are in the wrong job, business, relationships, etc. and as a result, they’re frustrated. But <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12:2</a> tells us to renew our minds with the Word of God so we can discern the good, the acceptable, and perfect will of God.</p>
<p>Nothing about your life should be outside the will and purpose of God for you, including those you meet, where you go, the things you do, and so much more. It’s the reason you must walk in sync with the Holy Spirit. The Bible says, <em>“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:14</a>). When you yield yourself to the Spirit to lead and guide you, you’d meet only those He planned to be in your path, and are integral to fulfilling your destiny in Him. </p>
<p>Nothing compares to walking in God’s exact plan and purpose for you at any given time. Before you take major steps or decisions, be sure they’re in sync with God&#x27;s perfect will. Spend time to meditate on the Word and fellowship with the Holy Spirit, and there’ll be a light in your spirit; you’d have the consciousness of what you’re supposed to do. </p>
<p>Knowing and walking in the will of God shouldn’t be a mystery to you. Once you recognise and yield yourself to the leading of the Spirit, He illumines your heart and your path to comprehend and apprehend His purpose for your life.</p>

<p><em><strong>…that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 26:18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Every child of God is born into an incorruptible inheritance in Christ. There’s an inheritance for you. The Apostle Paul refers to it in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:8&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 3:8</a> as unsearchable riches: <em>“…the unending (boundless, fathomless, incalculable, and exhaustless) riches of Christ [wealth which no human being could have searched out]”</em> (AMPC).</p>
<p>If this is true, and thank God it is, why then are there many people who are struggling in life when they ought to be living in God’s abundant blessings? It’s because of their ignorance of God’s truths. God said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%204:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hosea 4:6</a>, <em>“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge….”</em></p>
<p>No wonder Paul said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:32&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 20:32</a>, <em>“And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.”</em> The inheritance is already yours; but through study and meditation on the Word, you enjoy that which is already yours in Christ. </p>
<p>Everything that God has placed in this world is not for the angels or Himself but for us! If it is true, why should a Christian labour endlessly just to get something which belongs to him in Christ? Something is wrong.</p>
<p>The Bible says He’s already blessed us with ALL spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:3</a>). God already did everything He needed to do about the salvation, health and prosperity of every man, woman, boy and girl on the face of earth. Now, He wants everyone to live in blessings and enjoy their inheritance. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3</a> says, <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness….”</em> Can you now see that there’s no need for you to struggle in life? You’ve been brought into a life of manifold blessings. </p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2068:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 68:19</a>). <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2018:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 18:19</a> says, <em>“He brought me forth also into a large place….”</em> That’s the place of honour, wealth and great glory; your place of inheritance in Christ where you prosper and all your needs are met. The inheritance is already yours; so wake up and enjoy that which belongs to you in Christ. </p>

<p><em><strong>And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022:29&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 22:29 NIV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A short while before the Lord’s crucifixion, He said something remarkable to His disciples. He acknowledged and commended them for their steadfastness, noting their faithful support during His trials. For that reason, He said, <em>“…I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022:29&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 22:29 NIV</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 12:28</a> further helps us understand the depth of this proclamation. It says, <em>“Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.”</em> At first glance, if not studied with caution, and in context, one might perceive this as a future promise. But that&#x27;s not the case. It’s in the affirmative. </p>
<p>If you read it from the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB), it conveys the sense of it being in the affirmative. It says, <em>&quot;Therefore, since we have received an unshakeable kingdom....&quot;</em> We have received an unshakeable kingdom; in this day and in this hour of our lives, we’re operating a kingdom. We live in a kingdom right now, and we exercise the authority, power, dominion and influence of that kingdom.</p>
<p>It’s a kingdom with an extraordinary heritage, but so many aren’t aware of this. While you&#x27;re in this world, you actually belong in another operational world; so, you&#x27;re living in two worlds at the same time, but you belong only to one of them, which is the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>It’s the reason you must know the life and modus operandi of the Kingdom of God to which you belong and superimpose it on this natural world, which is the lesser world. You were sent to be a witness of the Kingdom to this natural world.</p>
<p>You’re the voice, the expression and the messenger of God’s Kingdom to the world. You’re to let the world know of the reality of the Kingdom and get them to become a part of God’s Kingdom; you’re the one with the keys to bring them in. What an honour that we were raised, authorised and commissioned to make this happen. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Observe what Paul elucidates in the opening verse; we’re to reign in life through Jesus Christ. There’re those who say, “We’ll reign through Him in the future,” but that’s incorrect. It says “in life”; that’s in the earth, right now. So it isn&#x27;t relegated to some distant future.</p>
<p>From the resurrection of Jesus Christ until the rapture of the Church is the exclusive time when we reign through Him. That’s the Church Age and the sole period during which we exercise authority through Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>After the Church Age, we will reign with Him, not through Him anymore. These two phases are distinct, and it’s worth re-emphasising. During the Millennium, that is, the one thousand years of peace when Jesus reigns on earth, we will reign with Him. Following this, we&#x27;d continue to reign with Him forever. But in this present age, we reign through Him, exercising authority and dominion through His Name.</p>
<p>Understanding this truth empowers you to live victoriously, knowing that you’ve been appointed a ruler and an heir with Christ. It&#x27;s not a time for complacency, no! Assert your authority in Christ and manifest His Kingdom on earth. Seize the opportunity accorded to us in the Church Age to rule over Satan, the forces and adversities of life. Demonstrate the power, love and righteousness of Christ in your world and spheres of influence.</p>
<p>Remember, each of us has our own world, and we’ll be held accountable for what we did with His Kingdom that He conferred on us. So be sure to effectively utilise His Name in this world. Let Christ reign through you in your sphere of influence.</p>

<p>*** I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me:  and the life which I now live in the flesh  I live by the faith of the Son of God, who  loved me, and gave himself for me (Galatians 2:20).***</p>

<p><em><strong>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Galatians 2:20</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, the Apostle Paul articulates a profound truth about the new creation and salvation. It says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</em> Observe he says, <em>“...if any man be in Christ...”</em>; salvation is you in Christ!</p>
<p>We see another truth in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:26-27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:26-27</a>. There, he beautifully encapsulates the very essence of Christianity: <em>“Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</em></p>
<p>Now, while salvation is you in Christ, Christianity is Christ in you. Christianity is Christ alive and manifested in you every day. No wonder in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:30</a>, Paul tells us something so profound: <em>“For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.”</em> This powerful imagery reinforces the inextricable union we have with Christ.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:15&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 6:15 NKJV</a> says, <em>&quot;Do you not know that your bodies are the members of Christ...?&quot;</em> In other words, your limbs are the limbs of Christ. Your hands, feet and voice are all imbued with His presence and power. When you speak, it&#x27;s Christ speaking through you. When you minister to others, it&#x27;s Christ ministering to them through you.</p>
<p>The Master Himself declared, <em>&quot;He that heareth you heareth me...&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 10:16</a>). This is the profound reality of Christ in us. Therefore, knowing this truth, you can boldly proclaim, &quot;Every fibre of my being, every bone of my body, every cell of my blood, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, is all fully inundated with the life of God.&quot;</p>
<p>You’re the embodiment of God&#x27;s glory; everywhere you go, you carry His presence and manifest His glory. You have the privilege of being the conduit of divine verities. </p>

<p><em><strong>I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2032:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 32:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>If Moses, David, Isaiah, Job, King Solomon, Micah, or any of the prophets of old were to show up on the scene today, what will they say to us? If the apostles Peter, Paul, James or John were to appear to you today to minister to you, what would they say?</p>
<p>I can tell you what they would say to you. They would say to you exactly what&#x27;s in their writings. They wouldn&#x27;t say anything more because their ministries were sealed with those writings. They can&#x27;t add to it. But with the Lord Jesus, it’s different.</p>
<p>The difference with Jesus is that His death didn&#x27;t end or seal His ministry. He arose and continued His ministry till this day. So, if the Lord Jesus were to appear to you today, He could say new things, but they&#x27;ll be consistent with what He already said. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:12-15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 16:12-15</a>, He said, <em>“I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.”</em></p>
<p>The difference between the Lord Jesus and the prophets and apostles of old is the eternal nature of His ministry. He sent the Holy Spirit to continue His ministry among us. His words possess an eternal relevance that transcends time and circumstances. He said of the Holy Spirit, “He shall take of mine and show it to you.”</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit imparts the essence of Jesus&#x27; ministry to us, teaching us, speaking to us, and guiding us into all truth. This divine partnership ensures that the extraordinary ministry of the Lord Jesus endures in us, through us and among us, even in this present age. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 1:30</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Oftentimes, many Christians acknowledge Christ as their righteousness, sanctification, and justification, yet they overlook the profound reality that Christ is their wisdom. Read the first few words of our opening scripture again; it says, <em>“…Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom….”</em> </p>
<p>It brings to mind what Paul said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:27</a>; <em>“…Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</em> When man sinned, he fell short of the glory of God, but Christ in you, glory restored. In the same way, Christ in you, wisdom has come. Christ is your wisdom, so don’t ask Him for wisdom anymore. </p>
<p>Have you ever encountered individuals who don&#x27;t reason soundly or correctly? During a discussion, their responses leave you bewildered, their thought pattern reeks of thoughtlessness; it’s like foolishness on rampage. Sadly, they’re oblivious to their own lack of insight. When prompted to express themselves publicly, for example, their utterances become disconcerting. This is because wisdom eludes them.</p>
<p>Wisdom is not something acquired in the classroom, and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily come with age; it’s from God. As a Christian, you have access to divine wisdom because Jesus Christ is the embodiment of all wisdom. But you see, you must boldly affirm that He’s your wisdom to walk in the reality of it.</p>
<p>Even now, declare, “Christ is my wisdom; therefore, I have wisdom over all crises of life and for every situation.” Hallelujah! When you walk in divine wisdom you don’t give vent to foolish reasonings or communications; your ideas, thoughts and words are sound and excellent. You’re sagacious, discerning, perceptive and prudent. You’ll always, and at all times, make accurate judgments and decisions. </p>

<p><em><strong>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Peter 2:2</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Christianity, there’s a Christian way of life. But Christianity itself is not a way of life. Therefore, when we lead souls to Christ, it&#x27;s important to guide them to be actively involved in a local church. We must ensure they become integral members of a church, not leaving them to navigate their newfound faith alone. They must be nurtured in the Christian way of life.</p>
<p>Once they receive salvation, show them that receiving salvation is only the beginning; they have to live the Christian life. And the only way they’re going to learn it and grow as they should is by learning God’s Word. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%203:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 3:15</a> says, <em>“…the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.”</em> So, the Church is the place to learn the Word of God.</p>
<p>It brings to mind what the Apostle Peter said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:2</a>: <em>“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.”</em> How do children learn? Children learn not just by instruction but also by observation. By actively participating in the church, spiritual children or “babes” can observe and emulate the attitudes and practices of mature Christians.</p>
<p>It’s one of the ways they know how to pray and cultivate the right attitudes and spirit of prayer. Also, in church, they learn how to worship God and sing the right songs; they learn how to conduct themselves with decency; they learn how to apply their faith in the face of belligerent challenges.</p>
<p>Learning how to do these things isn’t just by instruction alone, it also comes through observing the behaviour, communication, and actions of other Christians in the Faith. The same Spirit lives in them and causes them to do the things that we do. So, when you win souls, ensure that they’re fully engrafted into the local church. Pray for them; follow them up until they become rooted and grounded in the faith and established in the Word. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Hebrews 10:25</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s a subtle but dangerous movement orchestrated by Satan to diminish the importance of church membership. The notion that one can serve God without being a part of a church community is a deceptive ploy aimed at pulling Christians away from the security and support systems established by God for families.</p>
<p>In God&#x27;s design, children are placed under the care of tutors and governors until they mature to a certain level. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%204:1-2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 4:1-2</a>, for example, Paul explains, <em>&quot;Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child…is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Likewise, churches serve as spiritual families where you’re nurtured and guided in your Christian walk. Rejecting the importance of church membership exposes individuals to satanic attacks, as they lack the protective covering provided within the church community. </p>
<p>It is crucial not to heed the voices of ignorance or those influenced by Satan, seeking to undermine the work of God through His established structures. These structures are ordained for the edification and training of God&#x27;s people in their Christian walk.</p>
<p>God’s design isn’t for you to merely participate in multiple churches online or via television. He doesn’t want you hopping from one congregation to another without commitment either. Such practice leads to spiritual instability and undermines the unity and accountability found in local church fellowship.</p>
<p>Never be conditioned to forsake church attendance. Remain vigilant and educate others about the importance of active participation in a local church for spiritual growth and protection. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 10:25</a> the Spirit warns us not to abandon or relegate church attendance as some are in the habit of doing. </p>
<p>Being an integral, committed member of a local church is sacrosanct. David understood this and sang of its amazing blessings in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20122:1-4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 122:1-4</a>, saying, <em>“I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together: Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>*** For if, when we were enemies, we were  reconciled to God by the death of his  Son, much more, being reconciled, we  shall be saved by his life  (Romans 5:10).***</p>

<p><em><strong>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 5:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:11-12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:11-12</a> that God <em>“… gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.”</em> Here, the Apostle Paul refers to the five-fold ministry gifts which are for the edification and perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry.</p>
<p>Since these five ministry gifts are for the building of the body of Christ and perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry, then what exactly is this “work of the ministry”? First, it&#x27;s important to understand that there’re two kinds of ministries for the saints: primary and secondary.</p>
<p>The secondary ministry involves edifying one another within the Church, that is, within the Body of Christ. This is often referred to as the “body ministry” or ministry within the body. But I want to draw your attention to the first kind of ministry of the saints, which Paul referenced in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>—the ministry of reconciliation.</p>
<p>There, it says, &quot;<em>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The same God who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ has given us (the reconciled ones) the ministry of reconciliation: <em>“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>).</p>
<p>It reminds us of what the Lord Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 1:8</a>, <em>&quot;But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me....&quot;</em> In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:15</a> He said, “…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” This is a charge to every Christian. </p>
<p>We’re His ministers of reconciliation. We bear witness to the truth that God was in Christ, actively reconciling the world to Himself through Christ&#x27;s redemptive work, not counting men’s sins against them. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 5:19</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>This is one of the most profound verses in the Pauline epistles. It unveils the magnitude of the Father’s love for all men, His overwhelming and everlasting love! Think about it: God was in Christ, reconciling the world of sinners (not Christians) to Himself, not counting their sins against them. Amazing!</p>
<p>Most don’t realize the truth that Jesus was God, taking the place of sin and sinful man on the Cross. He accepted the most gruesome pain and punishment for the love of man.</p>
<p>It brings to mind how the prophet Isaiah described Him in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:2-3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 53:2-3</a>. He explained that He had no form or comeliness, no royal or kingly pomp that they should look at Him. There was no beauty that they should desire Him. He was described as one from whom men hid their faces; despised and unesteemed.</p>
<p>Yet, the world didn’t know that the Creator of the universe, the One who had made each and every one of us, was the one who hung on that Cross in their behalf. They failed to recognize Him; they were oblivious to His presence. But that’s why He sent us to proclaim His love.</p>
<p>The whole world needs to know that Jesus is the embodiment of God&#x27;s love, sent to reconcile humanity to Himself, not holding their sins against them. Even the vilest offender is loved by God. He harbours no anger or resentment for anyone.</p>
<p>The Bible says He’s not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 3:9</a>). It’s our duty to proclaim this message: to reveal who Jesus is, to declare His love and the worth of His sacrifice. It’s our responsibility to proclaim this Gospel of His love and grace.</p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Mark 16:15</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>God raised us for a purpose; He didn&#x27;t leave us here on earth to simply wait until His return, doing nothing. Our primary purpose is to share His message with others while we grow in grace, knowledge and character. We’re here to carry out His mandate; to ensure the Gospel is preached in all the earth and that it impacts every man, woman, boy and girl.</p>
<p>He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 24:14</a>, <em>“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”</em> The Gospel has been committed to your trust. You have a personal responsibility for the Gospel.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus gave the great commission in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:15</a> as we read in our opening scripture. He said, <em>“… Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”</em> The question is, can He rely on you to accomplish it? Your driving force and purpose should revolve around promoting the Gospel and spreading the knowledge of salvation throughout the earth.</p>
<p>Consider your role in your office, place of work or business as that of an ambassador of Christ; a custodian of the Gospel. I love the way the Apostle Paul personalized it in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%201:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 1:11</a>; he said, <em>“According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.”</em></p>
<p>Notice that he didn’t say, “…which was committed to our trust.” He understood the preaching of the Gospel as his primary purpose. That’s how it ought to be. God intends to use you as a vessel to impact the lives of all those around you and beyond. You’re His partner in spreading the good news of His saving power to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>Like the Apostle Paul, let’s all feel the weight of this responsibility, understanding that preaching the Gospel is not merely an option but a necessity: <em>“…necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>And the disciples came, and said unto  him, Why speakest thou unto them in  parables? He answered and said unto  them, Because it is given unto you to  know the mysteries of the kingdom  of heaven, but to them it is not given  (Matthew 13:10-11).</strong></em></p>

He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:10-11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 13:10-11</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’re those who grumble about their inability to understand the Scriptures. Often, they’d complain, “These words are too difficult to understand; no matter how I study the Bible, I just don’t seem to have a grasp of it.” No; never talk that way. It’s your divinely given right and ability to understand the Scriptures. Read the words of the Lord Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 13:11</a>; He said, <em>“...it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.&quot;</em></p>
<p>One of Satan&#x27;s tactics is to deceive God&#x27;s children just as he attempted with Jesus, questioning His identity. The Bible tells us, <em>&quot;And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 4:3</a>). Same way, he’ll attempt to put doubts in your heart. Don&#x27;t yield to the Devil&#x27;s deception that you lack understanding. The power lies in accepting and declaring God&#x27;s truth.</p>
<p>Accept, endorse and confess it. Align your words with God&#x27;s Word. Declare, &quot;I understand,&quot; and your understanding will be illuminated. The Bible recounts in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 20:22</a> how Jesus breathed on His disciples and said, <em>“...Receive ye the Holy Ghost.”</em> When He did, their minds were opened to understand the Scriptures.</p>
<p>It’s a similar miracle that occurred when you received the Holy Spirit. It&#x27;s the Spirit who enlightens your heart and enables you to receive and understand His truths. Always boldly affirm that you have the understanding of the righteous; you possess soundness of mind; you’re alert and imbued with keen insight. </p>
<p>You have the mind of Christ, which is an excellent mind (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>). You’re super-intelligent and your mind is anointed to understand the Scriptures; you have quickness of understanding. Have this mindset as you diligently study and meditate on the Word.</p>

<p><em><strong>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 10:19</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In his letter to the Ephesians, the Apostle Paul unveils the reality of the spiritual warfare we are engaged in and describes the hierarchy of demoniacal forces. We’re up against principalities, powers, the rulers of the darkness of this world, and spiritual wickedness in high places (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:12</a>). </p>
<p>Observe it says spiritual wickedness in high places, not “wicked spirits in high places.” All of those listed are also wicked spirits, but some demons are more wicked than others. However, it makes no difference the hierarchy of demons and how wicked they’re described; they’re all under your feet, including their boss—Satan, himself!</p>
<p>You have superior authority in the spiritual because you function in and by the Name of Jesus Christ. You live and function in the Kingdom of light where Satan has no rights. You live in the victory and authority of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>You have something that the devils can’t withstand— the Name of Jesus. Use it, and triumph gloriously, always! Exercise your dominion in Christ and cast out devils everywhere. Take charge of your nation, city, town and environment. Take charge of your life. Refuse to allow Satan run rampage in your home. You’re superior to him and his cohorts of hell; Jesus gave you absolute dominion over them. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:7-8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:7-8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:7-8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:7-8</a>, the Apostle Paul unveils a profound truth: every kind of wisdom has been lavished upon us in Christ.</p>
<p>Read the 8th verse in the Amplified Classic; it says, <em>“Which He lavished upon us in every kind of wisdom and understanding (practical insight and prudence).”</em> Pause and let the weight of this revelation sink in.</p>
<p>Recall the words of Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2012:42&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 12:42</a>; He said, <em>&quot;The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.&quot;</em> Solomon was given practical wisdom; it’s the same word that’s translated in our theme verse as “Prudence.”</p>
<p>The Greek Septuagint tells us that the wisdom that God gave to Solomon was “Phronesis.” In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 1:17</a>, it’s described as “the wisdom of the just”: <em>“And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”</em></p>
<p>“Phronesis” is practical wisdom, and it’s available to us in Christ. Christ has been made unto you wisdom from God. That practical wisdom empowers you to apply, utilize and immerse yourself in various fields with divine insight. Whether in politics, law, business, medicine, or any profession, you become exceptional.</p>
<p>This wisdom is a spiritual elixir that locates you within the framework of God&#x27;s will, beyond your natural understanding, causing you to do God&#x27;s things God&#x27;s way, in God&#x27;s time for God&#x27;s purpose. It&#x27;s also a mind-set; an excellent mind-set that causes you to think in a certain way and to say the right things in the right way at the right time for the right purpose in the right place. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Jesus answered and said unto him,  Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a  man be born again, he cannot see the  kingdom of God (John 3:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 3:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When you tell the natural man or those who are unlearned in the things of God, “I&#x27;m born again,” they think it’s just another religious cliche that suggests you just had a new experience. Some even think being born again means to turn over a new leaf or make new resolutions to be a better person. No!</p>
<p>Being born again is not an experience, and it’s beyond these outward expressions. When you&#x27;re born again, you don&#x27;t essentially “experience” a thing; rather, “you” are the experience; you happened. You came to be, as it were.</p>
<p>It’s like when a baby is born; you don&#x27;t say, “Oh, this baby has had an experience”; no! It&#x27;s the baby that happened, and everyone rejoices because the baby has come on the scene. Therefore, being born again is that you were dead but have come alive; you&#x27;re alive now. </p>
<p>Paul tells us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:1</a>, <em>&quot;And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins.&quot;</em> Also, he said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2:13</a>, <em>&quot;And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses.&quot;</em> The word “quicken” means “to come alive.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, being born again means you don&#x27;t have a past, so you can’t say, “something happened to me.” The old “you” died in Christ, and the new “you” has the resurrection life. It’s not the same person that died in Christ that’s alive now. That’s why the Bible says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). Your “past” has ceased to exist; buried with Jesus, and backdated to Calvary.</p>
<p>So from the moment you’re born again, you’re like a new born baby before God. That’s why the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:2</a>, <em>“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.”</em> The one who’s born again is enjoined to learn and keep growing in the knowledge of the Word. God’s Word builds you and transforms your life from glory to glory.</p>

<p><em><strong>…We continually ask God…that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:9-10&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 1:9-10 NIV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>If you ever find that you’re not enthusiastic about pleasing God, then your love for the Lord Jesus is questionable. If you genuinely love the Lord, then your heart’s desire, always, would be to please Him; you want Him as the first place in your life. </p>
<p>Why is it important that we please Him? It’s because we belong to Him and we live for Him. It’s about our identity as His children. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:15</a> says, <em>“…he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.”</em></p>
<p>He isn’t just your heavenly Father but also the Lord; and this is what led to your salvation—the acknowledgement or confession of His lordship over your life. Therefore, living to please Him becomes a natural expression of your devotion because now He’s Lord of your life and everything about you.</p>
<p>While the Lord Jesus walked this earth, He rehearsed to us how to please the Father in all things. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:29</a>, He said, <em>&quot;…for I do always those things that please him.&quot;</em> In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 5:30</a>, He said, <em>&quot;… I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Jesus lived with the constant desire to please the Father and encouraged us to adopt or cultivate the same mindset. Again, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 6:38</a>, He said, <em>&quot;For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.&quot;</em> Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%204:34&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 4:34</a>, He uttered some of the most inspiring words, <em>&quot;…My meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Master revealed to us how to live in total submission to the Father’s will, pleasing Him in all things. We’re to emulate Him. There’s no greater joy or fulfilment than living to please God. Nothing pleases Him more than one genuinely loving Jesus Christ and living as He lived. </p>

<p><em><strong>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 3:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14-16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 5:14-16</a>, &quot;<em>Ye are the light of the world…Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.&quot;</em> So, you can let your light shine as brightly as you want; it’s up to you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2060:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 60:1</a> says, <em>“Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.”</em> The Lord Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:22</a>, <em>“And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them....”</em> God made you the expression of His glory. But what is glory?</p>
<p>Glory is great honour, praise or distinction. It’s majestic beauty and splendour, resplendence, excellence. So, when God made man, He made him for glory, and everything about man was praiseworthy. But did you know that you have a mission, a divine assignment, to increase and manifest the glory of God in your life? Each one of us carries the glory of God to a certain measure, and how brightly we manifest that glory is within our control.</p>
<p>Our opening verse gives us an idea of how this happens. Let’s read it again, this time, from the Amplified Classic version. It says, <em>“And have clothed yourselves with the new [spiritual self], which is [ever in the process of being] renewed and remolded into [fuller and more perfect knowledge upon] knowledge after the image (the likeness) of Him Who created it.”</em></p>
<p>The word &quot;knowledge&quot; in the verse above is the Greek &quot;epignosis,&quot; and it means exact or precise knowledge of God. It means full comprehension, recognition or perception; to become fully acquainted with God. This is the knowledge He seeks for us to have of Him. </p>
<p>With this knowledge, the glory in your life increases, and your efficiency, effectiveness and results multiply; your spirit is continually renewed, refreshed and polished. Your spirit glows more and more as you deepen your relationship with Him. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:16</a> says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly....”</em> Have the Word of God in you in abundance through diligent study and meditation, and your life will become more glorious. Praise God!</p>

<p>I love the Holy Spirit! I’ve often wondered how folks who don’t have the Holy Spirit live on a day-to-day basis. Consider what we just read in our theme verse: it’s part of the glorious ministry of the Holy Spirit in our lives. He makes us willing and able to do the will of the Father.</p>
<p>This doesn&#x27;t imply that you sit idly by and say, “I’m not going to do or say anything if the Holy Spirit doesn’t make me say or do something.” That’s not how it works. There’s a cooperation; it’s a fellowship.</p>
<p>The scripture isn&#x27;t conveying the idea of you “waiting” for Him to compel you to do; rather, it emphasises a partnership that enables the Holy Spirit to fulfil His ministry in your life. Both He and you have distinct roles to play.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is called to work with and through you, but you need to allow Him to do His job through fellowship with Him. Through that fellowship, He instils in you a willingness to do God&#x27;s will effortlessly, where you’re always ready and willing to do what God has called you to do. Like Ezekiel, He’ll “set you upon your feet” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%202:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ezekiel 2:2</a>). </p>
<p>The Holy Spirit can prompt you to take certain actions and you’d be conscious that those actions are orchestrated by Him. He doesn&#x27;t just move you capriciously as though you’re a robot; no! There’s a oneness, a unity of purpose, an agreement with Him that’s required. As the Bible says, &quot;two can only walk together, when they agree&quot; (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos%203:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amos 3:3</a>).</p>
<p>Encourage the work of the Holy Spirit in your life. Cooperate with Him. Celebrate and appreciate Him for His guidance, and for causing your heart to be mantled with the wisdom to know and walk in the perfect will of God today. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%202:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Proverbs 2:6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 4:7</a>, the Bible says, <em>“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.”</em> It points attention to wisdom as the most important thing that you should go for, not money, not friends, but wisdom. Then it says in the concluding part, <em>“…with all thy getting get understanding.”</em> And that’s what I want to emphasize: understanding!</p>
<p>Understanding is important. In verse 8, referring to understanding, it says, <em>“Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.”</em> So, do you want promotion? Then you need to exalt understanding, and she shall promote you and bring you to honour. The 9th verse is also beautiful and further refers to what understanding will do for you: <em>“She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.”</em> Understanding will crown you with glory. Hallelujah! </p>
<p>Even the Lord Jesus taught on how important understanding is when He told and explained the parable of the sower in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:5-15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 8:5-15</a> (study the entire reference). In verse 12, He explained that as the sower sowed his seed (the seed is the Word of God), those that fell on the wayside <em>“…are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts  ….”</em></p>
<p>But Matthew gave us a better insight into what really happened to such individuals; the reason the devil was able to steal the Word from their hearts is because they lacked understanding: <em>“Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower. When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:18-19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 13:18-19</a>).</p>
<p>See how terrible it is not to understand the Word of God? Even Wisdom extolled understanding; read what Wisdom says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 8:14</a>, <em>“Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.&quot;</em> Here, Wisdom is talking and says, “I am understanding.” Amazing!</p>
<p>Anchor your life on the Word of God—the wisdom of God—and give attention to understanding. Christ is in you; He’s your wisdom. Therefore, you have an understanding heart and mind. The Bible says it is given unto you to understand the Word of God, the mysteries of the Kingdom. Therefore, every so often, declare, “I’m filled with the knowledge of God’s will in all wisdom, and spiritual understanding.” Hallelujah! </p>

<p><em><strong>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 6:33</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The way to give value and direction to your resources is to invest them in the Kingdom of God. Outside of the Kingdom of God, money holds little significance. There isn&#x27;t anyone who doesn&#x27;t have money. Do you know why? Because everything holds value—everything has worth.</p>
<p>That means currency isn’t the real money; it’s just what is used in measuring the real money. Therefore, in a sense, everything is money. Once you comprehend this, you&#x27;ll realise that God has bestowed upon you the wisdom to manage finances. </p>
<p>The reason those who are labelled wealthy seem to have the advantage over those termed as poor is due to their understanding of this mystery. Once you gain the same understanding, suddenly you’ll start seeing value in everything that God gives you. Everything that God gives you suddenly has power, and then you discover you can do anything and have anything. </p>
<p>With this understanding, the words of the Lord Jesus will mean more to you. He said, <em>“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:15</a>). Commit your resources to this. Make it possible for more and more people to receive God’s Word by sponsoring the distribution of Bibles and Rhapsody of Realities around the world.</p>
<p>Make it your mission to take the Gospel to every man’s world. This is the way to expand your reach for the Kingdom and make a quick and lasting impact.</p>

<p><em><strong>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 5:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s important that from time to time, you appraise yourself to be sure you’re focused on that which the Lord has called you to do. Each one of us has a unique purpose and destiny to fulfil in Christ and one day, we’ll give account to the Lord for all that we did while on earth.</p>
<p>According to the Scriptures, those who have done well will receive praise of Him; they’ll be rewarded. That’s why the Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, encourages us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>, saying, <em>“Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Life is a race, and in this race of life, you’re to run in such a way as to win the prize. Run with purpose. Don’t live like it doesn’t matter. The Amplified Classic version of the scripture above says, <em>“Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but [only] one receives the prize? So run [your race] that you may lay hold [of the prize] and make it yours.”</em></p>
<p>Run with the resolve to triumph gloriously and finish your course with joy. Remember part of Paul’s valedictory admonition in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 4:5</a>; he said, <em>“...Watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.”</em> He could confidently give such inspiring counsel because that was his testimony. He ran with purpose and made full proof of his ministry.</p>
<p>Paul finished his race gloriously and testified, <em>“For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:6-8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 4:6-8</a>). </p>
<p>We’re on this journey for a more profound purpose. Keep this truth constantly before you and it’ll serve as a guiding light in the way you live your life. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Every opportunity of service that you have in the house of God is profoundly significant and holds great meaning to God. He’s going to hold you accountable for the work and tasks He assigned to you. So serve the Lord dutifully, and do all that you do for Him with diligence, excellence and integrity of heart. The Bible says, <em>&quot;For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). </p>
<p>Oftentimes, when we are involved in something, whether an activity or project, we may not be conscious of the actual impact or effects of our actions. Not many realize that their actions are a message every day for which they must give an account to God.</p>
<p>When you’re conscious that your life is a message, and that every word spoken and every deed performed is recorded, you’ll live more purposefully. God is the author of your life&#x27;s narrative. He has a pre-existing plan for you, yet you play an active role in crafting your own story.</p>
<p>The day will come when a comparison will be made between God&#x27;s intended plan for you and the life you actually lived, and your reward will be determined by how closely your life aligned with His divine plan. Thus, pay close attention to fulfilling God&#x27;s purpose for your life.</p>
<p>Serving the Lord, in whatever capacity he puts you, holds unparalleled honour and surpasses any earthly achievement. Always remember this: your role in the house of God, irrespective of what it is, is part of a collective effort—a teamwork inspired by the Spirit—to win souls globally.</p>
<p>Keep carrying out your responsibilities in the house of God with diligence and excellence. Be a soul winner. Be committed to interceding for others. Each one of us is a necessary part of the machinery created through the Holy Spirit to impact and transform lives around the world.</p>

<p><em><strong>Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119:105&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 119:105</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re many who are ignorant of spiritual matters, and for that reason, they’re buffeted by the crises of life and walk on in confusion. So, it’s important to build your spiritual sensitivity. For that to happen, you&#x27;ve got to study and understand the Word, to know the mind of God.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 2:15</a> says, <em>&quot;Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.&quot;</em> Also, as you study the Word, train yourself to act on it promptly. This should be natural for every Christian because we’re doers of the Word (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:22</a>).</p>
<p>By responding promptly to the Word of God, you condition your spirit to recognize the effect of the Word in your life. That way, when you face challenges, you respond with the Word; you voice your faith. This practice trains your spirit to consistently align and respond to God rather than succumbing to the dictates of the flesh. </p>
<p>Also, in training yourself to be more spiritually sensitive you must be filled with the Spirit every day. Incorporate praying in the Spirit into your spiritual routine. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 14:14</a> says, <em>“For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.”</em></p>
<p>Praying in tongues or praying in the Spirit enhances your spiritual sensitivity as it involves the Holy Spirit providing utterance to your spirit. When you speak in tongues, it’s the Holy Spirit guiding your spirit&#x27;s expressions. Your spirit, through this process, learns to function under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, contributing significantly to an increased sensitivity to God&#x27;s leading. </p>

<p><em><strong>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:11-12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 4:11-12</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Apostle Paul highlights the distinct purposes of the five-fold ministry gifts in the Body of Christ. They’re for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, and for the edifying of the body of Christ.</p>
<p>Some Bible translations wrongly assume that the passage presents a single unified purpose, extending from the first line to the last due to the lack of punctuation in the manuscripts. However, a closer examination, supported by contextual analysis and comparison with other Scriptures reveals distinct purposes outlined by Paul.</p>
<p>Some other Bible translations wrongly phrased the statement as &quot;for the perfecting of the saints, so that the saints can do the work of the ministry, which is the edifying of the Body of Christ.&quot; But that&#x27;s a misconception. Three distinct purposes for the ministry gifts are, first, to perfect or equip the saints.</p>
<p>Secondly, they’re for the work of the ministry itself. Thirdly, they are for the edification of the Body of Christ. So, it&#x27;s not stating that the saints themselves will edify the Body of Christ, but rather, the five-fold offices listed in verse 11 are responsible for building up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Of course, when every part of the Body functions as it should, the entire Body is edified. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:16&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:16</a> (NIV) tells us, <em>&quot;From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2:19</a> says, <em>&quot;And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.&quot;</em> However, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4</a>, Paul directs attention to the distinct purposes assigned to ministry gifts for equipping the saints, the work of the ministry, and building up the Church.</p>

<p><em><strong>And that from a child thou hast known  the holy scriptures, which are able to  make thee wise unto salvation through  faith which is in Christ Jesus  (2 Timothy 3:15).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Timothy 3:15</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The wisdom of God is encapsulated in His Word; it is all-encompassing and will guide you through every aspect of life. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 4:7</a> emphasizes the importance of wisdom and making it the primary pursuit in your life. It says, <em>&quot;Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Scriptures, as read in our theme verse, have the unique ability to make us wise unto salvation. It’s one reason you must meditate on the Word. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:8&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua 1:8 AMPC</a> says, <em>“This Book of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe and do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall deal wisely and have good success.”</em></p>
<p>Notice that it says meditating on the Word will make you prosperous and cause you to deal wisely; that means it’ll make you discerning and sound. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:16</a>, <em>&quot;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.&quot;</em></p>
<p>As you immerse yourself in the Word, digesting its truths and allowing it to permeate your spirit, the Word will make you several steps wiser and broaden your capacity and capability. It reminds of what the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:2</a>, <em>“Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.”</em></p>
<p>Multiplied or increased grace means God can entrust you with even greater responsibilities because you’re wiser. He knows that as a result of His wisdom at work in you, you’ll make sound judgments and choices.</p>
