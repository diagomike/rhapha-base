<p><em><strong>For the love of Christ constraineth us;  because we thus judge, that if one died  for all, then were all dead: And that he  died for all, that they which live should  not henceforth live unto themselves, but  unto him which died for them, and rose  again (2 Corinthians 5:14-15).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:14-15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 5:14-15</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Did you know that God isn’t counting the sins of men against them? He isn’t because Jesus already died for everybody. “I thought He died for Christians”; someone might ask. No; it was for the whole world! <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:19&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:19 NIV</a> says, <em>“that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.”</em></p>
<p>Observe that it says God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself. Why? It’s because Jesus paid for everybody. When Jesus died, every one of us died in Him; in the mind of justice, we were in Him in His death. When God raised Him up, the whole world was given the opportunity to receive eternal life—the life of righteousness.</p>
<p>That’s the reason our message is His Gospel to the whole world. Our mission is to tell the whole world that Jesus paid for their salvation; therefore they don’t have to die or be judged anymore. Jesus was judged for the whole world.</p>
<p>For everyone in the world today who hasn’t been born again, eternal life is available now. All they have to do is believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead in His substitutionary act of salvation, confess the Lordship of Jesus over their lives, and they’ll be brought into the vital realization, experience and union with the living Christ. Hallelujah! </p>

<p><em><strong>Give us this day our daily bread (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 6:11</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our God is so gracious and kind. Did you know that He has more than enough supply for you every day? He isn’t just into “provision”; He’s into supply— abundant supply. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 9:8 AMPC</a>: <em>“And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].”</em> He wants you to have, not only for yourself, but enough to help others.</p>
<p>Therefore, for every day in God’s calendar and plan for your life, in His structure of things, there’re supplies set aside for you. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2068:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 68:19</a> says, <em>“Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation.</em> In this Year of Redemption, make up your mind to redeem every blessing that God has ordained for you.</p>
<p>Each one of us has a heavenly account. Call forth your supply even now. Some people have never taken possession of that which belongs to them since they became Christians. They have leftover supplies that have accumulated over time. It’s time to cash out! It’s time to draw from your heavenly account. How?</p>
<p>It’s through your faith-filled affirmations—your confession of the Word! The Lord Jesus said you shall have what you say (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 11:23</a>). In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2045:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 45:1</a>, the Psalmist said, <em>“…my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.”</em></p>
<p>Your tongue is the pen; use it now to sign your “coupons and vouchers” and turn them in for actual value. Hallelujah! You say, “Today, there’s an overflow of favour and resources for me, and I take possession. The Lord has supplied all that I require for life and godliness according to the riches of His glory in Christ Jesus. Amen.”</p>

<p><em><strong>For whether we live, we live unto the  Lord; and whether we die, we die unto  the Lord: whether we live therefore, or  die, we are the Lord&#x27;s (Romans 14:8).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord&#x27;s (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 14:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In life, many grapple with discontentment, burdened by various concerns and life&#x27;s challenges. Often, their dissatisfaction stems from not having learnt the value and fulfilment of living unto Christ. Living unto Him means finding contentment and fulfilment in what pleases Him, and your displeasure is confined to that which also displeases Him.</p>
<p>In other words, your displeasure can only be a reflection of His displeasure, which means you’ll take nothing personally; you become impervious to personal offences. If you claim to be living unto the Lord, but still harbour hurt, offence, or anger, it raises the question of whether your desire to please the Lord is genuine.</p>
<p>It brings to mind the story in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%208:4-7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Samuel 8:4-7</a>; the elders of Israel approached the prophet Samuel at Ramah, expressing their desire for a king to rule over them like other nations. Samuel, displeased by their request, prayed to the Lord. God responded, instructing Samuel to heed the people&#x27;s voice, clarifying that their request was a rejection of Him as their King rather than a rejection of Samuel.</p>
<p>The prophet Samuel felt personally offended, but God corrected and taught him a great lesson about being impervious to hurts, as it was about Him, not Samuel. Living for the Lord involves transcending personal feelings and aligning yourself with His divine will.</p>

<p><em><strong>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of  me; for I am meek and lowly in heart:  and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is  light (Matthew 11:29-30).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2011:29-30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 11:29-30</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’re some Christians who like to model their lives after the Old Testament prophets. Some actually would pray, “O, Lord, I want to be a type of Elijah so that I may initiate a bolt of lightning down out of the sky and incinerate your enemies.” Some ask for the same unction Jeremiah had so they can prophesy judgment on people and nations that don’t believe in God. Something is wrong.</p>
<p>Don’t try to be another Elijah or Jeremiah. Emulate Christ. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:54-55&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 9:54-55 (NKJV)</a>, when James and John, two of the disciples, witnessed the rejection of Jesus in a Samaritan village, they asked the Master, <em>“…Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, just as Elijah did?”</em> The Lord rebuked and severely censured them. He said, “<em>… You do not know what manner of spirit you are of”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:55&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 9:55 NKJV</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“You must display a new nature because you are a new person, created in God’s likeness—righteous, holy, and true”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:24&amp;version=NLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:24 NLT</a>). You aren’t to be fashioned after the Old Testament prophets; we have a model, and that’s Jesus!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:1</a>, we’re admonished to be imitators of God as His beloved children. We’re to emulate His quiet, gentle, loving and compassionate spirit. This is easy because we have His life and nature in us. Therefore, we can talk and love like Him and walk in absolute mastery and dominion in the earth.</p>
<p>Even in prayer, emulate Jesus. Study the content of His prayer, for example, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17</a>, and pray like Him. Have the primary desire and enduring passion to please the Father as He did. His joy was to fulfil the will of the Father. That should be your focus every day.</p>
<p>If you were on the journey to be like the revivalists of old, or to be patterned after the Old Testament prophets or anyone else for that matter, recalibrate your life immediately. You’d be amazed at the profound joy that’ll engulf you, leaving you transformed into a more Christlike personality. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2029:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Jeremiah 29:11</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Bible tells us how God chose Moses to be Israel&#x27;s deliverer. However, his ambition got the better of him and he took matters into his own hands. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%202:11-22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 2:11-22</a>, Moses witnessed an Egyptian mistreating a Hebrew. In anger, he killed the Egyptian and tried to hide the body. </p>
<p>The next day, when he tried to intervene in a scuffle between two Hebrews, one of them questioned his authority and asked if he was going to kill him as he killed the Egyptian. Afraid that his action of killing the Egyptian wasn’t a secret after all, Moses fled to the land of Midian.</p>
<p>In Stephen’s address to the Sanhedrin, as recounted by Luke in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 7</a>, he underscores Moses&#x27; assumption that his brethren would have recognized him as God&#x27;s chosen deliverer. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%207:25&amp;version=MSG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 7:25 (MSG)</a> says, <em>“He thought his brothers would be glad that he was on their side, and even see him as an instrument of God to deliver them. But they didn&#x27;t see it that way.”</em></p>
<p>Moses allowed his zeal to becloud and overshadow God&#x27;s intended process. At the time, he didn’t surrender his ambition to divine guidance. He was chosen by God to be the deliverer alright, but he tried to work things out his own way. It’s a mistake a lot of people make.</p>
<p>In your life, learn to surrender your ambitions to His divine guidance. Follow God’s plan, the divine blueprint. He’s more passionate about your success than you could ever be. I discovered this early as I started out in ministry and it changed my life. Learn to pursue His dream and do things His way; it’ll take away the stress and the struggle. </p>
<p>Remember the admonition that God gave to Moses later when he was to build the Tabernacle; He said, <em>“… See…that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%208:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 8:5</a>). When you follow His prescribed order, you won’t have to fight for anything; success will be effortless. You’d keep gliding from glory to glory. Things are remarkably easy when you follow the Lord’s guidance and do things His way.</p>

<p><em><strong>Be strong and quit yourselves like men,  O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants  unto the Hebrews, as they have been to  you: quit yourselves like men, and fight  (1 Samuel 4:9).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%204:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Samuel 4:9</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%204:1-9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Samuel 4:1-9</a>, the Israelites faced the Philistines in battle and suffered a defeat, losing about four thousand men. Troubled, the elders of Israel decided to bring the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh, hoping it would save them from their enemies.</p>
<p>As the Ark arrived, there was a great shout, and the Philistines, hearing it, became afraid. They expressed concern about facing the mighty God of the Hebrews, but in response, the Philistine leaders urged their people, <em>&quot;Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%204:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Samuel 4:9</a>). </p>
<p>The phrase &quot;quit yourselves like men&quot; in this context means to &quot;be a man&quot; or &quot;act like a man.&quot; With this instruction, they encouraged themselves to demonstrate qualities of strength, courage and resilience in the face of challenges or adversity. They went out and fought more fiercely, ultimately defeating the Israelites.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%202:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Kings 2:2</a>, David, in his final days, charged Solomon, saying, <em>&quot;I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man.&quot;</em> It’s quite interesting that David didn&#x27;t instruct Solomon to show himself as a king or a prince even though Solomon was crowned king.</p>
<p>Instead, the emphasis was on him demonstrating qualities of leadership and strength. Since David himself was a man of war, he encouraged Solomon to be strong and courageous, resilient in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, Paul made a similar call when he exhorted God’s people in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2016:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>, saying, <em>&quot;Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.&quot;</em> The phrase &quot;quit you like men&quot; is a specific expression urging the Corinthian Christians to embody qualities associated with leadership, resilience and strength. </p>
<p>It&#x27;s essential to note that the expression isn&#x27;t addressing gender but rather emphasizes virtues of courage and resilience in the context of faith and steadfastness.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Isn’t it remarkable that all through the Scriptures, Abraham was never referred to as a king? But he became a progenitor of kings. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2017:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 17:6</a>, God said to Abraham, <em>&quot;And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.&quot;</em></p>
<p>God reiterated the same thing to Jacob: <em>“…I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2035:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 35:11</a>). So, God gave a directive that from Abraham, kings would emerge. </p>
<p>Then we come to the New Testament and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201:5-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 1:5-6</a> unveils a glorious truth, that through the Lord’s redemptive work, He has not only washed us from our sins but has made us kings and priests unto God. It says, <em>“…Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.”</em> We now share in the royal heritage. Blessed be God! </p>
<p>Embrace your identity; you’re a king. God has ordained you to reign and rule in the realms of life. Not only does He want you to have the consciousness that you’re a king, He also expects you to reproduce kings like you, just as the Lord Jesus, the ultimate King, has made us kings and priests. </p>

<p><em><strong>Therefore, let us be grateful for receiving  a kingdom that cannot be shaken and  thus let us offer to God acceptable  worship, with reverence and awe  (Hebrews 12:28 RSV).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Therefore, let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:28&amp;version=RSV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Hebrews 12:28 RSV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Observe that the opening verse tells us to offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe. What does &quot;acceptable worship&quot; mean? It’s worship that’s according to the Word; that’s the worship God accepts.</p>
<p>That you “felt” good during worship doesn’t mean it’s acceptable worship. Many songs that many have sung through the years and have called worship were not worship at all.</p>
<p>For example, they’re those who made a song out of what the psalmist wrote in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20100:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 100:4</a>, <em>“Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise….”</em> King David may have composed it, but today, we do not “enter” into the presence of God. The day you were born again, you were born into the presence of God; that’s where you live. In fact, you carry the presence of God in you and with you!</p>
<p>That’s why when someone says, “Let’s enter into His presence,” I ask, “Where are you coming from?” These distinctions may seem subtle, but they are far from mere semantics. True worship is not about emotions, singing, dancing or having melodious tunes; it has to be according to the Word. </p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, <em>“But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%204:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 4:23</a>). Someone says, “But I worship with pure conscience.” The danger lies in assuming that a pure conscience equates to acceptable worship. </p>
<p>Your conscience will guide you based on the knowledge you possess. If your understanding is limited, your conscience too will be limited; so, it’s an insufficient guide. The conscience, as the voice of the human spirit, requires training through the knowledge and understanding of the Word to be able to present to the Lord acceptable worship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I say also unto thee, That thou art  Peter, and upon this rock I will build my  church; and the gates of hell shall not  prevail against it (Matthew 16:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 16:18)</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus made the remarkable statement in our theme scripture above in response to Peter’s amazing revelatory insight about the Master’s identity as the Christ, the Son of the living God. Many have misconstrued what the Master meant when He said, “Upon this rock I will build my Church.”</p>
<p>Some have speculated that Jesus was referring to Peter&#x27;s revelation about Jesus being the Christ, but no! He wasn’t referring to Peter’s revelation. The Master was succinct in His communication; He didn’t say, “Peter, upon the revelation that I’m the Christ will I build my Church.” Rather, what He said in essence was, “I will build my Church on Christ.” Christ is the Rock.</p>
<p>To further clarify this, it’s important to follow and understand certain prophetic nuances in the Bible. For example, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022:41-46&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 22:41-46</a>, Jesus asked the Pharisees about their understanding of the Messiah, and they replied that Christ was the Son of David. Then He asked them if the Messiah was the son of David, how come David addressed Him as Lord? And then He quoted what David said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20110:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 110:1</a>, <em>&quot;The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.&quot;</em></p>
<p>When you read several other portions of the Scriptures, you’ll observe where David referred to the Lord as “the Rock.” In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2022:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Samuel 22:1</a>, for example, he spoke to the Lord, expressing gratitude for the deliverance from all his enemies, including Saul. He declared, <em>“…The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Samuel%2022:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Samuel 22:2</a>).</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2018:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 18:2</a>, he said, <em>&quot;The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength….&quot;</em> In the 46th verse, he continues, <em>&quot;The Lord lives! Blessed be my Rock! Let the God of my salvation be exalted&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2018:46&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 18:46 NKJV</a>). In essence, Christ is the foundation of the Church; He is the Rock. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2010:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 10:4</a> states clearly, <em>“…and that rock was Christ.”</em> The Church is not built on Peter’s revelation; it stands unshakeable on the Rock—Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201:20&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Jude 1:20 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>What the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:31&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 40:31</a> needs to be properly understood. It says, <em>“But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength….”</em> Some have read this and ran off with the notion that to be constantly energized, strengthened or invigorated spiritually, you have to “wait on the Lord”; in other words, fast for a protracted period.</p>
<p>Well, fasting is an important spiritual exercise, but someone can fast for 40 days and 40 nights and still not have their strength renewed. In the New Testament, the Lord provides us a sure and effective means to be constantly rejuvenated and invigorated spiritually: being filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:18-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:18-20</a> says, <em>“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</em> This is the answer. Stay perpetually filled with the Spirit, studying and speaking the Word, and praying in tongues. When you do this, you’re constantly energized.</p>
<p>Paul tells us, <em>&quot;He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself...&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 14:4</a>). In other words, when you speak in tongues, you’re invigorated, revitalized, refreshed, energized and edified. There’s a transformation in your life, and your spirit is conditioned for success, excellence, prosperity and victory.</p>
<p>When you speak in tongues a lot, the words of Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 7:38</a> become your everyday reality: <em>“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.”</em> What a blessing it is to be able to build up yourself like an edifice, formidable and able to withstand anything and win always as you pray in tongues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Even the youths shall faint and be weary,  and the young men shall utterly fall: But  they that wait upon the LORD shall renew  their strength; they shall mount up with  wings as eagles; they shall run, and not  be weary; and they shall walk, and not  faint (Isaiah 40:30-31).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:30-31&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Isaiah 40:30-31</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The term &quot;wait upon&quot; is translated from the Hebrew word &#x27;qavah,&#x27; signifying to &quot;gather&quot; or to &quot;bind together&quot; perhaps by twisting. It&#x27;s comparable to twisting ropes together to form one braided rope. Contextually, therefore, &quot;wait upon&quot; might not be the most accurate choice of words in translating what the prophet Isaiah said in that verse. </p>
<p>For example, when you read the creation story in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 1:9</a>, the same Hebrew word &#x27;qavah&#x27; is used when God commanded the water below the sky to come together in one place so that the land will appear: <em>&quot;And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be <strong>gathered together</strong> unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Also, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%203:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 3:17</a>, where the Scriptures emphasized the idea of people being united or bonded together, the same word is used: <em>&quot;At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD, and all the nations shall be <strong>gathered</strong> unto it....&quot;</em></p>
<p>So, when <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:31&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 40:31</a> speaks of those who &quot;wait upon the LORD,&quot; a more accurate understanding would be those who are &quot;gathered together&quot; or those who are &quot;bonded together&quot; with the Lord; they shall renew their strength. What does this tell us in the light of the New Testament?</p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>, <em>“...he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.”</em> Now, you can understand why the Holy Spirit has come to live in you; you and the Holy Spirit have become one in that rich fellowship. It’s a “bonding together” as it were. </p>
<p>We’ve been brought into oneness with divinity; it’s an inseparable union. We’re in Him, and He is in us. Glory to God! This is the reason we can enjoy rich fellowship with Him in prayer—praying in tongues—and be reinvigorated through and through. We’ve been brought into a communion, a place of relationship, a oneness of spirit. Hallelujah! </p>
<p>You ought to enjoy that fellowship every day; it’s not something you go into and come out of, for you’re in Him, and He’s in you.</p>

<p><em><strong>And it came to pass, when Moses came  down from mount Sinai with the two  tables of testimony in Moses&#x27; hand,  when he came down from the mount, that  Moses wist not that the skin of his face  shone while he talked with him (Exodus 34:29).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses&#x27; hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2034:29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Exodus 34:29</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Many of us acknowledge that the Word of God, as the Scriptures tell us, <em>“…is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). Also, the Lord Jesus emphasized in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 15:3</a>, <em>“Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.”</em> So, we understand that the Word of God does all these. That’s because the Word of God is the first glory of the Kingdom. Recall the experience of Moses in the Old Testament, part of which we read in our theme verse. </p>
<p>He had spent forty days and forty nights with God on Mount Sinai, receiving the Ten Commandments. And because he had been in communion with God, when he came down from the mountain, his face radiated the glory of God such that everyone who saw him couldn’t look at him.</p>
<p>There was a distinctive glory on Moses that emanated from his attentive reception of God’s Word. Moses had to wear a veil to shroud the glory that had rubbed off on him (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2034:29-33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 34:29-33</a>). That’s the effect of deep contemplation and meditation on the Word.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s crucial to recognize the difference in how Moses and the children of Israel perceived the Word. While the people viewed it as commandments and instructions, Moses understood God’s Word as life (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2032:46-47&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteronomy 32:46-47</a>).</p>
<p>In the New Testament, this same glory is now within us. When you received the Word of God into your spirit for salvation, the Word came to live in you and the glory of God’s Word is now in your spirit. The best part of it is that the glory of the Word in us today outclasses what Moses had. </p>
<p>Ours, according to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:7-11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 3:7-11</a> (read the entire reference), is the more excellent glory: <em>“…For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth; for if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:10-11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 3:10-11</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>But ye shall receive power, after that  the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and  ye shall be witnesses unto me both in  Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in  Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of  the earth (Acts 1:8).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 1:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 1:8</a>, the Lord Jesus told His disciples they would receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them, and that power would make them effective witnesses. The word “power” in this context means power that works! The Greek rendering is &quot;Dunamis&quot;; it signifies inherent power—power that reproduces itself; it’s the root word from which we get the English, ‘dynamo.’</p>
<p>A dynamo is a device that generates electrical power through the conversion of mechanical energy. So, the term dynamo is often used to describe a generator that continuously generates power without requiring external assistance. This is the kind of power at work in you today. It’s a miracle-working ability.</p>
<p>This power makes you an effective witness to your world. A witness is one who possesses evidence and proof; he’s one who’s called to testify of what he knows. So, should you ever feel weak as a witness, activate the power within you! Paul explains how to do this in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:18-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:18-20</a>; it’s by getting yourself drunk in the Holy Ghost!</p>
<p>Also, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 14:4</a>, the Bible says, <em>“He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself….”</em> In other words, when you speak in tongues, you activate the power within you and make it effectual, if it had been lying dormant. There is power inside you—inherent power. It’s the power that works; with it, you can produce anything.</p>

<p><em><strong>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 2:9</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One remarkable distinction between Jesus and the prophets of old is that Jesus had the fullness of the Godhead dwelling in Him. The Holy Spirit was within Him, but the prophets only had the Holy Spirit come upon them from time to time.</p>
<p>For example, we read the story in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%206&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judges 6</a> when Gideon was chosen by God to deliver Israel from the Midianites. The Bible says, <em>“But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%206:34&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judges 6:34</a>).</p>
<p>Also, in the 14th chapter, we find the story of Samson who encountered a young lion while on his way to Timnath. The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, enabling him to tear the lion apart &quot;as he would have torn a kid&quot; (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges%2014:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judges 14:6</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2010:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Samuel 10:10</a>, before Saul became king, the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he prophesied among the prophets. Also, read the story of David in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2016:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Samuel 16:13</a>. After Samuel anointed David as the future king of Israel, the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him.</p>
<p>But today, the dynamics have changed. We’re in the generation of Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit doesn’t come on us like He did with those in the Old Testament. He lives in us now in His fullness. The Holy Spirit lives in you in His maximum capacity and entirety, just like Paul said about Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:19</a>, <em>“For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.”</em></p>
<p>In the next chapter, Paul also reiterated, <em>“For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2:9</a>). Then in the very next verse, He was quick to add that we are complete in Him: <em>“And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2:10</a>).</p>
<p>So, today, just like Jesus, when you walk the streets, it’s with the fullness of the Godhead. God Almighty, in His fullness, lives, walks and talks in you. Hallelujah! Can you see that you aren’t an ordinary person? You’re a God-carrying vessel, filled with His fulness, and doing extraordinary things. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto  treasure hid in a field; the which when a  man hath found, he hideth, and for joy  thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath,  and buyeth that field (Matthew 13:44).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:44&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 13:44</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus vividly describes the Kingdom of Heaven as a hidden treasure in a field. The field symbolizes the world, and the treasure within it is the Church. Jesus saw the Church in the visions of His Spirit. He, in turn, paid the ultimate price, shedding His own blood to legally acquire the whole world for the sake of the treasure therein.</p>
<p>Thus, the world belongs to Jesus; He is its rightful owner. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201:2&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 1:2 AMPC</a> emphatically declares that Jesus Christ is not just an appointed heir, but He’s the lawful owner of all things: <em>“[But] in the last of these days He has spoken to us in [the person of a] Son, Whom He appointed Heir and lawful Owner of all things….”</em></p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:16-17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:16-17</a>, we learn that as children of God, we’re joint-heirs with Christ. This implies that everything that belongs to Jesus belongs to the Church in the same way that it belongs to Him. Therefore, as He is—the lawful owner of all things—so are we. He doesn&#x27;t own it without us, and we don&#x27;t own it without Him. We have equal rights to everything that the Father gave to Jesus.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:8&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 3:8 (AMPC)</a> describes our wealth and inheritance as boundless, fathomless, incalculable and exhaustless. Hallelujah! Have this consciousness. Walk through life with the mentality that the whole world belongs to you, because it does in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>The whole world was willed to Abraham, but the promise had to be fulfilled in Christ. The Bible says, <em>&quot;And if ye be Christ&#x27;s, then are ye Abraham&#x27;s seed, and heirs according to the promise&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203:29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 3:29</a>). The whole earth is ours; we&#x27;re not trying to get it; it belongs to us in Christ. Now you can understand why the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:21-22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 3:21-22</a>, <em>“Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world… all are yours.”</em> Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>And these signs shall follow them that  believe… they shall lay hands on the  sick, and they shall recover  (Mark 16:17-18).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>And these signs shall follow them that believe… they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Mark 16:17-18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Did you know that when it comes to healing the sick, we’re the ones God asked to do it? He gave us power to heal. In our theme scripture, the Lord Jesus didn’t say the believing ones shall pray to me to heal the sick; rather, He said, they shall lay hands on the sick, and the sick shall be healed.</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 10:9</a>, He was just as direct when He sent His disciples out to preach the Gospel. He said, <em>“… heal the sick…and say unto them, the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.”</em> Also, He told them, <em>“And as ye go, preach, saying, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010:7-8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 10:7-8</a>).</p>
<p>Remarkably, He didn’t say, “pray for the sick”; rather, He said, “heal the sick.” Hallelujah! In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%203&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 3</a>, Peter exemplified this authority to heal the sick when he encountered a man who had been crippled from birth at the Temple gate. He declared, <em>&quot;...Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%203:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 3:6</a>). This wasn&#x27;t a plea or a prayer; Peter simply acted on the Words of the Master; He used the Name of Jesus as a powerful instrument.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 3:16</a>, he further emphasized the power of the Name of Jesus when he said that faith in His Name had made the formerly lame man strong: <em>“And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.”</em></p>
<p>One of the most beautiful things about Christianity is the blessing of using the Name of Jesus. When you speak or proclaim healing for the sick in His Name, your words are effective, producing exactly what they talk about. Even now, go ahead and make declarations in His Name about your health and that of your loved ones. Proclaim healing for many today who are sick and in hospitals. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>It&#x27;s essential to recognize that not everyone in this world will fulfil their God-given purpose. In fact, many are unaware that God has a unique plan for each person born into this world. Every human being faces two destinies: a natural destiny shaped by circumstances such as birth, family, environment, etc. and a divine destiny initiated when Jesus becomes the Lord of one&#x27;s life. From then on, He takes charge of your life.</p>
<p>The Word of God has to be the guiding light for your life. Every time you hear the Word, faith is imparted to you. Through this faith, you can please the Lord, serve Him, and accomplish anything in alignment with His will; you can fulfil the calling of God on your life.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:18</a>). <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 1:23</a> says, <em>&quot;Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”</em></p>
<p>As one born of the Word, living in the Word is fundamental to fulfilling your purpose. The Word fortifies your faith, guides your spirit, and serves as the nourishment for your spirit; it is your life. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>I exhort therefore, that, first of all,  supplications, prayers, intercessions,  and giving of thanks, be made for all men;  For kings, and for all that are in authority;  that we may lead a quiet and peaceable  life in all godliness and honesty.

<p><em><strong>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:1-4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Timothy 2:1-4</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Greek word translated “knowledge” in the scripture above is “epignosis.” It means full, exact or precise knowledge. God wants all men to be saved and to come to the full, exact or precise knowledge of the truth. If this weren’t possible, He wouldn’t have said so. This is His desire. </p>
<p>It’s also the reason He set ministers and ministries in place as gifts to the Church: <em>“And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers. For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, <strong>and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ</strong>”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:11-13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>).</p>
<p>God wants you built up and established in the Word until you come to such a high level of faith and knowledge of the Son of God—mature and fully grown in the Lord. As you develop in Christ and in the things of the Spirit, and as you increase in the revelation knowledge of the Word, you’re able to tame circumstances and live above the elements of this world.</p>
<p>When you have precise knowledge of the truth—the truth about Christ and what He’s done for you and in you—your life will be an endless stream of peace, joy and victories. Get to know the truth.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2087:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 87:3</a> says, <em>“Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God.”</em> Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2050:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 50:2</a>, the Bible says, <em>“Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.”</em> Hallelujah! God shines through you, not cancer, diabetes, kidney failure, poverty or any of the negativities of this world. You’re the perfection of beauty.</p>
<p>When you stand in front of the mirror, look at yourself and say, “I know who I am; greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world. My life is for the glory of God because Christ lives in me.” Be established in these truths. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>You did not choose me. I chose you and  sent you out to produce fruit, the kind  of fruit that will last. Then my Father  will give you whatever you ask for in my  name (John 15:16 CEV).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>You did not choose me. I chose you and sent you out to produce fruit, the kind of fruit that will last. Then my Father will give you whatever you ask for in my name (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:16&amp;version=CEV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 15:16 CEV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Isn’t it wonderful to know that the Lord Jesus chose and ordained you to produce abiding fruits: results that stand the test of time? Whatever you do is expected to succeed and “abide.” </p>
<p>The Bible tells us about Joseph who was brought into the house of Potiphar as a slave. However, because the Lord was with him, everything he did prospered. When his master, Potiphar, saw this, he promptly made Joseph the overseer of his house. Potiphar recognized that Joseph was blessed to produce lasting results.</p>
<p>The grace of God is on your life to produce excellence in everything you do. Become conscious of this. Whatever you’re required to do should be a success because you’re a child of God, and you’re fashioned for good works. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:10</a> says, <em>“For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.”</em></p>
<p>Keep bearing fruits. Keep winning. Remain effective. Wherever you find yourself, make a difference. Joseph’s excellence wasn’t discovered when he became the boss; it was discovered while he was a slave. He only became the boss because of his effectiveness.</p>
<p>Thanks be unto God; the Spirit of God in you makes you an effective and efficient person. Read what the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:8&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 1:8 AMPC</a>: <em>“But you shall receive power (ability, efficiency, and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you….”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 1:3</a> also gives a vivid description of your ever-fruitful and ever-productive life in Christ. It says, <em>“And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 16:11</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There are Christians who make snide remarks when they hear the teachings on prosperity in Christ. Sometimes, they accuse preachers of focusing too much on money and the prosperity message. Ironically, the same individuals work tirelessly all day and all week for money. Some of them even resort to dishonest means to obtain it and often feel distressed when they lack it.</p>
<p>There’s no better place to learn about financial prosperity than God’s Word. The Lord delights in your prosperity. The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=3%20John%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 John 1:2</a>, <em>“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”</em></p>
<p>It brings to mind the words of David in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2035:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 35:27</a>; he said, <em>“…Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.”</em> The Lord has pleasure in your prosperity. That should let you know that poverty, lack and want aren’t the will of God for you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 9:8 (AMPC)</a> says, <em>“And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].”</em></p>
<p>His will is for you to be in surplus, ever-prospering. Hallelujah! Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%201:1-3&amp;version=TPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 1:1-3 (TPT)</a>; it says, <em>“What delight comes to the one who follows God’s ways….He will be standing firm like a flourishing tree planted by God’s design, deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss, bearing fruit in every season of life. He is never dry, never fainting, ever blessed, ever prosperous.”</em></p>
<p>In Christ, you’re self-sufficient; you have whatever you require in abundance. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>***Let my prayer be set forth before thee as  incense; and the lifting up of my hands  as the evening sacrifice (Psalm 141:2). ***</p>

<p><em><strong>Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20141:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 141:2</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In the Scriptures, there’re copious references to the import and blessings of the lifting of our hands. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20134:1-2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 134:1-2</a> says, <em>“Behold, bless ye the LORD… Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.”</em> When we lift our hands, blessings are released; divine power flows through our hands.</p>
<p>Once, I was in a meeting where there were many people with arthritis, and a lot of them couldn’t lift their hands. I asked the Lord, “Why do we have so many people in that place with arthritis?” </p>
<p>The Lord’s response to me was very interesting. He said, “I said in my Word to lift your hands and worship me; lifting your hands in worship will keep you away from such ailments as arthritis.” Sadly, many don’t know this.</p>
<p>Then He said, “If those people had been praying, worshipping, praising with their hands lifted, as the Scripture says, they would have never suffered arthritis.” The things that God tells us to do are for our sake, for our blessing, such as the lifting of our hands. Every so often, in times of prayer and worship, let your hands go up.</p>
<p>Lifting your hands to the Lord is a sign of your recognition of His grace and glory in your life. Remember, the symbolism of the evening sacrifice offered on the brazen altar is reflected in the lifting up of our hands. Therefore, when you lift your hands in worship, it pleases God more than all the bulls and goats sacrificed on that brazen altar in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>David was well acquainted with the priesthood ministry in the old tabernacle. Also, he was a prophet of God, and by the Spirit, he had a revelation of the New Testament and saw that the lifting of our hands today had taken the place of the burnt offering in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 2:8</a>, the Bible says, <em>“I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or doubting.”</em> The Apostle Paul here was referring to spiritual worship and offering of praise to the Father from a joyful heart, full of love and thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Even now, lift your hands and worship the Lord for His love, mercy and kindness; tell Him how much you love Him.</p>

<p><em><strong>When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset. So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2017:12-13&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Exodus 17:12-13 NIV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>As referenced in our last study, the lifting of our hands to the Lord is an offering to Him, not a mere religious routine as some folks think. It’s a ministry. For example, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2017:8-13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 17:8-13</a> gives us the account of the Israelites&#x27; battle against the Amalekites.</p>
<p>The Amalekites attacked Israel at Rephidim. Moses instructed Joshua to choose men to fight against Amalek while he went to the top of the hill with the staff of God in his hand. As the battle progressed, whenever Moses held up his hands, the Israelites prevailed, but when he lowered them, the Amalekites gained the upper hand.</p>
<p>Aaron and Hur, the two men who were with Moses noticed that every time Moses lifted his hands, Israel had the advantage, and every time his hands dropped, the opposing side prevailed. Moses, unaware of the impact, was informed by Aaron and Hur that the lifting of his hands influenced the outcome of the battle. </p>
<p>Recognizing the importance, Aaron and Hur provided a stone for him to sit on, and they both helped to bear his hands up on either side. By so doing, Israel prevailed against Amalek. What did that signify? It wasn’t about the height of the hands; it was the lifting of the hands.</p>
<p>Remember that he had to sit down; when he sat down, the height was reduced. So, it wasn’t about how high the hands were; it was the fact that the hands were lifted. With his hands steady until sunset, Joshua overwhelmed the Amalekite forces. </p>
<p>There&#x27;s something about the lifting of our hands. If you desire to witness continuous victories and triumphs, always praise the Lord with your hands lifted. When you face challenges, declare, “Father, I lift my hands to you against these issues, against the forces of darkness, against those that war against me.” This act has the power to paralyze opposing forces! Blessed be God!</p>

<p>Your value to God is the price He paid for your salvation, which is the blood of Jesus Christ: <em>“Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold…But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:18-19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).</p>
<p>This should help you further appreciate the infinite magnitude and boundless nature of His love. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:17-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 3:17-18</a>, the Holy Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, prayed that we, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend the unfathomable dimensions of the Father’s love.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:32&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:32</a>, the Apostle Paul raised a thought-provoking question as he reflected on God’s matchless love for us. He asked, <em>“He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?”</em> In other words, why should anyone be sick, weak, poor, broke, depressed or live a down life, judging how much the Father loves us?</p>
<p>An understanding of our heavenly Father’s love will rid your life of fear, sickness and everything associated with Satan and darkness. Matthew’s account of what the Lord did as a demonstration of His love for the people lends credence to this. It says, <em>&quot;And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209:35&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 9:35</a>). Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>The thief comes only in order to steal  and kill and destroy. I came that they  may have and enjoy life, and have it in  abundance (to the full, till it overflows) (John 10:10 AMPC).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows) (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 10:10 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said He came that we may have and enjoy life to the full. Aren’t you glad about that? He lived and died, and came back to life to see to it that nothing cheats you out of His perfect will for you.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=3%20John%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 John 1:2</a>, He said, <em>“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.&quot;</em> In this verse, the Apostle John describes the comprehensive prosperity of the human person, which includes spiritual, material and physical well-being.</p>
<p>God knows that without sound health, you can’t enjoy the life that He gave you. That’s why He sent us to heal the sick. Divine healing is a manifestation of His goodness. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 10:38</a> further reinforces this truth. It says, <em>“How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”</em></p>
<p>God sent Jesus, and He went about doing good, healing all those who were oppressed of the devil. The Bible shows that He gave us the same charge. He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 10:8</a>, <em>“Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 9:2</a> says, referring to the disciples, <em>“And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.”</em> Hallelujah! Think about Peter and John at the gate of the temple called Beautiful. They encountered a man who had been lame from birth, begging for alms. The Bible says, “Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%203:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 3:6</a>).</p>
<p>The man, previously unable to walk, was healed instantly, and he entered the temple with Peter and John, praising God. The crowd, astonished at the miraculous healing, saw in the hitherto lame man the manifestation of the goodness of God. God doesn’t want people sick, weak, or broken. That’s why He sent us to take healing to the nations. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>According to the eternal purpose which  he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:  In whom we have boldness and access  with confidence by the faith of him  (Ephesians 3:11-12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord: In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:11-12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 3:11-12</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>If you read the opening text from some Bible translations, they missed the profound simplicity of what Paul was saying. They translated it as having access and boldness into God’s presence, but we already have that in Christ Jesus by the Holy Spirit. So what was Paul referring to here?</p>
<p>First, boldness in this context implies the freedom to express ourselves openly, being able to say whatever you want to say. While worldly systems grant freedom with limitations, in Christ Jesus, we have absolute freedom of speech.</p>
<p>We possess the freedom to speak boldly in the presence of the Father, angels, and even demons, and express ourselves freely anywhere. This boldness extends beyond uttering mere words; it empowers us to speak things into existence. </p>
<p>Secondly, we have “access”; meaning we can go anywhere. No nation can ever close its doors to you; you have access to every country, to every wealth and to all riches. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:12&amp;version=MSG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 3:12 (MSG)</a> beautifully captures it; it says, <em>“When we trust in him, we&#x27;re free to say whatever needs to be said, bold to go wherever we need to go.”</em></p>
<p>Even with that, it has a limited understanding of the word &quot;access.&quot; It&#x27;s not just about going wherever you need to go; you have access to the spiritual and the material, to the wisdom of Almighty God. You have access to the unending, boundless, fathomless, incalculable and exhaustless riches of Christ. </p>
<p>When you grasp the depth of your access and vast wealth in Christ, giving and lavishly sponsoring the spread of the Gospel becomes a lifestyle, because you know you have access to an unending supply. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And his name through faith in his name  hath made this man strong, whom ye see  and know: yea, the faith which is by him  hath given him this perfect soundness in  the presence of you all (Acts 3:16).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this PERFECT SOUNDNESS in the presence of you all (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 3:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>I want you to notice the expression “perfect soundness” in our opening verse. It’s rendered from the Greek word “holokleria”, which means a perfect state of health; a condition of health with no problems whatsoever. This is God’s desire for you, and it’s one of the many blessings of living in and by the Name of Jesus.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:4</a> expresses a similar thought; it talks about being &quot;perfect and entire, wanting nothing.&quot; The term translated &quot;entire&quot; is “holokleros,” the verb form of “holokleria.” It implies being perfectly sound, complete without blemish. What a life!</p>
<p>Then, to make this happen, God gave us the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of life, to keep us perfectly sound. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:11</a> says, <em>“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>
<p>In the previous verse 10, it says, <em>“But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:10&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:10 NIV</a>). Christ in you, the Holy Spirit in you, guarantees you perfect soundness of spirit, soul and body.</p>
<p>It brings to mind Peter’s encounter with Aeneas who had been crippled for 8 years. All Peter said to him was, <em>“…Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:34&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 9:34</a>). Aeneas was restored to a perfect state of health because Peter understood the transcendent power of the Name of Jesus and Christ living in us.</p>
<p>As a Christian, Christ lives in you, and you live in Him. Your faith in His Name and consciousness of His indwelling presence will keep you in perfect soundness. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>***And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness (Romans 8:10). ***</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>And if Christ [be] in you, the body [is] dead because of sin; but the Spirit [is] life because of righteousness (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Often, in a well-translated King James Version of the Bible, you&#x27;d observe some parenthesized words due to missing links in the manuscripts. Consequently, the correct rendering of our opening verse ought to have been, <em>&quot;And if Christ be in you, though your body is dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness.&quot;</em> The updated New International Version actually renders it similarly.</p>
<p>Then we come to the 11th verse of the same Romans 8; it says, <em>“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”</em> The word translated as “but” doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be &#x27;but&#x27;. It’s best rendered as &#x27;and&#x27;, &#x27;now&#x27;, &#x27;then&#x27; or &#x27;so&#x27;. Either of these foregoing words provide a more fitting connection.</p>
<p>So, let’s now put these in the right context and read: <em>&quot;And if Christ be in you, though your body is dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness. Now, if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:10-11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:10-11</a>).</p>
<p>Even now, as you read this, if your physical body has already been so battered, bruised, damaged and ravaged by sickness and disease, there can be a change. If it has been paralyzed, the Holy Spirit can give life to your physical body and restore you to perfect health.</p>
<p>It’s one of the reasons we speak in tongues. The Bible says, <em>&quot;He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself…&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 14:4</a>). The Greek word translated “edifieth” is “oikodomeo,” which means to construct or build up, to embolden or charge up like you’d charge a battery.</p>
<p>Thus, the one who speaks in tongues builds himself up, charges himself, and rejuvenates himself. What happens when you do this is that the power of God within you courses through your being, vitalizing your physical body. Spend some time right now to speak in tongues; the power that’s at work in you even now will revive, vitalize and produce life in your body or wherever you require it. </p>

<p><em><strong>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 2:6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s important to become more acquainted with the Word and let it dwell in you richly. This is crucial, because we’re in the last days, and some individuals and groups have come up with sinister schemes to cause pain, untold hardship, famine, wanton destruction and death in the world. But with the Word in your heart and on your lips, you can counteract their efforts and bring them to naught.</p>
<p>Read our theme verse in the Amplified Classic translation; it says, <em>&quot;…when we are among the full-grown…we do impart a [higher] wisdom (the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden); but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age or of this world nor of the leaders and rulers of this age, who are being brought to nothing and are doomed to pass away.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Observe that as a result of speaking wisdom, that is speaking the Word, the adversary is discomfited, his plans are foiled and brought to nothing. God isn’t doing that from heaven, no! It’s happening through us. We’re His battle-axe and weapons of war (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2051:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 51:20</a>).</p>
<p>When discussing the actions and activities of wicked and unreasonable men, feudal lords that seek to keep men and nations in bondage, declare only what the Word says about them. The Word says they are doomed to fail. Speak the truth about their failure.</p>
<p>Declare that in the clutches of their sinister agenda, they find no foothold, no progress, and no advancement against the Church and God’s people. The greater One lives in us; therefore, the malevolent designs of Satan and his cohorts of evil are doomed to wither and perish as we, the Church, walk on in victory. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Remember that in the Church age, God has not bestowed any governmental structure, group or individuals with the power of global control. Only what we—the Church—permit will come to pass. Our work and responsibility is to bring forth the will of the Father. Therefore, in prayer, and with your words, enforce and execute the will of the Father here on earth.</p>

<p><em><strong>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 3:24</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:24-25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 4:24-25</a>, the Bible tells us that the Lord Jesus was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification. Justification means acquittal, to be declared not guilty. How did this happen?</p>
<p>First, when Jesus died and was buried, in the mind of justice, we died and were buried with Him. When He was raised back to life, we were raised together with Him, a new creation. It happened at the same instance that God said of Him, <em>&quot;…Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%202:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 2:7</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus was born again when He was raised from the dead. That’s where we—the Church—came from. We came from the resurrection, not from the Cross. In the mind of God, when Jesus resurrected, you resurrected, you were born a new creature because you were in Him.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, says, <em>&quot;...If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.&quot;</em> Now that you&#x27;re born again, you’re without a past. The question then is, what happened to your past? It died with Jesus, because when Jesus died, the whole world died in Him. So, by His resurrection, all men should have a new life. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>That’s why when you were born again, you were born justified. The Bible says, <em>“Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus</em>” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3:24</a>). The word &quot;freely&quot; is translated from the Greek “dorean,” meaning &quot;without cause.&quot; To be justified is also to be declared righteous.</p>
<p>This means you were justified, declared righteous without cause; you didn’t have to do something about it to make it happen. It was by His grace; you were born that way. Now He says, <em>“… as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:4</a>). Blessed be God!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 1:23</a> says, <em>“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”</em> Every Christian is thus the epistle of Christ, because we’re born of the Word; we’re offsprings of the Word. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:18</a> says, <em>“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.”</em></p>
<p>You’re the Word in flesh! This is what the Apostle Paul meant by us being “living epistles.” Today, anyone who wants to see the Word of God should look at you, for you’re the epistle of Christ! This is what the Church is. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the Word of God in human flesh: <em>“And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us...”</em>(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:14 NKJV</a>). Jesus was the epistle of God. He was the love-letter sent to the world by God. The same Word that became flesh gave birth to us.</p>
<p>We were born in the realm of the spirit to be like Jesus through the Word. Glory to God. Your life is the life of the Word. You&#x27;re not born of the corruptible seed of man, but of God’s incorruptible seed. This is the reason the life in you is the God-life—the life of the Word. Hallelujah!</p>
