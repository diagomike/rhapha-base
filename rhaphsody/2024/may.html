<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the truth&#x27;s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20John%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 John 1:2</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John discovered Jesus in a way that most others never did. He saw something about the Word of God that was unique. He alone shares with us in his gospel writing, <em>“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:14</a>). </p>
<p>John understood it because he was there when Jesus taught them and said, <em>“...I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:6</a>). He heard Jesus say, “I am the truth.” And so, when Jesus, in His prayer to the Father, said, <em>“…thy word is truth”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:17</a>), John was able to put it together: The Word is Truth, and the Truth became flesh.</p>
<p>Jesus was more than a man, more than a prophet, and more than a Rabbi; He was God&#x27;s Truth—God in the flesh. What is truth? Truth is reality—absolute reality. Everything else fades away, but the Truth of God dwells in us, and shall be with us forever (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20John%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 John 1:2</a>).</p>
<p>Once this reality settles in your heart, you’ll realize there&#x27;s nothing you can’t have and nothing you can&#x27;t do, because the Truth dwells in you, and this Truth—the Word of Truth—created everything, including you: <em>“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:18</a>). Glory to God! </p>

<p><em><strong>For whatsoever is born of God  overcometh the world: and this is the  victory that overcometh the world, even  our faith (1 John 5:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 5:4</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s so much negative information in the world today and this has instilled fear in the hearts of those who aren’t rooted and grounded in the Word. But as a Christian, you live on the mountaintop, because you’re seated together with Christ in the place of glory and dominion.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you face distressing situations, turbulent times, live above them. Even if you were told a certain infectious disease has gotten into your system; it shall have no power over you. Refuse to fear. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 10:19</a>, Jesus said, <em>“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: <strong>and nothing shall by any means hurt you</strong>.”</em></p>
<p>Live with the consciousness that you’re a partaker of the divine nature. The life in you is divine; it’s not sustained by blood but by the Spirit of God who lives in you: <em>“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:11</a>). This verse isn’t a promise but a vital reality now that the Holy Spirit lives in you: He’s the life of your physical body.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve even been diagnosed with an incurable disease as you read this; have no fear. Declare the Word until the divine life in you gains the ascendancy. With faith in your heart, keep affirming, “The same Spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead, lives in me and has invigorated my physical body. I walk in divine health!” </p>
<p>Stand your ground in faith, declaring the Word, irrespective of the symptoms and the circumstances around you. The Word already declares your victory. Satan and the powers of darkness are under your feet. Even now, declare that you live victoriously through the Word and by the Spirit over and above sickness, disease and death. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And hath put all things under his feet,  and gave him to be the head over all  things to the church, Which is his body,  the fulness of him that filleth all in all  (Ephesians 1:22-23).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22-23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:22-23</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The opening text shows that Jesus cannot operate without His Church. The Church is the completeness or full expression of Christ. In other words, if you desire to know about Christ, receive His blessings, or make contact with Him, the Church is the answer.</p>
<p>Now, who constitutes the Church? Christians all over the world are the body of Christ. Wherever they are, they form the body of Christ in that location. Someone might ask, “Pastor Chris, what if I’m the only Christian in that location?” Then you’re the Church—the body of Christ—in that place.</p>
<p>The body of Christ is that man or woman in whom Christ dwells. We don&#x27;t have to be many to form Him. For example, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208:26-39&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 8:26-39</a>, Philip, one of the disciples, was led by the Holy Spirit to approach a high-ranking Ethiopian official—a eunuch. He preached to him and baptized him. </p>
<p>The Ethiopian eunuch received Christ, alone. When the eunuch journeyed back to Ethiopia, where was the body of Christ in Ethiopia? It was in the Ethiopian eunuch; he was the body of Christ in Ethiopia until he preached the Gospel to other people. </p>
<p>As the body of Christ, operating in your world, you’re His fullness. The fullness of His love, grace, glory and power is in you. This understanding eradicates weaknesses and limitations. Paul declares, <em>&quot;I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 4:13</a>). </p>
<p>He didn’t say &quot;we can&quot; but &quot;I can,&quot; because Paul comprehended that he was the body of Christ. This has to be your consciousness. If it’s just two of you in a certain location, both of you are the body of Christ there. If you’re a thousand, all of you are the body of Christ. </p>
<p>But if you’re the only one; anywhere you are, when you operate outside the assembly, outside the Church, you’re the body of Christ there. You’re His full legal representative and representation. That means you’re authorized by Him, and you’re His image or expression. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek  those things which are above, where  Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.  Set your affection on things above, not  on things on the earth. For ye are dead,  and your life is hid with Christ in God  (Colossians 3:1-3).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:1-3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 3:1-3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>I remember reading a number of books, many years ago, that taught on the Christian dying to the flesh so that we could please God. This got my attention as a young Christian who really wanted to serve God with his life. I would lay on my bed and pray, “Lord I want to die to the flesh so I can please you.” I prayed this way until I came across Colossians 3.</p>
<p>At this point, I had learnt how to accept the Word of God simply like a child. So, I read the first two verses which told me to set my affections on things above and not on things on the earth, and I was ready to do that. I however wasn’t expecting what came next in the third verse; it says, <em>“For ye are dead….”</em></p>
<p>This changed my life! Then I came across <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 5:24</a>; it says, <em>“And they that are Christ&#x27;s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.”</em> I began to walk tall with this new information. I went to my friends and said, “Guess what I found? We no longer need to die to the flesh, because we already died; the flesh has been crucified; now we have a new life in Christ Jesus.” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:11</a> sealed the whole thing! It says, “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” We’re dead to sin but alive to God! This means you can serve the Lord joyfully and confidently; you can live a life that’s pleasing to Him. Glory to His Name forever!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>***But if the Spirit of him that raised up  Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that  raised up Christ from the dead shall also  quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit  that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11). ***</p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:11</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>No one can live the Christian life without the Holy Spirit. It’s impossible! Some believe the Holy Spirit is in us only to help us speak in tongues; no! He does much more in us, for us and through us. Consider for example what we read in our opening scripture: the Holy Spirit in you quickens—vitalizes—your mortal body. He gives life to your body. </p>
<p>That means there shouldn’t be death in any part of your body, because the Holy Spirit—the Spirit of life— lives in you. Hallelujah! Many have chanted our opening verse in songs and quoted it in sermons but have never responded to it as they should. The Word always requires your response. Ponder it again: the Holy Spirit in you makes alive your mortal body. Your response, therefore, should be: My body is invigorated with the life of God. I live in absolute health in Christ Jesus. Amen. </p>
<p>God wants you to be bold and never afraid of death. Be like Paul, who when he was bitten by a venomous serpent wasn’t moved. Others were waiting for him to fall down and die, but he shook the serpent into the fire. This was what he knew; he was conscious that nothing could hurt or harm the one in whom the Holy Ghost dwells. </p>
<p>Now that you’re born again, you’ve been brought from humanity to eternity, which means you’ve become incorruptible, indestructible and imperishable; you’re not subject to failure, defeat and death! This should be your consciousness—a consciousness of life through the Spirit just as the Bible says that if Christ is in you, even though the body may be dead because of sin, the Spirit gives it life because of righteousness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:10</a>).

<p><em><strong>As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Peter 2:2</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>

<p>In Christ we already have everything. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3</a> says, <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”</em> His divine power has given us everything we require for life and godliness, but you can only enjoy them through your knowledge of Him. </p>
<p>As we grow in the Lord and become more aware of His Kingdom which we&#x27;re a part of, we learn to apply more of all that He’s granted us. It’s very much like raising kids; though they&#x27;re heirs of whatever their parents own, they can’t enjoy some of those things until they attain a certain age or level of maturity. That&#x27;s the way it is in the Gospel. </p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%204:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 4:1</a>, <em>“Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all.”</em> An heir is someone who is legally entitled to an inheritance, rank, or title. He may be an heir to a throne or an heir to some wealth; but as long as that heir is still a child, he’s not different from a servant. Why is this important?</p>
<p>The word “child” is translated from the Greek word “Nepios,” and it refers to one who’s a child mentally and still unable to communicate or talk intelligently. Thus, a Christian who’s still a child (nepios), though all the blessings and wealth in Christ belong to him, he can’t enjoy them because he’s unable to “talk right.”</p>
<p>The blessings are activated by your words—your confessions—which must be based on God’s Word and not on sensory perceptions. But the “nepios” talks according to his senses. From his words, one can tell he’s not trained. That’s why the Bible says he’s placed under tutors and governors, to be trained until he grows to maturity (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%204:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 4:2</a>). </p>
<p>It’s one of the reasons everyone of us must grow by the Word. And one of the ways to ensure this is your active membership in your local church where the Word of God is taught and you’re trained with the Word to help you grow and talk right.</p>

<p><em><strong>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our  infirmities: for we know not what we  should pray for as we ought: but the  Spirit itself maketh intercession for us  with groanings which cannot be uttered  (Romans 8:26).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:26</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The word translated “helpeth” in our opening verse is a complex Greek word: “sunantilambanomai.” It means “to strive to obtain together with” or “to take hold together with, against.” This expression gives us God’s picture of intercession; in fact, it’s the best explanation of how God expects us to carry out the ministry of intercession.</p>
<p>This means that in intercession, God takes hold together with us against the adversary. If, for example, I take hold together with you against someone else, it means I&#x27;m on the same side with you. </p>
<p>So, when Paul says “the spirit also helpeth our infirmities,” it means the Holy Spirit joins together with us in prayer against the adversary for those who are unable to help themselves. “Infirmities” is from another Greek word “Astheneia”, which refers to some form of limitation or weakness; when there’s a want of requisite capacity.</p>
<p>Imagine someone who has been sick for a long time and is probably dying. He’s so weak that he no longer can appropriate the blessings of Christ on healing and health for himself. Who’s holding him back? Satan. It’s God who wants to heal him. So, the Holy Spirit joins together with us to pray for that one. We take the place of that person in prayer and then rebuke the adversary.</p>
<p>This means the Holy Spirit is an intercessor and He carries out that ministry through us. It also means that He’s not the one holding back or causing the problem; He’s not the one we’re trying to persuade. He’s helping us. </p>
<p>Maybe you’ve been praying for years for someone to receive salvation. There’s no need trying to convince Him to save that person. The Holy Spirit sides with you in prayer against the adversary responsible for blinding the mind of that person from receiving the knowledge of God. Take advantage of this awesome blessing and ministry of the Holy Spirit today.</p>

<p><em><strong>What? know ye not that your body is the  temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you,  which ye have of God, and ye are not  your own? (1 Corinthians 6:19).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 6:19</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the children of Israel transported the presence of God from place to place every time they carried the Tabernacle of Witness, which contained the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%208:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Kings 8:9</a>, the Bible tells us specifically that, <em>“There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.”</em> The only thing in the ark was God’s commandments.</p>
<p>Today, your heart is the ark of God; that’s where the Word is. Remember what the Lord said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2031:33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 31:33</a>: <em>“But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.”</em> This was fulfilled in us when we were born again.</p>
<p>We were born again by the Word of God and have become one with the Word; we’re living epistles, <em>“... written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>). Blessed be God!</p>
<p>You’re now the living ark of testimony and the tabernacle of His presence, <em>“…for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%206:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). He dwells in you now. His hands are in your hands, and His legs are in your legs. He walks in you and talks through you. </p>
<p>Where you go, God goes. You’re in Him and He’s in you! Not only are you now in the presence of God, you carry the presence of God. Every time you show up, you come with the presence of God. No wonder the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:27</a>, <em>“...Christ in you, the hope of glory!”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Keep your eyes on the LORD! You will shine like the sun and never blush with shame (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2034:5&amp;version=CEV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 34:5 CEV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever come out in the nighttime to look up at the stars? It’s such a beautiful sight to behold. But did you know that in the spirit, when you look down on the earth, the same way you see those stars up in the sky, that’s how you see stars of light in the earth? The difference is that these stars you see in the Spirit are us—God’s children.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 2:15</a>). Even though we’re all stars, we glow differently. Some of us glow strongly, while others may not shine as brightly.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 9:29</a>, the Bible says about Jesus, <em>“And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.”</em> There’s something about prayer that affects your spirit and causes it to glow.</p>
<p>Others may not see the glory all over you; their eyes may not be opened to see it on your face, but as you pray in the spirit, you’re constantly transfigured from glory to glory. It’s one of the reasons we emphasize praying in tongues.</p>
<p>When you pray in tongues often, the glory of God is revealed in your life as you charge yourself up in the spirit and stir up the power of God inside you.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, <em>“Let your light so shine…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 5:16</a>). This means you&#x27;re responsible for making your light glow more and more. The more you pray in the spirit, the stronger your light. That’s what enables you to do the work of God effectively, and keeps you healthy and strong. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 2:7</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Life is full of mysteries, unanswered questions, events and activities beyond human understanding. As Christians, our way of dealing with these mysteries is by speaking mysteries. Rather than wonder about negative circumstances, we cancel them by speaking spiritual mysteries.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 14:2</a>). When we pray in tongues, we’re uttering divine mysteries inspired by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>At such times, your spirit reaches into the realm of the spirit, just as the Bible says, <em>“Deep calleth unto deep…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2042:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 42:7</a>). Then <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:10-11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 2:10-11</a> says, <em>“…for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.”</em></p>
<p>These mysteries of the Spirit that are unknown to men are unveiled to us by the Holy Spirit: <em>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man&#x27;s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:12-13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 2:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>Notice that it says, <em>“...Which things also we speak, not in the words which man&#x27;s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth....”</em> Cultivate the habit of speaking in tongues often. As you do, you speak things into your future. You settle matters and take care of things in the realm of the spirit so that when the time of crisis comes, you just laugh your way through. </p>
<p>This is why God wants us to pray all the time in the spirit: <em>“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:18</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance  that thou stir up the gift of God, which  is in thee by the putting on of my hands  (2 Timothy 1:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Timothy 1:6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When Paul told Timothy to stir up the gift of God in him, he was referring to the power of the Holy Spirit—the dynamic ability to effect changes. This was the same power Jesus talked about when He said, <em>“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 1:8</a>).</p>
<p>If you’ve received the Holy Spirit, that power resides in you. That power can however be dormant unless activated, and the quickest way to activate it is by speaking in other tongues. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 14:4</a> says, <em>“He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself....”</em> As you speak in other tongues, not only are you building yourself, you’re also energizing yourself in the supernatural; you’re stirring up divine power from within to effect changes in every area of your life. </p>
<p>The glory of God is revealed in your life as you charge yourself up in the spirit and stir up the power of God inside you. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 3:16</a>, we see the Spirit’s desire for God’s people to be invigorated with miracle-working ability by the Holy Ghost; praying in tongues can make that happen for you.</p>
<p>Praying in other tongues also energizes your faith. The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jude 1:20</a>, <em>“But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost.”</em> Faith comes to you when you hear the Word of God. The more you hear the Word, the higher your faith goes. However, you sustain yourself at the highest peak of faith by praying in other tongues.</p>

<p><em><strong>...The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>James 5:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understand that prayer isn’t about getting God to do something for you. He’s done everything He would ever need to do for and about you in Christ Jesus. So, what does prayer do for you?</p>
<p>Prayer enables your spirit to operate at a level that’s beyond this world. It enables your spirit to get a hold of divine inspiration that helps you communicate at a realm that’s above this world. It helps you to function in union with Deity such that your spirit rises to God’s realm of operation, and then takes control of the situation.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re praying and asking the Lord for something that you desire. As you pray and trust God for it, the Holy Spirit quickens your spirit to incubate upon that situation with God’s Word. Suddenly, you’re enabled to see. It’s like “stepping on the mountaintop” from where you’re able to look at the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Another way to explain it is like you pulling yourself over a wall to look, and then you see the glory of God! When you pull yourself over that wall and your spirit takes a hold of the vision, suddenly, words will come from your spirit, and you’ll begin to declare, “I have it in the Name of Jesus!”</p>
<p>At this point, nothing in this world can change your mind from it because you’ve already seen it as you prayed. That’s what faith is about; it’s declaring that what you’ve hoped for has presently become yours because you’ve seen and taken a hold of it with your spirit.</p>
<p>After seeing and taking a hold of it in the spirit like that, what you saw could happen on your first day of prayer or in the first week. In some cases, it could even be months or years. But that’s why Jesus said in Luke 18:1 that men ought always to pray, and not to give up. Keep declaring that you have it, for your spirit has already taken possession of it. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Brethren, pray for us (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:25</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>

<p>In the book of Acts, the Bible tells us how King Herod had the Apostle James put to death by the sword (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2012:1-2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 12:1-2</a>). He found that this pleased the Jews and he apprehended Peter also with a plan to have him killed.</p>
<p>When James was arrested and killed, the church hadn’t understood the importance of intercession. Upon Peter’s arrest, however, they immediately realized that they had serious business to attend to. The Bible says <em>“… but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2012:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 12:5</a>). The church prayed without ceasing. They needed to have a change and they got it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wonder how many people pray for their pastors and leaders. It’s really important to do this. You have to pray for them because you need them. The Lord put them there to help you and train you in the things of the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul wrote in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 13:18</a>, <em>“Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.”</em> Why did he say, “Pray for us?” As you study more of the Scriptures, you’ll find there were 2 reasons.</p>
<p>The first reason was so that utterance would be given unto him to boldly make known the mystery of the Gospel (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:19</a>). The second reason was because the Church needed him. In praying and interceding for him, he would be retained for their benefit because he said, <em>“For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%201:23-24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 1:23-24</a>). </p>
<p>Imagine if Paul had passed on earlier than he did, with all the wonderful revelations God gave him. The world and the Church would have lost so much. They however prayed, and Paul gloriously finished his course.</p>
<p>That’s why he could say in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:26-27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 20:26-27</a>, <em>“Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men, for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.”</em> Glory to God! Pray for your pastors and leaders; it’s very important, because they’re gifts of God to you.</p>

<p>***According as his divine power hath  given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the  knowledge of him that hath called us to  glory and virtue (2 Peter 1:3). ***</p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath CALLED US TO GLORY AND VIRTUE (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Notice our underlined part in our theme verse; God has called us to glory and virtue. Virtue means excellence. He’s brought you into a life of glory and excellence. All you have to do to enjoy the life He&#x27;s given you is to live in His Word! That’s the key to living in your inheritance in Christ and enjoying life to the full.</p>
<p>There’s nothing the Lord hasn’t given you or done for you already. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:3</a> says, <em>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, <strong>who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ</strong>.”</em> He has already granted you every blessing you could ever imagine. This is in sync with what we read in our opening verse.</p>
<p>Your life, therefore, should be one of praise, glory and thanksgiving to the Lord every day, everywhere and at all times. He’s given you the transcendent life; the overcoming life that makes you superior to Satan, darkness, disease, sickness, failure, defeat and death; life that’s beyond this world!</p>
<p>This extraordinary life, along with righteousness, was delivered to you in Christ through the Gospel. His vicarious sacrifice in our behalf ushered us into the glory-life. The Bible tells us that the prophets of old testified of the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 1:11</a>). </p>
<p>Christ suffered so that you would live in the glory. You’re in that glory now. Blessed be God! If, for example, you’ve had problems in your physical body, regardless of what it is, use the Word against it. Declare that you’re triumphant always and in every place. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Peter 1:23</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 15:7</a>, Jesus said, <em>“If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you….”</em> When you received His Word, you received Him; remember, <em>“...the Word became flesh and dwelt among us...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:14 NKJV</a>). You were born again by this incorruptible Word of God as our theme scripture above states. You’re the offspring of the Word.</p>
<p>This tells us something: it means God’s Word on your lips is God at work in and through you. It’s the reason nothing is impossible unto you. Now that you have His life in you, you can make anything happen; your possibilities and potentials are limitless.</p>
<p>Irrespective of what you might be going through today, you can do something about your situation. Speak peace like Jesus did to the raging tempest (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:39&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 4:39</a>). Calm the storms around you with your faith-filled words. Address the contrary winds and waves that may be billowing against you and hush them to sleep.</p>
<p>The disciples of Jesus were so terrified when the winds became tempestuous. The Word, the Logos of God was right in the boat with them, yet they were afraid. Today, He’s not in the boat with you; He’s in you. When you speak the Word, He is manifested. So speak right now and you shall have what you say (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 11:23</a>). </p>

<p><em><strong>Then Nebuchadnezzar…said unto his  counsellors, Did not we cast three men  bound into the midst of the fire?… Lo, I  see four men loose, walking in the midst  of the fire, and they have no hurt; and  the form of the fourth is like the Son of  God (Daniel 3:24-25).</strong></em></p>

<p>The Bible tells us how Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were thrown into a fiery furnace. While in the furnace, they were unruffled. They didn’t even pray to God to bring them out of the fire. But guess what God did; instead of bringing them out of the fire, He joined them as the “fourth man in the fire.” I love that!</p>
<p>The Bible says there wasn’t even the smell of smoke on their skin let alone being burnt. God doesn’t have to bring you out of the fire. He already said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2043:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 43:2</a>, <em>“…when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.”</em></p>
<p>It makes no difference what pressures and obstacles you face in life; what’s important is that the Lord is with you and in you. He’s your peace in the midst of the storm. Is there a situation that has made you fret or given you sleepless nights? Relax. Jesus is your peace. </p>
<p>He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 16:33</a>, <em>“These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”</em> Can you see why you should never be flustered by the adversary or any adversity that comes your way? The Lord already gave you victory and dominion over Satan and everything he’s capable of.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:4</a> says, <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”</em> Be ever mindful that the greater One lives in you; therefore, nothing can hurt or limit you. Expunge fear from your life by filling your heart with God’s Word. Even now, declare, “Father, I thank you, for you live in me and are with me. Therefore, I’m invincible; I’m a success. I’m making progress and can do all things through Christ who is my strength. Amen.&quot;</p>

<p><em><strong>Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20104:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 104:4</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a difference between how angels related to people in the Old Testament and how they relate with us in the New Testament. In the Old Testament, they had authority over people to the point they could even punish some who did something wrong.</p>
<p>A simple example is the story of Zechariah, which, though in the New Testament section of the Bible, happened in the Old Testament period. An angel brought a message to Zechariah that he and his wife would have a child in their old age, John the Baptist.</p>
<p>Zechariah however failed to believe the words of the angel, and the angel punished Zechariah for his unbelief; he became dumb until John the Baptist was born (read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201:19-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 1:19-20</a>). But in the New Testament, the angels are our servants; they actually serve us. </p>
<p>The Bible says angels are <em>“… all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 1:14</a>). We’re the heirs of salvation. The angels are ministering spirits sent forth to minister for us, that is, on our behalf. In the Old Testament, angels ministered to them; in the New Testament, they minister for us.</p>
<p>This is wonderful! It shows how real and powerful our Lord Jesus is, because we function in His Name. In His Name, we give instructions and even angels obey. The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%203:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 3:22</a>: <em>“Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And he brought him forth abroad, and  said, Look now toward heaven, and tell  the stars, if thou be able to number them:  and he said unto him, So shall thy seed  be. And he believed in the LORD; and  he counted it to him for righteousness  (Genesis 15:5-6).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2015:5-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Genesis 15:5-6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In our opening scripture, God was giving Abraham a very important training on how to see with the eyes of faith. The Lord brought him out at night and told him to count the stars in the sky. Of course, they were too many. While still trying to count, God said to him, “So shall thy seed be.” He believed, and that was the moment he got it. God trained him to use his spiritual sense of sight. It was something spiritual. It means looking beyond your thinking, your mind and your environment; seeing with the eyes of faith. </p>
<p>On another occasion, after Lot separated from him, God said to him, <em>“...Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever</em>” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2013:14-15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 13:14-15</a>). </p>
<p>By this time, Abraham had understood how to use his spiritual sense of sight. Upon God’s instruction, he looked and saw the whole world, and God gave it to him. Just like Abraham, you have to practise seeing with your spirit. You have to have times when you just sit down and use your spiritual sight. </p>
<p>What you see in those moments is what you get. The Bible says, <em>“And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh … and your young men shall see visions…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 2:17</a>). Notice he says the young men shall see visions; what visions are you seeing even now? What pictures are being captured by your eyes of faith?</p>
<p>If it’s the wrong picture, shake it off. If you see pictures of fear, death, sickness, or failure, reject them! And then change your mind; change your thoughts; change the words that are coming to you. Realign yourself; refocus and look again; the right pictures will come. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God… (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 8:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>

<p>If you’re a child of God, it’s your divinely given right and ability to understand the Scriptures. Never agree with those who claim God is a mysterious God; He’s not a mystery to His children. </p>
<p>It’s one of Satan’s strategies to deceive God’s people and try to make them believe they couldn’t understand the Scriptures. Never agree with him. You have the understanding of the righteous. It is given to you to understand the Scriptures.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that God has given us a sound mind. So, you say, “I’m sound; my mind is sound. I’m alert. I have good understanding.” Don’t accept the devil’s lies that God’s Word and His ways are mysterious. Accept that you have an understanding mind. </p>
<p>The power is in accepting and declaring what God has said. So even if you’ve been having difficulties with your understanding of the Word, right now, say, “I have an understanding heart and mind,” and right away your understanding will open up.</p>
<p>Part of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life is to help you understand the Scriptures. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:26</a>, Jesus said, <em>“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”</em></p>
<p>The Bible also tells us how He breathed on His disciples and said, <em>“...Receive ye the Holy Ghost”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 20:22</a>), thus opening their minds to understand the Scriptures (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024:45&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 24:45</a>). That’s a miracle, and that same miracle happened to you when you received the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><em><strong>…giving joyful thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of his holy people in the kingdom of light (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:12&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 1:12 NIV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>You’re the seed of Abraham, and the whole world belongs to you. Only a Christian who’s ignorant of this will live a beggarly life. God said, <em>“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%204:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hosea 4:6</a>).</p>
<p>It’s like someone who goes to an event with an all-access ticket yet stops at the gate to plead with the organizers to be allowed in. With your ticket, you don’t need to beg; just walk in and enjoy the party! It’s all about the ticket.</p>
<p>Jesus is your ticket to a boundless inheritance. The Amplified Classic describes it as unsearchable riches— wealth untold which no human being can search out (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 3:8</a>). He qualified you for the inheritance. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Then He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 16:23</a>, <em>“...Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.”</em> In other words, not only did He qualify you to be a partaker of His glorious inheritance, He’s saying, “Use my name!” That’s your ticket to enjoy all that’s been granted you in Christ. </p>
<p>Part of that inheritance is sound health. The Bible says, <em>“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=3%20John%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 John 1:2</a>). He wants you to prosper financially and be healthy enough to enjoy your wealth. How wonderful that is!</p>
<p>Wake up to this reality and say to yourself, “I’ll always be healthy, prosperous and sound. It’s part of my inheritance in Christ.&quot; Even if your parents didn’t leave you any inheritance, Jesus gave you one that’s incorruptible, and the inheritance in Christ Jesus is greater. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>The decision is announced by messengers, the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth... (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%204:17&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Daniel 4:17 NIV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In many nations around the world, Christians are being attacked every day. In fact, in some cities, they stand the risk of being jailed or deregistered for speaking about Jesus. For this reason, some churches today are afraid to speak boldly. Even when they speak, they’re mindful of what they say so they don’t offend the “authorities.” </p>
<p>No; as long as you’re proclaiming the truth of God’s Word, be bold. Don’t keep quiet. Declare boldly before anyone the truth that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, meaning God in the flesh. He’s the way, the truth and the life, and no one can come into a relationship with God except by Him (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:6</a>). </p>
<p>“But Pastor Chris, the law in my country forbids us from making such a claim,” someone may say. But the question is, where are you from? The one we’re talking about, Jesus Christ, rules in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth. He’s the Monarch of the Universe. His Word is law. So who would you rather obey?</p>
<p>The authorities in your country and in every country are subject to Him. The Bible says Jesus occupies the place of supreme honour in Heaven—a place that is infinitely superior to any conceivable command, authority, power, control or government. He bears a Name that’s far beyond any name that could ever be used in this world or the world to come.</p>
<p>Jesus rules; Heaven rules and the whole world must acknowledge it. The Bible tells us something remarkable Daniel said while interpreting King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream about a great tree that was felled. He said, <em>“The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%204:26&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 4:26 NIV</a>). Did you see that? Heaven rules! Even King Nebuchadnezzar, the king over all the nations at the time, had to learn a lesson that the heavens ruled, not him. </p>
<p>Don’t think the mayor of your city or the president of your country is the one ruling; you represent heaven, and heaven rules.</p>

<p><em><strong>And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Jude 1:6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206:1-4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 6:1-4</a> recounts how in the early days, entities described as the &quot;sons of God&quot; intermingled with humans: <em>“That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 6:2</a>).</p>
<p>The &quot;sons of God&quot; as used in this context were angels who had left their calling and estate, and used their bodies for evil things; they mated with humans and produced giant offsprings. Jude, by the Spirit, revealed what eventually happened to these angels: <em>“And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jude 1:6</a>). </p>
<p>God imprisoned these disobedient angels to prevent them from continuing in their wickedness. However, the offspring of these unions roamed the earth with insatiable appetites and a propensity for unrestrained evil. These physical giants built cities, and consumed vegetation at an alarming rate, such that it took a lot to sustain them.</p>
<p>But as they died, their spirits—which were not human spirits but demons—went to hell and punished those in hell because their legal condemnation was not yet established. And because they haven’t been permanently put in hell, they moved in and out of hell as they chose, and also ran rampage in the earth, carrying out evil activities.</p>
<p>Our world still contends with these spiritual free radicals today; demons that influence human affairs and perpetuate evil. But thanks be unto God; we have the authority in the Name of Jesus to dislodge and dispossess them of their hold and sway over nations and the lives of men. </p>
<p>Every so often, use the Name of Jesus against them and put a stop to the works of these demoniacal entities. Forbid them from influencing things in your life, in your home, in your environment, city and nation. Cast them out in the Name of Jesus! Once you do, the hearts of many in those regions will become open to receive the Gospel gladly and heed the call to salvation, and righteousness will prevail. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun  go down upon your wrath (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 4:26</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you noticed how some infants sometimes exhibit signs of anger? Unfortunately, some individuals carry this unchecked anger into adulthood. It is crucial to acknowledge and conquer unrestrained anger that may have been acquired during early life.</p>
<p>It brings to mind the story of Moses in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2020&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 20.</a> When the children of Israel were thirsty for water in the wilderness, they cried to Moses. When Moses spoke to the Lord about it, He instructed Moses to speak to the rock before the children of Israel and water would come out (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2020:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 20:8</a>).</p>
<p>The instruction was for Moses to speak to the rock to give them water; he wasn’t to strike it. But out of anger, and frustration due to the people&#x27;s complaints, he struck the rock instead. The Bible says, <em>“And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2020:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 20:12</a>).</p>
<p>Yes, water gushed forth, but the consequence was dire: God declared that Moses would not enter the Promised Land. This story gives a poignant example of how uncontrolled emotions can impede one&#x27;s journey. Moses allowed his anger to govern his actions, and his unbridled anger prevented him from entering the Promised Land. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:20</a> says, &quot;<em>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.&quot;</em> Your anger will never produce God&#x27;s righteousness; it’ll lead to actions contrary to God&#x27;s will. Anger causes people to take actions they otherwise wouldn’t have taken, and by the time they recollect, it might be too late. </p>
<p>Therefore, conquer anger with the Word. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:26-27&amp;version=TLB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:26-27 TLB</a> says, <em>“If you are angry, don’t sin by nursing your grudge. Don’t let the sun go down with you still angry—get over it quickly; for when you are angry, you give a mighty foothold to the devil.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit  he taketh away: and every branch that  beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may  bring forth more fruit. Now ye are clean  through the word which I have spoken  unto you (John 15:2-3).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.

<p>There’s no better way to purify God’s people than sharing the Word with them. Just share the Word of God. A pastor, for instance, could be concerned that some people in the church might not be living right. What he needs to do is to keep speaking and teaching the Word of God, and the people will be cleansed.</p>
<p>Notice that Jesus said, “You’re clean through the Word that I have spoken unto you.” As they hear the Word, it’ll purge their spirits and cleanse them. The Word has that sanctifying power. The Bible says, <em>“Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:25-26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:25-26</a>).</p>
<p>The Word of God washes. That’s why, when people come to church and listen to the Word, they feel like they’re in the best place ever. As they listened to the Word of God, it purified them. That’s what the Word of God does to your spirit.</p>
<p>That’s why when the true Word of God is taught in a local assembly, people will always come to hear that message that purifies, empowers and inspires them. It will even propel them to become soul winners, for the Word makes them fishers of men as He did the disciples (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 4:19</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>And God said…I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy and loving-kindness on whom I will show mercy and loving-kindness (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2033:19&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Exodus 33:19 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Isn’t the Lord wonderful? When He chooses to bless and favour you, there’s nothing anybody can do about it. David recognised this and said, <em>“Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chronicles%2028:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Chronicles 28:4</a>). </p>
<p>The Lord chose David above all his family members, yet David had nothing to do with it. He wasn’t the first son, neither was he the second, but the Lord loved him and chose him. God hasn’t changed; He still chooses to favour people today, and He’s chosen to favour you. It’s nobody’s job to question His choice. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20102:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 102:13</a> says, <em>“Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.”</em> Not only is it God’s choice, it’s also His set time to favour you. Believe this. Paul, writing to Timothy, said: <em>“Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus</em>” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 2:1</a>). </p>
<p>That’s what you ought to do; take advantage of the grace that’s in Christ Jesus. He likes you and He&#x27;s favourably disposed towards you; be conscious of it. You can get that job or promotion that you desire. You can rebuke that ailment from your body. The Bible says it’s by His grace, not of works lest any man should boast (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:8-9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>There’s grace for you from God for whatever you require right now: <em>“And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>***All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord;  and thy saints shall bless thee. They  shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom,  and talk of thy power; To make known to  the sons of men his mighty acts, and the  glorious majesty of his kingdom  (Psalm 145:10-12). ***</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee. They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power; To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20145:10-12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 145:10-12</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening verse tells us something striking about God’s Kingdom that we’re a part of: it’s a Kingdom with glory and power! A word I’d like to elaborate on is “glory.” The Bible says God’s saints shall speak of His glory. It also says they’ll make known the glorious majesty of His Kingdom. But what does glory mean?</p>
<p>Many times, people use the term “glory” without knowing what it really means. Glory is that which inspires, produces or causes honour. When something happens and that thing causes you to give honour, admiration and respect to another, that thing is said to be glorious.</p>
<p>Therefore, to say a meeting was glorious means that it inspired people to worship the Lord; they were inspired to praise Him. The meeting caused the attendees to respond in honour of God.</p>
<p>When Jesus turned water to wine at a wedding ceremony, the Bible says, <em>“This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 2:11</a>). When they saw what He did by turning water to wine, they were amazed. He manifested forth His glory, and His disciples believed in Him. They honoured and revered Him.</p>
<p>Now, you can understand when the Bible says, <em>“They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20145:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 145:11</a>). What’s in the Kingdom of God that we’re talking about? It’s a kingdom where sickness isn’t real, where defeat doesn’t exist; it’s a kingdom where life and immortality reign.</p>
<p>This is the Kingdom of God that we’re born into in Christ. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:9 (AMPC)</a> says, <em>“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God&#x27;s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”</em> As you walk in the light of who you are in Christ, you’re showing forth the glory of the Kingdom.</p>

<p><em><strong>But if we walk in the light, as he is in  the light, we have fellowship one with  another, and the blood of Jesus Christ  his Son cleanseth us from all sin  (1 John 1:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 1:7</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>I love the Word of God, because living according to what it says takes the stress out of your life. It takes the struggle out of Christianity. Think about what we just read in our opening scripture; it simply means there’s no need for you to be sin-conscious because in Christ you’re constantly purified.</p>
<p>All you have to do is walk in the light as He is in the light. He says as you do, the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from all sin. It’s automatic cleansing. Notice He didn’t say you should pray for the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse you from sin. He says, “The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin,” meaning that it happens without you asking. It’s a constant purification process.</p>
<p>Why is this necessary? It’s because the world around us is smothered in sin and darkness. However, by walking in the light, all your errors, mistakes, and missteps that you didn&#x27;t even know about are cleansed. So be sure that you’re functioning or walking in His light; His light is His Word.</p>
<p>Remember what Jesus said, <em>“Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 15:3</a>). His Word is a cleanser; it purifies. If you’ve been born again and still find yourself praying the prayer of salvation every week, that’ll be because you’re looking at yourself under a different light that’s showing you that something is wrong. </p>
<p>See yourself under God’s light. His light shows that you’re the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. See yourself thus and walk accordingly. God’s light is God’s Truth, and God’s Truth is God’s Word. To walk in the light therefore means to walk in the Word of God which purifies your soul and purges your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>…And if any man sin, we have an  advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ  the righteous (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 2:1</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Some have said that since Jesus went to heaven, He’s been begging the Father on our behalf to have mercy on us and forgive us our sins. That’s absolutely absurd. If that’s what He’s been doing since He ascended to heaven, why then did He come to die for our sins in the first place?</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is our advocate, but with the Father. He’s our advocate on the Father’s side. He’s not bringing arguments to the Father in order to convince the Father not to punish us; no! He’s the Father’s lawyer, appointed by the Father on our behalf.</p>
<p>He’s the one who helps us insist on what belongs to us. He sees to it that we walk in the vital reality of all that His death, burial and resurrection consummated for us. The Father isn’t against us; rather, He &quot;employed&quot; Jesus as our lawyer against our accusers. </p>
<p>Imagine you have a case where an accuser is charging you with an offence, and your dad hires the best lawyer to represent you. Jesus Christ is that lawyer; He’s not defending you from the Father’s wrath, for God isn’t your accuser. We’re not appointed to wrath: <em>“For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>).</p>
<p>It’s the devil who accuses God’s people (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 12:10</a>). But the Father got Jesus as your advocate. But did you know the Holy Spirit is also your advocate? Yes, He is. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:16</a>, Jesus said, <em>“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter….”</em></p>
<p>The Amplified Classic gives us six synonyms of the word “Comforter” translated from the Greek “Parakletos”, and one of them is “Advocate.” The Holy Spirit is your advocate—counsel for the defence. He doesn’t just watch from the background as we grapple with forces and circumstances that assail us; He comes right into the middle of the heat and takes charge with us. He engages our adversaries.</p>
<p>Never forget this: Jesus is our advocate with the Father, while the Holy Spirit is the Father&#x27;s advocate with us. So, there&#x27;s one advocate in heaven, and there&#x27;s another one here on earth in us and with us. How can we lose? How could we ever be disadvantaged? It&#x27;s impossible. </p>

<p><em><strong>Beloved, now are we the sons of God,  and it doth not yet appear what we shall  be: but we know that, when he shall  appear, we shall be like him; for we shall  see him as he is (1 John 3:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 3:2</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When you read this epistle of John, you have to be careful to read everything; otherwise, you may conclude that there are contradictions. For example, in our opening verse, the epistle says, <em>“…it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.”</em> This therefore means we’re not yet like Him.</p>
<p>But when you go right to the next chapter, the Bible says, <em>“Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:17</a>). I thought we just read that we shall be like Him later when He appears? But here, it says we’re like Him in this world now; we’re just as He is. Is this a contradiction? No, it&#x27;s not.</p>
<p>The first one is about your appearance, your outward appearance. Look at it again, “Beloved, now are we the sons of God….” We’re already the sons of God in our spirits. The Bible says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).</p>
<p>That recreation took place in your spirit when you were born again. You were born of the Word of God and with the life of God. So, he says, “now are we the sons of God.” Now, your spirit is like Him, but your physical appearance isn’t like Him yet.</p>
<p>So when it says, <em>“…it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is,”</em> he’s referring to the Rapture where, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, we shall be changed. We will be clothed with our celestial bodies, and we shall be like Him in appearance. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Observe that <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:17</a> says, “as He is...,” not “as He was.” We’re like Him now, not as He was before His death. When He was raised from the dead, we were raised together with Him, and we came alive with a new kind of life: the resurrection life. So, as He is now, the glorified Son of God, so are we in this world! </p>

<p><em><strong>The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2020:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Proverbs 20:27</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>As God’s children, we’re never in the dark about anything. You can know anything because the light of God is in your spirit. The Lord Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:12</a>, <em>“...I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”</em> </p>
<p>You’re not supposed to walk in darkness about your finances, your health, your career, business, and ministry or in any area of your life. If you ever find yourself in a situation where it seems you’re at a loss for answers concerning a situation, speak in tongues.</p>
<p>As you speak in tongues, the mystery about that situation will come to your understanding. If you have concerns about your health, don’t just run to the doctors or places you think you might find help. Consult with the Holy Spirit first; you’ll be amazed how quickly His light and wisdom will well up within you, showing you precisely what to do.</p>
<p>He’s in you to help you understand certain things about yourself and about life. He’ll show you the future and guide you to take specific steps in line with His plans for your life. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 16:13</a> says, <em>“Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.”</em> Learn to follow His light and guidance from within you.</p>

<p><em><strong>Stand therefore, having your loins  girt about with truth, and having on  the breastplate of righteousness; And  your feet shod with the preparation of  the gospel of peace; Above all, taking  the shield of faith…and the sword of  the Spirit, which is the word of God  (Ephesians 6:14-17).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em>Stand therefore, <strong>having your loins girt about with truth</strong>, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; And <strong>your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace</strong>; Above all, taking the shield of faith…and <strong>the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God</strong> (</em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:14-17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ephesians 6:14-17</em></a><em>).</em></p>
<p>Observe the underlined portions of our theme scripture; they all have to do with using the Word of God. Was this just a repetition or do they refer to different things? These are actually different things. Let’s start with truth. Truth refers to the whole counsel of God.</p>
<p>Jesus said concerning the Word of God, <em>“… thy word is truth”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:17</a>). Truth is what God has said concerning you, the world, the past, the present, the future, and anything else about life, about death, the spiritual, and the material. This means God holds the truth about anything and everything.</p>
<p>Number two is the Gospel of peace. The Bible says <em>“How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace… that publisheth salvation…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2052:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 52:7</a>). The Gospel of peace therefore refers to the message of salvation.</p>
<p>Now, the whole Word of God isn’t necessarily about salvation, but it points to it. This means the message of salvation is a part of that body of Truth because after salvation, there’s still a life to live. So, what we’re dealing with here is the preparation of the Gospel. It says, <em>“... your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace...”</em>; meaning that God is sending you with the message of salvation.</p>
<p>Then the third one is <em>“...the sword of the spirit, which is the Word of God.”</em> This isn’t just the Word revealed and kept within your spirit; it’s dealing with the spoken Word, the “Rhema” of God—God’s Word on your lips. It’s called the sword of the Spirit because it’s for combat. </p>
<p>As long as the Word is inside you, that’s Truth; you’re keeping the Truth in you, which is wonderful. Then the preaching of the Gospel saves, heals and delivers, but there’s a “war.” And the sword of the Spirit, which is the spoken Word of God, is your offensive weapon against the adversary. Therefore, speak the Word always and keep the enemy subdued. Hallelujah!</p>
