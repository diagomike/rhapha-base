<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly (Proverbs 20:27).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Old Testament, God gave Israel the tabernacle, which He divided into three parts. The first was the inner sanctuary, where the Ark of God was. It was also called the Holy of Holies or the Most Holy Place. The second part was the outer sanctuary, which was called the Holy Place. The third part of the tabernacle was the outer court, where the brazen altar and laver were.</p>
<p>This tabernacle of Moses gives us the picture of the human person: the spirit, soul, and body. Man’s body is the outer court, the soul is the first sanctuary, while the spirit is the inner sanctuary.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit resides in the inner sanctuary, which is the recreated human spirit. When a man is born again, his spirit is recreated; eternal life is imparted to his spirit and right away, the Ark of God is set up there. What was in the Ark in the Old Testament? It was the Word of God written on two tablets of stone (1 Kings 8:9, 2 Chronicles 5:10).</p>
<p>Where is the Word of God today? It’s in our hearts, our spirits. The Lord said, <em>“...this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts...&quot;</em> (Hebrews 8:10). No wonder Paul said we’re the words of Christ written by the Spirit, not on tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart (2 Corinthians 3:3).</p>
<p>This shows us the importance of the human spirit. That’s where the Word of God is today. That’s where God lives. Being born again is the recreation of the inward man—the human spirit—to become God’s dwelling place; His holy tabernacle. The premium, therefore, must be on the education of your spirit, which is only achievable by receiving and meditating on the Word of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint (Luke 18:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone once said, “I have so much to do in very little time; it leaves me with very little time to pray. So, in the mornings, I pray for only five minutes because I always have a busy day.” That’s a big mistake.</p>
<p>Never skip or reduce your times of fellowship with the Lord for other things you might consider “important.” The wisdom, guidance and strength you need for success comes from the Lord. Always remember that.</p>
<p>When you have so much to do, that’s when you need to pray. In fact, you’ll need to pray more at such times because you require spiritual help to achieve results in a shorter time and in the best way. Instead of feeling too busy to pray, a wise person will say, “I have so much work to do that I’ll need to give more time to prayer.” You receive a boost in your energy and inspiration, which will give you speed.</p>
<p>Jesus said men ought always to pray and not to give up (Luke 18:1), letting us know that we were made to pray. It’s something God built within the human system. In other words, there’ll always be the need for that spiritual fellowship with God.</p>
<p>Through such fellowship, we can be built, encouraged, directed and obtain the Lord’s mercy, grace and intervention in our circumstances. Not only should you desire to pray, you should pray always. We don’t pray just because we require a miracle; we pray because we’re in a loving relationship with a real loving heavenly Father.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints (Ephesians 6:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To pray always means to be in constant communication and fellowship with the Lord; it’s always ongoing. That’s what the Lord instructs us to do; He wants us in fellowship with Him all the time. It’s a continual communication of spiritual intelligence, where information is constantly being given to us to put us at an advantage.</p>
<p>The Amplified Classic version of our opening verse reads, <em>“Pray at all times (on every occasion, in every season) in the Spirit, with all [manner of] prayer and entreaty....”</em> Praying in the Spirit, therefore, becomes the accompaniment for all other kinds of prayer. Whether it’s the prayer of faith, the prayer of intercession—whatever kind of prayer it is—praying in the Spirit should be part of it.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14:14-15, Paul said, <em>“For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.”</em> This shows that praying in the spirit is a priority. From the Spirit, you’ll know what words to use. Your tongue will be arranged and inspired to say the right things.</p>
<p>As you go out to win souls, you may not know what you’re going to say right away, but pray in the Spirit first, and He’ll give you the right words. You&#x27;ll say things that are consistent with His divine purpose, because you’re in timely fellowship with Him, through the Spirit.</p>
<p>It reminds of what Jesus said in Matthew 10:19-20: <em>&quot;But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.&quot;</em> Hallelujah! Therefore, make it a habit to always pray in the spirit, and with the Spirit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope (Romans 15:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When studying the Bible, be diligent to observe principles, samples and patterns. As you read about the amazing life of the fathers, prophets and apostles, you’ll see samples of faith, and how they framed the course of their lives with the Word. 1 Corinthians 10:11 says, <em>“Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.”</em></p>
<p>The use of the word, “ensamples” in the King James isn’t exactly the same thing as “example”; it actually means “samples.” A sample is a specimen, an original that&#x27;s shown to you, like you say, “This is what it’s supposed to be.” It’s like a pattern or print given to you.</p>
<p>Hebrews 11 gives us a pattern. The Bible says, <em>“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report”</em> (Hebrews 11:1-2). When you read further, you’ll be inspired by the extraordinary feats of these great men and women of faith: what their faith accomplished for the kingdom of God (Hebrews 11:32-33).</p>
<p>These champions of faith subdued kingdoms and did wondrous things in their time; they ruled their world! That’s not all! Hebrews 11:3 says, <em>“Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.”</em> In other words, the various eras were framed by the Word of God (the &quot;Rhema&quot; of God). The use of the Greek, &quot;Rhema&quot; here indicates that the Word of God referred to was spoken through the lips of men.</p>
<p>It’s vital to note in this verse that God didn’t frame the “aions”; rather, through faith, the world’s systems—with respect to socio-economic structures and environmental management—were programmed through God’s Word that came out of these men and women of faith. Hallelujah! It shows what you can do today: you can frame things in your life and in your world to synchronize with God’s perfect will by speaking forth God’s Word.</p>

<p><em><strong>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report (Hebrews 11:1-2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How would you like to have a good report from God? Our opening verse says through faith, the elders in our spiritual family obtained a good report from God. If you want to be celebrated by God, if you want to have praise of Him, it’s got to be through your actions of faith. No wonder He says, <em>“But without faith it is impossible to please him…”</em> (Hebrews 11:6).</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God”</em> (Hebrews 11:8-10). As a result, James 2:23 says, <em>“…Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.”</em></p>
<p>How about Enoch? Genesis 5:24 says, <em>“And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.”</em> Hebrews 11:5 tells us more; it says, <em>“By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Read about all the other heroes of faith in Hebrews 11; the likes of Abel, Noah, Samuel, Isaac, Sarah, Joseph, Moses, Barak, Samson, etc. The Bible says they all obtained a good report through faith. However, we notice something striking that the Bible tells us: they didn’t receive the promise, because God provided something better for us: <em>“These were the true heroes, commended for their faith, yet they lived in hope without receiving the fullness of what was promised them. But now God has invited us to live in something better than what they had—faith’s fullness...”</em> (Hebrews 11:39-40 TPT).</p>
<p>Thus, we have no excuse; every day, give expression to your faith. Live the faith life. Practise God’s Word, for faith is acting on the Word! That’s the way to obtain a good report from God and walk in the glory and blessings of Christ.</p>

<p><em><strong>NOW FAITH is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of their reality [faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses] (Hebrews 11:1 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope is usually in the future, something you look forward to or desire in front of you. It’s a picture or an image of a desired future; a picture of a future accomplishment, possession or fulfilment. Faith, however, is the essence of hope. In other words, until you hope, that image or picture has no life. That&#x27;s why hope is so important.</p>
<p>Hope is powerful. When people become hopeless, they could give up, and die. But once you have hope, then the thing you’re hoping for suddenly becomes a possibility; you see that it exists.</p>
<p>Hope is like “potential energy”; which means it’s a possibility that could be realized if you could “look” at it with your spirit, because that&#x27;s when it becomes real. This is why hope must translate to faith for it to produce results. With hope, you see the blessings that could result from acting on God’s Word. But with faith, you take possession, you walk in the blessing. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God… (Hebrews 11:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Genesis chapter one shows us how God created all things; it was through words. He spoke, and everything He said, became. That’s because speech (words) create sound waves—energy. This is one reason why meditating on the Word is so important.</p>
<p>Meditation has three phases or levels. Level one is when you speak under your voice. Then in the second level, you’re literally talking or muttering. The third and final level is when you shout or roar; you’re talking aloud. This final phase is so important because of the power of sound or energy of words.</p>
<p>This is why when you read scriptures, you should oftentimes read them aloud. Read your Rhapsody of Realities aloud, including the prayers and confessions. Your affirmation of the Word is very important. God gave us a tongue so we could talk, and when you talk, energy is released.</p>
<p>Through the energy of words, God recreated and brought order to the world, which hitherto was a chaotic mass (Genesis 1). Ephesians 5:1 tells us to emulate Him as His beloved children. What God did in Genesis 1 was for us to emulate. With words, you’re to maintain the beauty and glory of your life, and change circumstances and situations in line with God’s will. By your words, you can chart your course in victory and success.</p>
<p>Jesus said you shall have what you say (Mark 11:23); so don’t keep quiet. There&#x27;s a reason for speaking. Even the very principle of salvation stresses the importance of speaking. It says, <em>“For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation”</em> (Romans 10:10). Confession here means, &quot;saying what God has said in agreement with Him.&quot; It’s translated from the Greek word &quot;Homologeo&quot;— which primarily means to say the same thing as another in agreement. That’s what makes His Word effectual in your life.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s not enough to “believe” the Word of God with your heart; you have to declare it with your mouth to experience the blessings therein. The Bible says Christ is your life. Christ is your wisdom. Christ is your righteousness. Christ in you, the hope of glory. For the rest of today, meditate on these truths about Christ, saying them aloud every so often.</p>

<p><em><strong>Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest (Joshua 1:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was a teenager, I engaged the Spirit of God on several issues. I didn&#x27;t want to live my life dabbling into different things, guessing and trying to figure out God’s purpose for my life. I wanted to know exactly where to go, what to do, and how to set my sail. I wanted to know God’s direction for my life, because I figured since He already knew my future, there wasn&#x27;t anything wrong with my asking Him.</p>
<p>Guess what? He directed my mind and my spirit to His Word. He said to me, “My Word is your compass; it illuminates your path. If you follow my Word, you’ll never lose your way; you’ll prosper in all that you do.” That’s what He said to Joshua in our theme scripture.</p>
<p>Psalm 119:105 says, <em>“Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.”</em> The Lord Jesus said in John 8:12, <em>“…I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”</em> He is the Word. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Set your focus on the Word and you&#x27;ll never fail: <em>“This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night… for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success”</em> (Joshua 1:8). God’s Word is absolute truth; you can depend absolutely on it.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid to believe God and stay on His Word. You can&#x27;t do that and make a mistake or regret it. Those who regret following God&#x27;s Word never really knew the Word; they weren’t following the Word but the desires of their own hearts. When you go for the Word, you stay focused no matter what tries to distract you. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth (Mark 9:23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Kingdom of God, in the realm of the supernatural, are infinite possibilities. That’s the realm in which we live; that’s the realm into which we were born. There’s no limit to your success. Hallelujah! Jesus said in our opening scripture, “All things are possible to him that believes.”</p>
<p>The Bible says in Romans 10: “With the heart (spirit) man believes”; your spirit has the capacity for infinite possibilities. When your spirit takes a hold of God’s Word, there&#x27;s no telling what you can do; there&#x27;s no telling what you could be; there’s no telling what you could have!</p>
<p>If you&#x27;d only believe, there’ll be a complete metamorphosis of your life. It doesn&#x27;t matter what limits have been placed on you; whether from your family, your friends, your location, your job, or your training—it makes no difference—you’re open to infinite possibilities. If you can only believe!</p>
<p>Dare to believe God. Dare to believe and act on His Word, and your path in life will be one of endless progress, victories and prosperity. Every so often, declare, “I go above and beyond the limits in the Name of Jesus. All things are possible to me. I have ability for all things. Amen.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Word” in our opening scripture above is the Greek, “Logos.” It describes God&#x27;s Word presented to us as His opinions, thoughts, ideas, doctrines, treatise, accounts, wisdom, knowledge, plans and purposes. Thus, our knowledge and understanding of the Word is so crucial.</p>
<p>When God speaks His Word to you, even if all He says to you is, “Go ye therefore”; that phrase will guide and guard your life in everything. That’s because all of Him and all that He represents are in His Word (the divine logos). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This Logos of God made all things: <em>“The same was in the beginning with God; All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made”</em> (John 1:2-3). Suddenly, we observe that the Apostle John gives a personality to the Logos of God; he uses the personal pronoun “Him,” instead of “it.” Then in verse 14, it becomes even clearer; it says, <em>“And the Word was made (became) flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth”</em> (John 1:14).</p>
<p>Imagine all of God&#x27;s ideas, all of God&#x27;s knowledge, all of God&#x27;s wisdom, all of who He is: in personality, in quality, all of His ability to perceive—all of that in the divine Logos—became flesh and dwelt among us. This is Jesus! The Word that was spoken, which was “speech,” became a man; took on humanity!</p>
<p>Jesus is the divine Logos. When they saw Him in Bible days, as He walked by, they saw the totality of the mind of God. He was the totality of the will of the Father. He was God&#x27;s message in flesh. John said, “We beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth!” Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works (Psalm 105:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the great men or women of God you find in the Bible were singers of the Lord’s praise. No wonder they lived an extraordinarily victorious life in every way. It’s time for us to learn to praise and sing unto the Lord Most High; we’re to sing songs of the Spirit, for we’re singers of His praise!</p>
<p>For example, after crossing the Red Sea and witnessing how the Egyptian warlords perished in it, Moses broke out in songs of praise: <em>“…I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously…The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father&#x27;s God, and I will exalt him. The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name”</em> (Exodus 15:1-3).</p>
<p>When the Israelites fought against King Jabin and destroyed him, Deborah and Barak sang to the Lord with these beautiful words: <em>“Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel…Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel”</em> (Judges 5:2-3). </p>
<p>How about Miriam’s poetic acknowledgement of Israel’s miraculous deliverance from the charging Egyptians: <em>“…Sing to the LORD, because he has won a glorious victory; he has thrown the horses and their riders into the sea”</em> (Exodus 15:21 GNB).</p>
<p>Over in the New Testament, we read the prophetic utterance about Jesus that says, <em>“...in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee”</em> (Hebrews 2:12). The prophetic utterance about Jesus declares that He would sing praises to the Lord in the midst of the church, among His brethren. And He did. Hallelujah! The night before He was betrayed, after He had served His disciples the Holy Communion, the Bible says,  <em>“They sang a hymn and went directly to Mount Olives”</em> (Matthew 26:30 MSG). Then in Luke 10:21, He did something beautiful: He sang a psalm. Psalms are spiritual songs. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it (Proverbs 22:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a very young age, through inspiring Bible stories, first from home, and then the children&#x27;s church, I began to learn about faithful Bible characters and the things to emulate from them. For example, I learnt of Samson, a legendary Israelite and a Nazarite from birth; a warrior and judge, renowned for his prodigious strength. He led and rescued the people of Israel from Philistine oppression (Judges 13–16).</p>
<p>Also is the amazing story of David and his decapitation of the belligerent Goliath of Gath who terrorized the children of Israel. David won the victory for Israel and brought the fear of Jehovah upon the Philistines (1 Samuel 17:20-58).</p>
<p>The story of Mordecai and Esther was also very inspiring to me. I read how they championed the course of the Jews amidst the threat of complete annihilation by Haman, a sworn enemy of God’s people (Esther 3:5-6). These stories of the prophets and apostles in the Bible helped to shape my mindset and character as I was growing up. Most of all was the God-evincing life of Jesus.</p>
<p>I was able to quickly distinguish the right role models in the Bible in my formative years. This is why it’s important to train children in the way they should go; get them exposed early to God’s Word and the right Bible characters.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you (James 4:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Satan never plays fair; so you have to always be on the offensive against him. Our opening scripture says to resist him; but how do you resist him? It’s with the Word—the Sword of the Spirit. Don’t think the devil is sleeping; he’s not! The Bible says he prowls to and fro like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8).</p>
<p>Don’t wait for his fiery darts before putting him in check. What the devil likes to do is to get your attention, so that you&#x27;re always on the defensive, fighting to get your peace back, to get your health and strength back, or to get things back to normal; ever fighting to restore something; no! Don’t let yourself be hemmed in such a position.</p>
<p>While with your faith you’re neutralizing all the fiery darts Satan throws at you, always be on the offensive with the “Rhema” of God in your mouth. In Ephesians 6:10-16, the Apostle Paul gave a list of the protective part of our armour. Then in the 17th verse, he gave the only offensive tool: “the sword of the Spirit,” which is the “Rhema” of God.</p>
<p>Rhema is Greek for the &quot;spoken word.&quot; In this case, it’s your proclamation of the inspired Word of God for the hour and the season. It’s always a word said, or a word in saying; otherwise, it’s not a sword; it’s not a weapon. Always put the Word on your lips; that’s what you use to discomfit the enemy and all adversities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing (Zephaniah 3:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our opening scripture lets us know that God’s might, His power of deliverance, is activated through singing. There’re many problems that some Christians go through, but if they’d apply this scripture, they’ll experience great victories. The Spirit of God responds to singing, and He’ll save you from trouble with rejoicing.</p>
<p>Throughout history, great victories have been wrought because God’s people sang. Think about it: In 2 Chronicles 20, Judah was surrounded and completely outnumbered by three enemy nations that were ready to attack them— Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir.</p>
<p>When the king was informed, he didn’t first consult with his army generals. He gathered all Judah to seek the Lord in prayer and fasting, and God said through a prophetic message, <em>“…fear not, nor be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you”</em> (2 Chronicles 20:17).</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat then appointed singers and placed them ahead of the army to praise the Lord. But here’s what I want you to observe: He gave them a simple Psalm to sing; just a short phrase. They sang, <em>“...Praise the LORD, For His mercy endures forever”</em> (2 Chronicles 20:21). Then, the Lord confused the enemy’s camp, causing them to turn their swords against one another until they completely destroyed one another. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>In Acts 16, Paul and Silas were falsely accused and incarcerated. But <em>“…at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed”</em> (Acts 16:25-26).</p>
<p>They didn’t ask God for deliverance; they only sang praises to God. They knew that if they’d praise the Lord, His power would be activated for their deliverance. In both examples we saw in the Scriptures, their salvation came, not before they would praise, but as they praised the Lord. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>When there’s trouble, when it seems the odds are against you, when there’s heat from every side, sing praises to God! Activate His power through songs of praise. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name (Hebrews 13:15).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our opening scripture is referring to the Lord, Jesus Christ. By Him, we’re to continually offer spiritual sacrifices to God in praise. Praise is thanksgiving: thanking and extolling God’s Majesty and greatness; acknowledging Him in His acts of kindness, for which you’re grateful and thankful.</p>
<p>But here’s the beautiful thing: in praising Him, in acknowledging His greatness, we’re thankful that His greatness is directed towards us for our advantage, in loving us, taking care of us, blessing us and all the numerous things He’s done for us.</p>
<p>The Spirit’s prayer through Paul in Ephesians 1:19 further explains it. It says, <em>“And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power.”</em> For example, when God demonstrated that great power in raising Jesus from the dead, He raised us up together with Him. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Everything He’s revealed to us about His power and His greatness is all about blessing us. He created all things: the stars, the moons, the sun, all the planets, the things we know and don&#x27;t know, and the ones we see and don&#x27;t see; they’re all for us.</p>
<p>No wonder the Bible says in 1 Timothy 6:17 that He gives us all things richly to enjoy. He shared all of what He&#x27;s got with us! 2 Peter 1:3 says, <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things….”</em> Think about that! Then He said in 1 Corinthians 3:21, “…all things are yours.” Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Romans 10:9-10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s important to note that the Bible doesn&#x27;t say, “With the heart, Christians believe”; rather, it says, “Man believes.” It&#x27;s a principle for all men—all human beings— regardless of who they are, where they come from, what they have; they can only believe with the heart—the spirit: that’s the way to be made righteous. But that’s not all. </p>
<p>Every man, woman, boy and girl ever born, and that’ll ever be born into this world has already been “saved” by Jesus Christ. When He died, He died to save all humanity. However, salvation is only a vital experience in the life of the one who not only believes, but affirms the lordship of Jesus over his or her life. In other words, upon believing in Jesus, there’s the further step of affirming His lordship: with the mouth, confession is made unto salvation. That’s the second part of the principle.</p>
<p>To receive salvation isn’t by your tears or good works. Salvation is a gift from God (Ephesians 2:8), received by the affirmation of His Word. Once you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, and confess with your mouth that He’s Lord over your life, your spirit is reborn instantly, through the impartation of eternal life by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It’s not difficult at all to receive salvation; some think they have to atone for their sins first, to be made right with God. Your own sacrifice will never suffice. It’s not about your good deeds; it’s about your faith in Christ’s vicarious death and resurrection. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep... (Genesis 1:1-2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you ever went underwater, the only light that you have in the water (if there&#x27;s no artificial lighting) is the light that&#x27;s coming from above the water. Now, the Bible says the whole earth was in darkness, and the “light” that was above the water was darkness.</p>
<p>But 2 Corinthians 4:6 tells us how God changed the situation. He commanded the light to shine out of the darkness: <em>“...God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts….”</em> The light didn&#x27;t come from heaven, because in heaven there’s no darkness at all. The light didn&#x27;t come out of God, because in Him there’s no darkness at all; the light came out of the darkness in the earth.</p>
<p>It brings to mind an amazing discovery by some scientists in 1934 (the sonoluminescence experiment). They created bubbles inside water and then activated sound waves towards the bubbles to collapse the bubbles. These bubbles were supposed to collapse by some form of implosion. When the bubbles imploded, light was emitted. They were in shock. How could that be?</p>
<p>They were experimenting for something else when they happened upon this amazing phenomenon. In 1989, similar experiments were carried out, this time with a single bubble so that this particular phenomenon could be observed more clearly. &quot;Is it possible that sound waves would cause bubbles underwater or liquids to implode, and light would result?&quot; they wondered.</p>
<p>Further experiments were carried out and it was found to be so: light was emitted when sound waves were excited against imploding bubbles. Those scientists only found out what God did in the beginning, in bringing form and order to a chaotic world of darkness as read in our opening scripture: He spoke and His speech (words) created sound waves.</p>
<p>When we talk, we release energy, and this energy goes out in form of sound waves. So when God said, “Let there be light,” energy was released and light came out of the darkness in the water. What’s this telling us? It lets us know that the original source material for everything is God&#x27;s Word. Blessed truth!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>We should be grateful that we were given a kingdom that cannot be shaken. And in this kingdom we please God by worshiping him and by showing him great honor and respect (Hebrews 12:28 CEV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the greatest honours that we have as God’s children is the privilege to worship Him. Our worship of the Lord is so sacrosanct; it’s not something you do halfheartedly and irreverently. Some people could be in an environment of worship and be distracted by several things. Some could even be using their phones or exchanging pleasantries while worship is going on. That’s irreverent.</p>
<p>The Lord deserves and demands true worship. True worship is from the heart, offered without distractions. And true worshippers are the ones who have known the Father. Recall the conversation between the Master and the lady from Samaria in John 4. In verse 20, the woman said, <em>“Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.”</em></p>
<p>The Lord responded, saying, <em>“…Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews”</em> (John 4:21-22). Observe that Jesus didn’t say the Samaritans weren&#x27;t worshipping at all; rather, He said they didn&#x27;t know whom they were worshipping.</p>
<p>Then He said, <em>“But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him”</em> (John 4:23). So, there’re true worshippers! When you learn to worship God truly from your heart, it’ll build your life and bring you tremendous blessings.</p>
<p>Take your times of worship seriously, especially worship in praise to God in the church. We worship God in our service to Him, in the things we do for Him; we worship Him in prayer as part of worship, but we also worship Him in praise and that&#x27;s the most important of them all. Always maintain not just an attitude, but a life of reverence, where you give true worship to the Lord.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life (Proverbs 4:23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the characteristics of adulthood is self-awareness. In other words, you know yourself; you know how you think, and you can even predict your own actions. You can say, “In such and such circumstances, I’d react or respond to issues this or that way.”</p>
<p>Now, consider this: the way you are or reason today— your current mindset—is a result of several factors. First is your parentage. From your parentage, you inherited certain traits. Then the society in which you grew up, the materials you consumed (the books you read, the films you watched, the things you listened to) all make up who you are today.</p>
<p>All the information that came to you through your senses were recorded by your mental faculty and your physical body. Your body has a mind. Your cells have memory. The physical members of your body have memory; they store information. So, all the information you ever received actually got stored in you.</p>
<p>Thus, each adult is an amazing conglomerate of massive storage facilities. Think about it: Your head has its own storage; your hand, your feet, all the systems of your body have so much inside them. All of these eventually lead to how you react to stimuli and how you respond to information or actions of other people.</p>
<p>No wonder the Bible says, <em>“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God”</em> (Romans 12:2). Through conscious meditation on the Word, your mind is organized, reorganized, programmed or reprogrammed. Its contents and processes are synchronized with God’s thoughts and perfect will for your life. That&#x27;s what brings about the transformation.</p>

<p>In the world, there&#x27;s no system or process that can help get rid of the wrong information that the human system has amassed over the course of mental and physical development. The storage is permanent. In the world are all kinds of people whose characters are the sum total or end result of all the negative information that has gone into them.</p>
<p>However, when you’re born again, the only material that has the capacity to erase, or delete all the wrong stuff from your mind and give you a fresh start is the Word of God. It’s the only material that cleanses the heart, purifies the soul and renews the mind.</p>
<p>The Word has sanctifying power. Jesus said in John 15:3, <em>“...Ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.”</em> Acts 20:32 says, <em>“And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up….”</em> With the Word of God, you can reconstruct your life, you can frame your world; you can decide you want to fix something in any area of your life—whatever it is.</p>
<p>Always take time to meditate on the Word and you’ll make apparent progress and experience good success in all your affairs. There’ll be an outburst of prosperity in every area of your life, to the praise and glory of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…Mercy triumphs over judgment! (James 2:13 NIV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone might see the evil, wickedness, deception, suffering and cruelty in the world today and conclude they’re a result of God’s judgment due to sin. But that’s not entirely true. We’re in the day of God’s mercy and His grace; we’re in a new dispensation; so it’s different today from how it was in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The evil happenings in the world today aren’t judgments from God; rather, they’re actions and orchestrations of Satan upon the world. You can easily discern this by the Spirit and through the Word. It’s the reason God expects us to respond by addressing Satan, cutting off his influence from our world and from men’s lives.</p>
<p>There’s sin, but Jesus already paid the price for sin on behalf of all men. The Bible says, <em>“There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus...”</em> (Romans 8:1). The word translated “condemnation” is the same as judgment. Jesus was judged in our place, and not just for us, but for the whole world. The Bible says, <em>“And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world”</em> (1 John 2:2).</p>
<p>Satan wants to make people believe that God is mad at them, punishing them, inflicting them with pain, whereas God isn’t the one behind it, but Satan. Our job, therefore, is to let the world know that God isn’t mad at them; rather, He’s made righteousness and eternal life available and free in Christ Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:19).</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need”</em> (Hebrews 4:16). Lamentations 3:22 says, <em>“It is of the LORD&#x27;s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.”</em> We’re in the dispensation of His overflowing grace and mercy. Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit (Proverbs 15:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your real personality is revealed in words; you&#x27;re no different from your words. Your words represent you. Think about this: before Jesus was manifested in the flesh, He was the living Word; He was God&#x27;s Word. The Word that the Father spoke became flesh; as it is written, <em>“And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory…”</em> (John 1:14 NKJV).</p>
<p>This is why your words are so important. Your words are “you.” If your words were capsulated and made flesh, what would that flesh look like? Will you be happy with what you see? If not, you can change it. Your life can reflect the beauty and glory of God. Begin by studying and meditating on the Word. Let the Word fill your heart and mind; for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks (Matthew 12:34).</p>
<p>Speak wholesome words. When you speak beautiful, faith-filled words, your life takes on the shape of those words and you receive a beautiful outcome.</p>
<p>Some people speak ugly and hurtful words to others all the time. Let that not be your description. Be gracious always in your speech and help others flourish through your words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart… (1 Kings 4:29-31).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day, the Lord was talking to me, and He told me how far greater and more excellent the divine wisdom we have in Christ is than what Solomon had. I was surprised and said, “Lord, Solomon was the wisest man that ever lived.” Then, the Lord replied, “Yes, but your wisdom is my wisdom,” for Christ is made wisdom unto us (1 Corinthians 1:24,30).</p>
<p>He then instructed me to go into the Scriptures to see the things Solomon talked about: <em>“…he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes”</em> (1 Kings 4:32-33).</p>
<p>Solomon talked about trees, plants, beasts and so on, and he was wiser than all men. But the Lord showed me that in Christ, we talk about higher things than what Solomon knew. We speak mysteries; mysteries that baffle men: <em>“But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory”</em> (1 Corinthians 2:7). We speak of higher things of the Spirit realm and the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>One of the ways we bring the hidden wisdom into this world is through the Spirit, when we speak in tongues. The Bible says, <em>“For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries”</em> (1 Corinthians 14:2). By the Holy Ghost, we speak mysteries. Then by the gift of interpretation, we know what those mysteries are.</p>
<p>When you pray in other tongues and the interpretation starts coming to you, sometimes you’d find that you spoke out a scripture or an explanation of something in the Spirit or from the Word. These are mysteries. When next you’re praying in tongues, be alert in your spirit because wisdom speaks through you. If you continue in prayer, the interpretation will come to you, or else ask and receive the gift of interpretation of tongues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance? (Romans 2:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romans 2:4 highlights something very powerful about the goodness of God: it provides the opportunity for repentance. In the Old Testament, the threat of judgment didn&#x27;t get the children of Israel to repent or obey God. But in the New Testament, He didn’t threaten us with judgments, because we’re His obedient ones (1 Peter 1:14). We’re described as having “obeyed” His Word of truth from the heart (Romans 6:17). Thus, He brought us into His goodness and love. Instead of judgment, He shows us His mercy.</p>
<p>God knows that if we would preach and tell the world about His love and goodness, they’d repent and turn to Him. 2 Corinthians 5:18 (NIV) says, <em>“All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.”</em> This is the difference. He knows we&#x27;ve sinned, but in Christ, He’s not counting our sins against us.</p>
<p>Joel in his prophecy (Joel 2:10-13), along with Zephaniah, said the people’s sins were being counted against them and because of that, judgment was coming to them (Zephaniah 1:14-15). But in our day, it’s different. The problem of sin was taken care of through the sacrifice of Jesus in our behalf. As a result of that sacrifice, God reconciled the world to Himself; He brought humanity into peace with Himself. Now He has sent us to take the message of His goodness and love to the world and reconcile people to Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, make this Christmas count for someone who hasn’t yet known the Lord. You’ll meet them at the mall. They’ll be at that family function you plan to attend. They’ll be at the park you’re taking your kids to play. You’d see some of them on your way home from Church. Let them know God isn’t punishing them for their sins. He already laid the punishment on Jesus Christ in their place and if they’d only believe, eternal life and righteousness will be imparted to their spirits. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends (John 15:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. He was born to fulfil the will of the Father. He was God’s love manifested to us. He was God’s sacrificial lamb to die and pay the price for the salvation of the world, to bring men into divine fellowship with the Father.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:5-6 says, <em>“Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.”</em> Before the foundation of the world, God planned that you’d live in His love.</p>
<p>He planned that in Christ, you’d be the proof of His goodness. Ephesians 2:10 AMPC says, <em>“For we are God&#x27;s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].”</em></p>
<p>Jesus experienced the love of the Father the way no man ever did. He said in John 14:10, <em>“...I am in the Father, and the Father is in me....”</em> He walked in the Father, and the Father walked in Him. We’re to do the same as admonished in Ephesians 5:1-2 AMPC: <em>“THEREFORE BE imitators of God [copy Him and follow His example], as well-beloved children [imitate their father]. And walk in love, [esteeming and delighting in one another] as Christ loved us and gave Himself up for us, a slain offering and sacrifice to God [for you, so that it became] a sweet fragrance.”</em></p>
<p>He saved us with His own love and gave His life for us, so we could experience the Father’s love through fellowship. Now we can better understand the Angel’s message to the shepherds in Luke 2:11-14: <em>“For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? (Mark 8:36).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our opening verse is an important food for thought. No man can truly “gain” the world without Jesus because it belongs to Him. He owns the world. You may own a piece of property today, but many years ago, that same property belonged to someone else who must have walked through its length and breadth and boasted “Look what I got!”</p>
<p>I ask people, “Where are the Pharaohs of Egypt and the Emperors of Europe? Where are the Caesars?” They’re long gone. Though they conquered the world at a point in their lives and thought they’d rule it forever, they had to leave it after a while, and someone else took over.</p>
<p>The natural man will give anything to live forever. But no matter how he tries to find a cure for death, he still has to answer the call whether or not he wants to.</p>
<p>Jesus taught about a rich man who had such a bountiful harvest that he needed to tear down his storehouses and build new ones to store his crops. He was excited to have laid up so much supplies for himself that could last for years. While he was thinking about this, God came into his room and said, <em>“...You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?”</em> (Luke 12:20 NIV).</p>
<p>What’s the purpose for your life in this world? Why are you here? I’ll tell you: It’s to make sure the Gospel of Jesus Christ goes to the ends of the earth. In Acts 26:16, the Bible says, <em>“But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee.”</em></p>
<p>This is the reason God left you here and it should be your passion. It should be what excites you. You may not be a pastor, teacher, prophet, an evangelist or an apostle, but you are called to be a soul winner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given (Matthew 13:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who don’t know God are quick to say, “His ways are not our ways, His thoughts are not our thoughts.” But for us who are born again, His ways are our ways. We’re born of Him, created in His image and His likeness. That means we look like Him, and we function like Him. Moreover, we have the same life and nature with Him. </p>
<p>1 Corinthians 2:16 says, <em>“…But we have the mind of Christ.”</em> He’s given us His thoughts, so we can think like Him. Ephesians 5:1 tells us to imitate Him. Hallelujah! Recall the words of the Master in our theme scripture: He said it’s our heritage to know the mysteries of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>The description of His character is clearly unveiled to us in the Scriptures; you can tell who He is; you can describe God by Jesus Christ, and know what to expect of Him. You can predict His response. He has revealed Himself and His will to us through His written Word and through the Holy Spirit. The Bible says He showed His ways unto Moses.</p>
<p>The only time He said, “My ways are not your ways” (Isaiah 55:8-9), which some people quote out of context, was because Israel, at the time, walked away from God&#x27;s ways. His desire is for our ways to correspond with His ways. He calls and invites us to walk in His ways.</p>
<p>If He didn&#x27;t show us His ways, how could we walk in sync with Him? So, His ways aren&#x27;t mysterious; His ways are revealed to us in His Word. If you know Him as your Father, He is not a mystery anymore. Yes, He&#x27;s a mystery to the world and to those who don’t know Him; but we’re family; we’re His children. We live in His Kingdom, and we know His ways. Praise God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways (Job 22:28).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you pray, learn to speak words of blessings; speak things into being. Ecclesiastes 11:3 says, <em>“If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth….”</em> There’re clouds that are calamitous, catastrophic, ruinous and tragic, but our clouds carry spiritual waters of blessings, prosperity and victories.</p>
<p>In John 7:38, Jesus said, <em>“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow, rivers of living water.”</em> The 39th verse says, <em>“(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified).”</em></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in you is a fountain of life. That’s why there&#x27;s a gusher, an outflow of life and blessings as you speak. Always speak blessings; words that cancel Satan’s plans. Even now, make a decree concerning your nation, your city, your life or about anything, and it shall be established unto you (Job 22:28, Ecclesiastes 8:4).</p>
<p>Remember, it’s by the blessing of the upright that the city is exalted (Proverbs 11:11). Speaking blessings over anyone, anything, any city or nation can be done by giving thanks. Therefore, give thanks as the Word enjoins us in 1 Timothy 2:1-2: <em>“I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority….”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek (Romans 1:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As God’s children, our role in the Gospel is clearly defined. Our Lord Jesus said, <em>“...Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature”</em> (Mark 16:15). In Matthew 28:19, He said, <em>“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”</em></p>
<p>Like the Apostle Paul, you ought to personalize your role in the Gospel and say, <em>“According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust&quot;</em> (1 Timothy 1:11). The Gospel has been committed to your trust; how faithful are you to its spread around the world? Has it dawned on you that you’re a soldier, and taking the Gospel to every man’s world as Jesus asked us to do means war?</p>
<p>In every nation, you have the civilians and you have the army. The army has a role that&#x27;s clearly defined for them: to defend the nation, protect vital national interests and fulfil national military responsibilities. You’re in God&#x27;s army (2 Timothy 2:3-4), working in sync and in partnership with an unseen heavenly host, to cover the earth with God’s righteousness.</p>
<p>These heavenly hosts, by God&#x27;s principles, can’t do the things they need to do without us and there’s a whole lot we can’t do without them. You have a role in the scheme of things. You’re God’s watchman, His mouthpiece and messenger.</p>
<p>You’re a co-labourer with God; His minister of reconciliation: <em>“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation”</em> (2 Corinthians 5:19). While there’s a raging battle for the souls of men, God needs you to prevail in prayer, and preach the Gospel with all fervency.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy… (Acts 2:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you notice that the first response or result of having the Spirit poured out upon all flesh is that men and women would prophesy? It shows the importance of prophecy in prayer. Until you find yourself prophesying in prayer, you haven’t utilized the power and benefits of prayer.</p>
<p>Prophecy is two-fold: we speak forth and we foretell. The key is being filled with the Spirit. The Bible says in Ephesians 5:18, <em>“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but <strong>be filled with the Spirit</strong>.”</em> The underlined expression connotes something that’s supposed to continue. The proper rendering is actually, “Be being filled with the Spirit.”</p>
<p>That means you should always be filled with the Spirit. If you’re that way, your prayer life will be enriched with prophecy where you speak forth God&#x27;s Word and you foretell the future. Don’t leave your future in the hands of others; create your “aion”—course of life—with prophecy.</p>
<p>As an individual, how your life goes depends a lot on you. Likewise, as the Church of Jesus Christ, we must also recognize that we have a responsibility to determine what happens in our communities. That’s why our prayers must be laden with prophecies. Whenever we come together to pray, we must know we’re coming together to determine the future of our cities, our nations, and our world through our prophetic utterances. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Hebrews 11:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine that someone, a very rich person that you know, gives you a signed cheque and says, “Fill in any amount you want!” God gave Solomon a blank cheque by asking him, “What do you want?” Solomon asked for wisdom and understanding (1 Kings 3:8-9). God didn’t send an angel from heaven to make Solomon wise. All He said was, “Solomon, you have it!” The moment God spoke those words, Solomon became what God said.</p>
<p>It’s such a blessing to hear God and to receive His Word. His Word to you at any time in your life regarding any situation is all you need. In Matthew 17:20, Jesus said, <em>“...If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.”</em> He just told you nothing shall be impossible unto you. That’s a blank cheque from God waiting to be cashed. All you have to do is fill in the blanks; the cheque has already been signed. When was it signed?</p>
<p>It was signed when the Holy Ghost came into your heart to live in you. The Bible says, <em>“It’s in Christ that you, once you heard the truth and believed it (this Message of your salvation), found yourselves home free—signed, sealed, and delivered by the Holy Spirit”</em> (Ephesians 1:13 MSG). So, it’s been signed!</p>
<p>It’s time for you to fill it out. But how? It’s with your mouth! The Bible says, <em>“…my tongue is the pen of a ready writer”</em> (Psalm 45:1). You fill in the blanks by speaking; as you declare words of faith in agreement with God, you’re writing in the Spirit; you’re composing a good matter! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>If life has been somewhat difficult and you’ve found yourself struggling, it’s because you haven’t filled in the blanks. The cheque has been signed, meaning that you’ve been authorized. Don’t wait anymore; start talking and watch your life go from glory to glory.</p>
