<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled (Matthew 24:32-34).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just how close is the Rapture? The parable of Jesus in our opening text gives a key to the timing. It talks about a fig tree whose branches are still tender. From the Scriptures, we know the fig tree is symbolic of the nation of Israel.</p>
<p>In 1948, Israel became a nation, which right now is still tender. It’s engaged in several conflicts and surrounded by enemies who want it completely annihilated. Jesus said, “When the branch is yet tender, it means summer is near.” What did He mean, and why summer?</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“He that gathereth in summer is a wise son…”</em> (Proverbs 10:5). This shows us something about summer: it’s gathering time. So, the tender branch indicates that gathering time is near.</p>
<p>We see this also in the Book of Amos, where a prophetic word was given concerning the nation of Israel: <em>“Thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit. And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the Lord unto me, The end is come upon my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more”</em> (Amos 8:1-2). Israel wasn’t living for the Lord, and God was going to judge them. But He said to Amos, “See, I have a basket of summer fruit.” This meant that He would gather another harvest, referring to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>2 Thessalonians 2:1 says, <em>“Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him.”</em> Our gathering together unto Him refers to the Rapture of the Church, and it’s closer than ever. We don’t have much time left. The gathering can take place any moment from now. If there’s anything you want to do for the Lord, this is the time. Don’t wait; otherwise, it might be too late. The time to act is now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand (2 Thessalonians 2:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expression, “the Day of Christ”, in our opening verse is wrongly assumed by many to generally mean “the last days.” There’s a difference between the Rapture of the Church, the Second Coming of Christ, and the Day of Christ. The Day of Christ refers to the millennium that begins with judgment. This isn’t the Great White Throne judgment in Revelation 20:11 or the Judgment Seat of Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:10. No! It’s the judgment of His enemies at His second coming, just before He sets up His millennial reign.</p>
<p>On that special day, the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven; He’ll come to rule in this world. At His appearing, the world, being at the Armageddon, will immediately unite against Him and the saints with Him, but these enemies will be destroyed, and all who reject Him: <em>“But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me”</em> (Luke 19:27). 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9 also says, <em>“…the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.”</em></p>
<p>However, before that great day of Christ, the Bible says there’ll be an apostasy: many who professed to be Christians will fall away from the faith: <em>“Let no one deceive or beguile you in any way, for that day will not come except the apostasy comes first…”</em> (2 Thessalonians 2:3 AMPC). What could bring about such a thing?</p>
<p>It’s the cares of this world: the deceitfulness of riches, and the lust for its pleasures. That’s why the Bible says, <em>“Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world…”</em> (1 John 2:15). It’s important that as the coming of the Lord approaches, you live your life stronger and stronger in Him so that you don’t fall away.</p>
<p>Don’t cling to the things of the world. Let your focus be on the Master and on that day when He shall be revealed from heaven. We all will be gathered unto Him to be with Him always. What a day that will be!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed (1 Corinthians 15:52).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Someone once asked me, “What’s the last trump? Will it be blown after the seven trumpets in the Book of Revelation?” No, this is a different trumpet, and to understand it requires a contextual analysis. When you read through some of the preceding verses in the same 1 Corinthians 15, you’ll observe a consistency of duality in Paul’s communication.</p>
<p>In several verses, he wrote about the spiritual and the natural, the celestial and the terrestrial. He also used the terms, “the first and the last,” and then “the first and the second”: <em>“And so it is written, The <strong>first man</strong>Adam was made a living soul; the <strong>last Adam</strong> was made a quickening spirit…. The <strong>first man</strong> is of the earth, earthy: the <strong>second man</strong> is the Lord from heaven</em> (1 Corinthians 15:45-47).</p>
<p>In this context, Paul considered “last” to mean “second.” So if we read our opening verse by the same token, it would go thus: “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the second trump….” This means there’re two trumpets, not one like many people think.</p>
<p>The Amplified Classic version of the verse corroborates this: <em>“In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the [sound of the] last trumpet call. <strong>For a trumpet will sound</strong>, and the dead [in Christ] will be raised imperishable….”</em> Many missed it because they thought he was talking about the same trumpet. Why is this important?</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the Bible tells us about two important trumpets. The first one was sounded when the Lord showed up, and the second was sounded for the assembly. The first was for the manifestation of God’s glory, while the second was for gathering the assembly. When the first trumpet sounds at the Rapture, the Lord Jesus will come out of heaven, and the dead in Christ will be raised incorruptible.</p>
<p>The second and last trumpet is the one that’ll assemble all of us who are alive and remain. When it sounds, we’ll be changed and caught up to meet the Lord in the air. Prepare for the Master’s soon return. Brace up for greater evangelism so that we can reach more people and get them ready to meet the Lord in the air at the sound of the last trumpet. Imagine what a glorious meeting it’ll be! Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them (John 17:26).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does Jesus inspire you? If you read about Him in the Scriptures, you’ll surely be inspired. Glorious words came out of the lips of this man of Galilee. He spoke words so gracious that even the officers who were sent to arrest Him testified, <em>“...No man ever spoke like this Man”</em> (John 7:46 WEB).</p>
<p>Always, people gathered around Him to hear Him. Once, they were with Him for three days in the desert and didn’t remember to go home until their food was exhausted. Yet, no one complained of hunger; they were just content to be with Jesus. What was He giving them? Words! He was a Master of words. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Though encapsulated in the body of a Jewish man from Nazareth, Jesus was the Word of God that created the whole world: <em>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made”</em> (John 1:1-3). The Bible also says in Hebrews 1:1-2, <em>“God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds.”</em></p>
<p>Jesus Christ made the worlds! This isn’t just talking about the planets and the galaxies; He also made the times and the seasons of men’s lives. John 1:14 says, *“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us….”*Blessed Jesus! The Word that created the universe came in a body to love us. How can you explain that!</p>
<p>No wonder the Bible says*, “…God is love”* (1 John 4:8). That’s His nature; He’s the description of love. The love of God is packaged in Christ Jesus! How I love Jesus! He’s the light and the beauty of Heaven, the brightness and the effulgence of God’s glory, the out-shining and out-ray of God’s light; that’s Jesus Christ! Hallelujah!</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen (Romans 15:33).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Old Testament, God was often called the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. However, in the New Testament, particularly in the epistles, God is known, more than anything else, as the God of peace. He’s called the God of peace more than He’s called the God of love or the God of righteousness. We see this referenced in Philippians 4:9*: “…the God of peace shall be with you,”* and in 1 Thessalonians 5:23: <em>“And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly….”</em></p>
<p>The word “peace” is from the Greek “Eirene”, which is akin to “Shalom” in Hebrew; it’s peace with prosperity. This is God’s desire for all men. No wonder the angels declared in Luke 2:14: <em>“Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.”</em> Think about it! He brought peace between us and Him: <em>“Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ”</em> (Romans 5:1).</p>
<p>The chaos experienced in some parts of the world today didn’t happen by chance. They were inspired by demons of chaos who thrive in chaos. They use chaos as a tool for perpetrating their nefarious schemes through their human hosts and keep at it until people bow to their wishes. But God wants peace and tells us to proclaim peace to the nations.</p>
<p>In the prayer He tells us to pray for all men, His intent is that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life (1 Timothy 2:1-2). That’s what He wants us to have. He’s always about peace. Even now, command peace for your city and your country. Declare in the mighty Name of the Lord Jesus that godly peace that brings liberty, grace, strength, health and prosperity will hold sway in your nation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:2 NKJV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you read today’s theme verse as it’s presented, you’re likely to think it’s talking about the law of “sin and death” as one entity. But that’s not what the Spirit is communicating to us here. He’s actually referring to the law of sin on the one hand, and to death on the other. For clarity, we could rearrange the words and the verse would read: “<em>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from <strong>‘death’</strong> and ‘<strong>the law of sin’</strong>”</em> (Romans 8:2). When you read it this way, it suddenly opens up and the meaning becomes very clear: it’s not “the law of sin and death” but “the law (or principle) of sin” on the one hand, and “death” on the other.</p>
<p>This means the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made you death-free in the same way that it made you sin-free! Hallelujah! This law of the Spirit of life or law of life is also referred to as the law of liberty in James 1:25 and James 2:12. John said, <em>“He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you…that ye may know that ye have eternal life…”</em> (1 John 5:12-13).</p>
<p>This (eternal) life is in the Son, and since you have it, you’re not supposed to struggle with sin, sickness, disease, infirmities and death. Think about this: at 120 years, Moses’ eyes weren’t dim and his natural force was unabated (Deuteronomy 34:7).</p>
<p>Moses lived under the Old Covenant, but he had a consciousness of life; He knew the Word of God invigorates and makes alive (Deuteronomy 32:46-47). Have the same mentality, because when you were born again, you passed from death to life and from sin into righteousness. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words (1 Thessalonians 4:16-18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How I look forward to the coming of the Lord, the Rapture of the Church! I hope you do too. His coming is with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump. He’s coming “with a bang.” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This isn’t going to be an ordinary shout; it’s going to be so loud the dead in Christ—every Christian who ever died—will hear it and come back to life. The Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first, then we that are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air; He’ll be waiting for us in the air. And the Bible says, <em>“...so shall we ever be with the Lord”</em> (1 Thessalonians 4:17).</p>
<p>That shout reminds of a story in John 11; Jesus shouted and a dead man named Lazarus came out of the grave: <em>“And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes...”</em> (John 11:43-44).</p>
<p>If Jesus hadn’t singled out Lazarus, calling him by name, every dead person would have heard His shout and come out of the grave. But He was specific and said, “Lazarus, come forth!” He’s going to shout again, and when He does, only those who had lived for Him before they died and those of us living for Him now will hear it at the Rapture of the Church!</p>
<p>That day is coming; are you ready? That’s what all this is for! That’s why we’re producing and distributing Rhapsody of Realities to the whole world in every language: we’re preparing the nations for His return. We want to reach every man, woman, boy and girl on the face of the earth with the Gospel: <em>“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”</em> (Matthew 24:14).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge… (Hosea 4:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two striking things are revealed to us in our theme verse: the first is the fact that God’s people can be destroyed and the second is the reason it’s possible for them to be destroyed, which is their lack of knowledge of God’s Word. The ignorance of God’s Word is such a terrible thing. Jesus said to the Jews, “You err, because you don’t know the Scriptures” (Matthew 22:29).    </p>
<p>This helps us further understand why the Bible says in 2 Timothy 2:15, <em>“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”</em> The solution to every problem, the answer to every question, and everything you’d ever require in life are all in the Word. Don’t ignore the Word.</p>
<p>To ignore the Word is to set yourself up for failure and unnecessary hardships in life. Jesus said, <em>“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free”</em> (John 8:32). Proverbs 11:9 says, <em>“…through knowledge shall the just be delivered.”</em> Acts 20:32 says, <em>“And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.”</em></p>
<p>It’s about your knowledge of God’s Word. 2 Peter 1:3 says, <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue.”</em></p>
<p>How much and how well do you know Him? That’s what’s going to determine how far you go—your prosperity, glory, dominion and victories in life. The things you require or desire for a godly life are already yours in Christ. But the way to make them effectual in your life is a function of your knowledge of Him.</p>
<p>The knowledge Peter writes about is full, exact knowledge— “epignosis” (Greek). Spend time every day, studying, listening to, and meditating on the Word of God. Inundate your spirit, soul and mind with the Word. As the Scripture says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom…”</em> (Colossians 3:16). The result will be a life of ever-increasing grace, ever-increasing relevance, ever-increasing glory, unending success and all-round prosperity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature… (2 Peter 1:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you were born again, you were catapulted from the domain of darkness into God’s marvelous light—the Kingdom of His Love-Son: <em>“Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son”</em> (Colossians 1:12-13).</p>
<p>Then 2 Peter 1:4 says, <em>“Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature….”</em> We’re participators in the divine experience. We’re not spectators in the Kingdom; we’re part of the process of making things happen. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>We’re now involved in that special life that God has, which hitherto no other being had. Now we have the nature of God! It’s the reason you can speak from where you are and things will happen. You can direct the power of God in a certain direction through your words or your hands.</p>
<p>Do you remember Moses? God said to him, “Stretch your hand over the water and divide it!” (Exodus 14:16). Moses parted the Red Sea by stretching forth his hand over the sea. That was him participating in the divine experience: God gave the Word, Moses acted; a miracle ensued.</p>
<p>What could have been the connection between a man’s hand and a raging sea? God is showing us something spiritual about our oneness with Him and our role in the divine experience. Recall the words of Jesus in John 15:5: <em>“I am the vine, ye are the branches…for without me ye can do nothing.”</em></p>
<p>For the latter part of that verse, the reverse is also true. He needs us as much as we need Him. He works, and walks in and through us today. Like Moses, when you lift your hands, they’re God’s hands; therefore, God responds. Your victory has been settled; all you have to do is walk in the light of it. Study the Word to know and play your role in the divine experience. You’re not an ordinary person.</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Finally, my brethren, be STRONG in the Lord, and in the POWER of his MIGHT (Ephesians 6:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the three words underlined in our opening verse; I’ll explain them one after the other. The first one is “strong.” In Luke 1:80, talking about John the Baptist, the Bible says, <em>“And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.”</em></p>
<p>Also, in Luke 2:40, the Bible talks about another child who <em>“…grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.”</em> This is Jesus. So, John the Baptist and Jesus waxed strong in spirit, meaning that they became strong.</p>
<p>The word, “power” is from the Greek, “kratos” which means strength. The next word, “might” is from the Greek, “ischus” which means force that one has the ability to wield or apply. What’s God telling us? He’s saying, “Be strong in the strength of the Lord and in His ability to apply force.” What amount of force is God able to apply in a situation? Take advantage of it; take advantage of God’s ability. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Remember, it’s the Spirit’s might and not your might. Apply His strength and not your strength. Trust in Him with all your heart. Trust what He can do. That’s why you have to know Him to have an idea of how much He’s able to do. The Bible says, <em>“And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee”</em> (Psalm 9:10).</p>
<p>Consider David who went into battle with Goliath, not with a sword or a spear, but with a sling and five smooth stones. When the giant, Goliath, stepped forward against him, he didn’t turn back; rather, he charged towards Goliath and struck him down with just a stone. David was strong in the Lord and applied God’s strength to defeat the giant. Be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Be strong in God’s truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel… (Luke 4:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While praying many years ago, precisely in 1981, I had some encounters with the Holy Spirit that changed my life. I began to experience a fellowship and knowledge of the Holy Spirit that made His power in my life more real and inherently applicable in life’s situations.</p>
<p>I had read about the missionaries who came from Europe to Africa. Some of them spent years trying to get converts to Christ without much results. They tried; some even died in the process, but it didn’t work. The problem was that they came with religion; they came with a nice message that exhibited the kindness of Christ. That was great, but they needed more than just a nice message.</p>
<p>No matter how much you love Jesus and how much you’re touched by the need to preach the Gospel to sinners in the world, if you’re not filled with the Holy Spirit, it won’t work. That’s why Jesus said to His disciples, <em>“…tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high”</em> (Luke 24:49).</p>
<p>Anyone can say, “I love Jesus, and I’ll serve Him all my life!” Peter also said the same thing. He said to the Master, “...Even if everyone else deserts you, I will never desert you” (Matthew 26:33 NLT). He emphasized, <em>“...Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you...”</em> (Matthew 26:35 NLT). Of course, it only took some soldiers, a little girl, and some other fellow to make Peter deny Jesus few hours later.</p>
<p>But after Peter received the Holy Spirit, His fears disappeared. The once “unlearned fisherman” began to say and do supernatural things, so much so that in one day, through his preaching, three thousand souls were converted!</p>
<p>If you’ve received the Holy Spirit already, that’s just the beginning. You have to know Him; you have to walk in and with Him. He has to become a constant part of your life. Remember, the power of our message isn’t in the shouting, nor is it in the ability to use many words. The power of our message is the Holy Spirit: <em>“And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power”</em> (1 Corinthians 2:4).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles... (Judges 6:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In life, there’re people who ask the wrong questions and make the wrong requests. There’s just something about them that makes them ask the wrong questions every time they have an opportunity. But you can ask the right questions. There’re good questions that guide you to useful answers. Until you learn to ask the right questions, you won’t find meaningful answers that’ll propel you forward.</p>
<p>God wants you to ask the right questions. At a time when Israel was being oppressed by another nation, an angel appeared to Gideon and greeted, “The Lord is with you, mighty man of valour.” Gideon replied, “Why do you call me a mighty man of valour? If God is with us, where are all His miracles?” This was a good question. If God was with them, then their lives ought not to be ordinary.</p>
<p>Have you ever watched the Olympics or some other sporting event on TV and wondered at the sportsmen who seemed to have superhuman abilities? You most likely found them amazing because you knew you couldn’t do some of the things they were doing. Or have you ever been blown away by the level of intelligence of a genius?</p>
<p>What about you? Who says you can’t be more extraordinary than these people? When are you going to say like Gideon: “If God is with me, then my life cannot be ordinary!” And then you start asking the right questions.</p>
<p>God gave Solomon wisdom, and the Bible says he was wiser than all men. So, there was a time in this world when one man was wiser than all men, and he wasn’t Jesus. Why can’t that be you? Why can’t you be wiser than all the people in your city? Who says you can’t?</p>
<p>Is there some sickness or disease troubling your body? If you’ve received the Holy Spirit, then you need to ask the question: “Should I still be sick with the Holy Spirit living in me?” Not only should you ask this question, you must answer it. Take a hold of your Bible and meditate on the verse that says, <em>“And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of his Spirit who lives in you”</em> (Romans 8:11 NIV). Before long, the power of the Spirit will course through your body and produce results. Put this to work today.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels (2 Thessalonians 1:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of people don’t realize that Jesus is coming back. You can tell by the way they live. They live their lives every day, doing whatever they please. Whether they realize it or not, Jesus is coming again. He said He would, and it’s getting closer than ever before.</p>
<p>How I look forward to that day! What a day it would be. Will you be ready for Him when He returns? Or will He come back to discover you didn’t do what you were supposed to do? It’s like when a teacher gives his students some homework and comes to class the following day to ask for it. The one who did it will be happy to see the teacher, while the one who didn’t would wish the teacher would forget or won’t come to class.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day”</em> (2 Thessalonians 1:8-10).</p>
<p>When Jesus comes back, He’ll be admired in those of us that love His appearing. This means His glory will be seen in each one of us. Those who heard us when we said Christ was in us will then see His glory in us and acknowledge it as true. Suddenly, we’ll be glorified, each one of us a bright shining light, and they’ll admire Jesus in us and among us. That day is coming very soon.</p>
<p>Jesus said,  <em>“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven”</em> (Matthew 5:16). He didn’t just tell us to shine, but to “so shine!” He’s made us a light to the nations and He wants us to light up other people. He wants us to bring life and joy to them as we reach them with the Gospel now more than ever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am (John 8:56-58).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With this singular statement— “Before Abraham was, I AM”—our Lord Jesus declared His agelessness. Agelessness refers to a life of endless development, where you grow without getting old. It’s an endless, incorruptible, and indestructible life. When you were born again, you received the same eternal life as Jesus and were brought into agelessness. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Speaking about eternal life, John declared: <em>“That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested unto us”</em> (1 John 1:1-2). The purpose for which it was manifested was so that we might have and live the same life. As you study the Scriptures and see such truths, you see your true reflection and can tell what your life ought to be.</p>
<p>Now that you’re born again, you’ve been born into God’s realm, into eternity! To live in the Word of God, and in Christ, is to live in eternity. That’s the life you’ve got. You’re in Christ; that’s your new environment. You’re not of this world. So, start living your ageless life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death (Proverbs 12:28).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our previous study, we reviewed the fact that eternal life has brought us agelessness, but in our study today, we’ll see that eternal life has brought to us even more—deathlessness! Our opening text declares that <em>“In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof <strong>there is no death</strong>.”</em> This refers to deathlessness.</p>
<p>There’s a difference between agelessness and deathlessness. Agelessness speaks of a life of endless development, where you grow without aging, whereas deathlessness refers to a life completely devoid of the tendency of death. The natural man’s life is programmed “from the womb to the tomb.” In other words, he was born with the tendency to die. All his life long, he does everything he can to keep himself alive and stave off death, but he eventually succumbs to it because he inherited a curse of death.</p>
<p>But when you’re born again and you have the life and nature of God in you, things are different; you transcend from mortality into immortality! The Bible declares, <em>“This truth is now being unveiled by the revelation of the anointed Jesus, our life-giver, who has dismantled death, obliterating all its effects on our lives, and has manifested his immortal life in us by the gospel”</em> (2 Timothy 1:10 TPT).</p>
<p>In Christ, you’re not susceptible to death, because of eternal life. Now you can better understand the words of Jesus in Mark 16:18: <em>“They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them….”</em> “Any deadly thing” here refers to something fatal or death-causing; but Jesus said none of such things can hurt or harm you. Why? Because you have eternal life!</p>
<p>John the beloved Apostle wrote, <em>“I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life”</em> (1 John 5:13 NIV). He wants you to know that you have eternal life because until you know it, you’ll never walk in the light of it. You have to know that you have eternal life and that this life is death-proof!</p>
<p>Death is failure introduced into a “system”; but he’s letting you know that there’s no failure in your “body systems”—no heart failure, kidney failure or lung failure; nothing of the sort! Since you have eternal life in you, the organs and systems of your body don’t fail! Thanks be unto God for eternal life. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God (Romans 8:16 NKJV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our passion for preaching the Gospel is one thing that the world can’t stand; it troubles them. “How can people be so passionate about Jesus?” they wonder. But then, they try to wave it off on the premise that people are generally passionate about their religion. What they don’t realize is that ours is different; it’s more than a passion.</p>
<p>When comparing Christians with the religious people of the world (Christianity isn’t a religion), there’re three things to look at: the first is our passion, which can actually be compared with theirs. Then there’s also conviction: the religions of the world may have as much conviction as we do; but there’s something that we have that they don’t have and could never have: the inward witness. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>We have a witness within our spirit about Jesus! That’s what we read in our theme verse; it says, <em>“The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God.”</em> So, when we’re standing for Jesus Christ, we’re not just standing because we’re passionate; we’re not preaching the Gospel just because we’re convinced of His message. Rather, it’s because we have a witness within our spirit that truly, Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, except by Him (John 14:6).</p>
<p>We have the witness in our spirit that now are we the sons of God. Deep down in our hearts, we know that we’re in fellowship with God and we have the Holy Spirit, and that we’re born again! These aren’t assumptions but vital and present-hour realities in our spirit. We have “inside information”, knowledge produced in us by the Holy Spirit that we’re born of God and forever victorious.</p>
<p>We’re different. What we have is not a religion. No matter how passionate and convinced people may be about their religion, there’s no salvation in any religion. The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the only saving message for the world. And thanks be unto God! We’re the custodians of this message of power by which God saves, heals, protects, delivers, preserves and prospers. We’re His witnesses. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://rhapsodyofrealities.b-cdn.net/app/dailyarticle/jul-22-day-17-ministering-in-the-sanctuary.jpg" alt="July 17th, 2022" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary (Hebrews 9:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Old Testament, from the instructions God gave to Aaron in Exodus 30:7-8, we observe the ministry of the priests in the sanctuary. He said that the lamps must be perpetually on; and when lighting them in the evening, and in the morning, he must burn incense. These were very specific instructions concerning the priests’ ministry in the sanctuary under the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Now, reading our theme verse in the New International Version, it says, <em>“A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.”</em> In that sanctuary, we’ve got three things: the bread (table of shewbread), the candlestick (the Menorah), and just before the veil, the altar of incense. These were the three articles of furniture in the Holy Place. How does this apply to us today?</p>
<p>The “bread” is our study and meditation on the Word. Recall that the “shewbread,” which is also referred to as the Bread of His presence, was eaten only by the priests (Leviticus 8:31, Leviticus 24:8). And the Bible says we’ve been made “kings and priests unto God” (Revelation 1:6); we’re holy priesthood unto God. Therefore, we’re qualified to eat the “Bread of His presence,” which represents our meditation on the Word.</p>
<p>The second thing in that sanctuary every day was the lamp of the Spirit. God said to Aaron, <em>“...When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick”</em> (Numbers 8:2). This represents the seven spirits of God: <em>“And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God”</em> (Revelation 4:5). This refers to the fullness of the Spirit; our fellowship and continual infilling of the Spirit. You’re to maintain that fullness of the Spirit every day; study Ephesians 5:18-21; it shows you how.</p>
<p>The third thing in that sanctuary was the altar of incense, which signifies the prayer ministry of the saints: <em>“Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice”</em> (Psalm 141:2). This refers to our prayer of worship, praise, thanksgiving and intercession. Today, you’re that sanctuary, and in the sanctuary, it’s about these three things: the Word, the Spirit, and prayer. Meditate on the Word every day; be ever-filled with the Spirit; and pray always.</p>

<p><em><strong>Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart (2 Corinthians 3:2-3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Christianity, we emphasize studying and meditating on God’s Word because of what it produces in your life: ever-increasing glory! That’s what your life is for. The glory of God is in the Word, and that glory becomes more visible in your life as you consciously and consistently feed on the Word.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“...Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind…”</em> (Romans 12:2). 2 Corinthians 3:18 says, <em>“But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”</em> These verses emphasize the ever-increasing glory in our spirit as we contemplate the Word.</p>
<p>If you don’t give undivided attention to the study, meditation, and practice of God’s Word, you inhibit His glory in your life. This has happened to some people without them even realizing it. They exposed themselves to news and information from negative sources other than the Word of God.</p>
<p>Remember, you’re what you eat; you become more and more like the information that you feed on. The Word of God is the glory of God; therefore, feed on the Word and your life will be increasingly excellent and full of glory. Colossians 3:16 says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.”</em></p>
<p>Take the Word of God as God’s vision, opinion, thought, idea, law or principle. Above all, take His Word as truth—absolute reality. Be inundated with the Word so that all you think and talk is the Word. That’s the sure path to a life of ever-increasing glory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm (Daniel 6:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible says an excellent spirit was in Daniel. How would you like that to be said of you? Well, the same is true about you because the day you received the Holy Spirit into your life, the excellent Spirit came to live in you.</p>
<p>This excellent Spirit is manifested in you when you choose to let Him have His way in your life and when you accept the Scriptures as His real and perfect will and live accordingly. You’ll suddenly discover that everyone will be esteemed in your eyes. When you’re awakened to this truth, everything about you becomes top-class; your life becomes an expression of the perfections of Christ.</p>
<p>Daniel excelled above the presidents and satraps because they didn’t have an excellent spirit; rather, they had a bitter and complaining spirit. They saw that the king was always favourable towards Daniel and it hurt them, so they conspired against him out of bitterness.</p>
<p>When people who don’t have an excellent spirit see others being praised, promoted and commended, they get hurt. In Matthew 7:18, the Lord Jesus said, <em>“A good (healthy) tree cannot bear bad (worthless) fruit, nor can a bad (diseased) tree bear excellent fruit [worthy of admiration]”</em> (AMPC). </p>
<p>Notice how He described an excellent fruit; He said it’s worthy of admiration. That’s amazing! What’s your life like? Is it worthy of admiration? If everyone turned out like you, will you be happy? If people behaved towards you the way you behave towards others, would you like it?</p>
<p>Let your life be a manifestation of the Spirit of excellence in you. Tower above envy, bitterness, anger and all the negativities of life, because you’re an excellent tree bearing excellent fruits: <em>“Any branch in Me that does not bear fruit [that stops bearing] He cuts away (trims off, takes away); and He cleanses and repeatedly prunes every branch that continues to bear fruit, to make it bear more and richer and more excellent fruit”</em> (John 15:2 AMPC).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them (Ephesians 2:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today’s opening scripture is a beautiful one, and I don’t want you to miss the blessing in it. Therefore, read it again aloud, carefully and meditatively. Here, the Spirit of God is talking to everyone who believes in Jesus Christ, everyone who has received the salvation in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>I want you to reckon that God is speaking to you right now, because He truly is. I love the AMPC rendering of the same scripture: <em>“For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live]”</em> (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).</p>
<p>You’re God’s workmanship, His handicraft, His design, His craftsmanship. That means God has His brand on you; that’s the proof of your authentication. This is the greatest and best brand in the universe. You should never think failure or defeat. You’re too sublime to fail; too excellent to be under. And that’s not all.</p>
<p>The next thing He tells you is, “…that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us….” This means your life isn’t an accident; God prearranged it. He wants you living the good life which He prearranged. He planned a good life for you, right here on earth; it’s yours to live NOW.</p>
<p>There’re people who live in the wrong place, they went to the wrong school, they have the wrong friends, and some are in the wrong job or business. Why? They took a path that’s different from the path that God prearranged for them. But God has a plan for you; you’re set on course by God; follow His master plan through the Word. Blessed be God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible tells us about the good, the acceptable or permissive will, and the perfect will of God (Romans 12:2). The good will of God is His general will. The acceptable will of God is one that He allows, not because there’s nothing better, but because of your insistence on it. There’re people that God granted what they were asking for even though it wasn’t His perfect will for them. Can God do that? Emphatically yes! It’s in the Bible. In 1 Samuel 8:1-22, the Israelites asked for a king because they wanted to be like other nations. Samuel the Prophet refused because it was contrary to God’s plan for His people.</p>
<p>But following their importunity, God had to instruct Samuel to do as the people had demanded. He said to Samuel, <em>“…Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them”</em> (1 Samuel 8:7). Think about it: God still helped them select the king, even though it wasn’t His perfect will for them to have one.</p>
<p>Sadly, there’re people who live outside of the perfect, the acceptable, and the good will of God. The school they attended, the course they studied, their career or business, the city they live in, etc., all their decisions were circumstantial, and as such, they live circumstantial lives. This isn’t God’s desire for His children.</p>
<p>How do you know and walk in God’s perfect will for your life? It’s through the knowledge of His Word and fellowship with the Holy Spirit. The Word of God is the will of God expressed. Through studying the Word and spending time in fellowship with the Holy Spirit, you become filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.</p>
<p>Talk to the Lord about your life’s decisions. He’s interested in everything about your life. Perhaps you’re learning of this truth for the first time and you’re unsure what your path is, it  ’s important for you to know that God has a perfect will for you. His will for you is an excellent life.</p>
<p>It’s not too late to turn to Him who has all answers. Yield yourself completely to the transforming power of His Word and surely, you’ll <em>“…discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect”</em> (Romans 12:2 ESV).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth (3 John 1:2)</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today’s study begins with this amazing verse that clearly reflects the mind of God for you. Remember the Bible says that all Scripture is given by the inspiration of God (2 Timothy 3:16). Therefore, more than anything else, God’s wish, His desire, His will and His plan is that you’d prosper.</p>
<p>I know some Christians have problems with the teaching on prosperity. Well, 3 John 1:2 proves God is interested in your complete prosperity: material prosperity, the physical (or bodily) prosperity and the prosperity of the soul.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the verse: <em>“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou <strong>mayest prosper</strong> and <strong>be in health</strong>, even as <strong>thy soul prospereth</strong>.”</em> Some people may be prospering in their soul but are neither prospering physically nor materially. I’m referring to Christians who are doing well, upright and forthright in all their affairs, yet they’re sick and financially broke.</p>
<p>But the Spirit of God says, “I wish you will prosper in your health and finances, just as your spirit is prospering.” Such folks must believe in material and physical prosperity so their lives will be balanced. That’s what God wants—a balanced spiritual life.</p>
<p>The last part of the verse refers to the prosperity of your soul, which is spiritual and has the priority. God wants you to prosper materially or financially; then He also wants you to be in health. Healing is good but when you’re in health, you don’t need healing because you don’t get sick. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>What’s the secret to this life of out-and-out prosperity? How can you prosper in your spirit, soul and body? The Bible says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly…”</em> (Colossians 3:16). If the Word of God is in you richly, you’ll prosper spiritually, and therefore, physically and materially too, because the lesser is included in the greater. Give yourself wholly to the Word. Study and meditate on the Word. Keep it inside you until it pours out of your mouth always, and in any situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the Word that God speaks is alive and full of power [making it active, operative, energizing, and effective]; it is sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of life (soul) and [the immortal] spirit, and of joints and marrow [of the deepest parts of our nature], exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart (Hebrews 4:12 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Word of God is powerful. If you receive and believe it today, it’ll produce wonders in your life: your body, academics, family, relationships, finances, business—everything about you. I’m referring to the Word that created the heavens and the earth (John 1:3). That same Word is the force that holds the planets in their place (Hebrews 1:3).</p>
<p>The Word is incorruptible, ever living and everlasting (1 Peter 1:23). It doesn’t matter where you are, if you believe and trust God’s Word, it’ll produce results. In the parable of the Sower, Jesus described four scenarios wherein the seed was sown with different results. Then He said, <em>“Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God”</em> (Luke 8:11).</p>
<p>A seed has the power to reproduce when you plant it in the right soil. The question is, is your heart the right soil today? If it is, the message will reproduce itself. Just as corn seed reproduces corn, and orange seed reproduces oranges, the Word of love, hope, faith, power, prosperity, truth, strength, soundness of mind and body that I bring you every day in this devotional will reproduce itself in your life, if you receive and believe it. It’ll fill your life with the manifestation of Christ.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah 4:3, the Lord warned His children*, “…Plow up the hardness of your hearts; otherwise the good seed will be wasted among the thorns”* (TLB). I give the same charge to you today. Every day, prepare your heart for the Word by speaking in other tongues. 1 Corinthians 14:4 says, <em>“He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself.…”</em> Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom (Colossians 3:16).</p>

<p><em><strong>The Lord appeared from of old to me, saying, Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn you and continued My faithfulness to you (Jeremiah 31:3 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was listening to a testimony some time ago and the lady who was testifying said, “I didn’t know that God loves me so much.” That statement touched me deeply. She found out that God loves her, and it changed everything for her. To realize that God loves you personally is one of the greatest discoveries you’ll ever make in your life.</p>
<p>The love of God is unfathomable and immeasurable. He’s more ambitious for your success than you could ever be for yourself. What glory will fill your soul when you discover this reality! It’ll transform your life totally.</p>
<p>Hebrews 13:5 says*, “…for He [God] Himself has said, I will not in any way fail you nor give you up nor leave you without support. [I will] not, [I will] not, [I will] not in any degree leave you helpless nor forsake nor let [you] down (relax My hold on you)! [Assuredly not!]”* (AMPC). This means even if you walk away from Him, He’ll go after you until you prove to Him you don’t want Him. But He always wants you, and He’ll always love you.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t He give up on you? Why does He always want you? And why will He always want you? It’s because He loves you personally. He truly does. If you were the only person on the face of the earth, Jesus would still have come to die for you.</p>
<p>When He made you, He made you to look and function like Him. He sees Himself in you. When you misbehave, He doesn’t look for how to punish you; rather, He seeks to help you and make you become who He really wants you to be. He knows you’d get better if you’d listen to Him and receive His words; so, He always brings His Word to you to correct you, guide you and perfect you. He genuinely loves you.</p>
<p>There might be some people in your family that despise you. There might be some people who may not really like you; it makes no difference. The only one who really counts is Jesus Christ, and He loves you affectionately. Let that mean more than the whole world to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church (1 Corinthians 14:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you receive the Holy Spirit, you receive the power of God to reside in you as Jesus said (Acts 1:8). This power is triggered or activated when you speak in other tongues. The Greek word translated “edifieth” in the opening scripture is “oikodomeo,” which means to construct or build up, to embolden or charge up like you’d charge a battery.</p>
<p>That verse is therefore telling us that the one who speaks in tongues builds himself up like an edifice; he emboldens himself and charges himself like a battery. When you spend time to speak in other tongues, you’re building up your spirit: <em>“But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost”</em> (Jude 1:20). If you were weak in your Christian life, as you speak in other tongues, the power of God that had lain dormant within you would be stirred and you’ll be strengthened to do the things of God.</p>
<p>Speaking in tongues is the antidote to fear and timidity. God hasn’t given you the spirit of fear, but of power, love and a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). Activate the power within you by spending time speaking in other tongues; do this every day and every so often. Your inner man will be built up strong and you’ll constantly walk in dominion over all your adversaries.</p>
<p>Also, speaking in tongues empowers you to preach. I heard the testimony of a nine-year-old boy who was timid and unable to preach to his friends. After he began speaking in tongues, he became confident, and the hitherto timid boy became a bold preacher of the Gospel everywhere. There’s no limitation as to what the Spirit of God can do in your life if you’d spend time to speak in other tongues every day, knowing that you’re speaking mysteries to God, which will provide divine wisdom.</p>
<p>Furthermore, speaking in other tongues aids “quick charge” and causes your spirit to respond quickly to divine signals. Speaking in other tongues is a great blessing. You can learn more about this from our book, <strong>“The Power of Tongues.”</strong> Get it and study it carefully and expose your spirit to the rich benefits of <em><strong>“glossolalia”</strong></em> (Greek)—speaking in tongues.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love (1 John 4:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible says God is love, a simple but very profound statement. But what does it mean? If God is love, what does He look like? Or what does love look like? For generations and thousands of years, the understanding of this revelation was obscure to many because no one had seen God (1 John 4:12). So, all they had were wild imaginations of who God was, and what love is.</p>
<p>But then came Jesus who said, <em>“…he that hath seen me hath seen the Father…”</em> (John 14:9). Jesus was God manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16). When He walked the streets of Galilee, He was the embodiment, the manifestation of God’s love. 1 John 4:9 says, <em>“In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.”</em> Jesus was love made flesh. That’s one of the most extraordinary things that I ever discovered. And it came to me like a vision: I saw love walking like a man in front of me, in the person of Jesus Christ! Truly, Jesus is the perfect description of love! What’s more?</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love”</em> (1 John 4:7-8 NKJV). That means, the proof that we know God’s love is how we show it, because we’re the expression of His character, ability and nature today. You’re the proof of God’s love.</p>
<p>You can’t claim to know God’s love if you don’t show it. His love must be demonstrated through you. It reminds of what the Bible says in Ephesians 3:10 NKJV: <em>“To the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places.”</em> This is God’s plan; His dream is to manifest Himself, His love, His divine excellence and wisdom through the Church. And it’s happening through you. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust (1 Timothy 1:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Christians, we have a ministry of reconciliation; our work of the Gospel is to reach our world and reconcile men to God. We have to do it. Those of us who have believed in Jesus Christ have been brought into fellowship with God (1 John 1:3), but the whole world isn’t. It’s our responsibility to bring them in.</p>
<p>Jesus said in Mark 16:15, <em>“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”</em> This charge wasn’t given to angels, but to us—His disciples. There’re Christians who pray to God to send angels to get people to come to Christ; but that’s not their job. Their job is to get the people in contact with us so we can minister the Gospel to them.</p>
<p>We’re the bearers of the message of salvation; we’re the ones to lead people to salvation in Christ Jesus. Somebody might say, “But in Revelation 14:6-7, we’re told about the angel that was to preach the everlasting Gospel: <em>‘And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, <strong>Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters</strong>.”’</em></p>
<p>The message of this angel wasn’t a message of salvation, but of judgment as seen in the underlined portion above. Preaching the Gospel of salvation is an assignment clearly cut out for us. In Acts 10, the Bible tells us how an angel was sent to a Roman soldier by the name of Cornelius (Acts 10:1-3). But the angel didn’t preach the Gospel to Cornelius. Instead, the angel got him to make contact with Simon Peter who came and preached to Cornelius and his household, and they received salvation.</p>
<p>What an honourable assignment it is for us to be the bearers of the message of salvation to the ends of the earth! Blessed be God! You should be glad about that. Make it your life work. You’ve been given the opportunity to serve in the Gospel, to make His righteousness known, and establish His Kingdom in the earth and in the hearts of men. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>...The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much (James 5:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a promise of a higher realm of life for you regardless of where you are presently. But until and unless you have a compelling desire for it, you may not move to that new and higher realm of life.</p>
<p>Let’s look through the Scriptures for two examples of those whose lives were transformed as a result of their compelling desire for a change in their circumstances. In the early period of the history of the nation of Israel, some had become comfortable with the Egyptian lifestyle and possibly forgotten about the land God promised their forebears (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob).</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t until they were subjected to slavery, and the Egyptian whips bruised and tore into their skin that they remembered God’s promise. Suddenly, Israel’s desire for a change grew and God heard their cry and sent Moses, a deliverer, to bring them out of slavery and lead them into the Promised Land.</p>
<p>There’s another inspiring story of a woman named Hannah in the Book of 1 Samuel 1:1-21. She had no child because she was barren and had been in this situation for many years. Her situation seemed bearable because her husband loved her very much. However, the tide turned for her when her rival began to goad her with her condition.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she became sad and very desperate. This time, her husband’s effort to assuage her grief was meaningless; her desire for a child had become overwhelming. The Bible says, <em>“…she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore”</em> (1 Samuel 1:10).</p>
<p>In these two situations, God’s response came as a result of a strong desire for a change. So, do you desire a change in your situation today? Do you want the power of the Kingdom of God to produce results for you? Then, your heart must reach out; you must be bursting with a strong desire. This is just the beginning of the steps you need to take to make a lasting change in your life. To learn more on the subject, get our book, <strong>“When God Visits You.”</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare (1 Timothy 1:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Acts 5:26, the Bible says, <em>“Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.”</em> From the foregoing verse, there’s the captain, then there’re officers. The word “captain” is the Greek “strategos”, and that’s the commanding officer.</p>
<p>However, the word “officers” is “huperetes” (Greek), which refers to those that work with their hands; that is, those that carry out the assignment or instructions given by the “strategos”—the captain or commanding officer.</p>
<p>Then, when you read 2 Timothy 2:3, it says, <em>“Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.”</em> The word “soldier” is the Greek, “stratiotes” and it’s different from both “strategos” and “huperetes.” But when it says to “war” a good warfare as read in our opening verse, it uses “Stratiomai” for war. That refers to a commanding officer in the military expedition—a strategist. He’s not the “huperetes,” he’s not the “strategos,” but the strategist!</p>
<p>You’re required to be tough like the “strategos”; tough as a good soldier. But you’re not to carry out the “war” like the “huperetes”—the officers; rather, use prophecy. Hallelujah! Use prophecy to wage war; that’s the strategy, and it’s a strategy of the Spirit. In prophecy, you’re declaring words of power, inspired by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Use the spoken Word to frame and plan your course of life. The Word is a spiritual substance. That’s why it’s important you pray in the Spirit a lot. As you do, you’ll find yourself uttering words in your understanding that are inspired by the Spirit of God, by which you prevail over demons and the adversities of life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter (Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener, and Standby), that He may remain with you forever (John 14:16 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Holy Spirit is not some smoke or cloud, nor is He a light. He’s not a thing! The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Godhead. This is because He’s the last of the Trinity to be known by us! In Genesis 1:1, God was introduced to us as “Elohim” (Hebrew). “Elohim” in Hebrew is plural for God.</p>
<p>We’re then told in the second verse that “the Spirit of God moved over the face of the deep.” Thus, even though the Holy Spirit is the first to be revealed from “Elohim,” He’s the last that we get acquainted with because of what Jesus said to His disciples in John 14:16-17: <em>“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.”</em></p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is exactly like Jesus. He doesn’t receive power from God. In fact, He’s the POWER of God! He’s the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father. He’s not less than the Father, nor is He less than Jesus. If you went to heaven, you wouldn’t find the Holy Spirit outside the Father, for He’s in the Father.</p>
<p>On earth, His presence is everywhere! Everywhere you go as a child of God, the Holy Spirit goes with you and His presence rubs off on everything that’s connected with you. He doesn’t have a different name; “Holy Ghost” or “Holy Spirit” is a description of His person, His character.</p>
<p>Jesus said, <em>“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom <strong>the Father will send in my name…</strong>”</em> (John 14:26). This simply implies that though the Holy Spirit has no name of His own, He answers to the Name of Jesus. Oh, so many things to show you about this awesome Personality! He’s the Beauty of heaven—our Comforter, Counsellor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener and Standby. Hallelujah! Learn more about Him from our book, <strong>“The Holy Spirit And You.”</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever (Hebrews 13:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we say, “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever,” it isn’t a statement we made up, neither is it a cliche. It’s absolute TRUTH and it came from the Scriptures! Jesus hasn’t changed. He  ’s the same, yesterday, today and forever.</p>
<p>Oftentimes when people go through difficulties, in their frustration, they cry, “Oh God, where are you?” The reason is that they’re ignorant of the fact that God has already laid out a good plan for them (Ephesians 2:10). He has a good plan for every man, woman, boy or girl.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, except and unless they look into the Scriptures, they may never discover that plan. And when they don’t discover it, they may cry, beg or plead, and it’ll look like God isn’t listening to them; meanwhile, He already provided the solution ever before they were born. But how can they know, except someone shows it to them? (Romans 10:14). That’s why He sent us to preach the Gospel.</p>
<p>The Bible, for example, tells us in Psalm 33:5 that <em>“…the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.”</em> Yet, the experience of a good number of people is one of sadness, pain, frustration. Why is it so? Has God changed? Absolutely not!</p>
<p>There’re two major reasons for this, aside ignorance: the number one reason is that there’s a devil that makes them blind to God’s perfect will. The second reason is that other human beings who are inspired by Satan and the demons of darkness afflict other people with their selfishness and greed. They’ve used their own wickedness to frustrate other men. It’s man’s inhumanity to man.</p>
<p>God knew what would happen and that’s the reason He planned the answer long before you came. The answer is Jesus Christ! If you embrace the life that He brought and walk in the light of it, His glory will be manifested in your life. And in spite of the two aforementioned factors, you can use the power of His Name to live above Satan and the systems of this world. His Name has power in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth.</p>
