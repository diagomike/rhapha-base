<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof (Proverbs 18:21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, a gentleman came into one of our meetings with his weak and deathly-ill wife. When he noticed that I had ministered to several people and was getting ready to round off the meeting, he tried to get my attention. Crying profusely, he dropped his wife, who lay helplessly on the platform!</p>
<p>The ushers tried to get him organized, but he wouldn’t stop; he was in tears. When I heard him and turned in his direction, I asked, “What’s the matter?” He said, “My wife is dying.” But I needed to get his attention. Sternly, I said to him, “You’re saying the wrong things. If you say she’s dying, that’s what you’re going to get!”</p>
<p>Then, I asked him, “What exactly do you want? Do you want her to live or die?” I was tough on him, even though he was desperate. Then, he said, “I want her to live.” I instructed that he put his hand on her, call her name and tell her to live and not die! When he called her name and said those words, something happened. Just a few seconds afterwards, the woman who had been so weak and sickly, unable to stand by herself, jumped up excitedly; her body had received strength! They had a miracle. Hallelujah! </p>
<p>But you see, she could have died. Someone had to teach her husband what to do and what to say. He had to say the right thing because death and life are in the power of the tongue. When sickness attacks your body, that’s death attacking your body; you have to wake up to it and say, “No; in the Name of Jesus, I refuse to be sick!”</p>
<p>You have to speak life to your body, for the Gospel we have received is a gospel of life; life has come to us. Hallelujah! If, for example, a Christian is diagnosed with a heart condition, by words, that heart can be mended or he or she can even have a new heart. It’s about what you say. Words are so important in the Kingdom of God. By your words you can consistently chart your course in victory and success; you can recreate the circumstances of your life and walk in health perpetually. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord (Luke 2:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus Christ is the Saviour of the world. This is one of the tenets of our faith upon which all of the Gospel rests. That’s why the verse above is very important. In Matthew 1:21, the Bible says*, “And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.”*</p>
<p>Jesus Christ is the only One who could save man to the uttermost and make the divine life available and possible for all men to receive. He saved the world by giving His own self as a sacrifice. He paid the full penalty for the sins of all men and took our place of condemnation.</p>
<p>The Bible says <em>“…God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men’s sins against them”</em> (2 Corinthians 5:19 NIV). 2 Corinthians 8:9 says*, “For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.”* His vicarious death was for our sake. 2 Corinthians 5:21 says, <em>“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”</em> </p>
<p>When He was crucified, He became us on the Cross. God had said, <em>“The soul that sinneth, it shall die (spiritual death) …</em>” (Ezekiel 18:20). Romans 5:12 says, <em>“Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned.”</em> Spiritual death is separation from God. Jesus took our place and experienced that separation from the Father when He hung on the Cross.</p>
<p>But thanks be unto God! Man’s salvation was consummated when Jesus Christ—the Lamb of God—was offered to take away the sins of the world (John 1:29). 1 John 4:14 says, <em>“And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Words are powerful, but the Word of God is all-powerful. The Word made all things. The Word of God is God. God manifests Himself in and through the Word. The Word of God is life. The Word of God is light. The Word of God is truth. </p>
<p>The Word lives and abides forever (1 Peter 1:23). Hebrews 4:12 says, <em>“For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword….”</em> The thirteenth verse says, <em>“Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.”</em></p>
<p>These attributes of the Word are the attributes of Deity. So, when you stake your life on the Word, you’re staking your life on God. And He never fails. The Scriptures describe the infallibility and immutability of God’s Word: <em>“Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath: That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us”</em> (Hebrews 6:17-18).</p>
<p>Can you see why you should always stay your mind on the Word of God? The Bible says He keeps in perfect peace—peace of prosperity—the one whose mind is stayed on Him (Isaiah 26:3). You stay your mind on Him through meditation.</p>
<p>Give the Word time and attention. Place a premium on the Word. Consciously affirm the Word, irrespective of the challenges you face, and the Spirit will alter things in your favour. Blessed be God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover (Mark 16:17-18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our theme scripture outlines some of the signs of our divinity. One of them is our dominion and power over sickness, disease and infirmities. Not only do we have power to cast out devils, we have power to heal sicknesses and cure diseases. Jesus made us healers. He said in Matthew 10:8, <em>“Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.”</em> Notice He didn’t say, “Pray to me to heal the sick.”</p>
<p>He said in Luke 10:19, <em>“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”</em> He made us superior to Satan, who is majorly responsible for most of the sicknesses that people suffer with. Why then are there Christians who are still buffeted by sickness, disease and Satan, in spite of these realities?</p>
<p>Psalm 82:5-7 gives us the answer. It says, <em>“They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness…I have said, ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.”</em> Many are ignorant of God’s Word and as a result, they’re not aware that they have power over sickness and disease; they’re not conscious that they have the divine life.</p>
<p>Jesus said in John 10:34: <em>“…Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?”</em> Peter calls us <em>“Partakers of the divine nature”</em> (2 Peter 1:4). Paul says, “We’re more than conquerors” (Romans 8:37). Sickness, really, can’t and shouldn’t thrive in your body, because Christ is the life of your physical body. The Holy Spirit in you already gave life to, and vitalized, your physical body (Romans 8:11). Believe and act on these truths today. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>…But his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay (Jeremiah 20:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Gospel to have gotten to us in our day, some people had to pay the ultimate price. Some ministers and saints of God sacrificed their lives for this message to get to us. There was a time in the not too distant past, when the possession of a Bible either put one in prison or got one killed. Those who printed Bibles did so in hiding.</p>
<p>Today, we have Bibles everywhere. On your phone, you could even have many translations. But this didn’t happen by chance; it’s the result of the faith, prayers, and labour of many before us. That’s why it’s important for us in our day to wake up. We should be inspired by the examples of those who fought to take the message to places where the Gospel wasn’t known.</p>
<p>If you were a driver for example, who regularly conveys passengers from one location to the other, this should inspire you to preach to your passengers. It makes no difference whether or not they’re happy to hear your message. Once they get into your vehicle, you’re in control, because you have them in that space for the rest of the journey. The most they can do if they don’t want to hear you is to request to alight from your vehicle.</p>
<p>Are you a CEO or do you hold an influential position in your organization? You can use your position of influence to preach the Gospel to your employees. Don’t let it bother you that some of them may want to leave because you preached to them. Remember, God gave you the business in the first place. You therefore have to boldly preach to them, not with the aim of forcing them, but to provide them a chance to hear and believe in Jesus Christ for salvation.</p>
<p>Think of what others went through fighting for the opportunities you now have all around you today. The time is short, and the return of the Master is at hand. Ensure you take advantage of every opportunity the Lord has given you to witness to others. Don’t hold back; get wild with the Gospel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light (Colossians 1:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How gracious and loving the Lord is! Think about what we just read in our opening verse: it’s not a promise but something He’s already done. He qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. </p>
<p>Ephesians 1:11 says in Him we have obtained an inheritance. Part of that inheritance is described for us in Ephesians 3:8 (AMPC) as unsearchable riches*: “…to proclaim to the Gentiles the unending (boundless, fathomless, incalculable, and exhaustless) riches of Christ [wealth which no human being could have searched out].”*</p>
<p>The whole world belongs to Jesus Christ; He bought the whole field. The Bible says the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof. Romans 8:17 says we’re joint-heirs with Him. Thus, part of your inheritance is the whole world. This is absolute truth from God’s Word. 1 Corinthians 3:21-22 says, <em>“…For all things are yours; Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world…all are yours.”</em></p>
<p>Then, think about the fact that God brought you into fellowship with Himself and made you one with Himself; it explains it all. He gave you Himself! What could be greater than that? Now you’re a partaker of His glory, grace and righteousness, a partaker of His divine nature. This is huge!</p>
<p>It’s the reason you must be bold in your life and live without fear or sense of lack or want, because you’re the heir of the Monarch of the universe. This life of extraordinary blessings that He’s given you isn’t the result of your “good works” or personal deeds of righteousness; it’s His grace at work. He qualified you to inherit and walk in the fullness of the blessings of the Gospel. Study the Word to know more of your inheritance and wonderful blessings in Christ, and live in those blessings every day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble (James 4:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible says God searches the heart; He discerns the thoughts and intents of your heart. He wants you to watch your heart always and rid it of anything that’s inconsistent with the divine nature in you. Always, He wants to see love and humility in your heart.</p>
<p>He doesn’t want you to look at or treat anyone with disdain. He wants you to be humble enough to believe in others; believe the Lord can use them as much as He can use you. Perhaps in your family, workplace or in your church, someone does something remarkable that’s being commended; don’t sneer in disdain. Genuinely celebrate others for their accomplishments.</p>
<p>Learn to sincerely bless the Lord, praise and worship Him when He does something remarkable in another person’s life. When it seems others are esteemed above you, it shouldn’t hurt you; be full of joy for them. Another person’s success doesn’t mean that you’re failing. Therefore, celebrate the success of others. When God sees such love and humility in your heart, He’ll promote you. He exalts the humble.</p>
<p>No matter what God does through us, He never wants us to be proud. Be proud of Him and what He’s made you. Be proud of His glory in your life, but never exalt yourself above someone else. Romans 12:3 says, <em>“For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.”</em></p>
<p>The 10th verse says, <em>“Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another.”</em> The Bible says, <em>“By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life”</em> (Proverbs 22:4). Hallelujah! Be that man or woman who’s known for being loving, gracious, excellent and humble.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified (Acts 20:32).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people have made shipwreck of their faith because they believed certain dreams and revelations they claimed came from God. In the New Testament, God doesn’t lead us through dreams. He guides us through the Word and the Holy Spirit. We can always depend on the Holy Spirit to lead and guide us through our spirits and through the Word.</p>
<p>You might be quick to ask, “How about Acts 2:17? Doesn’t it indicate that God still leads through dreams?” No, He doesn’t. Dreams were for the sense-knowledge generation of men. Since the Holy Spirit came, you don’t find the apostles or anyone in the New Testament being ministered to in a dream. The Holy Spirit, nonetheless, does lead by visions and other revelations such as prophecy, the inward witness, and other gifts of the Spirit.</p>
<p>However, any vision, prophecy or revelation that doesn’t align with the Word is not from God. It brings to mind the story of a certain sick man who had been a Christian for many years and had a vision where someone walked into the room, wearing sandals and a white robe, and covered with a cloud. He recounted that as he looked from the person’s feet upwards to make out his face, the image suddenly spoke and said, “It’s not my will to heal you” and disappeared.</p>
<p>He immediately believed it was Jesus, because he said he “felt” the presence of God. From then on, he believed it wasn’t God’s will to heal him. What made him think it was Jesus who appeared to him? Was it because the person was in a white robe? Was it because the person was covered with a cloud?</p>
<p>Those aren’t enough reasons to assume it was Jesus. If, in a vision, you heard a voice that tells you something that’s inconsistent with the Scriptures, then it’s questionable. The question to ask is, does God want people well? Emphatically yes! Read 3 John 1:2. He’ll never come to you in a dream or vision to tell you anything contrary. He never contradicts Himself. Every revelation must be subjected to the Word of God! This is the reason you must study the Word and know it for yourself.</p>

<p><em><strong>So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation (Hebrews 9:28).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible lets us know that the end of all things is near; the coming of the Lord is so close: “<em>But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer”</em> (1 Peter 4:7). The question is, are you watching for His return? Are you expecting Him?</p>
<p>There’re Christians who aren’t taking this seriously; therefore, they’re casual with their relationship with God and complacent about their Christianity. They’re like the 5 foolish virgins the Bible talks about (Matthew 25) who weren’t expecting the return of their master and were unprepared when he eventually came.</p>
<p>Don’t be among those who say, “This talk of Jesus coming soon has been on for ages, when is it ever going to happen?” Such folks will be caught unawares when it eventually happens because they weren’t expecting Him. The Bible says only those who are expecting Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation. The events and happenings around the world today are clear indications that His appearing is imminent.</p>
<p>Don’t be caught “sleeping.” When the Apostle Paul in 1 Thessalonians 5:6 admonished us not to sleep, he wasn’t talking about physical sleep. He was talking about spiritual sleep, when you’re so deep into worldly things that you become unaware and oblivious of the spiritual realities around you. Jesus told us to watch and pray, <em>“…for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh”</em> (Matthew 24:44).</p>
<p>We’re on a crusade to reach at least 7 billion people with the Gospel and get them ready for the Rapture; be a part of it. We want our towns, villages, cities and the nations of the world to be emptied for the Rapture. This is our drive; we’re leaving no stone unturned in ensuring no one is left behind.

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away (2 Timothy 3:1-5).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re in the last days, and you have to learn to walk in the knowledge of God’s Word. We’re in what the Bible shows as “difficult or perilous times.” Here’s how The Living Bible renders verse one of our opening scripture: <em>“You may as well know this too, Timothy, that in the last days it is going to be very difficult to be a Christian.”</em></p>
<p>Why is it going to be difficult for some? It’s because of the choices they have to make: unpopular choices. I’m talking about such choices as standing for truth and righteousness, refusing to compromise your faith, sticking to the Word—doing what the Word says—rather than what’s convenient.</p>
<p>There’re those who are going to compromise and make decisions because of money and earthly favours. As a result, they’ll do the wrong things; things that aren’t consistent with the Christian walk. That shouldn’t be you. Don’t make a decision in life because it’s popular opinion; never follow the crowd.</p>
<p>Remember what Jesus said: <em>“Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it”</em> (Matthew 7:13-14). This is very instructive.</p>
<p>Let the knowledge of God’s Word—the wisdom of God— guide the choices and decisions that you make. It makes no difference that you’re the only one taking a stand for Jesus Christ and for the Gospel in your estate, neighbourhood, school or place of work; keep at it. Refuse to compromise. Rather, remain <em>“…stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord”</em> (1 Corinthians 15:58).</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way (2 Thessalonians 2:7 ESV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re three restrainers of evil the Bible talks about; one is the government. Romans 13:1-4 tells us that the powers that be are ordained of God and that they’re established to restrain evil. The second restrainer of evil is the Holy Spirit. Jesus said, <em>“And when He</em> (the Holy Spirit) <em>has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment”</em> (John 16:8 NKJV).</p>
<p>The third restrainer of evil is the Church. Jesus said we’re the light of the world (Matthew 5:14), and when light shines, darkness recedes. Among these three restrainers of evil, the Church is the one who restrains evil by the power of the Holy Spirit. The scripture states that the restrainer will be “taken out of the way.” That certainly wouldn’t be referring to government, because there’ll be governments during the reign of the Antichrist. In fact, when the Antichrist comes, he’ll establish a government.</p>
<p>Also, the Holy Spirit won’t be removed from the earth after the Antichrist is revealed, because He’s going to cause 144,000 Jewish men to carry out ministry in the earth after the Rapture. The Bible tells us a large multitude of people gave their hearts to the Lord during the Great Tribulation, and the only way those people could have been saved is through the ministry of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>So, out of the three restrainers of evil, only the Church will be taken away before the Antichrist is manifested. The Church is expected by God to restrain evil today. We’re the light of the world and the salt of the earth (Matthew 5:13-14). When we decree a thing, it’s established unto us. Satan can’t lord it over the nations; he can’t perpetuate his wickedness in the nations of the world and in the lives of men as he desires to because we’re putting him in check. We’ll continue to restrain him and reign gloriously in the earth by Jesus Christ until the Rapture takes place. Glory to God!</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord (Ephesians 5:19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase “spiritual songs” in the verse above means songs of the spirit. The Apostle Paul made the same reference in 1 Corinthians 14:14-15 when he talked about singing in tongues—singing in the spirit: <em>“For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will <strong>sing with the spirit</strong>, and I will sing with the understanding also.”</em> Singing with the spirit is singing in other tongues. These songs come out of your spirit, not from your understanding. It’s similar to the way you yield your tongue to the Holy Spirit to pray in tongues, only that this time, you’re singing in other tongues and worshipping the Lord.</p>
<p>Jesus said, <em>“God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth”</em> (John 4:24). Worshipping in the spirit is the climax. You may sing and worship the Lord in your understanding and that’s okay, but ascend higher; sing songs of the Spirit, from your spirit! Worship and relate from your spirit; it’s a deeper fellowship.</p>
<p>Your songs of the spirit are songs of worship and praise to the Lord. Those listening to you may not like the tune or melody, but it makes no difference. You’re not singing to them; you’re singing to the Lord! You’re making melodies of worship to the Lord, just as praying in tongues isn’t unto men but unto God (1 Corinthians 14:2).</p>
<p>Worshipping in the spirit brings about a divine exchange; as your spirit passes words in the spirit to God, the Holy Spirit imparts information to your spirit. When you’re through with such sessions of worship and fellowship, you’re full of the Spirit and are in dominion. At that point, nothing moves you. You’re more than certain of your victory. Your spirit has the dominion!</p>
<p>Christianity is a life of the spirit, lived from the inside out. Therefore, learn to worship the Lord in the spirit, with your spirit, and by the Holy Spirit: <em>“For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh”</em> (Philippians 3:3).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night… for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success (Joshua 1:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you know that your prosperity and how well you succeed in life depends on you? This is clear from our theme verse above. It says if you meditate on the Word day and night, you’ll make your own way prosperous and have good success.</p>
<p>You may have found yourself in certain circumstances you had nothing to do with. For example, you may have been born into a poor home; that wasn’t your making. But it’s up to you to do something about it. You may have been born poor, but you weren’t born to be poor.</p>
<p>The Word of God shows you the principles of prosperity, but it’s up to you to apply them and change your estate. As much as He wants you prosperous, as much as He wants you healthy, happy and strong, you have a vital role in making His dream for you come to reality. He said in 3 John 1:2, <em>“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”</em> 2 Peter 1:3 says, <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness….”</em> He’s already done everything and given you everything you require for an extraordinary life of success, and extraordinary prosperity.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:3 says, <em>“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.”</em> What then? Act on the Word! If there’s a situation in your life you want changed, the Word is your answer. Trust the Word. Meditate on it day and night as He has said. That isn’t something God or anyone can do for you. 1 Timothy 4:15 tells you the inevitable result: your progress and prosperity will “appear to all”—“phaneros” (Greek); that means apparent, undeniable and unending; it’ll spread abroad. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life (John 8:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord Jesus is our perfect example in everything: He was humility personified. You couldn’t follow or emulate Him and miss your way. He said, <em>“…he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”</em> You couldn’t follow His steps and walk in pride; it’s impossible.</p>
<p>There’re those who say they’re afraid pride might take a hold of them, no; not when you truly know and follow Jesus. The way to follow Him is through the Word. Be a doer of the Word. 1 Peter 5:5 says, <em>“Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.”</em></p>
<p>Be submissive to the Lord and His Word; that’s true humility. In Philippians 2:3 (AMPC), the Spirit adjures, <em>“Do nothing from factional motives [through contentiousness, strife, selfishness, or for unworthy ends] or prompted by conceit and empty arrogance. Instead, in the true spirit of humility (lowliness of mind) let each regard the others as better than and superior to himself [thinking more highly of one another than you do of yourselves].”</em> In essence, He’s saying, “Be humble!” Never disdain your brothers and sisters in Christ, especially your leaders in the Lord; be submissive.</p>
<p>Pride is of the devil. It led to his self-exultation; and for his haughtiness, God kicked him out of his place of honour. Make the conscious decision to walk in humility. It’s part of the manifestation of the life of Christ in you. It brings promotion. The Bible says God resists the proud and gives more grace to the humble. That grace results in honour, increase, enlargement and progress. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest (Luke 10:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, <em>“…Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest”</em> (John 4:35). There’s been such a great harvest of souls into the Kingdom in these last days. The Lord is doing a quick work.</p>
<p>We’ll yet witness a greater move of the Spirit that’ll culminate in an unprecedented harvest of souls in places like China, the Middle East, and other regions that many had thought would be difficult to penetrate. These vast fields of souls are ripe and will be massively reached with the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>God has given us the most sublime assignment of all time, which is preaching the Gospel to every creature. He could have used the angels to minister or preach the Gospel for the salvation of men, but He didn’t. He chose us for it instead.</p>
<p>We’ve been entrusted with the most important news and message in all the world, for every generation: the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which He said shall be <em>“…preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”</em> (Matthew 24:14). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Be fervent in spirit, and preach the Gospel anywhere and everywhere. Let the light of Christ shine through you continually. Lead people to Christ. His message that we bear is filled with divine power to save and transform men’s lives. Therefore, proclaim it with intensity. Challenge, warn, and urge those around you who haven’t received Christ to do so. We’re in the time of great harvest, and the grace of God for salvation has been poured out upon all men.</p>

<p><em><strong>Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water (Hebrews 10:22).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a glance, our opening verse seems to suggest that we should draw close to God and have our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and then have our bodies washed with pure water. But if that’s true, who’s going to do the sprinkling? This is why some people today sprinkle some liquid on people and say, “This is the blood of Jesus.” But that’s wrong.</p>
<p>Nobody can sprinkle the blood of Jesus today. So, don’t do it. The Bible doesn’t say, <em>“…having our <strong>bodies</strong> sprinkled…”</em>; rather, it says our hearts. That means it’s the sprinkling of the heart, and what that verse is saying is that your heart has already been sprinkled from an evil conscience. It’s not an ongoing process; it’s been done already!</p>
<p>Some other translations, like the Rotherham’s, put it more clearly. It says, <em>“Let us approach with a genuine heart, in full assurance of faith, <strong>having been sprinkled</strong>, as to our hearts, from an evil conscience, and bathed, as to our bodies, with pure water.”</em> Hallelujah! If you don’t understand this, you’ll be trying to do what God has already done, and it won’t work.</p>
<p>When it says, “…our bodies washed with pure water,” it’s akin to what we have in 1 Corinthians 6:11: <em>“And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”</em> Hallelujah! When you were born again, you were baptised into Christ (Baptism of the Holy Spirit); the Holy Spirit came upon you to live in you.</p>
<p>His purpose of coming upon you was to make your body His temple, the tabernacle where He now dwells. But first, He must wash that temple; He must purify and sanctify it. That’s His work, and at the New Birth, He sanctified your body and made it His home. He has made your heart His Home! Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men. It teaches us to say “No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ (Titus 2:11-13 NIV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Word of God is replete with incontrovertible proofs that Jesus is Himself, God. He’s our great God! Sadly, there’re Christians who haven’t come to this realization. That’s why they still wonder how come He says He’s the Son of God if actually He is Himself, God. Well, the expression “Son of God” means God in human flesh!</p>
<p>In His manifestation in the flesh, Jesus put aside His glory so He could be a hundred per cent man and a hundred per cent God. That’s what legitimized His substitutionary work in our behalf; otherwise, it would have been questionable. The Bible says He <em>“…made himself of no reputation, and…was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross”</em> (Philippians 2:7-8).</p>
<p>Jesus is God’s perfect imprint, the icon of the unseen God (Colossians 1:15, Hebrews 1:3). Hallelujah! But who was He before He came as a man? He was the Word, God’s Word: <em>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God”</em> (John 1:1). Then the 14th verse says, <em>“And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us….”</em> The Word that was God, became flesh and He was named Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>In John 10:30, He said, “I and my Father are one.” When He made that assertion, the Bible says the Jews picked up stones to stone Him to death, because they understood what He meant. They said, <em>“…For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and <strong>because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God</strong>”</em> (John 10:33). He wasn’t making Himself God; He was, and He is, God!</p>
<p>He said in John 14:7, <em>“If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.”</em> Who did they know and see that He equated to the Father? Jesus! When Philip expressed doubt in the ensuing verse 8, the response from Jesus climaxed the discussion in a most unambiguous way. He said, <em>“…Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father…”</em> (John 14:9). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death (Proverbs 16:25).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 Samuel 15, we read about Saul and how God led him to victory over the Amalekites. God gave him specific instructions to completely destroy the Amalekites, including their livestock. But Saul and the people destroyed the things that they didn’t want and then kept some choice spoils for themselves. They even kept the king alive. </p>
<p>Displeased with Saul, God said, <em>“It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments…”</em> (1 Samuel 15:11). How regrettable! Saul was the king, and the people were supposed to follow him, while he was expected to follow the Lord. But he disobeyed God’s direct instructions repeatedly.</p>
<p>When Samuel the prophet confronted him about his error, he blamed it on the people. He said, <em>“...For the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed”</em> (1 Samuel 15:15). Bad enough that he didn’t follow the clear instructions God gave him, he also refused to take responsibility for his actions, blaming the people instead.</p>
<p>Of course, Saul lost out on God’s plan following his wilful disobedience. Subsequently, the Bible says “The Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit troubled him” (1 Samuel 16:14). Always follow God’s instructions; follow His Word, His plans and His guidance.</p>
<p>Some people pursue ambitions that have no connection with the purpose of God for their lives. They’re not yielded to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Don’t live like that. Follow what the Spirit tells you to do. He’s the One who unveils mysteries and divine secrets to you and helps you to discover yourself in God’s dream.</p>
<p>Whatever idea or plan you have, be sure it’s consistent with His Word—His perfect will. Yield to the lordship and guidance of His Word. His Word is light, and if you follow Him in the Word, you’ll not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life! You’ll be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.</p>

<p><em><strong>[For I always pray to] the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation [of insight into mysteries and secrets] in the [deep and intimate] knowledge of Him (Ephesians 1:17 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Matthew 16:13-20, Jesus asked His disciples a pressing pair of questions bordering on His identity. First, He asked them, “Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?”</p>
<p>After getting their responses, He then asked the second question: <em>“...But whom say ye that I am?”</em> (Matthew 16:15). The Bible says, <em>“…Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God”</em> (Matthew 16:16). Peter’s confession of Jesus as the Christ was a revelation from God, but Peter didn’t know it; He thought it was his reasoning.</p>
<p>Jesus had to tell him: <em>“...Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven”</em> (Matthew 16: 17). Hallelujah! Just like Peter, many of God’s people have received revelations from God. Think about it: How did you know Jesus is the Christ? It’s the Holy Spirit that revealed it to your spirit. The Bible says, <em>“…no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost”</em> (1 Corinthians 12:3).</p>
<p>You believe the Virgin Birth of Jesus Christ; you read about it in the Scriptures and believed. That was the Holy Spirit granting you insight into that mystery. Likewise, the resurrection of Jesus Christ; you weren’t there when it happened, but you believe.</p>
<p>Also, you believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that He died for your sins and God raised Him from the dead, and He’s alive today; that’s a revelation from God. Your brain can’t figure out such truths. Science can never give them to you. You have them in your spirit because God made them known to your spirit.</p>
<p>It’s part of the ministry of the Spirit in us: the unveiling of truth. So, trust Him with your life. Make knowing Him more and living His Word your greatest passion. Through that fellowship, He’ll keep unveiling Himself and the greater mysteries of the Kingdom to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth… (Psalm 138:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oftentimes, people like to distinguish between praise and worship because they think they have major differences. But not really; praise is worship. Praise is one of the things you do when you worship God. In fact, it’s the highest part of worship. The simple difference between them is that worship includes other things you do for the Lord. For example, your service to God is an act of worship.</p>
<p>Once you clearly understand praise as the highest part of worship, you’ll realize how important it is in your relationship with God. The Bible says, <em>“Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ”</em> (1 Peter 2:5).</p>
<p>The Church is a holy priesthood assigned to offer up spiritual sacrifices to God, and there are different kinds of sacrifices. An example is when you give up something valuable for God or you volunteer your time through missionary activities. But the highest sacrifices are the sacrifices of praise.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name”</em> (Hebrews 13:15). Notice that it says we’re to offer our sacrifice of praise to God continually, not just once in a while. This shows just how important it is. Paul describes it as the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His Name.</p>
<p>David made a similar reference in Psalm 69:30-31. He said, <em>“I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving. This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.”</em> Did you see that? He said, “I will magnify him with thanksgiving.”</p>
<p>The next verse lets us know that carrying out this act of praise to God is a massive testimony; it says, <em>“The humble shall see this, and be glad…”</em> (Psalm 69:32). Even now, give thanks to the Lord. Praise Him lavishly from your heart; think of something you want to thank Him for and then go ahead to praise Him profusely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it (John 14:13-14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we say that Jesus gave us the power of attorney to use His Name, many don’t understand what this means. The term “power of attorney” refers to a legal authorization that gives a designated person the power to act on one’s behalf. It therefore means that every request you make is as though Jesus were the one making it, since you’re making it in His Name.</p>
<p>The Apostle John, in some of his writings, vividly captures the words of Jesus that further elucidates the legal authority we’ve been given in His Name. For example, in John 14:13-14, Jesus said, <em>“And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.”</em> Here, the Lord was talking about making a demand in His Name. That’s extraordinary.</p>
<p>It’s like what Paul tells us in Colossians 3:17: <em>“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus….”</em> There’s another beautiful reference in John 16:23; it says, <em>“And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.”</em></p>
<p> When He said, “And in that day…,” the Lord was referring to the day of the new deal—the day of salvation that He came to consummate. That day began from His resurrection. So, we’re in “that day” where we use and live in His Name. If you’ve ever wondered why all over the world, we use the Name of Jesus in prayer, this is the reason.</p>
<p>So, right now, use His Name to effect changes in your world. He told us we could, and you should! Address issues in your nation, your physical body, your workplace, school etc., in His Name and expect a change.</p>

<p><em><strong>But I, GOD, search the heart and examine the mind. I get to the heart of the human. I get to the root of things. I treat them as they really are, not as they pretend to be (Jeremiah 17:10 MSG).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re remarkable instances in Scripture that help us understand that the Lord indeed tests men’s hearts. Consider the story of David, how God chose him from the house of Jesse and the very significant rejection of his brother, Eliab. Eliab, from the outward appearance, was everything you’d want in a leader. The moment he showed up, and Samuel the Prophet saw him, he said, <em>“…Surely the Lord’s anointed is before him”</em> (1 Samuel 16:6).</p>
<p>However, the Bible says, <em>“But the LORD said unto Samuel, <strong>Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him</strong>…for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart”</em> (1 Samuel 16:7). Notice the Lord’s choice of words; He didn’t say, “Don’t anoint Eliab, for I have not chosen him.” If He had said that, it would mean Eliab wasn’t even considered in the first place. But the Lord said, “I have refused him.” It means that God considered him and said, “No!”</p>
<p>Did Eliab ever know that he was considered by God to someday be king over Israel? No! But God considered him and found him wanting. The story of Abraham is another case in point, this time, a positive one, because Abraham passed the test. After years of wanting a child, he and Sarah eventually had a son at their old age. But one day, the Bible says God tested Abraham. He asked him to offer his only son, Isaac, as a sacrifice (Genesis 22:2). God didn’t announce to Abraham, “Hey I want to test you now,” no! But Abraham demonstrated his faith that God could raise Isaac from the dead, and symbolically, that’s exactly what happened (Hebrews 11:17-19). He trusted completely in the Lord and obeyed.</p>
<p>You may never know when you’re being tested or considered for the next level of your assignment and promotion. The important thing is for you not to be found wanting. It’s the reason you must walk in faith, hope and love. Be humble, and always be at your best, not in hypocrisy, but in integrity of heart and in uprightness, for God indeed sees your heart.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God (Matthew 22:29).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The knowledge of God’s word is so important. Jesus said to the Jews, <em>“...Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God”</em> (Matthew 22:29). What Jesus said to the Jews back then is still very relevant in our day. It becomes even worse when one is a minister, a leader, or a teacher of the Word, and doesn’t know the Scriptures.</p>
<p>When Jesus made the assertion in our opening scripture, think about the fact that He was addressing the leaders that the whole nation of Israel trusted to give them the knowledge of God. So much trust was reposed in them, but it turned out they were ignorant.</p>
<p>The same leaders of the Jews were the ones who, ignorantly, condemned Jesus Christ. They called the Lord all derogatory names and discouraged the people from believing in Him. They condemned Him to death, and before their very eyes, Jesus was reviled, insulted, assaulted, and crucified. They called Jesus a deceiver, but they were the ones deceiving and being deceived.</p>
<p>No wonder Paul, in one of his writings, said, <em>“The experts of our day haven’t a clue about what this eternal plan is. If they had, they wouldn’t have killed the Master of the God-designed life on a cross”</em> (1 Corinthians 2:8 MSG). Paul had his share of these malicious attacks fomented by the Jewish leaders.</p>
<p>On one occasion, he and his colleagues were in Thessalonica to preach. As Paul preached in their synagogue, some Gentiles and many important women believed his message. But the Jewish leaders were offended, and then incited some insurrectionists to start a riot in the city (Acts 17). They were ignorant of God’s plan of salvation for the Gentiles.</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge of the Scriptures makes people do a lot of terrible things. Even Paul alluded to the danger of ignorance and how it led him to persecute the Church before his conversion: <em>“And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry; Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief”</em> (1 Timothy 1:12-13).</p>
<p>Get to know the Word; study the Scriptures for yourself like the Bible says: <em>“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth”</em> (2 Timothy 2:15).</p>

<p><em><strong>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace (Romans 8:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t you just love the Scriptures? Think about what we just read: it says, if you’re carnally minded, it’ll lead to death. But if you’re spiritually minded, you’ll have life and peace. Simple scripture; but absolutely profound! </p>
<p>So check your life; are you living in agitation? Is your life void of peace? When people are flustered, distraught, disturbed and confused, it’s because they’re not being spiritually minded. The Word is clear: when you’re spiritually minded, you’ll have life and peace.</p>
<p>Being spiritually minded or carnally minded is about the work of your mind, where you focus the attention of your mind. Carnally-minded people only respond to the things of this world; they’re flesh-ruled. Your focus at all times should be on God’s Word and the eternal realities of the Kingdom. That way, in the midst of troubles and chaos, you’d always have peace, a life without agitations!</p>
<p>Isaiah 26:3 says God keeps in perfect peace—in the peace of prosperity—the one whose mind is focused on Him: <em>“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church (Ephesians 1:22).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible says God has put all things under the feet of Jesus. This is such a powerful and profound truth. If all things are under the feet of Jesus, it means all things are under the Church, which is His body. Jesus is the head; the Bible calls the Church <em>“the fulness of him”</em> (Ephesians 1:23). That means without the Church, Jesus is incomplete in this world.</p>
<p>It’s like your physical body; your head is at the top then you have the rest of your body, right down to your feet. No matter where you stand or on what you stand, even the lowest member of your body—the tip of your toes—is above where you’re standing or what you’re standing on.</p>
<p>So, when the Bible says God has put all things under the feet of Jesus and made Him the head over all things for the sake of His body, the church, it means as a member of the body of Christ, a Christian, it doesn’t matter what role you occupy in the body (the Church) or what place in the body of Christ you belong; as long as you’re in Christ, you’re above all things.</p>
<p>I would to God that everyone in the body of Christ will come to an understanding of this truth. In the Body of Christ, no one is insignificant; but even if you thought you were insignificant, you’re still above all things. This has nothing to do with your own might or ability; it’s the result of who you are: a member of the body of Christ!</p>
<p>You’re above sickness and disease. You’re above Satan, darkness and death. You’re above the deception, corruption, falsehood and crippling influences that ravage men’s lives in this natural world. You’re above the world!</p>
<p>Always remember who you are; as Jesus is, so are you in this world (1 John 4:17). As He is seated in dominion and great glory, far above all principalities, powers, might, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come, so are you. Therefore, reign and rule over the world, for He’s placed all things under your feet. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ (Titus 2:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s easy for some to be carried away by the activities of this world and just go on like the world will always be the way it’s been.</p>
<p>When we talk about the Rapture of the church, there’re still those who think it’s a ruse. That’s because they haven’t read their Bibles. The Bible does tell us about the Rapture (read 1 Thessalonians 4:15–17). 1 Corinthians 15:51–53 says, <em>“Behold, I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”</em></p>
<p>Notice that this will happen in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye; that means in a split second we will be out of this world! The Rapture isn’t going to be a long process. It’s not like the Second Coming in which the Lord will be in the air for long enough for all the nations to see Him; no! The Rapture of the Church will be in an instant—in a flash and it’s all done—we’re all gone; but it’s for those who are waiting for Him, who are expecting Him. </p>
<p>Hebrews 9:28 says, <em>“…and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”</em> Do you love His appearing? Are you looking forward to His return? While many of us are saying, “Even so, come, Lord Jesus,” some are hoping His coming will be delayed, because of their carnality. Don’t get stuck in that rut!</p>
<p>Some of the very last words of the Master in the entire Bible is, <em>“...Surely I come quickly...”</em> (Revelation 22:20); there’ll be no delay. So, if you haven’t been living right like one who’s expecting Him, repent, because there isn’t much time left. Take your fellowship with God very seriously. Be like the wise servants the Bible talks about, who are waiting for and expecting their master (Luke 12:36-38).</p>

<p><em><strong>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him (Colossians 3:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Name of Jesus never fails. No wonder Paul said whatever you do in speech or deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jesus. To do all things in the Name of Jesus doesn’t mean that when you want to clean your shoes or floor, for example, you say, “I clean these shoes in the Name of Jesus,” or “I wipe this floor in Jesus’ Name”; no!</p>
<p>What it means is that you’re to live your life in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. In all situations and circumstances, your life proclaims the Name of Jesus Christ; you live as His representative. You live your life every day in and with the consciousness of the power, glory and dominion of His Name.</p>
<p>When you do this, you won’t struggle with some health troubles; your life will be an unending stream of blessings and the supernatural. You’ll have no consciousness of need, because the power and glory of His Name make all things right with you, for you, and in you.</p>
<p>The question is, “How do you live in His Name and as His representative?” It’s simple; first, become conscious of His life in you. 1 John 5:11 says, <em>“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.”</em> This life is both death-proof and disease-proof! Secondly, never live in fear. Live in boldness.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “<em>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love”</em> (1 John 4:18). If before now, you were always attacked by fear, from now on, say, “I refuse to fear. I live in boldness, in the Name of Jesus.”</p>
<p>It makes no difference what you face in life; in His Name, you’re a victor; you’re triumphant forever. In His Name, you live above circumstances and the perils of this world. His Name is a strong tower; you were born into it, to live therein. Hallelujah! Have this consciousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus… (Romans 8:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word translated “condemnation” in the verse above also means judgment. Judgment is a part and parcel of God’s programme even though some folks don’t think so. The Bible clearly reveals two main judgments for man. The first one took place when the Lord Jesus was judged for the sins of mankind on the Cross. The second will take place on Judgment Day, before the Great White Throne.</p>
<p>Most are more familiar with the latter. According to Romans 8:1, man doesn’t have to face the second judgment. He can obtain God’s righteousness by accepting the truth that Jesus was judged for him on the Cross of Calvary. Jesus became the sacrifice for our sin and paid the penalty by His death.</p>
<p>Romans 3:25-26 says we’ve been justified freely by His grace through the redemption that’s in Christ Jesus: <em>“Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.”</em> Blessed be God!</p>
<p>Thank God Jesus didn’t remain in the grave; He resurrected on the third day! Today, anyone who believes in Him is justified from every sin—severed from judgment. Hallelujah! What He accomplished for us is much more than the remission of sins. He ushered us into a new life; we now have a new nature. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This is the Gospel: <em>“For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ”</em> (Romans 5:17). Now, every man can boldly come before the throne of grace to obtain mercy (Hebrews 4:16). But someday, not too far away, that throne of grace will become the throne of judgment for those who rejected the salvation in Christ Jesus. That’s why He sent us to tell the world that the price has been paid for their salvation. Jesus was judged on their behalf.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil (Psalm 119:162).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Jesus preached, there were those who listened to him and believed, and there were those who were critical and only listened to find fault with Him. The Pharisees sent spies who posed as honest inquirers, hoping to trick Jesus into saying something that would get him in trouble with the Law. They asked Him, <em>“Tell us: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</em> (Luke 20:22 MSG).</p>
<p>The question was a trap, but Jesus recognized and understood their unscrupulousness and guile; so, He pointed them to the Roman denarius (a coin) with Caesar’s image on it, and said, <em>“…give Caesar what is his and give God what is his”</em> (Luke 20:25 MSG). They weren’t there to listen to Him, believe and be blessed, no! They wanted to trap Him with His speech, but Jesus is wisdom personified.</p>
<p>Mark 12:13 says, <em>“And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.”</em> In Matthew’s account, he wrote, “<em>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk”</em> (Matthew 22:15). Luke 20:20 says, <em>“And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.”</em></p>
<p>Can you see the different reasons for which some of them attended His meetings? Did Jesus know? Emphatically yes! But He didn’t expose them; He let them make up their minds for themselves after listening to His teachings. It’s the same today; how do you receive the Word? Do you receive it with a sincere heart?</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“So get rid of all uncleanness and the rampant outgrowth of wickedness, and in a humble (gentle, modest) spirit receive and welcome the Word which implanted and rooted [in your hearts] contains the power to save your souls”</em> (James 1:21 AMPC). When you hear the Word of God, take it as it is in truth, with a genuine, truthful, sincere and honest heart. Remember, His Word is His Wisdom. Proverbs 4:5-6 says, <em>“Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith (1 John 5:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar verse to our opening scripture is 1 John 4:4; it says, <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”</em> We also read something just as inspiring and enthralling from Peter in his second epistle: <em>“Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: <strong>that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature</strong>, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust”</em> (2 Peter 1:4).</p>
<p>How about Paul? Read what he pens for us by the Spirit in Romans 8:35-39: <em>“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword…Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”</em></p>
<p>The apostles, in stating these truths, were affirming the life we have in Christ; a life of dominion over Satan, the world, and its systems. The Christian is unconquerable. You’re a victor in Christ Jesus; you rule and reign in life through Him. You could never fail. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also spoke about your impregnable nature. He said, <em>“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you”</em> (Luke 10:19). In Mark 16:18, He said you shall take up serpents; and if you drink any deadly thing, it’ll have no effect on you. When you lay hands on the sick, they shall recover. What a life!</p>
<p>You have overcome the world. Distressing situations may come from the enemy, but be unflustered; in Christ, you’ve already been made triumphant: <em>“Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ…”</em> (2 Corinthians 2:14). Train yourself in this consciousness.</p>
