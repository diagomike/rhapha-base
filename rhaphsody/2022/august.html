<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give (Matthew 10:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The day you were born into this world, God assigned angels to you. Their first and primary responsibility was to protect you and to see to it that in the process of time, you heard and received the Gospel for your salvation. As you progress in life, depending on what God has called you to do, He assigns more angels to you.</p>
<p>On the flip side also, Satan has demons whose primary responsibility from when you were a child was to devour, destroy, deceive you and lure you away from the path of righteousness. The Bible teaches about the woman who was about to deliver a child in the Book of Revelation; she was to deliver a man-child and the devil was there waiting right from the time of birth (Revelation 12:4-5).</p>
<p>This wasn’t peculiar to that child alone; God only used that prophetic illustration to show us Satan’s modus operandi. Even now that you’re born again, Satan still seeks to hinder you from serving the Lord. The Bible says <em>“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour”</em> (1 Peter 5:8).</p>
<p>That’s why you must be vehement when dealing with Satan: cast him out! You have the authority in the Name of Jesus to cast out devils (Mark 16:17). That authority is unrivalled and unparalleled in heaven, earth, and in hell. Therefore, when you say, “Devil, get out of here in the Name of Jesus,” he’s got to comply.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:9 says God has highly exalted the Lord Jesus and given Him a Name that’s above every name. Ephesians 1:21 says He’s seated far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.</p>
<p>The best part, however, is that you’re in Him; you’re seated with Him on His exalted throne of grace, reigning through Him. Hallelujah! Satan has no right to run things in your nation, city, town, street, home, in your life or that of your loved ones. Put a stop to his work; cast him out in the Name of Jesus and he’ll be gone!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Apostle Paul was letting us know in our opening verse that we’ve been blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ. He strengthens the thought further in 1 Corinthians 3:21 when he says, <em>“…all things are yours.”</em> In the same vein, the Apostle Peter tells us that God’s <em>“…divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness…”</em> (2 Peter 1:3 NKJV).</p>
<p>It’s one thing to know that you’ve been blessed with and in all things, but it’s another thing to actually take possession of the blessings. The key is connecting with your faith; that’s what Abraham did. In Genesis 17:5 NKJV, God said to him, <em>“…I have made you a father of many nations.”</em> Abraham connected with his faith; he had to see with the eyes of his mind.</p>
<p>The Bible says Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness. He believed, because he had visualized the reality of his children as he attempted to number the stars (Genesis 15:5). By faith, he saw and accepted the reality of God’s Word in his spirit, spoke it forth, and it came to pass. </p>
<p>Romans 4:20-22 says, “<em>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.”</em> Learn to visualize and take a hold of God’s provisions for you in Christ Jesus. Refuse to stagger at God’s Word through unbelief; take a hold of your blessings first in the spirit, and speak them forth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Don’t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything; tell God your needs, and don’t forget to thank him for his answers. If you do this, you will experience God’s peace, which is far more wonderful than the human mind can understand. His peace will keep your thoughts and your hearts quiet and at rest as you trust in Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:6-7 TLB).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t you just like the fact that as a Christian, you’re not supposed to worry over anything? It takes the stress out of life. Worrying only makes things worse. Recall the words of Jesus in Matthew 6:27 (TPT); He asked, <em>“So, which one of you by worrying could add anything to your life?”</em> Refuse to worry about your rent. Refuse to worry about your health. Refuse to worry about anything!</p>
<p>Some people believe until they’re worried and flustered, God won’t do anything about their situation. What they don’t know is that worry actually short-circuits the power of God in one’s life. If worrying had any positive effects, God would have said, “Be worried; in fact, be very worried.” But He never said that. Rather, He said*, “…forsake your worries! Why would you say, ‘...what will we wear?’ For that is what the unbelievers chase after. Doesn’t your heavenly Father already know the things your bodies require?”* (Matthew 6:31-32 TPT).</p>
<p>Worry is a “...fiery dart of the wicked” (Ephesians 6:16); so, when it attacks you, repel it. Use the Word against it. Every day, be resolute that you’re going to practise God’s Word. His Word says, <em>“Don’t fret or worry. Instead of worrying, pray. Let petitions and praises shape your worries into prayers, letting God know your concerns. Before you know it, a sense of God’s wholeness, everything coming together for good, will come and settle you down. It’s wonderful what happens when Christ displaces worry at the centre of your life”</em> (Philippians 4:6-7 MSG). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers (Romans 1:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the New Testament, it may surprise you to know that the use of the term “worship” is hardly applied to Christians. Of course, you find the term used in the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), but in the gospels, Jesus dealt with Jews, not Christians. In the Book of Acts, “worship” is used about four times, and in none of those occasions was it really applied to the Church.</p>
<p>Then you find the word only used once in First Corinthians, and twice in Hebrews. However, when you go into the Book of Revelation, worship is used about 22 times! “How could such a thing that we say is so important be missing in the epistles?” you may wonder.</p>
<p>It’s because, in the epistles, the Lord is actually giving us a practical understanding of worship; He tells us exactly what worship is. Remember, in John 4:24, He had said, <em>“God is a Spirit: and they that worship</em> (Greek: proskuneo) <em>him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”</em> So, in the epistles, instead of the term “worship,” the Apostle Paul gives us a particular phrase in our theme verse which sufficiently corroborates the words of Jesus in John 4:24. It’s the phrase “Serve with my spirit.”</p>
<p>Serving God with your spirit includes worship, because worship in the New Testament is different from worship in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, it was mostly outward in nature. But in the New Testament, it’s spiritual, even in the cases where we have outward demonstrations.</p>
<p>This is why it’s important to understand that what matters in the worship isn’t that we worshipped; it’s whether the One that we worshipped accepted it. There’s a conditioning of your spirit through the Word of God, through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, that makes your spirit a worshipper. The Father seeks such to worship Him.</p>

<p><em><strong>This God made the world and everything in it. He is Lord of heaven and earth, and he doesn’t live in temples built by human hands (Acts 17:24 CEV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many today still love to have special “altars” where they “meet with God.” It might be a particular room in the house or a corner of the living room where they commune with the Lord. While it’s important for us to get some privacy with the Lord whenever possible, we really don’t need to create “special altars” today to meet Him. We’re now His living tabernacles; your heart is His new altar.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, men and women built altars where they worshipped the Lord. These altars became the place where they met with God and received direction. Jacob, for example, had to return to Bethel where he first built an altar to the Lord (Genesis 35:3). Genesis 8:20 tells us about Noah; he *“…builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.”*This was the old order.</p>
<p>Today, where you are is where the altar is, for the altar is in the temple, and you’re the temple of the living God: 2 Corinthians 6:16 NIV, <em>“...For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”</em> 1 Corinthians 3:16: <em>“Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?”</em></p>
<p>Everywhere you are is the place of His presence. You can pray in your room, speak in tongues in the kitchen, and worship in the Spirit even in the bathroom! And anyone who comes in contact with you is in contact with divinity because you’re a God-carrier, the home of His presence. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:2 NKJV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you read today’s theme verse as it’s presented, you’re likely to think it’s talking about the law of “sin and death” as one entity. But that’s not what the Spirit is communicating to us here. He’s actually referring to the law of sin on the one hand, and to death on the other. For clarity, we could rearrange the words and the verse would read: “<em>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from <strong>‘death’</strong> and ‘<strong>the law of sin’</strong>”</em> (Romans 8:2). When you read it this way, it suddenly opens up and the meaning becomes very clear: it’s not “the law of sin and death” but “the law (or principle) of sin” on the one hand, and “death” on the other.</p>
<p>This means the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made you death-free in the same way that it made you sin-free! Hallelujah! This law of the Spirit of life or law of life is also referred to as the law of liberty in James 1:25 and James 2:12. John said, <em>“He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you…that ye may know that ye have eternal life…”</em> (1 John 5:12-13).</p>
<p>This (eternal) life is in the Son, and since you have it, you’re not supposed to struggle with sin, sickness, disease, infirmities and death. Think about this: at 120 years, Moses’ eyes weren’t dim and his natural force was unabated (Deuteronomy 34:7).</p>
<p>Moses lived under the Old Covenant, but he had a consciousness of life; He knew the Word of God invigorates and makes alive (Deuteronomy 32:46-47). Have the same mentality, because when you were born again, you passed from death to life and from sin into righteousness. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness (Ephesians 4:23-24).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you were born again, you were recreated in righteousness and true holiness. Unlike the unregenerate man, you’re completely awakened to the fatherhood of God; you’re alive to Him. 1 John 3:2 says, <em>“Beloved, now are we the sons of God....”</em> You’re in a sonship relationship with the Lord; you’re born of Him. That’s the meaning of 1 John 4:4: *“Ye are of God, little children…”;*you hail from Him; your origin is in Him. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Peter calls us partakers of the divine nature (associates of the God-kind). You’ve put on the God-nature, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of God that created you (Colossians 3:10). This is your true identity. Walk in this light. You’re not the same person you were before you were born again. That’s why the Bible says, <em>“Therefore, if anyone is in Messaiah, he is a new creation. <strong>Old things have disappeared</strong>, and-look!-all things have become new”</em> (2 Corinthians 5:17 ISV).</p>
<p>The old sin-nature was supplanted with God’s life of righteousness. People may still associate you with some of the wrong things you did before you were born again, but the truth is the person that did those things doesn’t exist anymore. What the Bible says about you now is that you are washed, sanctified, justified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God (1 Corinthians 6:11). Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God (1 Corinthians 2:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Spirit of God, through the Apostle Paul in our opening scripture, wasn’t referring to mental knowledge but spiritual knowledge—revelation knowledge. It’s possible for us to know the will of God for our lives. The Bible says spiritual things can only be spiritually understood: <em>“But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned”</em> (1 Corinthians 2:14).</p>
<p>When your spirit is enlightened by God’s Word through the ministry of the Holy Spirit, you’re able to know God’s will and purpose. The guidance of the Holy Spirit is so important in our lives. He guides your steps and grants you understanding of the Word. With Him, you’re never at a crossroads. Knowing Him and walking with Him is the key to that successful life you’ve always desired. He brings you into your inheritance and your destiny in God. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure about God’s perfect will on any matter, give some time to praying in the Spirit. He’s the embodiment of all knowledge. Ask Him, and He’ll reveal the knowledge or guidance you need to your spirit.</p>
<p>You can do the same with respect to your work; activate His ministry in your life and He’ll teach you how to be the best at what you do. He’ll grant you an extraordinary amplitude of comprehension and supernatural sagacity to excel in all that you do. He’ll make your thought pattern excellent; your ingenuity, creativity, intuition, sharp-wittedness will be limitless!</p>
<p>Remember the words of Jesus in John 14:26. He assured us, <em>“…he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.”</em> With the Holy Spirit, you can never walk in darkness or be confused about anything. He’ll help you retain knowledge and information in your spirit and bring that information to your consciousness when occasion demands. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And this is the confidence (the assurance, the privilege of boldness) which we have in Him: [we are sure] that if we ask anything (make any request) according to His will (in agreement with His own plan), He listens to and hears us (1 John 5:14 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes people pray, “Father, let your will be done,” without realizing the import of this statement. It isn’t one to be made casually. You don’t just say, “Thy will be done”; you have to know what that will is. When Jesus prayed and said the same words, He knew exactly what the Father’s will was and He mentioned it.</p>
<p>There’s a difference between a will and a desire. The fact that something is God’s will at a particular point in time doesn’t mean it may be His desire. I’ll give you an example from the Bible. In Isaiah 38, the Bible tells a story about King Hezekiah who was sick. The Prophet Isaiah was sent to him by God to tell him to set his house in order because he was going to die. At that moment, God stated His clear will for King Hezekiah’s life.</p>
<p>After receiving this message from the prophet, Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to God, weeping. The Bible says, <em>“Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, go, and say to Hezekiah, thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years”</em> (Isaiah 38:4-5). Praise God!</p>
<p>When Hezekiah was told he was going to die, if he had replied, “Thy will be done O Lord,” he would have died. But he knew that wasn’t God’s desire for him. He knew God created him for His praise. So, in his prayer, he said to the Lord, “…the dead cannot celebrate you. Only the living can praise you as I do this day” (Isaiah 38:18-19).</p>
<p>When you’re praying about the will of God on a matter, find out how consistent that thing is with His character. Only then will you know how best to pray about it. For instance, in the Old Testament, God led the children of Israel in several battles and fought wars on their behalf, yet the Bible tells us He’s a God of peace. He’s more known as the God of peace than any other name in the Bible. This shows us His desire; what He really wants is peace, not war. This kind of understanding will help you pray always in line with His desires as revealed in His Word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth… (Romans 1:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To walk in the fullness of the blessings of the Gospel, you must first understand what the Gospel of Jesus Christ is. That’s when you can really believe it. Proverbs 4:7 says, <em>“…with all thy getting get understanding.”</em> Understanding the Gospel is so important. Paul said, <em>“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek”</em> (Romans 1:16).</p>
<p>So, what’s the Gospel? In a nutshell, it’s the Word of God concerning Jesus Christ: who He is and His mission; what He came to do. Having this understanding is imperative to living a consistently victorious Christian life.</p>
<p>Jesus told a parable of the sower that went forth to sow, and as he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside and the birds of the air came and picked them up. In His interpretation, Jesus said the seed is the Word of God. He went further to say that the seeds that fell by the wayside are those who hear the Word of God and don’t understand it; then Satan comes immediately and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts (Mark 4:15). The Word actually got into their hearts, but because they lacked understanding, the devil took it away from them. You need to understand the message of the Gospel. Once you understand it, you’re set for life; you’ll never need “another fire,” because you’ve come to understand the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life.</p>
<p>No wonder the Spirit prays through Paul in Ephesians 1:18: “that the eyes of your understanding be enlightened to know the hope of God’s calling, and the riches of the glory of His inheritance amongst them that are sanctified.” Every so often, affirm that you have an understanding heart, and that the mysteries of the Gospel are unveiled to your spirit, and you walk in the fullness of the blessings of the Gospel every day. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him (John 4:23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When people don’t understand the Scriptures, it shows in the songs they sing. Through the years, God’s people have sung many unscriptural songs that affected their emotions but hadn’t any true and lasting spiritual impact.</p>
<p>One of such songs is the hymn, “Fill my cup, Lord.” Many sing it with delight, yet they fail to ask themselves what they really mean when they ask the Lord to “fill their cup.” With what do they want Him to fill it? Another line of the song says, “Come and quench this thirsting of my soul….”</p>
<p>If you have Christ, you’ll never thirst again. Jesus said to the woman at the well, <em>“…whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life”</em> (John 4:14). Those are the words of Jesus. So, how can you still be thirsty?</p>
<p>Then they sing, “Bread of Heaven, feed me ‘til I want no more….” How could that be? In John 6:35, Jesus declared, <em>“... I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.”</em> This makes it crystal clear that if you have Jesus, you’ll never hunger and thirst again.</p>
<p>People still sing such hymns because they don’t know. Psalm 82:5 says, <em>“They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness….”</em> Don’t just sing a song because it sounds nice; listen to the words; be sure they’re consistent with the provisions of the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is coming for a Church without spot, without wrinkle, without blemish or any such thing (Ephesians 5:27). And He says we should be no more children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine (Ephesians 4:14); but we should rather grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ (2 Peter 3:18). So, when you sing in worship, let it be with the knowledge and understanding of the truth of God’s Word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot (1 Peter 1:18-19).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s no religion in the world that assures its adherents that they’re loved. Most religions generally preach judgment. They have no solution for sin. Some people classify Christianity as one of the many religions in the world, but they’re wrong. In Christianity, Jesus provided solution for sin. This He did by giving His life for all men.</p>
<p>Because of the vicarious death of Christ, we know how precious and valuable we are to God. He washed us from our sins in His own blood (Revelation 1:5) and made us righteous with His own righteousness (Romans 3:26, 5:1).</p>
<p>Jesus gave His own life to prove to us that God loves us as much as He loves Him (Jesus). He values us as much as He values Jesus. That means He thinks we’re important. Only a fool will pay something for nothing, and God is no fool. Therefore, never think you’re nothing; He paid so dearly for you. Know your value; you’re special.</p>
<p>In 2 Peter 1:4, the Bible describes us as partakers of the divine nature. In other words, we’re partners, comrades and associates of the God-kind! This means we belong to a heavenly pantheon. John 10:34 says, <em>“Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods.”</em> Hallelujah! This is the reality.</p>
<p>You’re not supposed to live a beggarly life after Jesus has paid so much for you. When you pray, don’t pray like someone who is trying to get something from God. No! Nothing is too good for you. He already did, and gave, the best for you; He gave you ALL when He gave you Christ. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time (1 John 2:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible is facing a lot of attacks today from different quarters. We know that these attacks are inspired by the spirit of antichrist that’s already in the world: <em>“…and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world”</em> (1 John 4:3).</p>
<p>The spirit of antichrist is responsible for motivating different individuals and organizations to portray the Bible as untrustworthy and undependable. That’s the spirit that propels them to publish books and promote films that seek to discourage faith in the Bible.</p>
<p>2 John 1:7 says, <em>“For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.”</em> Some of these people surprisingly claim to be Christians. But remember that in the Book of Job, the sons of God, referring to angels, came to present themselves to God on a certain day, and Satan also came among them (Job 1:6). It’s still happening today. </p>
<p>When God’s children gather before the Lord in churches and fellowships, you’ll find others who join them that aren’t of God. These have opened themselves to be used by Satan to attack the Word of God so that people will lose faith in the Bible; but their efforts will fail as God’s people pray and preach the truth.</p>
<p>Don’t pay attention to those who say the Bible is old- fashioned and should be done away with. The Bible is still as relevant today as it was at any time in history. It’s God’s document of truth, and it’s trustworthy and dependable. Let your faith in it be unshakeable.</p>

<p><em><strong>God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? (Hebrews 2:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years ago, as a young teenager studying the message of Jesus Christ and what He came to do, I thought: if Jesus needed to prove His message with miracles, signs and wonders, and the apostles followed suit, then I would need to do even more because I was going to be preaching to a generation that didn’t know about those miracles. I would need to prove to them that Jesus Christ is alive; He’s the same yesterday, today, and forever. If I couldn’t prove it, how would I convince them?</p>
<p>God wants us to be able to prove the message of the Gospel. That’s why He calls us witnesses. The Bible says, <em>“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth”</em> (Acts 1:8). Who’s a witness? It’s someone who has proof, not just hearsay; he or she has firsthand evidence.</p>
<p>When you received the Holy Spirit, you received power—ability to bear witness of His truth, death and resurrection. With this power, you can do the same things Jesus did. It was this very power of the Holy Spirit that worked in Him to do the works of God.</p>
<p>Jesus effected changes, and now you can too, because you have His Name and His power is at work in you. His Spirit and life in us is proof that He was who He claimed to be: the son of God. Jesus Christ is alive, and we must prove it with miracles, signs and wonders. As you take the Gospel to your world today, go with the consciousness that you’ve been given power to produce proof that Jesus is alive. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our opening verse isn’t a promise; it’s a law. It’s just like 2 Corinthians 5:17 that says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</em> This verse and our opening verse aren’t promises from God; they are the sovereign declarations of God.</p>
<p>The one who’s born again is a new creation; he or she has the life and nature of God. Being born again, your human life was supplanted by the life and nature of God. Now, your body houses a new type of life that’s unsusceptible and impregnable to sickness or disease. Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new! If you don’t know about this new life, you’ll never put it to work; you’ll be living the human life when you have the divine life in you.</p>
<p>Learn to activate the divine life within you by declaring and personalising the Word of God. Remember, the greatest miracles are performed with words. I wish you’d understand the power and energy of your words! The Bible says, <em>“And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick…”</em> (Isaiah 33:24). Why? It’s because they’ve recognized and embraced their divinity.</p>
<p>The Bible says in 2 Peter 1:4*, “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature….”* You’re an associate of a divine pantheon; you hail from above; your origin is divine. No wonder Jesus said, “Isn’t it written in your law I have said ye are gods?” (John 10:34).</p>
<p>Recognize and affirm your divinity; practise it. The Bible says the communication, the everyday expression of your faith, becomes effectual as you recognize and affirm who you are in Christ (Philemon 1:6). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds (2 Corinthians 10:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have the work of Christianity, the war of Christianity, and the walk of Christianity. For the work of Christianity, the Lord has made tools available for us to effectively carry out His work. These tools are determined by the specific job description given for the work.</p>
<p>For instance, in reconciling men to God, we need to know where the people are and how to reach them. This clear description determines the kind of tools we use for our evangelical work, such as the different strategic outreaches we organize to reach people where they are, etc.</p>
<p>We’re in a spiritual warfare; we actively carry out onslaughts against the forces of darkness that try to resist us as we deliberately win souls into the Kingdom. Our tools or weapons of war are determined by the description and understanding of the adversary.</p>
<p>For example, the Bible clearly identifies for us the tools David used when he faced the giant, Goliath of Gath; they were a stone, a sling, and the words he spoke. Study the account; you’d see the spirituality of David’s action. The weapons or tools of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God in discomfiting the adversary (2 Corinthians 10:4).</p>
<p>However, for our Christian walk, which refers to the everyday activities of our Christian life through which we relate with one another and relate with God, we don’t need “tools.” When you’re born again, living the Christian life is the most natural thing to do with your new nature in Christ. It’s natural for us to walk in the light of who we are in Christ and in our heritage in Him.</p>
<p>Anything that makes you dependent on aids or “tools” is like “crutches” that a lame man needs to be able to move around. God doesn’t want you to live like that. It’s not His desire for you to depend on medications to stay alive. He wants you to live in divine health every day, just as He wants you to live in His righteousness and manifest His glory and wisdom everywhere. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them... (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As one who’s born again, your life has been so excellently planned out and preordained by God. All He wants is that you follow the blueprint. For instance, marriage or bearing children, though of natural desire and blessing from God, are not necessarily God’s specific plan for everyone (Matthew 19:10-12; Isaiah 56:4; 1 Corinthians 7:1-40). Also, preaching the Gospel everywhere is Christ’s general instruction to all Christians, but He has specific plans and can forbid you from doing so at certain places or times (Acts 16:6-10).</p>
<p>Some people have given birth to children that probably should never have been born. You may find this surprising, but if you study the Scriptures well enough, you’d understand. Someone might ask, “Doesn’t the Bible say that children are the heritage of the Lord?” That’s part of the reasons you must find out from Him if the one you’re bringing forth is from Him.</p>
<p>Some couples never asked God, “Are we supposed to have children?” They think once they marry, they must have children. Marriage isn’t necessarily for having children; that’s why it’s wise to pray and ask the Lord.</p>
<p>A lady had three children, but before they’d grow to be fifteen years, they died. You might wonder why God would allow her go through such an ordeal. But the question you’re not asking is, “Were those children supposed to have come in the first place?” We must learn, through the Spirit and the Word, the plan and purpose of God for our lives and how to walk therein.</p>
<p>There’re things that many people go ahead to do in life even though they aren’t part of God’s agenda for them. They want to live their lives for the joy of other people; they want certain jobs, professions or positions because others are pressuring them to. As in all things, God wants to guide you. Don’t think He’ll be mute if you ask Him; you’ll be amazed how fast and clearly He’ll speak to you and give you the guidance you need.</p>
<p>Never find yourself always insisting on what you want; ask God. You can be as happy as ever, fulfilling God’s purpose for your life. That’s the most important thing—discovering your purpose and fulfilling it.</p>

<p><em><strong>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed (Acts 19:20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible tells us that Jesus ministered to multitudes when He walked the streets of Israel. On one occasion, He preached to a crowd on the shore of Lake Galilee and the Bible specifically records that a vast multitude of people pushed to get close to Him to hear the Word of God (Luke 5:1).</p>
<p>Jesus preached that the Kingdom of heaven had come and that they should repent from their sins and get into the Kingdom that He had come to set up (Mark 1:14-15). But instead of believing in Him and getting into His Kingdom, they rejected Him. He was crucified; albeit, it all fulfilled the plan and purpose of God.</p>
<p>Then came the apostles; they too went forth preaching that the Kingdom, which Jesus had come to set up, is real, and that Jesus is God’s Son, and that even though they crucified Him, God raised Him from the dead (Acts 2:22-24). They preached that Jesus is alive and that He’s been appointed by God to be the judge of the living and the dead (Acts 10:42). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The first day that Peter would preach this message, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, the Bible says it was to a large crowd, and three thousand of them gave their hearts to Christ (Acts 2:41). The next time he preached, five thousand people gave their hearts to Christ (Acts 4:4). Afterwards, it became a multitude that believed (Acts 6:2). From a multitude, it became <em>“...a great multitude…”</em> (Acts 14:1). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>It hasn’t changed in our day. We’re witnessing the greatest move of the Spirit in these last days. There’s been such unprecedented harvest of souls into the Kingdom, beyond what we’ve ever seen. The Word of God is growing mightily in the nations of the world and prevailing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Romans 10:9-10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The recognition and declaration of truth activates its power. Believe truth and declare it. That’s the way to walk consistently in God’s blessings. </p>
<p>Take for instance 1 John 5:13 NIV; it says, <em>“I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.”</em> Many have lived and died, never knowing that they had eternal life. They believed in Jesus all right, but no one ever emphasized to them that eternal life was their present-hour possession. They never recognized that truth; as a result, it wasn’t activated in their lives. That’s why I’m emphasizing it to you today. You’ve got to know it!</p>
<p>Again, Romans 8:10 NIV says, <em>“But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life because of righteousness.”</em> Believe and affirm this about yourself always. The Spirit of God that you’ve received gives life to your body; therefore, your body is invigorated, quickened by that same Spirit.</p>
<p>When you activate these truths by your affirmation, it makes no difference the kind of sickness that tries to attack your body or the adversities you face; you’ll be impregnable. Glory to God! Jesus taught in Mark 11:23 that you’d have to say it, to have it. Philemon 1:6 highlights your acknowledgment of God’s truths: who you are, and your heritage in Christ as the basis for an effectual life of ever-increasing glory and triumph. It says, <em>“That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us) (1 John 1:1-2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s an understanding and appreciation of the Word—a perspective of truth that the apostles had. It was quite profound. Consider what we just read in the verse above; John uses the definite article for “life” and says, “For <strong>the life</strong> was manifested.” He’s saying, “The life was shown to us.” This is an expression that’s beyond human reasoning. How could life be given the definite article and then be said to have been “manifested” for us to see?</p>
<p>Is life a person? Now you can understand it when Jesus said in John 14:6, <em>“…I am the way, the truth, and the life….”</em> He is the life that became defined in totality, in a human person, and was manifested to us. 1 John 1:2 says, <em>“...For the life was manifested, and we have seen it….”</em> How can somebody see life? What does life look like? Now you know: Jesus is life. But you see, it’s a discovery you’d have to make for yourself; it has to become a revelation of truth in your spirit, not head-knowledge.</p>
<p>Jesus is the embodiment of life. 1 John 5:12 NKJV says, <em>“He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.”</em> In the 13th verse, he climaxes his message and says, <em>“I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life”</em> (NIV).</p>
<p>For God’s people everywhere, this is your reality: You have LIFE—eternal life! Jesus is eternal life*: “And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life”* (1 John 5:20).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart (Hebrews 4:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s so important to understand that when you were born again, you were actually born of the Word. The Bible says, <em>“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”</em> (1 Peter 1:23). You’re the offspring of the Word. You’re called to live by the Word, even as you’re being built by the Word; you dwell in the Word.</p>
<p>Therefore, as one who’s born of the Word, when you speak, your words cease to be mere words. That’s the reason Romans 10:8 says of the Word: <em>“…The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.” You’re to always give vent to the Word; speak the Word always.</em> </p>
<p>Here’s what the Spirit is saying to you even now: <em>“In the realm of the spirit, the Word is all that’s necessary; receive the Word at my mouth, says the Lord, have it in your spirit for your spirit is the home of the Word. As you receive my Word, you’ll think my thoughts and walk in my realm of life. Therefore, when you speak, it will come to pass, because it’s the Word; says the Spirit of the Lord!”</em></p>
<p>Yes, you’re born into that realm; created, fashioned and sharpened by the Word. As you grow in the Word, you become a manifestation of the Word. That’s the way Jesus was; He was the outbreathing of God, the Word of God made flesh. He walked the streets of Israel as the Word. And as He is, so are we in this world (1 John 4:17). We’re called the word—the epistle of Christ: <em>“Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart”</em> (2 Corinthians 3:3). Meditate on these truths today.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>One day, some of the disciples of John the Baptist came to the Lord Jesus; they observed that Jesus had a house in the first place, because they had been following John the Baptist through the wilderness. They stayed with Jesus through the day, asking questions about the Kingdom of God; and Jesus answered their questions.</p>
<p>When it was night-time, they didn’t want to go back to John, and the Bible records that they stayed with Jesus from then on and never went back to John. They found what their soul had been longing for; their search ended; they had come home!</p>
<p>Yes, in Christ, you’re at home. Christ is a Person; Christ is also a place—a place like no other. In Him, you’re at peace. In Him, you’re fulfilled. In Him, you’ve arrived. Christ! What a place! When those disciples got to Him, they found the place where love abides, the place where love reigns and rules, a place where only grace and righteousness abounds.</p>
<p>The disciples of John were enraptured in love when they came to Jesus, just as we are today. As they listened to Him, their search ended. When you come to Him, you’re home; your struggles end. If you haven’t received Christ, receive Him now; come into Christ now by praying the prayer of salvation on page 76, at the back of this devotional.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I will say of the Lord, He is my Refuge and my Fortress, my God; on Him I lean and rely, and in Him I [confidently] trust! (Psalm 91:2 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oftentimes, we think about certain things that happened to some very “good” people, and say, “If that could happen to so-and-so, what about me? That fellow was better than I am!” Well, it’s got nothing to do with who’s better than who. It’s got to do with your personal walk with the Lord and your faith in His Word. It’s about your faith confessions. Bad things can happen to good people.</p>
<p>Ponder again on the anointed words of the Psalmist that we read in our opening scripture. It was David’s confession and it’s got to become your confession as well. Every so often, you say, “The Lord is my Refuge and my Fortress; He’s my God; on Him, I lean and rely, and in Him I confidently trust!”</p>
<p>Learn the power and value of thinking right and speaking right. If your thinking is wrong, it’ll reflect in your words. And if your words are wrong, things will go wrong in your life. Your confessions regulate your life. The Bible says*, “Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth”* (Proverbs 6:2).</p>
<p>No wonder Psalms 39:1 admonishes that you guard what you say and speak only what’s right: <em>“…I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle….”</em> James 3:2 says, <em>“For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.”</em></p>
<p>Proverbs 15:4 says, <em>“A wholesome tongue is a tree of life...”</em>; a wholesome tongue is one that speaks in line with the provisions of Christ in His Gospel. Do you want to live the awesome, transcendent life of ever-increasing glory that God has destined for you? The key is your confessions: <em>“For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile”</em> (1 Peter 3:10). Refraining your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking guile means that you only speak in conformity with the Word of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds (2 Corinthians 10:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Christian, you ought to look at things from the spiritual perspective, especially when you encounter circumstances that pose some serious challenges to your faith. Are you in a health situation, and you’ve done everything you know and the prognosis is still dim? Or in your finances you’ve applied all the strategies you know, but your situation seems to be worsening, and you’re wondering what next to do?</p>
<p>At such times, stand strong in faith. You have to realize that there’s an adversary who is all out to oppose the Gospel and try to hinder your effectiveness in the things of God. Ephesians 6:10-11 says, <em>“…be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.”</em> The wiles of the devil refer to the strategies of the devil. The Apostle Paul, here, wants you to know that there’s an enemy that is lying in wait, strategizing against you and the Church.</p>
<p>But to counter this enemy, he tells you to put on the whole armour of God, why? Because he knows that if you don’t put on the whole armour of God, you can ’t face the adversary. The twelfth verse of the same chapter goes on to say, <em>“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places”</em> (Ephesians 6:12).</p>
<p>Something about this “wrestling” that you need to realize is that it’s not just a fight as in physical combat; rather, it’s the adversary trying to sway you from the right path through deception. But with the Word in your mouth and heart, you prevail always against the enemy. James 4:7 says, <em>“…Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”</em></p>
<p>Revelation 12:11 shows how to resist him. It says, <em>“And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.”</em> No matter what the enemy throws at you, stand strong in faith and use the all-powerful Name of Jesus to neutralize him. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah: And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters (Genesis 5:21-22).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we read in our theme scripture tells you the kind of man Enoch was; he was a prophet of God. He was the prophet of God who saw the vision of the Lord’s coming with ten thousands of His saints: <em>“And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him”</em> (Jude 1:14-15). Hebrews 11:5 says, <em>“By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.”</em></p>
<p>Enoch was caught up to heaven alive and never died. The Bible says that before his translation into heaven, he had the testimony that he pleased God. How do you please God? The way to please God is walking by faith, for the Bible says, “Without faith, it’s impossible to please God” (Hebrews 11:6). You can tell today whether or not you’re pleasing the Lord; the question you need to answer is, “Are you walking by faith or by sensory perceptions?”</p>
<p>Faith is acting on the Word; it’s doing God’s Word. Enoch knew he pleased God because he was a doer of the Word. James 1:22 says, <em>“But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.”</em> It’s akin to what Jesus said in John 14:15: <em>“If ye love me, keep my commandments.”</em> The way to show you love God is doing His Word, and faith works by love.</p>
<p>Learn to walk in the light of God’s Word. In Colossians 1:10 NIV, Paul by the Spirit, prayed, <em>“… that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God.”</em> This is fulfilled in your life as you live every day by faith, for the just shall live by faith (Romans 1:17, 2 Corinthians 5:7, Galatians 3:11). Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God (Revelation 19:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I contemplate the second coming of the Lord, my heart is filled with so much joy. But you know, about seven years before this second coming, the Rapture will take place (1 Thessalonians 4:17), and we’ll go to heaven for the marriage supper of the Lamb. It’s going to be big!</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth”</em> (Revelation 19:6). Glory to God! That’s the number one reason for the Rapture. We’ll get out of this world and assemble in Heaven for a great party. Blessed be God! Are you getting ready for the party?</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God”</em> (Revelation 19:1). You’ve got to make up your mind you wouldn’t miss this. There hasn’t been, and could never be, any royal party or event organized by the monarchs or presidents of this world that could compare to the grand party God almighty is throwing for us in Heaven.</p>
<p>And guess what? The invitation is open to all; all you need is to have been born again. Those of us going in the Rapture are just one of the arrivals, because all those Jesus took with Him when He resurrected are already there waiting. Don’t miss it. Everyone left behind will be full of regrets. The latter part of our theme verse says, <em>“...These are the true sayings of God.”</em></p>
<p>That day is nearer than many can imagine. This is why we’re going all out, reaching the entire world with the Gospel through Rhapsody of Realities, to prepare many for that glorious day of the Rapture. Our aim is to reach 7 billion people across all ages in all 7,139 languages of the world.

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him (Proverbs 22:15).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re people who often don’t behave wisely, even though they’re born again. The reason for this isn’t farfetched; the Bible says the one who isn’t disciplined by a wise and understanding person will grow up to be foolish. God’s Word is the cure for foolishness, because the Word of God is the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>No wonder Paul admonished Timothy in 2 Timothy 3:15 to give uninhibited attention to the Scriptures, God’s Word because of the Word’s power and capacity to make one wise*: “And that from a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.”* That’s why the preaching and the teaching of the Word are so important.</p>
<p>Don’t ever let the Word become too common to you. Never be casual with your study times and meditation on God’s Word. The Word is what God uses to mould your personality, form your character, create your habits, and chart your course in life in order for you to arrive at your divine destiny.</p>
<p>God’s Word—imbibing it— is more important than the air you breathe. If you stop taking in the Word, you’ll find yourself walking at cross-purposes with God. If you ever want your life to be balanced, full of excellence, grace and glory, the Word of God is the key.</p>
<p>Job said, “I have cherished your Word more than my necessary food” (Job 23:12). Just as food is necessary for your body’s physical growth and development, your human spirit must feed on the Word. Colossians 3:16 says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly….”</em> Inundate your entire being with the Word. Think through the Word; train yourself to reason only by the Word, and not only will you please God, your life will be full of His glory.</p>

<p><em><strong>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them (Ephesians 2:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a child of God, you have a calling to lead and blaze new trails in music and arts, agriculture, education, organization, administration, products and services, etc. Yes, that’s God’s plan. And one of the beautiful and amazing benefits of having the Holy Spirit in your life is that He makes you creative and innovative. He opens your eyes to see what others don’t see and your ears to hear what others don’t hear. He anoints your eyes to see the right things, and your mind to understand and conceive lofty ideas.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of man David was. The power of God came on him when Samuel the prophet anointed him to become king of Israel, and he turned out to be a marvel in his day. When he faced Goliath of Gath, he came into the battlefront with something new; he came with an innovation.</p>
<p>David’s weapons weren’t sophisticated; they were simple, but markedly different from what was expected. The sling he used wasn’t new to the Jews. In fact, as you read the Bible, you’ll find others who could use those weapons better than David. But none of them thought that a sling and some smooth stones would be enough to defeat Goliath. Only David thought it would, through God.</p>
<p>That’s innovation; thinking differently; thinking through God’s ability. That’s what God expects from you. Our theme verse says you were <em>“…created in Christ Jesus unto good works….”</em> Hallelujah! We were created to be ingenious, to think new, and to think fresh. What God tells you to do may not be as sophisticated as the tools and strategies others are deploying, but rest assured that it will win. He’s the extraordinary strategist.</p>
<p>He can guide you to come up with something new from something old, from an existing idea. Take advantage of the person, power and ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life. He’s your advantage. He causes you to see, think, say and do things at a superior and supernatural level. His ideas are unbeatable and the best; they win all the time. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field (Matthew 13:44).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole world belongs to Jesus. He bought the whole field. The 38th verse of the same chapter lets us know that the field is the world: <em>“The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one.”</em> He rules the world!</p>
<p>His dominion and rulership over the world is absolute. He’s <em>“…in charge of running the universe, everything from galaxies to governments, no name and no power exempt from his rule. And not just for the time being, but forever”</em> (Ephesians 1:21 MSG).</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“The earth is the LORD’S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein”</em> (Psalm 24:1). Hallelujah! This means the whole world belongs to us, because we’re heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ*: “And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ…”* (Romans 8:17). It’s the reason we can tame this world and keep it under our dominion, in line with God’s purpose. It’s the reason we can completely forbid Satan and his cronies of darkness from wreaking havoc upon the nations.</p>
<p>To have the Antichrist’s policies in the nations of the world while we (the Church of Jesus Christ) are still here isn’t going to happen. We’re the restraining force against Satan and his antichrist activities, and we’re very much in office. We’ve taken our place. The Antichrist can only be in charge after the Rapture of the Church. As long as we’re here, he’s liquidated!</p>
<p>The Antichrist is going to function with Satan’s power: <em>“And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon</em> (the devil) <em>gave him</em> (the antichrist) <em>his power, and his seat, and great authority”</em> (Revelation 13:2). But blessed be God! We already have authority over Satan; therefore, it makes no difference what power Satan is going to give to the Antichrist; it’s nothing compared to our dominion and authority in Christ. Hallelujah! Maintain your focus on the Word of God; let nothing move you. You’re on the winning side.</p>

<p><em><strong>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places (Ephesians 6:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through the preaching of the Gospel, we deliver people from Satan’s dominion unto God. It’s warfare. So, you must be prepared. And thank God it’s a war in which we’re victorious. Christians who aren’t prepared easily get discouraged or even knocked out, because they didn’t realize that soul winning is war. You can’t win souls without warring in intercession. If you’re going to lead many to Christ, evangelizing your world in a remarkable way, you’d have to labour in intercession.</p>
<p>That was the kind of foundation God gave several of us many years ago, while we were still very young. All we knew was prayer, night and day, interceding for the souls of men and the nations of the World. The Bible says Satan, the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those that don’t believe so their hearts won’t receive the light of the Gospel (2 Corinthians 4:4).</p>
<p>It reveals the spirituality of this warfare. We have an adversary—Satan. The Bible says, <em>“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour. Whom resist stedfast in the faith…”</em> (1 Peter 5:8-9).</p>
<p>The devil is all out to oppose the Gospel and God’s children. But in prayer, you effectively destroy Satan’s stronghold in men’s hearts and his stratagems and machinations against you and your work as a preacher of righteousness. So, pray always in the spirit for those you’re planning to reach with the Gospel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders…Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing (Revelation 5:11-12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the Bible talks about blessing the Lord, how do you bless the Lord? In Matthew 26:26, the Bible says, <em>“And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it….”</em> How did Jesus bless the bread? The Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, explained it in 1 Corinthians 11:23-24 when he said, <em>“For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: And when he had given thanks</em>(Greek: eucharisteo)<em>, he brake it….”</em></p>
<p>Matthew said Jesus took bread and blessed it; then Paul gets the revelation and tells us exactly how Jesus did it: it was by giving thanks! In essence, when we say, “Let’s bless the Lord,” it means to give Him thanks; you’re thanking Him for who He is, for what He’s done in your life and for all His mighty works.</p>
<p>This is what we do in worship. The Bible says, <em>“By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name”</em> (Hebrews 13:15). Praise is giving thanks. In Revelation 11:16-17, we observe an offering of true worship; it says, <em>“And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, <strong>fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, Saying, We give thee thanks</strong>, O Lord God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Live each day in an attitude of worship, an attitude of thanksgiving. This is the way to stay happy all the time, because you know that no matter the challenge you face, greater is He that’s in you than He that’s in the world. You always win. Praise God forevermore!</p>
