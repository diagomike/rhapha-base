<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ephesians 2:6-7, the Bible says we’ve been raised up together, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus; so that <strong>in the ages to come</strong>, God might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus. The underlined portion actually means “ages following”; the ages following the sitting of Christ.</p>
<p>After the resurrection of Christ, He ascended to Heaven, sat on the throne, and a new age began. Now, we’re seated with Him. God enthroned us with Christ in the heavenly realms. So, the Scripture is telling us that He wants to demonstrate the exceeding riches of His grace to the Church in the successive ages following the enthronement; that’s now! It’s not in the future; it’s not during the Millennium or after the Millennium; it’s now!</p>
<p>Another important word to note in Ephesians 2:6-7 is “through,” in the phrase, “through Christ.” It’s translated from “en” (Greek), and it means “in.” We operate in the earth in Christ Jesus. Ephesians 3:21 says, “<em>Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.”</em> It’s all happening here with us—the Church—not in heaven.</p>
<p>This is why we can’t fail. We’ve got to do everything He’s called us to do in this time. If we don’t recognize this reality, we won’t be able to take advantage of it, and suddenly, we’ll be in the Millennium. At the Millennium, we’ll reign with Christ, but now, we reign through Him. This is the time of the Church. If you don’t reign in Christ now, when are you going to fulfill it?</p>
<p>Use the authority He’s given you to dominate your world. This is your time. You’ve been enthroned to reign. You were born to exercise dominion over Satan and the circumstances of life! Whatever comes against you in life, take charge and reign over it through your faith declarations in the power of the Spirit. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But grow in grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen (2 Peter 3:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 Peter 2:2, Peter writes to Jewish Christian pilgrims in certain cities, and he says to them, <em>“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.”</em> The word “babes” there is “brephos” (Greek) and it refers to infants, children. Peter was writing to infant churches and young Christians; they had recently given their hearts to Christ.</p>
<p>But then there’s another group of Christians described in 1 Corinthians 3. The Apostle Paul called them “babes in Christ.” He said, “<em>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ”</em> (1 Corinthians 3:1).</p>
<p>The word “babes” in this case is the Greek “nepios.” It means one who can’t talk right. He may be twenty years old, but he’s not able to communicate correctly. He’s unskilled, untrained, not mentally coordinated, in spite of his age. So, when it’s applied spiritually, it’s dealing with somebody who is a spiritual babe, one that’s not cultured, even though he’s been a Christian for many years. Such people can neither grasp spiritual communication nor communicate spiritual truths. Paul berated them, saying, <em>“I have fed you with milk, and not with meat...”</em> (1 Corinthians 3:2). “Milk” refers to the elementary principles of the Word of God, the elementary doctrines of Christ.</p>
<p>One who’s a spiritual babe will pray and cry to God to bless him. If he were spiritually mature, he’d have known that God already blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus (Ephesians 1:3). He hasn’t grown to understand the mystery of Christ, that the day he was born into Christ, he became an heir of all the blessings of God in Christ Jesus.</p>

<p><em><strong>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified. He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay (Matthew 28:5-6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you truly believe in what Jesus Christ did for you, if you believe that His work of salvation was important, and that you actually received that salvation, you can’t keep it to yourself. He said in Mark 16:15, <em>“…Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”</em> Those are our marching orders.</p>
<p>You have to tell others about Jesus. You can win at least one soul before the end of this week; plan for it. Pray specially about it. There’re still many who don’t know what Jesus came to do; they’re not aware that He came as their substitute. They’re not aware He already saved them from the punishment, as well as the life and nature of sin. The world needs to hear this truth.</p>
<p>But the question, according to Romans 10:14 is, “How can they hear without a preacher?” That’s why each one of us must be personal about the Great Commission. Preach the Gospel with greater fervency, especially as we prepare ourselves and others for the coming of the Lord.</p>
<p>Don’t relent in your efforts; seek out the lost; those hopeless and confused in your world and let them know there’s salvation in Christ Jesus. Let them know eternal life, fellowship with God, a life of peace, righteousness, eternal victory and prosperity are now both possible and available in Christ Jesus. Tell others this glorious news.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, Which is his body, THE FULNESS OF HIM THAT FILLETH ALL IN ALL (Ephesians 1:22-23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever thought about the fact that the Church is the fullness of Christ? We’re the completion of Christ; He’s the head, and we’re the body. We’re the fullness of Him that fills everything. </p>
<p>John 1:16 says, <em>“And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.”</em> We’ve received of His fullness. When you received the Holy Spirit, you received ALL of Him. Your humanity was supplanted by the life and nature of God. Today, you’re God’s living tabernacle; you’re immersed in Him and He in you. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>You’ve received in all fullness everything that’s of deity in Christ Jesus. All of His power, glory, dominion, strength and wisdom; everything He is, owns and represents—you have received! Imagine if you’ve lived all your life with this consciousness? </p>
<p>Remember the words of Jesus in John 10:10, “I came that they may have life, and have it to the full.” You didn’t need more life from God when you were born again; all that He’s got, you have received. You’ve received of His ability, wisdom, knowledge, glory and dominion.</p>
<p>No wonder John tells us in 1 John 4:17, <em>“...As He is, so are we in this world….”</em> If we had less life than He does, we wouldn’t be described as <em>“the fullness of Him”</em> (Ephesians 1:23). Each one of us is filled in Him, and with Him. You’re replete with God. This was God’s plan from the foundation of the world: for us to be and have His fullness; and He accomplished it in Christ Jesus, and by sending the Holy Spirit to live in us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified (Hebrews 10:12-14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blessed be God! The Lord Jesus offered the one supreme sacrifice for sin for all time. And by His one sacrifice, He perfected us forever! He made us perfect, holy and complete for all time. How glorious this is!</p>
<p>This isn’t something we qualified for or achieved by ourselves; Jesus did it for us. He perfected us in righteousness and holiness of truth. That’s what Paul refers to when He said in Ephesians 4:24 that you should put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5:21 says, <em>“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”</em> Never see yourself as unrighteous and imperfect. Christ is your perfection. You’re perfect, because the One who gave birth to you is perfect. Hebrews 2:11 declares, <em>“For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one….”</em> You’re like Him. 1 John 4:17 says, <em>“…as he is, so are we in this world….”</em></p>
<p>Colossians 2:10 says, <em>“And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.”</em> The word “complete” also means perfected; you’re perfected in Him. Some have asked, “Doesn’t Ephesians 4:12 talk about <em>“the perfecting of the saints”,</em> meaning that we’re not yet perfect? No; that verse refers to the maturing or maturity of the saints; it means equipping or training the saints for the work of the ministry.</p>
<p>It’s like when a child is born; that child is perfectly as human as the parents are. But the child needs to be trained and equipped with information, education and strength to live a fully functional human life. That’s what the Apostle Paul meant by “perfecting of the saints.”</p>
<p>Already, you are, and have, the righteousness of God. But as you receive the Word of God into your spirit, you’re being trained in the life of righteousness; you become more skilled in the doctrine, understanding and application of your righteousness in Christ.</p>

<p><em><strong>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts (Haggai 2:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Acts 4, we read that the saints of the early Church, in a time of intense persecution, prayed to the Lord. They said, <em>“…grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus”</em> (Acts 4:29-30).</p>
<p>Few chapters after that, Peter went into the house of Cornelius the Roman centurion and the Bible says, <em>“While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word”</em> (Acts 10:44). Remarkable indeed!</p>
<p>The word “fell” is translated from the Greek “epipipto,” which means to embrace with affection, to fall like rain or fall upon someone in an embrace. As Peter spoke those gracious words of salvation, the Holy Ghost embraced everyone in Cornelius’ household, and they were all recreated and filled with the Spirit. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Such experiences ought to be commonplace through the Church of Jesus Christ. In these last days, the Spirit of God is moving on His children to preach and teach His Word with power, with miracles, signs and wonders. God’s people around the world are going to be amazed at the move of the Spirit in their lives at a degree they’d never seen before.</p>
<p>Become conscious of this as you go preaching the Word everywhere. While you’re yet speaking and preaching in the offices, in the shops, in the streets, schools and shopping malls, the Holy Ghost will fall on your hearers and they’ll be filled with the Spirit.</p>
<p>Get yourself immersed in Him every day. Before you go out, get filled with the Spirit. Soak your spirit more in the Holy Spirit through fellowship. Pray and fast often. God’s power to save, heal, deliver and bless is in the Gospel, which has been committed to your trust to share with others by the power of God’s Spirit. And this is the time!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST HIS SON CLEANSETH US FROM ALL SIN (1 John 1:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank God for Jesus! The Bible says in Him we have our riddance (redemption) through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins (Colossians 1:14). This is so powerful! Because of Jesus, all your sins are remitted (completely removed)—past, present and future.</p>
<p>No wonder we’re called His justified ones. We’re not “ordinary sinners saved by grace.” You’re not a “wretch”; like they sing, “Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a ‘wretch’ like me….” Even the sinner isn’t a wretch. Jesus didn’t die for a wretch. You’re somebody special. </p>
<p>Your value is the blood of the Son of God. That blood, the Bible says, cleanses you from all sins—all unrighteousness. Notice the present progressive tense, “cleanses,” which means it happens as often as you require it.</p>
<p>We live in an unclean world, with so much unrighteousness around us. Sometimes these impurities rub off on us. But thanks be unto God! The blood of Jesus Christ cleanses you from ALL unrighteousness; it’s automatic. Hallelujah! That’s what we read in our opening verse.</p>
<p>It didn’t say you’ll be cleansed after you pray for the forgiveness of your sins, neither did it say, “the blood is going to cleanse you from sin”; no! It’s not futuristic; it’s a continuous automatic process: His blood CLEANSES you each time the need arises! This is perfectly legal before God.</p>
<p>No wonder He calls us holy, unblameable and unreproveable in His sight (Colossians 1:22). Then, in 1 Corinthians 6:11, He says you’re washed, sanctified, and justified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Blessed be God!</p>
<p>Get to know, understand, and consciously walk in the light of God’s Word, in the light of your righteousness, and you’ll not have to worry about sin, because your nature in Christ isn’t subject to sin.</p>

<p><em><strong>They are astonished and think it very queer that you do not now run hand in hand with them in the same excesses of dissipation, and they abuse [you] (1 Peter 4:4 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All your life, you must have been hearing that the coming of the Lord is near. But make no mistakes about it, it’s closer now than you can imagine. Your role is to be prepared, and look forward to His return. Be one of those eagerly awaiting His return. He said in Luke 21:34-36*, “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.”*</p>
<p>1 Thessalonians 5:2-3 says, <em>“For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.”</em> The Word shows us that these things will be fulfilled towards the ending of time, and we’re in those days that the Scriptures talk about. We can truly see all the prophetic signs manifesting right before our eyes. </p>
<p>Now, Hebrews 2:3 cautions, <em>“How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation….”</em> Be sure that your life is in sync with God, living according to His Word. Don’t be ashamed to stand up for the Lord. He stood up for you, and saved you. Don’t be ashamed that they may call you names, insult you and even persecute you; live for the Lord.</p>
<p>The Bible says it’s better to suffer persecutions for doing the right thing than to join those who live in error. If they ostracize you for believing in Jesus, it makes no difference; Jesus loves you. If they forsake you, He won’t forsake you; He’s always in you and with you. Therefore, distinguish yourself for the Lord. That’s what God wants you to do.</p>
<p>Remember, the Rapture itself doesn’t have a sign. In other words, it can happen anytime. Therefore, serve the Lord heartily and with joy, so that when He comes, He’ll meet you aglow, and burning with the Spirit, serving the Lord.</p>

<p><em><strong>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son (Colossians 1:12-13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many assume and believe that one day, in the sweet-by- and-by, the Lord will graciously deliver us from the power of darkness. But Paul, by the Spirit, lets us know in our opening verse, that it’s already happened. Not only has the Father qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the Kingdom of light, He’s also “delivered” us from the power of darkness, and translated us into the Kingdom of His Love-son. Glorious news!</p>
<p>Notice the tenses used; they’re all in past: “Who hath <strong>delivered us</strong> from the power of darkness…and <strong>hath translated</strong> us….” That’s why those who seek deliverance day in day out are just acting ignorantly. It’s inconsistent with God’s present truth.</p>
<p>God’s people don’t need deliverance from Satan or the powers of darkness. The only deliverance some may need is from ignorance, and the cure for that is the knowledge of God’s Word: (Proverbs 11:9).</p>
<p>Being born again, you’re not under Satan’s jurisdiction or authority. But that isn’t even the best part, because God doesn’t just “deliver” or bring you out to leave you; He brings you out to bring you in! Having taken you away from the domain of darkness, evil powers and all their works, He TRANSLATED you into the glorious Kingdom of the Son of His love.</p>
<p>Therefore, that you’re in the same compound or live in the same street or city, or work in the same office with someone who isn’t born again doesn’t mean you’re in the same “place.” You’re in Christ; they are of this world—in the kingdom of darkness, under Satan’s dominion. You’ve been raised up together, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That’s where you are now: a place of glory, power, dominion, and authority. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High (Psalm 82:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can anyone read what the Psalmist penned in the scripture above and still preach, believe or teach a message that tries to convince God’s people that they’re mere humans? That isn’t consistent with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is that “Ye are gods!” Even Jesus reiterated it (John 10:34).</p>
<p>Therefore, when you profess your divinity, you’re not arrogating anything to yourself that God Himself hasn’t already said about you. The more you have, and walk in the consciousness of your divinity, the better and faster your growth in Christ.</p>
<p>Everything in the epistle teaches us that our humanity was nailed to the Cross. Romans 6:6 tells us, <em>“...that our old man is crucified with him….”</em> When you were born again, you were born after Christ, as a new type of being. 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature….”</em> Peter said, “We’re partakers (sharers) of the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:4).</p>
<p>When someone says, “We’re only humans,” it suddenly shows how ignorant they are of their divine life. If you say you’re human, you’ll suffer what humans suffer: the frustrations, depression, sickness, disease, lack, pain, misery, satanic oppression, and corrupting influences in this world. But if you profess your divinity and walk accordingly, you’ll live as a champion in this world, over and above the elements—the sufferings, distress, miseries and pain.</p>
<p>You might ask, “How about when we feel discouraged? Isn’t that part of our humanity?” But that’s the very thing that God said we must never allow. He said to Joshua, <em>“I’ve commanded you to be strong and brave. Don’t ever be afraid or discouraged…”</em> (Joshua 1:9 CEV). It doesn’t matter what happens to you; refuse to be discouraged.</p>
<p>No matter the adversities you face, be bold, courageous, and audacious in faith. James 1:2 says, <em>“My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.”</em> Humans cry when they go through tests and trials, but we rejoice, because we know that in all these things, we’re more than conquerors (Romans 8:37). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death (Revelation 12:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way to use the blood of Jesus against the adversary is taking the Communion, the breaking of bread and drinking of the cup in remembrance of Him. 1 Corinthians 11:26 says, <em>“For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.”</em></p>
<p>As you take the Communion, you’re proclaiming, speaking of, and shouting aloud, the Lord’s death and all the wonderful blessings of His redemptive work, consummated in your behalf, till He comes. Through His death, burial and resurrection, you were given a new life and brought into oneness with God.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when it says, “They overcame him by the word of their testimony,” the Greek word translated “testimony” is “marturia,” which means record. John used the same word in 1 John 5:11: <em>“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.”</em> The saints overcame the enemy by declaring “the record”; that is, their testimony of eternal life.</p>
<p>What are your declarations today? Learn to say over and over again: “I have eternal life; I hail from God and His divine Kingdom. I’m a child of God, separated from sin, defeat, lack, sickness, oppression, and the world.” Hallelujah! You don’t belong in the land of failure. You have a right to divine protection, prosperity, victory, success, liberty, divine health and all the blessings of salvation. These should be the words of your testimony.</p>
<p>If you’d put the Word in your heart, and speak it forth with your mouth, you’ll always win. Keep affirming your triumphant life in Christ. Celebrate the life of liberty, victory, health and success that you have in Christ Jesus, whose body was broken for you, and His blood shed to bring you into sonship with God. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field (Matthew 13:44).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Kingdom of God’s dear Son where you now live, all your resources, including your home, finances, and your physical body are all kingdom property. 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 makes it clear; it says, <em>“What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price….”</em></p>
<p>You’re the temple of God, and the temple sanctifies all things that are brought into it. Everything that’s brought to the temple is different from the things outside the temple. When money comes to you, for example, it becomes Kingdom-money, one sanctified for the Master’s use and glory. Until you recognize this, your money won’t be different from the money of the sinners, and what happens to their money will happen to yours.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 9:8 (AMPC) declares: <em>“And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].”</em></p>
<p>In this Kingdom, your greatness never diminishes, for He brought you into a life of ever-increasing glory, ever-increasing faith and ever-increasing grace. 2 Corinthians 9:10 says, <em>“Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness.”</em> Make impact for the Kingdom through your giving and watch your life blossom in righteousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left (Isaiah 30:21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, <em>“My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me”</em> (John 10:27). So, you can’t miss the voice of God talking to you. There’s one distinguishing element in His voice that makes it unmistakable: Love!</p>
<p>Let’s review His love-nature, as penned for us in the Scriptures. 1 John 4:7-8 says, “<em>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.”</em> Verse 16 further tells us, <em>“And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.”</em></p>
<p>These verses reveal that love is the totality of God’s nature. This is much more than someone having love in his heart or the ability to love; rather, it means God is love personified. He’s not a God of love; He is love.</p>
<p>Everything He does is from His love-nature. Therefore, whenever He speaks, you’ll always hear the voice of love. Even His reprimands and judgments are in love. Everything about Him emanates from love. That’s why, when God talks to you, if you aren’t rebellious, you’ll always hear Love’s voice in your spirit.</p>
<p>As an offspring of Love, you have it in you to respond to Love; to hear and respond to Him in love. The Bible tells us, <em>“There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. We love him, because he first loved us”</em> (1 John 4:18-19).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble (James 4:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re those who think what they need is a double or more anointing. But there’s no place in the Word of God where we’re admonished to ask for more or double anointing; what God gives is more grace. The life that He’s brought us into is one of grace to grace (John 1:16); grace heaped upon grace.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how some people outrightly ignore or don’t recognize the grace of God. There’s so much grace that you can take advantage of. But grace must be recognized, celebrated and used. Think about it: God’s throne is called “The throne of grace” (Hebrews 4:16). It says, <em>“Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, you can “take” whatever grace you require. You have to determine which grace you need, because there’re several different “graces.” Is it the grace for soul winning, or giving (2 Corinthians 8:6-7 NIV)? Which grace do you want?</p>
<p>This is a special season in God’s calendar; He’s releasing more grace! Take advantage of that special grace even now for your work, your family, your finances, leadership, etc. Do you realize it requires grace to deal with certain people and handle certain situations?</p>
<p>There’re situations that you may not have been able to handle with your current level of grace. But with more grace, you can! That means the Lord is promoting you to the next level, with more grace for your new level. Receive more grace for these times, and walk in dominion and absolute victory and mastery over circumstances, by the power of the Holy Ghost. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare (1 Timothy 1:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our theme verse, the Spirit of God admonishes Timothy to war a good warfare with the prophecies spoken concerning him. Since this is God’s Word, it then means it’s not peculiar to Timothy; it applies to you just as much. What have you done with all the prophecies that have been spoken over you, including the ones written concerning you in the Scriptures?</p>
<p>The Scriptures are replete with words of blessings and prophecies concerning the new creation; take them seriously. Use them in your fight of faith. Some have said, “You know, I’ve never really had anyone prophesy to me”; then prophesy to yourself! God said every one of us in the Church should covet the gift of prophecy, because it’s such an important gift in the Church (1 Corinthians 14:39).</p>
<p>The Bible says prophecy edifies the Church, and you’re a member of the Church. So, if anything edifies the Church, it should edify you. So, when there’s a word of prophecy in the church, receive it and personalize it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the word can come to you in a song while the choir is ministering, or while the preacher is preaching or teaching. It can come to you in your own spirit, because God is talking all the time to each one of us. Don’t forget where He is—He lives in you. If you pray and listen to Him in your spirit, the prophetic word will come to your spirit.</p>
<p>Besides the prophecies you receive in the church, the written word—the Bible— is full of prophecies. Get into your privacy, open a portion of the Bible that’ll exhort you, and begin to read the scriptures out to yourself. The Psalms have a lot of exhortation and prophecies. As you read them aloud, put your spirit with it; trust and believe the Word. Your spirit will immediately be in sync with the Spirit of God that authored the Word that you’re reading, and pick up words from the author of the writings and you’ll continue to prophesy. Prophecy is one of the ways to bring the supernatural power of God into manifestation.</p>

<p>God asked us to pray, because He plans to answer. Prayer is His idea; He invited us to pray. This should inspire you to pray, because the beautiful part about praying is the answers you get. </p>
<p>Some people have become so used to praying without answers that they now lack the confidence to pray. The reason is that they don’t understand this truth. Moreover, they’re praying amiss; they’re not praying the right way. I always get results when I pray, and you should too. The question then is, “How do you pray?”</p>
<p>In the New Testament, we pray in the Name of Jesus. We can ask the Father for anything in the Name of Jesus, and He’ll give it to us. This was what Jesus meant when he stated in John 16:23-24: <em>“And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.”</em></p>
<p>When we pray, we stand in the place of Jesus, we’re taking His place; so, we can’t be praying to Him in His Name, or while standing in His stead. In addition, we may demand that something be done or occur, in the Name of Jesus; this isn’t prayer; rather, it’s exercising the authority of His Name, as in John 14:12-14. That’s what Peter did in Acts 3:6: <em>“Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.”</em></p>
<p>So, prayer in the New Testament is geared to effecting changes. You can effect definite changes in the realm of the spirit through prayer, to your advantage. That’s why Jesus said, “...men ought always to pray, and not to faint.” That means pray always, and don’t give up, because when you pray, you make power available for the works of righteousness. Through prayer, we cause the will of God to be done in the earth as it is in heaven. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace (Romans 8:5-6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord Jesus had a spirituality that was unmistakable. He was very spiritual. For example, in Matthew 16:17, even while responding to Peter’s answer to a question He (Jesus) had asked, He dealt with the spiritual nature of what Peter said. Jesus had asked the disciples, “Whom do men say that I am?” Peter answered correctly, and Jesus replied, <em>“...Blessed art thou, Simon Bar jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.”</em></p>
<p>Peter didn’t know that it was God that gave him the revelation; he just spoke as it was in his heart. But Jesus immediately addressed the spirituality of his answer. He let Peter know that his answer didn’t come to him by his flesh or senses; it wasn’t from his study. Also, consider how He taught His disciples to pray in Matthew 6:9, when He gave them a format for prayer. He said, <em>“Our Father which art in heaven….”</em> He talked about the Father in heaven. The spirituality of His communication is so inspiring.</p>
<p>Even at His arrest, He said to the soldiers and the priests who came to arrest Him, <em>“…this is your hour, and the power of darkness”</em> (Luke 22:53). He let them know what power was behind their actions—the power of darkness. He dealt with the spirituality of every subject. This is how He wants us to live.</p>
<p>There’re some who think that being spiritual is excessive, but to live or do things any other way is death. When you’re motivated to do something, always consider whether your motivation is coming from God, from the flesh, or even Satan. You can tell by the Spirit and through the Word. Understanding the spirituality of life is where the victory in life really is. That’s where life’s purpose actually resides.</p>
<p>You’ve got to connect your life with that which is spiritual. Whether or not you realize it, you came from the Spirit. God made you and God is a Spirit. So, your origin is spiritual. Therefore, always be spiritually minded. Walk wisely. The Bible tells us to walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16). Your consciousness should be spiritual.</p>
<p>Think like Jesus. Talk like Jesus. Practise His way of thinking. But you can’t do that except you meditate on the Scriptures. The Word shows you what spiritual things are and delivers them to you. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come (1 Corinthians 11:26).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word “shew” isn’t exactly the same as “show”; to show is to display. Of course, it also means, in a certain way, to declare, to make known. But more typically, “shew” which is translated from the Greek word “kataggello” is to announce, to proclaim. When we take the Holy Communion, we’re announcing or proclaiming the Lord’s death. We’re being emphatic that the testator died; and as a result, His testament (His will) is in force.</p>
<p>That testament left you an estate; everything He owned, He gave to you; it’s declared in His will. A will is the last disposition of a man that died. All you need to enjoy what’s in the will is proof of death. Once he’s dead, the testament becomes effective. When we take the Communion, we’re reaffirming the Lord’s death, declaring that His testament is now in force. There’s no argument; Satan can’t stand against that. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Every time you have the opportunity to participate in the Holy Communion, it’s an announcement of glory, of your triumphant life in Christ Jesus. You’re declaring that all blessings of the New Testament are your present-hour reality. You’re in dominion and walking in glory; nothing has power over you.</p>
<p>No sickness, disease or infirmity can thrive in your body. His blood was shed for you that you may live. And now, you live, because He lives. This is the eternal significance of the Communion; it’s an announcement that His testament is in force.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God (Colossians 4:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Christians are committed to interceding for others; they just know it’s their job to do so. We all should be that way, because God needs such people. It’s possible the reason you’re able to study the Word today like you’re doing right now is the dedication of such people. It could be the reason you’re growing in the things of God and standing in the faith today.</p>
<p>You may not know it, but many are Christians today because of someone else who laboured in intercession, praying fervently, for their lives. The Bible says woe to that man who is alone; when he falls, he has no one to lift him up (Ecclesiastes 4:10). It’s important we support and lift others through prayer.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you become “a prayer collector,” enlisting “prayer warriors”; the local Church takes care of that. It’s the Pastor’s responsibility to train the Church to pray for one another.</p>
<p>Those who were around the Apostle Paul, one of whom is Epaphras, understood this message. As read in our theme verse, Epaphras interceded for the Church, God’s people in Colossi, to come to maturity. How inspiring!</p>
<p>When you take up the ministry of intercession, you’re siding with God as a labourer in the Kingdom. You’re working with Him to improve and impact the lives of others. Hallelujah! Jesus said, “The harvest is plenty, but the labourers are few” (Matthew 9:37). He needs those who would labour in prayer like Epaphras for the souls of men. Be that man or woman that He’s found to stand in the gap, to pray for people to come to Christ, to pray for fellow Christians who are yet to come to maturity in the things of God, and also for ministers of the Gospel to fulfill their call and destinies in the Gospel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth (Luke 12:15).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a popular story that’s been told for years, and it bears repeating because of its relevance today. It’s about a very wealthy man who had thousands of employees, but one day, he decided to commit suicide by drowning.</p>
<p>Somehow, there was a young man watching who had known this rich businessman for over twenty years. He rushed to the scene, just in time! At the risk of his own life, he dragged the old man back to shore. While they were both on the floor exhausted, trying to catch their breath, the old man said, “Why did you save me? You’re contributing to the frustration of my life.”</p>
<p>The young man, in complete shock, said, “But Sir, why would you want to die? Your family is the best in town. You’re well known in the community, and everybody loves you.” The old man retorted, “That’s the problem. I’ve lived for everybody. I’ve given jobs to thousands. I’ve made money for everybody. I’ve made people happy. But I’ve never been happy, myself. It’s not worth it. You should have allowed me to drown.” Then he pulled the young man close to himself and said, “Young man, try not to be like me. I’m a failure.” How sad.</p>
<p>But this is the situation of many. Don’t be carried away by the world’s symbols of success. Take for instance someone who, all his life, was raised with good character, but because of inordinate ambition for fame and wealth, he puts aside a good reputation and character to become a criminal. He thinks that’s the cheapest way. Because he thinks if he doesn’t measure up with the society of his day, that’s when he’s a failure. But man is not what he has!</p>
<p>Remember the words of Jesus, <em>“…a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.”</em> The most important thing in life is to discover your purpose, and fulfill it. It begins with living your life for Jesus, making impact with the Gospel; that’s living a purposeful life.</p>

<p><em><strong>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him (Colossians 3:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to learn to celebrate the Name of Jesus. I mean you shut your door for privacy, and dance to the Name of Jesus, all by yourself! For some people, when they’re alone, they mope and gripe about everything that bothers them and makes them unhappy. They’re always overwhelmed by their challenges, thinking about some unattained goals or “disappointments” they may have experienced. They can’t see what God has done. That shouldn’t be you.</p>
<p>When others aren’t with you, in your closet, you can say what you want and really express yourself in the presence of the Lord with no inhibitions. You can shout as much as you want to in celebration of the Lord, for His greatness and grace upon your life. Before long, you’d find yourself so stirred in the anointing of the Holy Ghost that you’d prophesy. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>I like to shout. I may not shout in a way that somebody else will hear me; I know how to shout “under my breath,” all by myself. I never have time for gloominess or to mull over negativity. The life of God in us is a great miracle; you ought to learn to celebrate it all the time.</p>
<p>There’s no reason for frustration or for you to be disadvantaged. If you’d learn to do these things, and do them consistently, even if you were in penury, He’ll bring you out, into abundance. Even if you thought you were already a failure, you’ll come out of that place. When you live your life in joy, in celebration of the Lord—His Name, and your life in Him, every day—you’ll always be on top. Glory to His Name forever.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature (Mark 16:15).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Christian, you must be effective in soul winning. You’re a missionary here on earth, an ambassador for Christ. You’re commissioned of God to take the message of salvation to others. That’s the instruction given to us, as read in the scripture above. Your life should be about soul winning; dedicate your time, effort, and resources to it.</p>
<p>Be known for your passion for the Lord, His Gospel, and the souls of men. Soul winning was Jesus’ lifestyle. On a certain occasion, as He passed through Samaria on His way from Judea to Galilee, He needed to rest a bit; so He sat at a well, while His disciples went to get some food.</p>
<p>While at the well, a woman came to draw water, and Jesus began to preach the Good News to her (Read John 4). Jesus encountered this woman and brought her out of her shell—the feeling that she was “nobody.” Despite being a total stranger to her, He gave her a new self-value. The Bible tells us to follow His example (1 Peter 2:21).</p>
<p>Sometimes, there’re those that we have to reach out to. You may notice someone who’s sitting quietly in a corner somewhere, and you pull a chair and sit beside that one, and say, “Can I be of help to you?” Then in the process, minister the Gospel to that one.</p>
<p>There’s the one who’s alone and seems helpless; then you come by, sit with him or her and you lead them to Christ. Don’t ignore them and act like they’re not there. Become concerned about their plight. Your life is all about being an effective witness for Jesus Christ. You represent Him in your world.</p>
<p>Your lifestyle and actions before non-Christians should, and must, be such that endear Christ to them, to believe and receive the Gospel. Your job is to win them and bring them into the Kingdom.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come (2 Timothy 3:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezra Chapter 6, the children of Israel decided to build the house of God upon their return from exile. The Bible tells us that as they built it, they prospered. Ezra 6:14 tells us how they prospered: <em>“… they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo....”</em></p>
<p>The latter part says, <em>“And they builded, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.”</em> This is profound, instructive and enlightening. They prospered in their work, they built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and the instructions of Kings Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, who were kings of Persia at different times. Those prophets caused it to happen through their message. They brought them the Word of God.</p>
<p>The ministry of the Word is so important in our lives; it’s integral to every success. That’s why we bring the Word to you every day through this devotional, to strengthen you, especially in these dark days. We’re not moved by what’s happening in the world today, because we know that in all these things, we’re more than conquerors (Romans 8:37). We prevail by the Word. Our glory, victories and success were preordained before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>We’re aware that the current imbroglio around the world is the handiwork of Satan. He tries to weaken the nations and their economies. But God never leaves you stranded. He keeps bringing you His Word to guide, encourage and strengthen you. Through the ministry of the Word, the wisdom and skill you require to be victorious are imparted to you.</p>
<p>Keep learning and meditating on the Word of God; it’ll grow mightily in you and prevail. You’ll be a wonder to your world, dominating circumstances, living above Satan and the elements of this world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth (Luke 12:15).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve often said that money is an illusion that exists only in the minds of the poor. There’s no such thing as “money.” Money is a deception and a distraction in the world. When God made this world, there was no such thing as money. Money evolved with time. With what’s happening in the world today, many now better understand that money is a game of numbers.</p>
<p>What God expects is that you live as the champion that He’s made you. Fear nothing in this world, and refuse to be intimidated. That’s the Gospel. Prosperity is beyond money. The presence or absence of money doesn’t change your state or condition spiritually, and therefore shouldn’t change your testimony of God.</p>
<p>If, for example, you require something, and your money isn’t enough for it, that doesn’t mean you can’t have it; you can get it free! That’s the life of prosperity I’m talking about. God never said, “Except you have the money, nothing will be yours”; rather, He said plainly, <em>“…all things are yours”</em> (1 Corinthians 3:21).           </p>
<p>What’s important is the purchasing power, and your purchasing power isn’t money; it’s your faith! You have what God says you have, irrespective of the currencies you have at hand or don’t have. Believe this and you’d be free from the power and intimidation of money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost (Romans 14:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the Scriptures, there’s a relationship between joy and the Holy Ghost. Romans 15:13 says, <em>“Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.”</em></p>
<p>Also, in 1 Thessalonians 1:6, the Bible says, <em>“And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.”</em> And our theme verse says the Kingdom of God is “righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.”</p>
<p>Although some Christians have received the Holy Spirit, their hearts are full of troubles; they’re worried about many things. They’re worried about their children, their health, business, etc. They just seem to have so many reasons to not be happy.</p>
<p>Someone may say, “With the things happening in my life, I need a change of environment; I need to travel somewhere I can really be happy.” No! Don’t look to anything external to give you joy. Joy is one of the fruits of your recreated human spirit. So, it’s in you. Your spirit produces endless joy. It’s called, <em>“...joy unspeakable and full of glory”</em> (1 Peter 1:8).</p>
<p>True joy and happiness have nothing to do with what’s going on around you. Our joy is independent of circumstances. We’re joyful in adversity. That’s what the Bible says: count it all joy, when you go through diverse tests (James 1:2).</p>
<p>Some thoughts may come to you to dampen your faith, to douse your joy and dampen your spirit; always be quick to discard such thoughts. Be joyful ALWAYS! The Spirit of God does more for and with us in an atmosphere of joy and happiness. So, make up your mind to be joyful, today, and always.</p>

<p><em><strong>And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel (Hebrews 12:24).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 11:25, the Bible says Jesus took <em>“...the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.”</em> His blood represents His life. He gave His life for you that you may live. The Bible says we weren’t redeemed with silver or gold or precious stones but with the blood, the precious blood of Jesus Christ, Son of the living God (1 Peter 1:18-19). His blood is your true value; and His blood speaks! It speaks blessings in your behalf.</p>
<p>His blood speaks your righteousness, justification, victory, prosperity and divine protection. You’re not left to the dictates and mercy of the adversary or the dominion of sin. You’re purified and preserved by His blood. The Bible says, <em>“Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us”</em> (Hebrews 9:12).</p>
<p>Thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ! It speaks your salvation. Hallelujah! The Bible says He was made sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him (2 Corinthians 5:21). Jesus didn’t just save you from sin; He gave you His life and nature. Today, sin, its effects and consequences have no dominion over you. You’re free to serve the Lord and live for Him.</p>
<p>Before Jesus came, there were sacrifices and offerings for the atonement of sins in the Old Testament. This involved the killing of animals, several bulls and goats. But the Bible says in Hebrews 10:4, <em>“For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.”</em></p>
<p>Jesus Christ, with one sacrifice, has PERFECTED FOREVER all those who are called in Him. He offered Himself once, for the total blotting away, the removal of sins (Hebrews 9:14). He purged our sins by His own blood: <em>“Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high”</em> (Hebrews 1:3).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 5:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each time I think about all that Jesus did for us, oftentimes, tears of worship and appreciation flow freely from my eyes. I’m elated with uncontrollable joy. Think about it: because of Jesus, we’ve been declared not guilty; justified; acquitted.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:4-6 tells us, <em>“But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.”</em> When Jesus died, we died with Him. When He was buried, we were buried with Him. When God raised Him from the dead, we were raised together with Him.</p>
<p>We were in Him in His death, burial, and resurrection. Romans 4:24-25 says, <em>“But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.”</em> We weren’t justified by His death; we were justified by His resurrection.</p>
<p>When He was raised from the dead, He was born again (Acts 13:32-33). He’s the head of the new creation. The Bible says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new”</em> (2 Corinthians 5:17).</p>
<p>You’re not the same person that was born of your biological parents; that’s the old man that had the nature of sin. That old man died in Christ, and a new YOU was born when you were born again. No wonder He says in Romans 6:4, <em>“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.”</em> Walk in the consciousness and light of your new life and nature in Christ. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ (Ephesians 3:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the scripture above, the Apostle Paul acknowledged that grace—a supernatural enablement, a gifting, an ability, a blessing—had been granted him to preach the unfathomable riches of Christ to the Gentiles. The same is true about you today because the Word of God is undated, and has universal applicability.</p>
<p>What we read came through the Apostle Paul by the Holy Spirit. That’s why it’s Scripture for us; but Paul has gone to heaven; however, that word has to be worked here. God is waiting for anybody who would step into it and announce it like Paul did. He’s waiting for whoever would be synchronized with it! I already got in sync with that verse years ago; so, I’m on it. Great grace has been granted me to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ, and I’m making full proof of it.</p>
<p>It’s your job to make everybody hear about and be influenced by Christ Jesus and His amazing love, and to have Christ in them. In the different organizations, platforms, forums and places you find yourself, see yourself placed there as a missionary. It makes no difference where you work; in that place, you’ve been graced to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ and bring glory to the Lord. Become conscious and strategic about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps you travel a lot; certainly, you meet people while on such trips; minister the Gospel to them. Moreover, when you arrive your destination, there’re souls there! Find out how you can effectively reach them. You can begin by giving them copies of Rhapsody of Realities. Be an effective witness for the Lord. That’s the reason for your life. Jesus said*, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you”* (John 15:16).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works (Hebrews 10:24).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Christianity, we provoke one another to love, to produce works of righteousness. We don’t provoke to hate, anger, jealousy or malice. Don’t provoke someone else to become resentful of another person. Always say and do things that promote love and peace, for you were created to love.</p>
<p>Jesus said in John 13:34, <em>“A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.”</em> Spread love. When people try to instigate a dislike within you for someone else, know that it’s a wrong spirit working through them, and lovingly let them know that they’re wrong.</p>
<p>Don’t entertain anything that’ll make you bitter or enraged towards someone else. Walk in love and inspire others to love. Jesus said, <em>“By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another”</em> (John 13:35). God has given you His love and the ability to express it lavishly. Romans 5:5 says, <em>“…the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.”</em></p>
<p>Let love show in your language. Let it reflect in your actions. Walking in love reveals the perfection of your spirit and person. Jesus said in Matthew 5:48, <em>“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”</em></p>
<p>But right before that, He said, <em>“But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven…”</em> (Matthew 5:44-45). He wants you to love unconditionally like your heavenly Father.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world (John 16:33).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1 John 5:5, John, by the Spirit asks, <em>“Who is he that has overcome the world?”</em> He immediately gives the answer: it’s the one who believes that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God! In the world, there’s hunger, poverty insecurity, sickness and disease, death and darkness. But you’re “in Christ.” Stay in Christ, for in Christ you’ve overcome Satan, the world and its failing systems.</p>
<p>It’s only when you look outside Christ that you see and are overwhelmed by the troubles, sorrows, distresses and corrupting influences in the world. He said, “In me, there’s peace; cheer up.” That’s His Word unto you. Accept it, and suddenly, you’d realize that nothing in this world can put you down.</p>
<p>No wonder He says, <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”</em> (1 John 4:4). This is the reason we’re forever excited about preaching the Gospel and making the love and righteousness of Christ known. How could anyone know this truth and be quiet?     </p>
<p>The whole world needs to know that there’s a Name that’s above every name, and that at that Name, every demon bows! At that Name, sicknesses give way! At that Name, poverty has no chance! They need to know that there’s success in life that’s independent of the world’s economics. True peace and prosperity are only found in Christ. This is where you come in; refuse to be quiet.</p>
<p>Open your mouth, and declare the Gospel freely and boldly. Let those you come in contact with know that only in Jesus Christ is there salvation. Let them know that God isn’t mad at them, and that they can now embrace life through the Gospel. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit (Galatians 5:25).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In John 14:21, the Lord Jesus reveals the secret to winning every day, living triumphantly. He said, <em>“He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.”</em> If you want Him to show up in your life, and for His glory to be manifested in and through you, He says it’s simple: “Keep my words.”</p>
<p>His glory is manifested when you act on His Word. Recall at the wedding in Cana of Galilee; when they needed more wine, Mary admonished the servants saying, “Whatever He tells you to do, do it.” Jesus then told them to fill the water pots with water, and when they did, the water turned into wine. It was Jesus’ first recorded miracle.</p>
<p>John then tells us concerning that miracle, “<em>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him”</em> (John 2:11). Prove your love by doing His Word, and you’ll experience blessings and miracles in your ministry, job, business, finances, physical body, and everything about you.</p>
<p>If you’ve found yourself in a situation where everything around you seems hard, don’t despair. Put the things you’ve learnt to practice. We’re Word-practitioners; we do the Word. The challenges you face are your opportunity to demonstrate your trust in the Lord, and prove His Word. Therefore, keep declaring your health, success, prosperity, and victory in Christ Jesus.</p>
