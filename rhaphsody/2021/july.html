<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads (Revelation 7:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Rapture of the Church, there’ll be a time of Great Tribulation, according to the Scriptures, particularly during the second half of the seven-year treaty to be signed with Israel and a coalition by the Antichrist, the man of lawlessness.</p>
<p>During this period, 144,000 Jews will be anointed by God to preach the Gospel and get people prepared for the second coming of Christ. While they’re at it, they’d need to be sealed because of the different judgements that would be poured out on the earth throughout that period. Men will be plagued, except those with the seal of God on their foreheads (Revelation 9:4), even as we the Church had been sealed during the Church age.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise”</em> (Ephesians 1:13). 2 Corinthians 1:21-22 also says, <em>“Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God; <strong>Who hath also sealed us</strong>, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.”</em> Having received the Holy Spirit, you’ve been sealed by God. Because of this, you have God’s approval, His authority, and His protection.</p>
<p>Therefore, it doesn’t matter what’s happening in the world; refuse to fear. There’s a decree that you shouldn’t be hurt like others; you’re separated, severed from perishing because you believe in Jesus Christ. So, don’t mix fear with your faith. The Kingdom to which you belong, and the life that God has given you, function with the exclusion of fear.</p>
<p>Meditate again on John 3:16: <em>“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish…</em>” (NKJV). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints (Revelation 5:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Old Testament, the Lord gave instructions to the priests to burn incense morning and evening in the Tabernacle. They were also to offer sacrifices in the morning and in the evening. Yet, the Bible says all that was a shadow of things to come (Hebrews 10:1). God wanted something better and spiritual.</p>
<p>Many years later, the Apostle John, by the Spirit, sees into the heavens and is shown this amazing truth: <em>“…golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints”</em> (Revelation 5:8). Blessed be God! When we pray in the earth, it comes before the Lord as incense. King David had a revelation of this; the Lord had guided him to understand that our prayers are actually set before God as incense. So he said in Psalm 141:2, <em>“Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.”</em></p>
<p>The kind of prayer referred to is one of worship and intercession. In worship, we offer sacrifices of praise to the Lord with the fruit of our lips—words of praise and thanksgiving (Hebrews 13:15). Our intercessory prayers go up to God, thwarting the plans of the enemy and changing things in the heavenly realm. This is such a heavenly ministry!</p>
<p>Think about it: As we pray, we send incense; fragrance of a sweet smell—a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God—resulting in positive changes in the earth! That’s why you should always pray. 1 Thessalonians 5:17 says, <em>“Pray without ceasing.”</em> 1 Timothy 2:1-4 says, <em>“I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority....”</em> As saints of God, we have a ministry of prayer. It’s our responsibility to pray for sinners that they may receive salvation. Each one of us has a primary ministry of worship, which is ministering to the Lord. These prayers of intercession and worship are the incense before the Father.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer (Revelation 6:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day while in prayer, I was singing a hymn that went thus: “All hail the power of Jesus name, let angels prostrate fall; bring forth the royal diadem, <strong>and crown Him Lord of all</strong>.” Suddenly, the Lord stopped me and said, “Crown Him Lord of all? You can’t do it.”</p>
<p>For the first time, I thought about it and realized that no man can crown Him; not even the whole world could. With what will they crown Him? We don’t have a good enough crown to put on Him, neither do we have any authority to bestow on Him. More so, you can’t crown the One who has all authority. All power is His.</p>
<p>It explains why some Bible scholars have difficulties understanding certain portions of Scripture such as Revelation 6:2. It says, <em>“And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; <strong>and a crown was given unto him</strong>: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.”</em></p>
<p>Some think the horse rider in the verse above is Jesus, but He’s not. First, it says the rider had a bow. Jesus never uses a bow; the Bible however says He (Jesus) has a sword (Revelation 2:12). In Revelation 6:2, we read that <strong>“…a crown was given unto him....”</strong> But a crown wasn’t given to Jesus; He’s the King of kings. The description: <em>“…he went forth conquering and to conquer”</em> isn’t of Jesus, but of the Antichrist.</p>
<p>Jesus will only battle the nations at His second coming. That’s when He’ll ride on a white horse and judge the nations in righteousness. Revelation 19:11-12 says, <em>“And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.”</em> Notice that a crown wasn’t given to Him; rather, He has many crowns, and He gives crowns (James 1:12; 1 Peter 5:4).</p>
<p>It’s important to know who Jesus really is, and to sing the right songs to worship Him. He is <em>“…the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords; Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen”</em> (1 Timothy 6:15-16).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, STOOD A LAMB as it had been slain… (Revelation 5:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we get to heaven, we won’t find the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit sitting on different thrones; we’ll only find One seated in the fullness of God on the throne, whose Name is Jesus. He’s the lamb at the centre of the throne (Revelation 7:17). He’s the outward expression of the Godhead. Colossians 2:9 says, <em>“For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”</em> However, looking at our opening verse, one could ask: if Jesus is seated on the throne, who then is the Lamb that stood in the midst of the throne?</p>
<p>In studying the Book of Revelation, you have to understand that prophetic visions and revelations are often given and communicated with symbolisms. This was no different with John the writer of this book. The Lamb here was symbolic.</p>
<p>John didn’t say he saw a man, but a Lamb, which typifies Jesus Christ. This was symbolic of the Father’s relationship with Jesus; it was characteristic of Jesus’ attitude and humility. We learn more about His humility in Philippians 2:6-9: <em>“Who, although being essentially one with God and in the form of God [possessing the fullness of the attributes which make God God], did not think this equality with God was a thing to be eagerly grasped or retained…He abased and humbled Himself [still further] and carried His obedience to the extreme of death, even the death of the cross! Therefore [because He stooped so low] God has highly exalted Him and has freely bestowed on Him the name that is above every name”</em> (AMPC).</p>
<p>Remember the words of the Prophet Isaiah, which also highlights His humility and obedience: <em>“He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth”</em> (Isaiah 53:7).</p>
<p>Jesus is the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world (Revelation 13:8) for the sins of all men. John the Baptist called Him the Lamb of God in John 1:29, and Peter in his epistle says the same in 1 Peter 1:19. Now, God has enthroned us with Him in the heavenly realms. We’re seated with Him (Ephesians 2:6), and through us, He demonstrates the exceeding riches of His grace, glory and power. Blessed be His Name forever!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not; neither WAS THEIR PLACE FOUND ANY MORE IN HEAVEN (Revelation 12:7-8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible tells us that after the Rapture, there’ll be a war in heaven. Satan and his demons will fight to retain their place in the heavenlies but Michael and his angels will prevail over them, and Satan will be cast out into the earth, meaning that he’ll have no place anymore in the heavenlies.</p>
<p>Someone might be wondering, “Does that mean Satan currently has a place in the heavenlies?” The Bible says he does: <em>“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual <strong>wickedness in high places</strong>”</em> (Ephesians 6:12).</p>
<p>Ephesians 2:2 also says, “Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.” Oftentimes, when there’s chaos, anarchy and turmoil in a society, many don’t realize that the devil is behind such things.</p>
<p>From his place in the atmospheric realms, Satan runs families, cities, kingdoms, and nations, determining a lot of things that happen in them. He’s only restrained—his efforts, operations and manoeuvres are only thwarted by the prayers of the saints of God. When we pray, God’s mercy is released and angels are dispatched upon our request and according to His will.</p>
<p>This is why you can’t afford to sit idly by or be complacent while the devil runs rampage in your family, business, city, or nation. You need to learn how to pray and pray the right way. You need to learn how to use the Name of Jesus and stand against the demonic powers that lure men into destruction and foment trouble in the nations of the world and around you.</p>
<p>We’ve been vested with all power and authority in heaven and in the earth to subdue, dominate and decimate satanic powers, their activities, and take charge of our world. We have the power to frustrate the devil and keep him under our feet. We’re not helpless at all. You have the authority to determine what happens in your life, in the lives of your loved ones, in your nation, and around the world by using the Name of Jesus.</p>

<p><em><strong>[And it is, indeed, a source of immense profit, for] godliness accompanied with contentment (that contentment which is a sense of inward sufficiency) is great and abundant gain (1 Timothy 6:6 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s so inspiring to know that as a child of God, you can win and have a glorious life, every day; a life that you can be happy about, every day. A key factor for enjoying your life is learning to enjoy the process of growth; learning to recognise and be satisfied with your present accomplishments as you aspire to greater heights.</p>
<p>Some people are never satisfied with their lives. They carry an air of sadness and discontent all the time. This attitude worsens their situation, so they never really know what it means to be truly joyful. True joy is in fulfilling your God-given purpose—being in God’s place, at God’s time, for God’s purpose in God’s way. Nothing could be more fulfilling than that.</p>
<p>Forget the missteps of yesterday. Don’t be bothered about tomorrow. Enjoy today. The regrets of yesterday and apprehensions about tomorrow are enemies of today’s happiness. If you aren’t satisfied about today, tomorrow’s dreams may never materialise.</p>
<p>Being satisfied about today doesn’t mean shelving your dreams for a greater tomorrow; it just underscores your hopefulness, preparation, anticipation and excitement for a more rewarding future. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee (Isaiah 26:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To see your life go from grace to grace, make giant leaps of faith, and experience the uplifting power of God, you have to make certain decisions. The first is to surround yourself with the right information, and that can only be gotten from God’s Word.</p>
<p>If you’re not giving yourself to God’s Word as you should, there’ll be other information that’ll come to you, albeit, negative, to keep you from living a life of victory. Make a conscious decision to study and meditate on the Word; let the Word of God dwell in you richly. Discipline yourself to keep listening to the Word of God, day in, day out.</p>
<p>You might say, “It’s a busy world; how do I create the time to consistently listen to, or study the Word?” While you are dressing up in the morning getting ready for work, or even while you’re on the go, listen to a message on your device. This is one sure way to constantly bombard your mind with the Word of God so that your faith will keep growing to meet the challenges and the crises of life in the present hour.</p>
<p>If you stay in the word, your faith will be strong. Romans 10:17 says, <em>“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.”</em> Perhaps you commute long distance to work every day; maximize those times. If you’re on the bus or train, put your earplugs on; shut the world out and listen to God. If you aren’t driving, get out any of our books, be it in print or digital format and study; inundate your mind with thoughts from God’s Word.</p>
<p>Your spirit has ears that are different from your physical ears; so, don’t stop listening to the Word. When the crises of life come, your faith will prevail; you’ll always win. Take advantage of our different platforms, like the Pastor Chris Digital Library (PCDL), the Rhapsody of Realities mobile app (where you can download Rhapsody of Realities and our other books) and build your life with the Word of God. Listen to, and study these materials, not just once but consistently, until the message gets into your spirit and stays. That’s what will produce the results you desire.</p>

<p><em><strong>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God (Hebrews 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re many today, including leaders, who have forgotten the purpose and mission of the Church. They’re carried away by the work, so much so they’ve forgotten the objective. It’s like being on a journey but forgetting the destination; they’re carried away by the sights and pleasures, the many distractions and attractions on the way.</p>
<p>Why do you live? What’s your purpose? In 2 Corinthians 1:8-9, the Apostle Paul said*, “For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead.”* It’s only when you understand your mission that you can have an attitude and mindset as the one we see in the verses we just read.</p>
<p>Without a consciousness of the mission, you may be enjoying the journey, but you’re going nowhere. Therefore, you must live as one who has a destination, a God-given purpose. That way, nothing in this earth can shake you; the things of this earth will have no value to you, because your mind is on your purpose and on your mission.</p>
<p>It was so with Jesus, who <em>“…for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame...”</em> (Hebrews 12:2). It didn’t matter that they put a crown of thorns on His head with blood dripping from Him, and the excruciating pains from those nails; He endured it all.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what challenges you’re facing in your life; focus on the destination. Don’t let the things that happen along the way distract you from finishing your course. Paul demonstrated his resolve as stated in Acts 20:22-24: <em>“And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord... (Philippians 3:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I analyze some of the things going on in the world today, I remember the commitment of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. They said to the king, “We will not bow to your image of gold.” And the king got angry and threatened to throw them into a burning fiery furnace. But they responded boldly, “Our God is able to deliver us from your fire; but if He doesn’t, we still won’t bow” (Read Daniel 3).</p>
<p>They weren’t refusing to bow to the king’s image because they expected that God would deliver them. It didn’t matter to them whether or not they’d be delivered from the fire. They were standing their ground because of their commitment to the Lord, recognizing that He’s the only true God. Thus, in spite of the intimidation, they wouldn’t budge! What a conviction!</p>
<p>It was a similar case with Daniel. There had been a decree against prayer to any God but the king for thirty days. But Daniel continued in prayer; the Bible says when he found out a decree had been passed to outlaw prayer, he prayed again as he always did, knowing that the supervisors were watching (Daniel 6:6-10).</p>
<p>For refusing to yield to the obnoxious decree by the King, Daniel was thrown into the Lion’s den. There’s no record that Daniel prayed to be delivered from the lion’s den; he was rather ready to be eaten up by lions than deny his faith in God. These are set for us as examples. Our situation today isn’t any different. When it comes to what God has said versus what anyone else is saying, it’s not a difficult choice; there’s just one way we go—Jesus only! We serve the Lord Christ. When it comes to the call of the Gospel, live or die, we’re the Lord’s! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Never find yourself apologetic, intimidated or reluctant to express your convictions about Christ and the message of the Gospel. We’ve got to be ready. We’re from a lineage of those who gave everything and requested no deliverance; they wanted a better resurrection, a victorious one. Come what may, be undaunted; be bold about your faith in Jesus Christ. Be convinced and compelled by the truth of the Gospel and preach it boldly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth... (Deuteronomy 8:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prosperity has nothing to do with how hard you fast and pray; it’s the Lord’s doing. God is the One who prospers you. He delights in your prosperity (Psalm 35:27). You don’t have to wonder whether or not God wants you to prosper. He doesn’t want you to put your trust in step-by-step human calculations, because that won’t work. They may seem to work for some time, but they won’t last. True and lasting prosperity comes by grace.</p>
<p>A story is told in Mark 10, of a rich young ruler’s attitude to wealth. He wanted to know what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus told him to obey all the commandments; but he said, “Master, all these have I observed from my youth.” The Bible says Jesus looked at him with love, and said to him, “Go and sell all that you have, and give it to the poor, and come and follow me” (Mark 10:21). At that, the rich young ruler went away sad. He was tied to his possessions, for the Bible says he had great possessions; or as someone rightly put it: “his great possessions had him.”</p>
<p>Jesus then looked round about and said to His disciples, <em>“...How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!”</em> (Mark 10:23). Jesus was letting them understand that salvation wasn’t going to be by their money, or great possessions, but by the Spirit of God. Jesus wanted the rich young man to put his trust, not in his wealth, but in God, the giver of wealth.</p>
<p>Your prosperity isn’t dependent on any man, your business, the systems and governments of this world, or the economy, but on God. It’s by His grace. Now you can understand why He says in 2 Corinthians 9:8: <em>“And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work.”</em> The power that God gives His children to get wealth is spiritual power, not political power or economic power. It’s the power He gives every Christian to propagate God’s righteous course. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body (James 3:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse above tells us about Christian perfection or maturity in Christ and how to measure it. He says, <em>“If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man….”</em> Jesus said, <em>“For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned”</em> (Matthew 12:37). He put the premium on words.</p>
<p>In other words, whether you go to heaven or you go to hell would depend on the words you speak. Your life came by words, and so, it’ll always be dependent on words. Some people don’t understand this, so they speak carelessly, using profane and derogatory words, especially when they’re angry or unhappy.</p>
<p>Don’t pride yourself in your ability to subdue others with ugly words that damage their self-esteem. It may be someone who’s confided in you about something, but now there’s an issue; don’t see it as an opportunity to “expose” him or her. Think about the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life: even though He knows everything about you, He never accuses or denigrates you before anyone. He loves and protects you always.</p>
<p>Jesus is that way too. He knew all men and knew everything about everybody, but He related to them in love. Even as He ministered to some of those who rejected His message, He said, “I judge you not” (John 12:47). How gracious He is! That’s the example He gives us to follow. If He never accuses you, if He doesn’t condemn you, if He doesn’t berate you with disparaging words, why do you think it would be proper to do that to your brothers and sisters? Express love only, especially in your words.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus (2 Timothy 2:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s no better time to be strong in the Lord, taking advantage of all His might, than in these last days. You have to be strong in the spirit. Paul the Apostle, in writing to the church in Ephesus, said, <em>“Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might”</em> (Ephesians 6:10). How important this is for us today.</p>
<p>There’ll be a time of testing in your life, and in that testing period, you must remain in the Lord. There may be so much happening in your life; the challenges may be fierce and the storms raging hard; but be strong in the Lord; in His grace. He said, “<em>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord…”</em> (1 Corinthians 15:58).</p>
<p>The Word says in Matthew 10:22*, “…he that endureth to the end shall be saved.”* You have to not just finish but finish stronger than how you started. That’s the path of the righteous; it’s <em>“…like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day”</em> (Proverbs 4:18 ESV).</p>
<p>In Christ, we get stronger; the glory continues to increase. It’s from faith to faith, glory to glory, and grace heaped upon grace. That’s the life He’s given us. As long as you’re strong in the Lord—keeping His Word in your heart and in your mouth—you’ll continually walk in victory and dominion.</p>
<p>Yes, there’re tests, trials and challenging times in our journey of faith, but the Bible says, <em>“If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small”</em> (Proverbs 24:10). To gripe and cower when situations challenge your faith is to checkmate your chances of promotion. Recall what the Spirit says in James 1:2: <em>“My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.”</em> He knows that victory is in our spirit.</p>
<p>Never be overwhelmed by any situation, for there’s a strengthener in you—the Holy Spirit. And in Him, by Him, and through Him you’ve overcome: <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”</em> (1 John 4:4). Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak (Matthew 26:41).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God said, <em>“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge…”</em> (Hosea 4:6). And Jesus said, “<em>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free”</em> (John 8:32). Many are walking in darkness without knowing, because they don’t know the truth; they don’t know the Scriptures. They’re honestly seeking truth; they want to know God, but then they go to the wrong place for knowledge.</p>
<p>Just because you heard some people say, “Shout hallelujah and clap for Jesus,” doesn’t mean it’s a church of Jesus Christ. You’ve got to be spiritually discerning. In Acts 16, while walking through the marketplace, Paul and Silas encountered a girl possessed with an evil spirit. The Bible says, <em>“The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation”</em> (Acts 16:17).</p>
<p>Wasn’t she stating a fact? She was! But the 18th verse says, <em>“…Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.”</em> What she was saying sounded nice, but she was being influenced by a spirit of divination. Paul discerned this, for as she spoke, he (Paul) was grieved in his spirit.</p>
<p>When the Spirit of God speaks, a child of God isn’t grieved in his spirit; rather, you’re edified. When you hear a voice or a message, you have to know by what spirit such a message is coming to you. Many Christians have listened to the voice of Satan and mistaken it for God’s voice, because they were undiscerning.</p>
<p>We’re in the last days, and Jesus told us these things would happen; so He says, <em>“Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation….”</em> And in Matthew 10:16, He said, <em>“Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.”</em> Then in Ephesians 5:15 AMP He tells us not to be ignorant, but to always discern the will of God: <em>Therefore, see that you walk carefully [living life with honor, purpose, and courage; shunning those who tolerate and enable evil], not as the unwise, but as wise [sensible, intelligent, discerning people.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life (1 John 5:13 NIV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s important that you come into a consciousness of who you really are in Christ. You have to learn and recognize who and what Christ means to you and in you.</p>
<p>The thrust of John’s admonition in our theme verse is the word “know,” which is “eido” (Greek), and it means awareness. So, John says, “I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may have the awareness that you have eternal life.” You already believe; you already know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God; you already know in the deepest recesses of your spirit that you have eternal life; but is it in your present-moment, every-day consciousness?</p>
<p>He’s talking about a certain kind of knowledge that affects your current behaviour, your current decisions and opinions. He wants your current actions to be guided by this knowledge. He wants you to know that you were born into eternity when you were born again. You have eternal life now. This is why Peter the Apostle stated in 2 Peter 1:3-4 that we’re associates of the God-kind: <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust”</em> (2 Peter 1:3-4).</p>
<p>With such awareness, when you face challenges, you’re unflustered, because you know who you are. Meditate on the Word of this life, and it’ll promote health in your body. Be aware of your roots in Christ, your divine lineage and heritage. It should become part of the scope of your knowledge that your life is for the glory of God; you’re more than a conqueror. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses (1 Timothy 6:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2 John 1:1, the Bible says, <em>“The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth.”</em> Nobody wrote about the truth and the use of that word like John. Why was he so eager to talk, and so conscious, about the truth? He caught it when Jesus said, <em>“...I am the way, the truth, and the life…”</em> (John 14:6).</p>
<p>None of the other writers of the gospels quoted Jesus on that; but it was very important to John. In 3 John 1:1, he said, <em>“The elder unto the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.”</em> Here, John calls the Gospel of Christ, the Truth.</p>
<p>Truth is reality. The Word of God that’s been given to us is truth: <em>“…thy word is truth”</em> (John 17:17). You can be as prosperous, healthy and successful as you want to be. What you need is to train your mind to stay on the truth of God’s Word always.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you hear or what you’re being told; whether it’s about your health, family, finances, business, etc., as long as it doesn’t measure up to God’s truth, it’s not a factor. Truth has nothing to do with physical manifestations or sensory perceptions. </p>
<p>When you know truth, for instance, you won’t be bothered if the devil told you were going to die of cancer or whatever disease. When he whispers such thoughts to you, silence his voice by responding with God’s truth: “The Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in me, and He has vitalized my mortal body! The Holy Ghost perambulates my body. Hallelujah!”</p>
<p>That’s walking in the truth! There’re things you’d completely disallow in your life—everything that isn’t of God—because you’re compelled by the knowledge of the truth. Glory to His Name forever!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature… (2 Peter 1:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every man has an intuition that he’s more than an animal, and that’s correct. Jesus is the very embodiment of the divine nature, the very revelation of God, the express image of divinity, the outshining of God’s glory. He became a living example for us to see and to behold God’s plan, purpose, and expectation.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“In him was life; and the life was the light of men”</em> (John 1:4). Then we read in 1 John 5:11-12, <em>“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life….”</em> When you were born again, the divine life was imparted to your spirit; from that moment, you became a partaker of the divine nature— an associate of the God-kind.</p>
<p>This is what men have always sought consciously and unconsciously! This is the mystery, testimony and power of Christianity: the reality of our oneness with Deity. The bane of many has been their ignorance of the power, import and impact of the divine life in them. They aren’t conscious that as Christians, we’re God carrying vessels, fully loaded with God!</p>
<p>Be awakened to this reality, so much so, it reflects in your language. If you’re still one to make statements such as, “I was scared to death”; or “That thing almost killed me,” then you haven’t come to the awareness that you’ve received the life and nature of God into your spirit! You don’t yet know who you are.</p>
<p>We don’t die! Life works in us. We don’t have the spirit of fear, but of love, power and a sound mind. Being born again, you belong to a heavenly pantheon; you’re in the God-class. The life in you can’t be tainted, corrupted or impaired by sickness, disease or death. But because many don’t know this truth, they live as victims.</p>
<p>No wonder the psalmist lamented, <em>“I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes”</em> (Psalm 82:6-7). How sad! Let your divinity soar; give expression to the God-life, the God-nature in you. Don’t live as an ordinary man or woman, for Christ has made you extraordinary. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God (Ephesians 3:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase “might be known” in the scripture above is “gnorizo” in Greek, and it means to certify, declare, make known or give to understand. The Church is designed by God to house, display or manifest the manifold—many-sided—wisdom of God. This is huge!</p>
<p>It means the Church will make known to the principalities and powers in heavenly realms, the awe- inspiring, endless, wisdom of God. This is our calling in the now of our lives; God seeks to demonstrate His power, His wisdom, through us NOW.</p>
<p>The question is, how is this possible? It’s pretty simple: He filled us with wisdom. 1 Corinthians 1:24 declares that Christ is the power and wisdom of God. Christ in you is God’s great answer to all human need. Christ in you is your glory and wisdom. Until you understand this, you may never take advantage of it. That’s why there’re lots of Christians who act confused in life, walking in darkness, when they’re the light of the world.</p>
<p>Christ has been made unto you wisdom. Just as easily as you can say, “I’m the righteousness of God in Christ,” always be quick to affirm that this vital resource of divinity—divine wisdom—is deposited within the recesses of your human spirit and expressed in your daily walk.</p>
<p>Remember, being filled with the Holy Spirit means you’re filled with Christ, the wisdom of God. Even now, affirm boldly that Christ is your wisdom; you’re led and guided in wisdom; you speak wisdom and deal wisely in all your affairs. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Luke 13, a woman who was bent double came into the synagogue; the Bible says for eighteen years she couldn’t straighten up herself. But Jesus knew her problem was spiritual. So He said to those present, <em>“…ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?”</em> (Luke 13:16).</p>
<p>Who could have thought it was a spirit of infirmity that held her bound? Medical doctors would have been trying to find out what happened to her bones, the muscles, the tendons, or her ligaments—carrying out futile tests. But Jesus discerned that it was a spirit of infirmity.</p>
<p>It’s important that you’re spiritually discerning; be spiritually minded. You have the Holy Spirit living in you; He’s the Spirit of knowledge. Through the revelation and enlightenment He brings to your spirit, you can know the truth about any situation. He’s the Spirit of truth, and part of His ministry in your life is to guide you into all truth. That way, you can always tell what’s behind a particular problem or situation.</p>
<p>It’s also not enough to simply know what’s behind the problem or that a case is spiritual. Learn from what Jesus did; the Bible says, <em>“And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God”</em> (Luke 13:12-13). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Jesus said the woman was bound by the devil, and if His diagnosis was wrong, His prescription or response would have yielded no result. Jesus always interpreted and dealt with issues from the spiritual standpoint. Likewise, you must be spiritual and spiritually minded. Listen to the Spirit of God; study and meditate on the Scriptures; pray often in the Spirit, and your spiritual alertness and sensitivity will be at its peak always.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s (Philippians 2:19-21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I came across the scripture above many years ago, it caught my attention. Paul was deeply concerned about the church in Philippi, and desired to minister to them. But he couldn’t personally visit them, because he was in prison. Then he said to them, “Timothy is the one that I can send to you, because the others seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s. How enlightening!</p>
<p>There’re many like that in the Church today; they seek their own and live unto themselves; they’re selfish. Yet, the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:15, <em>“…that he (Christ) died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.”</em></p>
<p>Selfish people can’t walk in truth, and can’t truly walk in love. Selfishness is contrary to the Word of God. When you have a dream for something you want to do, even if it’s something you want to do for God, it’s important you ask yourself what your real motivation is. You may find yourself struggling between the love of God and the love of yourself, struggling between serving Jesus and serving your interests.</p>
<p>That’s what Paul was referring to; He could only pick Timothy, of the several people he had with him, to send to the Philippian church. Paul was convinced Timothy would do the work from a pure heart; he’d do it selflessly, in love. Paul was writing, not just for that day but also for us to learn.</p>
<p>In Matthew 6:33, Jesus communicated a similar thought when He said, <em>“But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.”</em> He didn’t say the first of the things you should seek is the Kingdom of God and after that you can seek other things. No; He said be Kingdom-conscious; pursue Kingdom expansion and the establishment of God’s righteousness; put that first, and you’ll never need to struggle for anything in life.</p>
<p>Trust God with your life; serve Him with a pure heart, and watch Him take you from glory to glory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness (2 Peter 1:5-6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Temperance is from the Greek word “egkrateia” and it means self-control, the ability and will to control your impulses, to delay immediate gratification for a long-term gain. That simply means the ability to wait or hold on, saying “no” or “not now” to your impulses.</p>
<p>This was the virtue Moses displayed after he had been raised as a prince in Pharaoh’s house. The Bible says*, “…when he grew up, refused to be treated as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter. He chose to share the oppression of God’s people instead of enjoying the fleeting pleasures of sin”* (Hebrews 11:24-25 NLT). “What if I don’t have temperance?” someone may ask.</p>
<p>As long as you’re born again, you have the virtue of temperance. The Bible says it’s the fruit of the recreated human spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). The man who desires to operate effectively with this virtue must learn to control his senses. And that can be achieved by training your body.</p>
<p>You have to discipline your body; break it the way you break a horse until it does what you say, not you doing what it says. If your body can’t be subject to you, then it means you’re a slave to your body. And you can’t do anything serious for the Lord if you’re body-ruled.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 9:27, Paul said, <em>“…I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection….”</em> For instance, you can decide you’ll not sleep whenever you’re in church, or whenever you’re studying the Bible or listening to God’s Word; that’s temperance.</p>
<p>Also, when you fast; don’t find yourself going for food barely an hour into the fast. Part of the essence of a fast is to deny yourself the natural cravings in order to put your body in subjection to your spirit. You have the ability and will to control your impulses, to subdue your body and tell it what to do, and it’ll comply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God (James 2:23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s so important to understand that there’re several broad applications and definitions of righteousness. But righteousness, first and foremost, is the nature of God, His nature of rightness. The nature of God can be described from different perspectives, like we say, “God is love”; so, love is His nature. But when we talk about righteousness, that’s a different nature we’re describing.</p>
<p>Righteousness as God’s nature is His ability to be right and do right only and always. It’s His perfection, accuracy and distinction in glory. Righteousness distinguishes God in glory from everyone else. Now, this righteousness is absolutely unattainable by man or any creature. Therefore, in God’s benevolence, He attributes, bestows or imputes to us a kind of righteousness which is called “Right standing.”</p>
<p>You may have heard what in some countries is called “a certificate of conformity”; it’ll help you understand what righteousness or right standing is. It stipulates that a particular product meets the required standards or specification of the government or authorized agency. There’s also the “certificate of good standing,” which certifies that a company is properly registered with the state and it’s up to date on all state levies and required documentations, and therefore legally permitted to engage in business activities in the state.</p>
<p>Now, right standing, like the certificate of good conduct or good standing is the ability to stand before God and be accepted. Now we can fellowship with Him, unafraid and unashamed. The most beautiful part is that He didn’t wait for you to have “complied” or “filed” the necessary “documentations” and meet all the required standards first; He declared you righteous because of what Jesus did in your behalf.</p>
<p>Recall we read in our theme verse that <em>“... Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness….”</em> God gave Abraham the certificate of right standing for believing. Likewise, righteousness was imparted to you as a result of your faith in Jesus Christ. It’s the gift of God—a gift of grace imparted to all men, which becomes effectual the moment one submits to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>God’s idea and expectation isn’t just for some of us to be effective in the work of the ministry, while some others in the Church are spectators. The work of the ministry is for every Christian. The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:18, “<em>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and <strong>hath given to us</strong> the ministry of reconciliation.”</em></p>
<p>Notice the underlined: God gave US—not just the apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists and pastors— the ministry of reconciliation! No one is left out in this. His purpose in teaching us His Word is for us to be raised to live the Kingdom life; to subdue this world and establish His righteousness in the earth and in the hearts of men.</p>
<p>As we carry out the work of the ministry, the world will wonder at the life of glory, success, victory and prosperity exuding from us. This is because we’re His ambassadors; the light in the midst of darkness. This is the time for those around you who don’t have the divine life to wonder whether you’re an angel, as you minister the Gospel to them in such power and demonstration of the supernatural. They said the same of Stephen in Bible days (Read Acts 6:15).</p>
<p>The preceding verse 5 says Stephen was a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost; he was neither an apostle nor a prophet. He was made a Deacon in the early Church, being full of faith and power and the wisdom of God.</p>
<p>This is your time to shine ever so brightly with the light of the Gospel, bringing men and women into the Kingdom. Everywhere you are, let men see your good works and glorify your Father, who is in heaven. As the Bible says, <em>“...the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising”</em> (Isaiah 60:3). In other words, as you manifest Christ everywhere, bearing the truth of His glorious Gospel, they’ll turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning… (1 John 2:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world”</em> (Galatians 4:3). This is referring to those who are “nepios” (Greek), spiritual babies; they’re the ones down with the flu today, and then headaches and heart trouble tomorrow.</p>
<p>But you can come out of that level through knowledge. There’s a training that’s required; that training brings you into “epignosis” (Greek); the exact or precise knowledge of God, full knowledge with intimacy. It’s called the knowledge of the fathers.</p>
<p>In His prayer for the Church, the Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, shows us how to get this knowledge of God. He says, <em>“That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him”</em> (Ephesians 1:17). As you meditate on the Word, secrets about the Kingdom-life and how to walk in the reality of the Word are unveiled to you. From then on, you know how to live in glory, with dominion over circumstances.</p>
<p>I would to God more of God’s people would come to the realization of who they are and what they have in Christ Jesus! How could you have the very life of God in you and be down with kidney problems, heart trouble, or any other kind of sickness or disease? It’s an anomaly; it’s not supposed to be.</p>
<p>The life in you can’t be sullied by infirmities; it’s superior to Satan and the elements of this world. Therefore, rather than be agitated when you feel the symptoms of sickness, boldly declare, “I have the life of God in me, and that life permeates my whole being and gets rid of all ailments and maladies.”</p>
<p>Make such declarations again and again, and soon enough, you’ll literally experience a surge of God’s power coursing through your whole being. This is how “the fathers” respond to circumstances and situations; it’s with the Word! They’re not slaves to the elements of this world; they live above them. Blessed be God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints… which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:26-27).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s review three portions of scripture that refer to Jesus accomplishing His work. The first is in John 17:4, where He said to the Father, <em>“…I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.”</em> The second occasion was on the Cross, when He said, <em>“...It is finished...”</em> (John 19:30). The third one is in Hebrews 10:12-13 and states, <em>“But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.”</em> The Lord Jesus, today, is seated and waiting until His enemies are made His footstool.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t be sitting if He hadn’t accomplished His purpose. But the problem has been that most people never knew what He came to do. When you read Ephesians 3:3-5, you’d discover that His real purpose for coming was a mystery. There are many written prophesies about the Messiah and when He’d be born into this world; and He fulfilled all of the amazing things written of Him. But His purpose remained a mystery to the Prophets.</p>
<p>What was this mystery? It’s what we read in our opening verse: Christ IN you, the hope of glory! This is the mystery which was hidden from ages and from generations, but has now been made manifest to His saints. Glory to God!</p>
<p>So, there’s an assurance, a guarantee that your life is glorious, because Christ is in you! That’s your hope for a healthy, prosperous, vibrant and successful life! You have a right to walk out of any predicament; you can walk out of poverty, lack and want, because of what Christ has accomplished in your behalf. What you need is to become ever more conscious of His presence and glory in your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? (Hebrews 2:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word translated “gifts” above shouldn’t have been translated gifts, but “distributions,” because it’s the Greek “merismos.” The Douay-Rheims translation actually renders it correctly. It says*, “God also bearing them witness by signs, and wonders, and divers miracles**, and distributions of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.”***</p>
<p>What does the Scripture mean by “distribution of the Holy Ghost?” What Jesus did in John 20:22 gives us an idea. The Bible says He blew on His disciples and said, <em>“...Receive ye the Holy Ghost”</em> (John 20:22). He “distributed” or ministered the Holy Ghost to them. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>We’re ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit (2 Corinthians 3:6). We’re distributors and administrators of the Holy Ghost. Recall what we read in our theme verse! Who were those that performed the signs and wonders, and special miracles? It was the Apostles! God did signs, wonders, miracles, and “distributions of the Holy Ghost” through them.</p>
<p>The Bible says we’re stewards or ministers of the New Testament, of the mysteries of Christ (1 Corinthians 4:1). Hallelujah! We “serve” the Spirit, the blessings of the New Testament, like that waiter who serves in a restaurant. So, like Paul, you can say, “I’m a minister of the Spirit.”</p>
<p>You can lay hands on someone and say, “Receive the Holy Spirit” and the person will be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit from you can go into five, ten, hundred people and more. Glory to God! This is what He’s called us to do as His ministers and ambassadors; we’re bearers of the divine order. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing (1 Peter 3:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn’t it great to know that the life of blessings is your heritage in Christ Jesus? God already blessed you beyond measure; He’s blessed you with ALL spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3). According to the Scriptures, He blessed you ever before you knew Him. How gracious the Lord is!</p>
<p>However, it’s one thing to be called to inherit a blessing, and a completely different thing to actually walk in it. To walk in God’s blessings, you have to recognize that you’re blessed. You have to see yourself the way God sees you and call yourself what He calls you.</p>
<p>Whenever God looks at you, all He sees is a success, a victor, an excellent person. In 1 Peter 2:9 AMPC, He says <em>“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”</em> God’s Word is His Word of wisdom about your life; speak it continually.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 2:12-13 says, <em>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak....”</em> Your affirmation of blessings establishes them in your life. You have to declare that you’re the righteousness of God, even if you’re feeling condemned. You have to declare that you have and live in divine health, even if you’re feeling a pain in your body.</p>
<p>Always declare your state and estate in Christ. You’re an heir of God, and a joint-heir with Christ (Romans 8:17). 1 Corinthians 3:21 says*, “…all things are yours.”* You’ve been called to a life of glory, honour, dominion and power; know it, affirm it, and walk accordingly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working] (James 5:16 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any kind of positive change you might desire is possible in the Name of Jesus, through the power of the Holy Spirit. Looking through the Scriptures, you’d find examples of people who were desperate for a change and what they did. You too can learn what they learnt, act as they did and get what they got.</p>
<p>Take Hannah for an example. For many years, she remained childless until she decided she must have a miracle. She went into the house of the Lord, fell on her face before God and prayed, made a vow and prevailed.</p>
<p>How compelled are you to change your financial status? How compelled are you to change your health situation? How compelling is your desire to move to the next level and experience the supernatural in your daily walk, in your ministry, academics, business or career?</p>
<p>Success and progress in any area requires very simple and basic principles. One of such is a strong compelling desire. Let your desire be strong enough to compel you to take the right and necessary actions.</p>
<p>In Mark 5:25-29, we see another striking example of an actualised desire for change. It’s the account of the woman with the issue of blood who, having suffered for twelve long years, made up her mind to receive a miracle.</p>
<p>Compelled by her desire, she pressed through an impossible crowd to get to Jesus, defying the injunction that forbade her from having physical contact with other people. The haemorrhage she suffered made her ceremonially unclean; therefore, she stood the risk of being stoned to death if found in public, following the Jewish law of the day (Leviticus 15:25-27).</p>
<p>However, her desire for freedom, for her healing, compelled her to act her faith and she got a miracle. In Mark 9:23, Jesus said, <em>“…all things are possible to him that believeth.”</em> So, it makes no difference where you are in your life today, anything is possible. Act on God’s Word. Act your faith and be absolute about the result that you want, and it shall be so.</p>

<p><em><strong>But you shall receive power (ability, efficiency, and might) when the Holy Spirit has come upon you… (Acts 1:8 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your life, career, ministry, business, job or academics, are there limits you want to break? Are there new records you want to set? Do you want to chart new vistas? What is it you want to achieve? The Holy Spirit in you is your advantage! There’s something about His power and grace that causes you to do the extraordinary and unimaginable!</p>
<p>If you were tasked with any project or assignment, maybe in your school, place of work or an evangelical assignment in your local church, execute it by the power, wisdom and guidance of the Spirit. Become conscious that you’re up to that task because of the greater One who lives in you; working in, and through you.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure”</em> (Philippians 2:13). Zechariah 4:6 says, <em>“…Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.”</em> That same Spirit is in you today, and has brought the glory of God into your life, giving you guidance and direction, with the wisdom and ability to walk through “walls” and blaze new trails. He’s filled you with supernatural ability to do things that can’t be humanly explained.</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 3:5 AMPC says*, “Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us, but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God.”* Blessed be God! Every day, tell yourself, “I can do all things by the Holy Spirit who lives in me!”</p>
<p>Take advantage of the person, power, grace and ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life! He’s your advantage. He causes you to see, think, say and do things ordinary men can’t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Word of God is clear on how to have a fruitful, productive and efficient life of success: it’s by the renewing of your mind with the Word. Why is your mind so important? It’s because God has fashioned the mind as the instrument for your transformation.</p>
<p>Your mind is unlimited in its potential to create whatever you desire. When you put your mind-power to work, the possibilities are endless. There’re no limits to what you can achieve, and absolutely no restrictions to how high you can propel yourself in life.</p>
<p>Your prosperity is essentially determined by the content and quality of your mind, because with your mind, you can change anything about yourself: you can establish a perfect structure and administration for your life, and enjoy to the utmost the special life and blessings God has given you.</p>
<p>Open your mind to God’s Word through study and meditation. 2 Timothy 2:15 says, <em>“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”</em> Through conscious meditation on the Word, your mind is organized and programmed for excellence, greatness and success. Its contents and processes are synchronized with God’s thoughts and perfect will for your life. This is what brings about the transformation.</p>
<p>Who you are today is a function or expression of your mind-work. Through God’s Word, you can work on your mind and change its contents, and that change will show up in your life as an upgrade, reflecting in your character and the results you produce.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Forever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven (Psalm 119:89).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never accept anything contrary to what the Word says about you. Never question the integrity of the Word. Believe, accept and affirm that you’re who God says you are, you have what He says you have, and can do what He says you can do.</p>
<p>Let the Word of God give you a new mentality, a new way of thinking. Don’t say you’re sick just because you felt the symptoms of sickness in your body. To talk that way is to take sides against the Word. The Word says if the Spirit of Him that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you (and thank God He does), that same Spirit shall vitalize your mortal body (Romans 8:11). Your confession, therefore, should always be, “I’m vitalized by the Holy Spirit; divine health is my nature and one of the many blessings I have and enjoy in Christ Jesus.”</p>
<p>If you’re experiencing weakness, doubt, discouragement or lack, don’t accept these anomalies as what your life should be; your life is for the glory of God. 1 Peter 2:9 (AMPC) says, <em>“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God’s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”</em> The Word of God is practicable; when you read a scripture like this, you must respond. You say, “Blessed be God! My life is full of the glory, beauty, wisdom and excellence of the Spirit, and I manifest these to my world!”</p>
<p>The Word says, “All things are possible to a believing one”; respond by saying, “Yes, Lord, because of your ability that’s at work in me, my potentials are limitless; I have an ever-increasing capacity to do more.”</p>
<p>The Word of God will work for you only when you give it the right response. Yes, God’s Word is all-powerful and settled in heaven, but you have to settle it in your life by your affirmations: “He has said…that we may boldly say…” (Hebrews 13:5-6). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils… (Mark 16:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One important truth every Christian must understand is that Satan and all his demons have been thoroughly, and completely dethroned and defeated by Jesus. So, no Christian should be afraid of Satan; he’s not a factor. Think about the fact that the very first thing Jesus said we could do in His Name is casting out devils; it shows just how much Satan has been paralysed.</p>
<p>Even if you only gave your life to Christ moments ago, you have authority over Satan and can cast out demons. That’s because being born again, you have the life of God and the righteousness of Christ; you have the authority of Jesus. Therefore, keeping Satan in check isn’t a question of how long you’ve been a Christian or how “spiritual” you think you are; it’s about Jesus and the authority He’s given you to walk and live in His Name.</p>
<p>Satan has no right to run things in your life, in your home, city, nation, or in the lives of your loved ones; cast him out! Exercise your authority in Christ over him. Cast him out any day, anytime and anywhere by using the Name of Jesus. When you address Satan in the Name of Jesus, he responds as though he’s hearing directly from Jesus.</p>
<p>You might ask, “What if the demon doesn’t go when I try to cast him out?” That’s not an option if you’re doing it in the Name of Jesus; when you have the consciousness of what that Name represents. Understand this: we walk in His Name, and walking in His Name is recognizing the power and authority of His Name; living with the consciousness of what His Name represents.</p>
<p>Philippians 2:9-10 says, <em>“Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.”</em> You couldn’t know this and be negotiating with demons; you cast them out! No devil can stand the Name of Jesus; they know what that Name represents because they are aware that in hell, Jesus spoiled principalities and powers and made a public spectacle of them (Colossians 2:15). Hallelujah!</p>
