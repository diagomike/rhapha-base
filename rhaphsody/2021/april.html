<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God (Romans 12:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the coming of the Messiah, it was prophesied that Elijah would come first (Malachi 4:5-6). The Scribes used this prophecy as evidence against the messiahship of Jesus. But the disciples, having seen Elijah with their own eyes talking with Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration (Read Matthew 17:1-3), asked Jesus, <em>“...Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?”</em> (Matthew 17:10). </p>
<p>To their surprise, Jesus confirmed the Scribes insistence that Elijah must come first before the Messiah. He said, <em>“...Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things. But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them”</em> (Matthew 17:11-12). The Bible says, <em>“Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist”</em> (Matthew 17:13). Elijah already came, but they didn’t know it, because they were looking in the flesh! </p>
<p>There’re many Christians who are like that today. All they’re dreaming, praying, struggling to be and have in God, they already are, and already have, but they don’t know it. This is why you must know the Word. Through the knowledge of the Word, you’re enlightened as to your identity and heritage in Christ.</p>
<p>Nothing could be greater or better than Christ in you, and you in Christ. You’ve got to come to the full realization that as He is, so are you (1 John 4:17). You’re His righteousness, the expression of all the perfect things that are consistent with His nature—His goodness, His kindness, His love, His humility, and excellence!</p>
<p>This is why our theme verse admonishes that you renew your mind, because it’s only through the Scriptures, by the Spirit, that you discover what God has already made you and granted you in Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But we will continue to devote ourselves steadfastly to prayer and the ministry of the Word (Acts 6:4 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relating with God, the first thing you need to understand is what He has to say to you (the Word). Secondly, what He gives you the privilege to say to Him (prayer). Third is your worship, which is also in the form of sacrifices and offerings (Hebrews 13:15). These three are central in our relationship with the Lord.</p>
<p>Man is a spirit, and the spirit of man came from God’s Spirit, and was created by the Word of God: <em>“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”</em> (1 Peter 1:23). Being born of the Word, you must, therefore, continually feed on God’s Word to truly live. 1 Peter 2:2 says, <em>“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby</em>.” The Lord Jesus said in Luke 4:4, <em>“…It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.”</em></p>
<p>The Father always speaks; He’s always in communication with your spirit, sharing His thoughts with you. So, it’s not just the words that you say during the times of prayer that matter, but the opportunity it provides for the Spirit of God to minister to you as you minister to Him.</p>
<p>We also give quality time to worship, that is, to sing unto the Lord in praise, and adoration. When we worship the Lord, it’s a mingling of spirits; a moment of divine ecstasy, where you’re enraptured in the bliss and glory of His presence.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, in John 4:23, outlines true worship as that which is done in spirit and in truth; meaning that you’re to worship the Father from your spirit and according to His Word. Thus, it involves making confessions to His Name on the basis of who He is, in line with the revelation of His personality in the Word. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? (1 Corinthians 3:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re born again, even though outwardly you may look like your next-door neighbour who isn’t born again, a real transformation took place in your spirit. You were actually, literally, born divine—born anew with the life and nature of God. Not only are you godly, you’re God-like.</p>
<p>But because many don’t know this, they say, “We’re all humans.” No, we’re not; that’s what you were before you were reborn. The human “you” died, and a new you came from God. That  ’s what John meant when He said, <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”</em> (1 John 4:4); it means you hail from God; your life is divine.</p>
<p>What God expects is that you become conditioned to your divine nature. It’s the purpose for the renewing of your mind: Romans 12:2 says, <em>“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind….”</em></p>
<p>You may say, “But in the Book of Acts, Peter told Cornelius that he himself was a man.” You may also refer to the occasion where the people at the cities of Lycaonia almost worshipped Paul because of the signs and wonders he had performed, and he told them, <em>“... We also are men of like passions with you...”</em> (Acts 14:15).</p>
<p>But here’s what you must understand: the apostles, at this time, hadn’t fully understood the mystery of the Gospel. Otherwise, they’d have communicated differently. Think about it: Jesus never talked like that. He said, <em>“…I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world”</em> (John 8:23).</p>
<p>When it dawned on Paul through revelation of the Spirit that he was the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus, he expressed it differently. He said the Christian is “a new creature”—a new type of man (2 Corinthians 5:17). The same Peter also graduated to a higher class and in His epistle, he called the Christian “partaker of the divine nature”; associate of the God-kind.</p>
<p>Psalm 82:6 says, <em>“I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.”</em> If you talk and live as a man, you’ll suffer the things men suffer. Become conscious of your divine nature and practise the divine life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us (Romans 5:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we say, “God loves you,” many think it’s just a generic communication about God’s love for everyone. Yes, He does love everyone, but He thinks of, and relates to you like you’re the only one on the face of the earth. Each one of us is uniquely valuable to God; as valuable to Him as Jesus is. This is so huge a truth that it takes understanding the Word of God and the thinking of the Spirit to accept it.</p>
<p>God proved His love for you with the price He paid: the life of Jesus. The Bible says, <em>“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us”</em> (Romans 5:8). If you were the only one on earth that needed salvation, Jesus would have still come to die for you. He didn’t come because we were many.</p>
<p>Luke 15:7 says, <em>“I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.”</em> If that’s the truth as it is, I want you to think what it means to the Father for anyone to go to hell. 2 Peter 3:9 tells us, <em>“The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.”</em></p>
<p>He wants everyone to know, embrace, and walk in the truth of His love. He’s entrusted us with the message of His love, to share it with the whole world. Remember, He saves you and makes you His partner in saving others—a soul winner. Therefore, make this Easter count for someone in your world who hasn’t yet known the Lord. The responsibility is on you to reach those in your sphere of influence with the news of Christ’s love and saving power.</p>
<p>Think about what the apostles of Christ did for us regarding this glorious Gospel; they gave everything and even their lives because they thought it was worth that much. They wanted to make sure that the Gospel went to others, until it got to us.</p>
<p>Let it be your ultimate passion, joy, love and pride to give of your finances, time and energy for the spread of the Gospel around the world. It’s such a great honour and privilege to be a part of something so sublime and so divine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were (Romans 4:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faith is a principle by which we live in the Kingdom of God. The Bible says*, “…the just shall live by faith”* (Romans 1:17). And the faith we’ve been given is the God-kind of faith. You can apply it as God did throughout the Scriptures and be guaranteed the same results. The Bible says by faith, He framed the cosmos, the worlds (Hebrews 11:3).</p>
<p>No wonder Jesus averred in Mark 11:22, <em>“...Have faith in God.”</em> Several translations read “Have the faith of God” or “the God-kind of faith”—the supernatural faith that God operates. We read about it in our opening verse: He calls things that are not as though they were; seeing the unseen. By the spoken word, you bring into physical manifestation things which are not perceptible to the senses.</p>
<p>What about things that are already there that you don’t want? The Bible says, <em>“And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are”</em> (1 Corinthians 1:28). He says we use “things which are not, to bring to nought things that are.” What a principle!</p>
<p>The word “nought” is from “katargeo”(Greek), meaning to make void, bring to nought or nothing, to make or become of no (none, without) effect; to decimate. This you can achieve with your words—your faith proclamations. With words, you can destroy or decimate things which are. Remember, you can call things that are not, as though they were. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>There’s no disadvantage to the child of God. Whatever the situation you’re facing today, there’s a way out. The victory is in your mouth. Don’t look at the circumstances, for they’re subject to change. Look at the unseen—your victory—the picture the Word of God projects. Look at what the Word is telling you, and stick to the Word.</p>
<p>The more dire the situation or circumstance is, the more you affirm the Word and proclaim that you’re victorious in the Name of Jesus! The Name of Jesus can’t be overthrown. Use it, and you’ll always win. Blessed be God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in. And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour (Joshua 6:1-2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joshua was one of such characters in the Bible who was guided to victory by divine revelation. As he prepared to lead Israel in one of her defining battles, the angel of the Lord appeared to him and gave him the strategy by which he should defeat the enemy. Even though the city, Jericho, was greatly fortified against aggression, God’s Word to him at that moment assured him of victory. The Holy Spirit gave Joshua the winning strategy. He said, <em>“And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, …and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him”</em> (Joshua 6:3-5).</p>
<p>Those walls weren’t ordinary walls; they were fortifications of massive proportions. However, when the Israelites shouted according to the Lord’s instruction, the walls came crumbling down (Read Joshua 6).</p>
<p>Aside that day, never in the history of mankind has it ever happened that people shouted and great walls fell down flat. I believe that when they shouted, every one of them released a sound code that caused the walls to come down: the energy of words! If releasing the right words or sound could bring down physical barriers, it’ll also remove financial barriers or any other kind of barrier.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re in a financial strait; no money is coming in and none is going out; things are extremely hard. It’s time for you to get a hold of God’s Word for that situation and release it. Keep speaking until there’s a change. The same Holy Spirit that gave Joshua the strategy to take Jericho has given you His Word. He said in 1 Corinthians 3:21, <em>“...all things are yours.”</em> In Romans 8:17, He said you’re an heir of God, and a joint-heir with Christ.</p>
<p>Keep His Word in your heart and in your mouth in meditation. Keep pondering, muttering and shouting the Word until the situation you’re dealing with crumbles before you. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you (John 15:7 ESV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Wuest translation helps us see that Jesus’ remark in John 15:7 is more of an instruction than a promissory note. He’s commanding you to ask whatever your heart desires. It says, “<em>If you maintain a living communion with me and my words are at home in you, <strong>I command you to ask, at once, something for yourself, whatever your heart desires, and it will become yours.</strong>”</em></p>
<p>Can you trust His Word? Yes, you can! Faith is about acting on the integrity of God’s Word. In these challenging times, you can rely on the Word of God. He said, “<em>If you abide in me, and my words are in you, ask what you want, and it shall be done for you.”</em> The Complete Jewish Bible puts it this way: “If you remain united with me, and my words with you, then ask whatever you want, and it will happen for you.”</p>
<p>All that’s required is for you to abide in Him and for His words to be resident in you. Are the words of Christ at home in you? Or do you set them aside? When His words are at home in you, it’s blessings all the way; victories only; success unlimited. </p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, <em>“Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly….”</em> When the Word is in you and abides, your faith is built strong; then you’re positioned to make a demand and create the kind of life you want, irrespective of circumstances.</p>

<p><em><strong>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Hebrews 11:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assume it was your birthday, and your favourite uncle, rich and generous, called you on the phone to tell you he just bought you a car. You’d believe him and immediately get excited, even though you hadn’t seen the car. That’s faith; it doesn’t require physical evidence.</p>
<p>The reason you believe and rejoice is that you trust your uncle’s character; otherwise, you’d express doubt upon receiving the news. Similarly, when you think, talk and act based on the integrity of God’s Word, you’re expressing faith, and you’re bound to have extraordinary results.</p>
<p>Someone once lamented how God gave him a specific word about his healing, prosperity and restoration, yet he claimed he didn’t see evidence that the Word came to pass in his life. His language actually manifested unbelief. What other evidence is there concerning your blessings and triumphant life besides the Word of God?</p>
<p>Become fully persuaded by the Word of God. Don’t wait for any physical manifestation before you take what God says is yours. Accept His Word and live accordingly. Your faith is the manifestation, for faith perceives as fact that which has been declared by the Word.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>...It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God (Luke 4:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verse above is the Master’s response to one of Satan’s temptations, and it gives a most remarkable insight on how to use the Word. What Jesus actually said is that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word (rhema in Greek) of God. He wasn’t referring to the Logos of God, which is the whole body of truth; the revealed Word of God that expresses His thoughts, character, plans, purposes and personality. But “rhema,” on the other hand, is the spoken and active Word from God to a specific person, for a specific purpose, at a specific time.</p>
<p>Even though something is written in the Scripture, you may not be able to live by it if you don’t know it or if you don’t personalise it, being addressed to you. What you have in Scripture is the Logos of God, the entire body of truth, but you live by every word of that Logos that’s addressed to you in the “now” of your life, or every word that the Spirit of God ministers to you for you.</p>
<p>This is the reason prophecy is important. When you receive a prophetic word, it blesses you because it’s what you need for the moment. For example, you may be in a precarious situation and suddenly, you receive a word from the Lord saying, “…lo, I am with you always…” (Matthew 28:20).</p>
<p>Now, those words were written in the Scriptures long ago, but it becomes “rhema” when the Spirit of God brings it to you in the now of your life in whatever situation you’re in. As brief as those words are, they’re loaded, and reaffirm God’s commitment to you. He’s with you, and for that reason, you have it made; you’re energized, strengthened and inspired to win! Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake. I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one… (1 John 2:12-13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Apostle John, in the opening text, addresses three classes of God’s people: first, the little children, then the young men, and finally, the fathers. “Fathers” in this context isn’t referring to a male parent, but to those who have attained spiritual maturity in Christ; those who have raised others and have been in the Lord long enough to have the experience of God through the Word. It refers to those who have come to spiritual manhood. In them, the Word of the Lord is fulfilled. Through the Holy Spirit, these ones are able to understand and interpret the mind of God on wide variety of issues and establish His righteousness. </p>
<p>Attaining to this level of spiritual maturity is simply by giving yourself to the Scriptures in study and meditation, knowing God’s Word and living by it every day. In 2 Timothy 2:15 AMPC, Paul admonished: <em>“Study and be eager and do your utmost to present yourself to God approved (tested by trial), a workman who has no cause to be ashamed, correctly analyzing and accurately dividing [rightly handling and skillfully teaching] the Word of Truth.”</em> Also, Jesus said in John 5:39, <em>“Search the scriptures....”</em></p>
<p>The Scriptures have the capacity to build you unto maturity: <em>“And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified”</em> (Acts 20:32). The Word is your life; therefore, yield yourself to the Word to build and nourish you. The Bible says, <em>“As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the Word that ye may grow thereby”</em> (1 Peter 2:2). The Word is the only ingredient that can transform and build our lives on all three levels: spirit, soul and body.</p>

<p><em><strong>All scripture is given by inspiration of God… (2 Timothy 3:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible, as we have it today, didn’t “drop” on us from heaven; it was chronicled and written by holy men of God as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. The reason some question the veracity of the Bible is that they’ve not been able to distinguish between the “author” of the Scriptures and inspired writers.</p>
<p>The sixty-six books that make up the Bible have several writers. From the Old Testament to the New Testament, writers vary; they all penned words as they were inspired by the Holy Spirit. For example, Paul wrote most of the Epistles, such as the Book of Romans, First and Second Thessalonians, Galatians, First and Second Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, etc. The Holy Spirit also moved prophets like Moses, Jeremiah, Isaiah, and apostles like Peter, John, James to write the Scriptures, but they can’t be said to have authored the Scriptures. In our theme verse, we’re shown the authorship of the Scriptures: <em>“All scripture is given by inspiration of God…”</em> (2 Timothy 3:16).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated “inspiration” is “theopneustos,” which means the outbreathing of God! “God” in this context is the Holy Spirit. He’s the author of the Scriptures. If you ever want to know and walk in God’s perfect will at all times, understand His judgements and His perspectives on all of life’s issues, study and meditate on the Scriptures.</p>
<p>The concluding part of 2 Timothy 3:16-17 further shows us the purpose of the Scriptures: It’s <em>“…profitable for instruction, for reproof and conviction of sin, for correction of error and discipline in obedience, [and] for training in righteousness (in holy living, in conformity to God’s will in thought, purpose, and action), So that the man of God may be complete and proficient, well fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work”</em> (AMPC). These and more are what the Scriptures can do in, and for you as you study and meditate on them! You’ll have all the advantage you need in life, and enjoy the full blessings of your heritage and life in Christ.</p>

<p><em><strong>For skillful and godly Wisdom shall enter into your heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant to you. Discretion shall watch over you, understanding shall keep you (Proverbs 2:10-11 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’d pay attention to what’s written in the Scriptures about the last days, and relate it to current happenings in the world, you’ll surely realize that the Lord is getting ready, preparing the Church for His coming. Your responsibility is to prepare your heart through the Word; live your life for Him daily. </p>
<p>Nothing can prepare you for the coming of the Lord like the Scriptures. 2 Timothy 3:15 tells us, “<em>And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, <strong>which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</strong>”</em> Notice our underlined portion; the wisdom of God is what carries you all the way through to the end of salvation in the presence of the Lord.</p>
<p>Jesus emphasized the importance of the Scriptures when He said, <em>“…man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God”</em> (Luke 4:4). </p>
<p>Search the Scriptures. Study and build your life on God’s truth. His Word cultures you to have Kingdom consciousness, with the goal and desire to please Him always and in all things. The Word cleanses and keeps you in the state of readiness to meet the Lord.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart (Proverbs 7:2-3)</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 Timothy 3:16-17 AMPC says, <em>“Every Scripture is God-breathed (given by His inspiration) and profitable… So that the man of God may be complete and proficient, well fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work.”</em> It’s impossible for anyone whose life is regulated and propelled by the Word to fail or be disadvantaged in life. The Word programmes you to be an absolute success.</p>
<p>If you sow a corn seed, for example, you aren’t going to have a harvest of mangos, apples or oranges. The reason is that the seed was programmed to reproduce its kind.</p>
<p>Also, you must have heard of computer programming: creating a sequence of instructions to enable the computer to do something. It’s similar to how God’s Word functions as well. It’s the mystery of writing, and God invented writing. Writing is about one thing— programming.</p>
<p>When God talks to you, when His Word comes to you, what He seeks is to write the “programme” and have it stored in your “heart,” which you can further process, because of who He’s made you. Psalm 82:6 says, <em>“…Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.”</em> He created creators. You’re an innovator.</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 6:17 says, <em>“But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.”</em> He’s brought you into union with Himself, and into His class of being. No wonder Jesus reiterated the words we read in Psalm 82:6 in John 10:34 (NKJV): <em>“…Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?”</em> There’s another beautiful one in James 1:18: <em>“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.”</em> How powerful this is!</p>
<p>You’re the “Godkind” of man; the first, best and most sublime of His creatures. Hallelujah! Being born again, you were brought into union with Him; you’re a comrade of the heavenly pantheon. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God (Romans 8:27).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you pray in tongues, keeping your mind focussed on the subject of your prayer is very important. It’s akin to the operation of the Spirit in the stretching forth of hands in the Old Testament. For example, God told Moses to stretch forth his hand over the sea and divide it (Exodus 14:16).</p>
<p>On several other occasions, He instructed them to stretch forth their hands to cause things to happen (Read Exodus 7:19, Exodus 8:5, Joshua 8:18). He was showing in the Old Testament that the power of God can be directed with your hands. The power goes in the direction of your hands.</p>
<p>But the higher level of that is the mind. Your mind does far more than the stretching forth of your hands. That’s why the pollution of the mind is one of Satan’s biggest strategies. If he can pollute your mind and make your mind ineffective, then your mind won’t be an effective tool to direct the power of God.</p>
<p>It’s one of the reasons God wants you to maintain the purity of your mind. The purer the mind, the more refined and effective it is in directing and communicating the power of the Spirit.</p>
<p>So, when you pray in tongues, set your mind over that “thing” you want the Spirit of God to channel His energy and power to. If your mind wanders, steer it back. If the wrong picture comes to your mind, cast it off. Discipline your mind. Every so often, you say, “In the Name of Jesus, my mind is set on course!”</p>
<p>Of course when you pray in tongues of the Spirit, your spirit is edified, even when your mind wanders without a focus. But there’s a difference when you need to direct the power of the Spirit towards a particular end: your mind’s vision is then required. So, in prayer, learn to set your mind on course, and your victories and testimonies will be endless. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear (Hebrews 11:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe you desire a change in your finances, business, health, academics, family or ministry; no matter the situation, you can create that change. Just like your heavenly Father, you can utter words and have your desires created. You can change the course of your life with words and make it conform to God’s plan for you. The Bible says you were created in God’s image and likeness (Genesis 1:26). Therefore, you have the ability to speak to things, or situations, and elicit a definite response from them. Genesis 1:3 says, <em>“And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.”</em> He simply commanded it to appear, and it did. 2 Corinthians 4:6 sheds more light on what happened in that instance. It says, <em>“For God, <strong>who commanded the light to shine out of darkness</strong>, hath shined in our hearts....”</em></p>
<p>Also, in Genesis 1:11-12, the Bible says God spoke to the earth to bring forth grass and plants, and it did. In Genesis 1:20-21, likewise, the Bible says, <em>“And God said, let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life....”</em> He spoke to the water, and it brought forth all manner of creatures. Our theme verse says, <em>“Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear”</em> (Hebrews 11:3). If the things which are visible to the optical eyes were made of things which are invisible, then these “invisible things”—the spoken words from our lips—must be subatomic particles.</p>
<p>Spoken words are coded messages that create sound waves. These sound codes are thus transmitted to the elements, darkness, earth, water—and God elicited a definite response from each of them. The fact that these elements produced the exact things God demanded is proof that there was an interpretation of the codes sent to each of them through words.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:1 AMPC says, <em>“THEREFORE BE imitators of God [copy Him and follow His example], as well-beloved children [imitate their father].”</em> God expects you to copy Him, to act like Him. Therefore, with your words, you can change hopeless situations. Even if you had a great life already, you can make it much more glorious by your faith-filled words.</p>

<p>The weapons of our warfare are mighty through the Holy Spirit to the pulling down of fortresses of darkness: mental, physical, intellectual, or financial fortresses. When fortresses are built against God’s work, God’s house, or the ministry of the Gospel, we deploy our weapons!</p>
<p>Not many Christians realize that we’re at war; the Bible tells us to “war a good warfare” (1 Timothy 1:18). Our theme verse isn’t talking about the weapons of Jesus’ warfare, but “our warfare.” Thanks be unto God we have weapons! One of them is what the Apostle Paul called <em>“...the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God”</em> (Ephesians 6:17).</p>
<p>That sword of the Spirit is the same thing Daniel referred to when he said <em>“A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him...”</em> (Daniel 7:10). Daniel saw it in a more glorious way. John called it “a sword from his mouth” (Revelation 19:15). And in 2 Thessalonians 2:8, Paul called it “…the spirit of his mouth....” He’s dealing with that fiery stream that Daniel talked about. When it’s needed to be a sword, it works as a sword; when it has to go as spirit, it fulfills the purpose. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Our God leads His children in war to victory (Exodus 15:3, Exodus 14:14, Psalm 24:8, Revelation 19:11). There are warrior angels whom the Lord deploys in our behalf. Thus, we’re victorious in all wars. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>In your life, fear nothing; fear no one. Use the sword of the Spirit. Use the Name of Jesus. The Word declares that we have overcome all antichrist spirits. The forces of darkness are under our feet. In Christ Jesus, we have overcome the world. In every situation, you can declare, “I’m more than a conqueror. Greater is He that’s in me, than he that’s in the world!” As we deploy our weapons through the Holy Ghost, we win at every count. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows (Galatians 6:7 NIV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kingdom of God is a real functional kingdom, with principles. For example, giving and receiving is an important kingdom principle. Genesis 8:22 AMPC tells us, <em>“While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.”</em> In John 12:24, the Lord said*, “Listen carefully: Unless a grain of wheat is buried in the ground, dead to the world, it is never any more than a grain of wheat. But if it is buried, it sprouts and reproduces itself many times over”* (MSG).</p>
<p>Except you sow your seed, you have no reason to expect a harvest. The kingdom principle of seed time and harvest positions you for the prosperous life that God has ordained for you; it’s a principle that works. It doesn’t matter how beautiful a seed is in your hand or what else you do with it; until you sow it, it’ll produce no harvest. That’s the kingdom truth! The seed doesn’t reckon who’s holding it—whether it’s a good man, or wicked fellow—once the seed gets into the right environment, it’ll produce the necessary results.</p>
<p>This kingdom principle applies to everything about life. The harvest a farmer gets is a direct result of the seeds he plants. Just as it is with the farmer, so it is with you. Your seed could come in different forms; it could be your time, talent, or any other gift God has blessed you with for a glorious life. How great and glorious your life will be is hinged on what you do with your seed.</p>
<p>For example, this material you’re reading right now, “Rhapsody of Realities,” is an indispensable tool for mass evangelism. You can be a part of its spread, penetration and distribution around the world in these end times. Commit to ensuring the Gospel reaches the unreached, and gets even to the remotest villages. Give your best into it.</p>
<p>Remember, the more you give, the more the Lord blesses you, and the greater you become. Operate this principle and see your life move from glory to glory. The Lord will multiply your seeds sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness. He’ll overwhelm you with grace for ever-increasing fruitfulness and superabundance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand; To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people (Psalm 149:6-7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bad decisions and choices of many world leaders have brought about the destruction and decimation of economies, and other untold hardships experienced around the world today. In the Scriptures, you’d observe these things were foretold a long time ago, and they are today being hatched by satanic powers.</p>
<p>The plans for a one-world government, one-world economy, and one-world religion were all foretold in the Bible. The Bible declares: <em>“So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter. Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice. He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm worked salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him”</em> (Isaiah 59:14-16 NIV).</p>
<p>The phrase, “no one to intervene” actually means “…there was no intercessor….” Can you see why you must take your place as a praying-priest, an intercessor? We’re the executors of the will of the Father; we’re the ones to establish His reign and righteousness in the earth and in the hearts of men. This is your role today as a Christian.</p>
<p>Don’t just sit idly by and watch these vicious destructions and chaos continue unabated. Take a stand and say “no!” to the havoc, mayhem, destruction, chaos and turmoil the devil is unleashing in the world!</p>
<p>Intercede fervidly for world leaders, Presidents and Prime Ministers of nations, that their hearts and minds be guided away from the devil’s manipulation. Pray that they desist from choices and decisions that jeopardize the future of their nations, whilst resisting ideas that plunge their people into poverty and death.</p>
<p>It could take days, weeks or months before you see the change that you require, but don’t stop; keep praying, because you’re causing a “shifting” in the realm of the Spirit; things are changing in the direction of God’s will and purpose for our world as we pray. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee… (Romans 9:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some years ago, after a certain programme which had several ministers in attendance, one of them said to me, “You talk about the Scripture as though it’s a person.” I said, “Oh, yes; it is!” It matters that you know this: the Scripture has personality and character. This is what Jesus revealed in the various things He said about the Scripture.</p>
<p>His apostles captured the same truth, and propagated it. For example, our theme verse says, “For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh….” He could have said, “For God saith unto Pharaoh…” and that’d be right, because we know that God did talk to Pharaoh; that’s what the Scripture tells us. The Bible says Moses went to Pharaoh and said, <em>“...Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go…”</em> (Exodus 5:1).</p>
<p>Again, we find Paul echoing the same truth in his writing to the Galatians in Galatians 3:8. He said, <em>“And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.”</em> It doesn’t say the Spirit preached to Abraham, or the Lord preached to Abraham. It says the Scripture preached to Abraham. The Scripture “talked” to him.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:22 says, <em>“But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe</em>.” Also, look at Galatians 4:30; it doesn’t say, “What saith God?” Rather, it says, <em>“</em>…what saith the scripture?” It’s so important that you put a premium on the Scriptures.</p>
<p>When you want to know anything, get into the Bible to find out what God says about it. Whatever God says about it is what should matter to you. Build your life on the Scripture, for they’re able to make you wise unto salvation (2 Timothy 3:15), and make you an absolute success; complete and proficient, well-fitted and thoroughly equipped for every good work (Read 2 Timothy 3:16 AMPC). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth (3 John 1:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Divine healing is one of the beginning stages of a greater life. Healing is wonderful, but there’s a greater life than healing. God doesn’t want you to live in the realm of getting healed from one sickness or the other every now and then. He wants you to come to a place of victory, where you understand divine health, which is greater than divine healing.</p>
<p>You may say to me, “Pastor Chris, I minister to people and they get healed, but when I have trouble in my body, I pray and do everything I know, but I don’t get healed.” It’s simple: God never told you to pray for yourself to be healed. Just because it worked for you when you were a baby Christian doesn’t mean you should go on like that (Acts 17:30). This is the sad situation of a lot of Christians; they’re even having a problem with getting healed, when they shouldn’t be sick in the first place.</p>
<p>Our theme verse says, <em>“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health….”</em> It doesn’t say, “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be healed.” He wants you in health. God’s plan for you is divine health! He doesn’t want you suffering from headaches, colds and fevers; there should be no diabetes, stomach trouble or any such thing with you. Grasp this truth and live by it.</p>
<p>If you’ve been falling in and out of sickness, say to yourself, “I’ll never be sick another day in my life, because the Word of God guarantees my divine health.” If you experience any symptom in your body, don’t panic. Use the Word! Keep yourself in health with God’s Word; it’s medicine.</p>
<p>Proverbs 4:22, referring to God’s Word, says, <em>“For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.”</em> Discipline your body to comply always with God’s Word. Transcend the level of needing healing, to living every day in divine health. You’re a new creature in Christ, with the divine life, the very life of God. How could you have that life and be subject to the elements? Walking in divine health is God’s best for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures (Luke 24:45).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s so important that you know the Scriptures for yourself. It’s the only material guaranteed to help you through the rough roads ahead, successfully. God told Joshua if he’d meditate on the Scriptures, he’d be a success and make his way prosperous.</p>
<p>Jesus was the very embodiment of knowledge and wisdom, yet He referred His hearers to the Scriptures. In fact, the first miracle He’d perform after His resurrection was about the Scriptures, as read in our theme verse. He so wanted them to know the Scriptures that He opened “their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.”</p>
<p>He emphasized the Scriptures. He taught them the words of the prophets throughout the Scriptures to let them know the prophecies concerning the Christ. Earlier, in His ministry, He stood up in the Synagogue to read from the Scroll of Isaiah as mentioned in Luke 4:21, and He said, <em>“...This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.”</em> He emphasized the fulfilment of the Scriptures and that the Scriptures were the revelation of Himself as He ministered to these disciples after His resurrection.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself”</em> (Luke 24:27). His whole life was about the Scriptures. This is something you must take seriously; focus your life on the Scriptures. John 5:39 says, “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.”</p>
<p>But to know the Scriptures isn’t in the head; to know it is by the Spirit; without the Spirit, you can’t know it. It’s not to quote it to impress anybody, but to live by it. It’s no use learning it to be able to explain it to everybody and impress others whereas it has no power in your life. If you don’t live it, the head-knowledge of it will do you no good. So, make up your mind that through the Spirit, you’ll specialize in the Scriptures. Give attention to the Word. Know it by the Spirit. It’s what you must live by.</p>

<p><em><strong>For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith (Mark 11:23).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re born again, you’ve got the power to turn negative situations around through your words. Ezekiel prophesied to the wind and commanded life into dry bones and they came alive (Read Ezekiel 37). You too can talk to anything and have it respond to you: Prophesy to your finances, business, academics, family and ministry. You can create what you want with your words.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“...we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery…”</em> (1 Corinthians 2:7). That means esoteric language; the world doesn’t understand it; yet it’s ordained by God to produce results for us. Glory to God! What kind of words do you speak? Are they constructive or destructive words?</p>
<p>Remember, the breeding ground for wrong talk is wrong thinking; so, you must change your thinking first. And don’t justify your negative talk by saying, “I’m only saying what’s happening around me.” No! You’re supposed to declare what should happen around you! You’re a king. Kings say what should happen.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you don’t immediately see a change. Some things may not change outwardly right away, but rest assured that the moment you give the word, creation is set in motion. Recall the tree Jesus cursed? (Read Mark 11:12-24). Outwardly, everything looked the same, but the Bible says it withered immediately from its roots. As you release words of faith concerning your finances, job, business, ministry, academics and so on, you’ll see many instant changes.</p>
<p>However, there may be other miracles that may take a while to manifest. The time in-between your declaration and its manifestation isn’t the time to give up or complain; rather, it’s the time to intensify the pressure on the adversary; you keep speaking until the “clouds are full.” The Bible says if the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth (Ecclesiastes 11:3). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us”</em> (Romans 5:8). This is inarguably the best and greatest news on earth; that He loved us while we were yet sinners. And because of His love, He sent Jesus to save us from destruction, sin and judgement. Blessed be God!</p>
<p>Romans 5:6 says, <em>“For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.”</em> Oh, the strength of this communication from God! If He loved sinners then, He still loves them today. He didn’t die for Christians; He died for the ungodly—the hopeless, wicked sinners; people who hated God. If His work of salvation hadn’t been perfect or sufficient and He had to do it again, He’d have done it! That’s how strong His love is.</p>
<p>This is to let you understand the heart of God in this hour. When He sees Satan using men to destroy other men, He’s grieved. Even the very human instruments of Satan, the very people that Satan uses to destroy other men, God loves them! And He’d want them to turn away from their ignorance and recognize His love.</p>
<p>God loves men so much that He impresses upon us to intercede for them in their wickedness, ungodliness, ignorance, and in their sinfulness. In 1 Timothy 2:1, He makes praying for all men a priority: <em>“I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men.”</em> This is so consistent with God’s love.</p>
<p>The first thing He thinks about in the earth is the value of every man. Before you pray for your needs, your work, etc., pray first for all men. He wants them to come to the knowledge of His love and His truth. 2 Peter 3:9 says He is unwilling that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. Such amazing love!</p>

<p><em><strong>Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came (Amos 6:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re those of us who have learned the truth; we’ve received the Word. And through the Word, we’re triumphant every day, living a wonderful and fulfilling life. However, we must still give attention to helping those who haven’t known the truth yet, those who haven’t understood the Word of God yet.</p>
<p>We’ve got to care about our brothers and sisters all over the world, especially those in prison or experiencing all kinds of hardships. Until and unless we’ve brought them in, it’s not over. It’s not over as long as Satan is deceiving others and seeking to destroy lives; we can’t be “at ease in Zion.”</p>
<p>Read the Lord’s touching words in Amos 6:6, <em>“You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions, but you do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph”</em> (NIV). When you hear about churches being burnt or priests and pastors and ministers being incarcerated unjustly because of their commitment to the Gospel, don’t act like it doesn’t concern you. Get on your knees and pray!</p>
<p>Don’t think only of yourself. Until the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ is celebrated in every country, it’s not over. Be it those in the presidency, or in the Prime Minister’s office, or among Monarchs, etc., we have to realize that God has given us an assignment to pray for them and reach them with the Gospel.</p>
<p>We have to bring others into the peace, love, and joy that God has given us; otherwise, our job isn’t done. So, keep preaching and teaching others God’s Word. Keep interceding for men and women all around the world to come into God’s light and righteousness. And at the end, you can boldly affirm, “I fought a good fight.”   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>***After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:9-10). ***</p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:9-10).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Master taught His disciples to pray, following the pattern in the scripture above. He didn’t say to them, “Pray this prayer”; rather, He told them to pray “after this manner.” This was before the completion of His redemptive work. Now that He’s made salvation available to all—both the Jews and non-Jews—we need not pray to God anymore to give us our daily bread, because He’s already done it!</p>
<p>The essence of the scripture above is that it lets us know there’s a daily allocation of blessings for us from heaven. The Christian is born with, and into, a glorious inheritance in Christ. Sadly, a lot of God’s children have never laid claim to what rightfully belongs to them. And so, there’s an accumulation of blessings waiting to be claimed.</p>
<p>God’s provision for you today isn’t like the “manna” of the Old Testament that the Israelites ate in the wilderness. Though manna came from heaven, the people couldn’t keep any leftovers, because it would decay by the next day. In this dispensation, however, our leftover allocations remain intact, and we can always lay claim to them by our words; calling them forth, in the Name of Jesus.</p>
<p>All creation has the capacity to respond to spoken words. This is key to laying hold on your inheritance in Christ. Everything in creation, whether existing in tangible or intangible form, has memory. And so, they can all respond to spoken words. So, speak the right words always, and your life will be full of blessings. Through your words, you can claim all the accumulated blessings already granted you in Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses (1 Timothy 6:12).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible says God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that anyone who believes in Him should not perish but have <strong>everlasting life</strong> (John 3:16). That’s why Jesus came; to give eternal life to men so they could be in fellowship with God. The question to ask is, did He achieve His purpose? Emphatically, yes!</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son”</em> (1 John 5:11 NIV). He’s not about to give us eternal life; He’s done it! The next verse says, “<em>He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life”</em> (1 John 5:12 NIV). He’s referring to the life and nature of God; the divine essence.</p>
<p>That life is incorruptible; it’s neither subject to failure nor death! This is the life you have in Christ. Ephesians 2:1 says, <em>“And you hath he quickened</em>(made alive)<em>, who were dead in trespasses and sins.”</em> You’re not dead in sins anymore. Why? You have eternal life now! Not many Christians know they have eternal life. So, John says, <em>“I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life”</em> (1 John 5:13 NIV). John wrote this to them because they lived as though they didn’t have the divine life.</p>
<p>Now, you can better understand why Paul, writing to Timothy, said, <strong>“…lay hold on</strong> eternal life….” The underlined portion is “epilambanomai” (Greek), and it means to take a hold of something without letting go. That’s how you should relate with eternal life. Don’t let it be a mere theoretical knowledge to you. Seize it; make it work for you.</p>
<p>Every so often, declare, “I have eternal life, in the Name of Jesus; therefore, I live above the elements of this world; I’m in dominion. Blessed be God!” If there’s been an issue with your health, don’t cry; rather, declare, and keep declaring, “I’m perfected in Christ Jesus; I refuse to accommodate any sickness, disease or pain in my body, because I have the life of God in me! I’ve taken hold of eternal life!” Soon enough, your physical body will comply, because it’s been impacted by the divine life in you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation (Romans 10:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re three vital things you must do to effectively work the Word and enjoy God’s provisions for you always. First, your heart must line up with the Word. The Bible says, “<em>For with the <strong>heart man believeth unto righteousness…”</strong></em> (Romans 10:10). That means you’re made right with God when you come into agreement with His Word in your heart.</p>
<p>The second thing is, your mind must line up with your heart on the Word. This implies that the Word must have meaning in your understanding. Without that meaning, you can’t communicate what’s in your heart through language.</p>
<p>Then, third, you must speak the Word—“rhema” (Greek); a word directed to a specific person, at a specific time, for a specific purpose. It’s the active Word given for a particular situation. That was what Ezekiel uttered in the valley of dry bones; he said, “I prophesied as He (the Lord) commanded me” (Ezekiel 37:10).</p>
<p> If your speech or utterance isn’t in line or agreement with what God has said, you’ll get the wrong result. The opening text says, “<em>For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; <strong>and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation”</strong></em> (Romans 10:10). The word translated “confession is made” is the Greek word “homologeo,” which means to speak in consent, or in agreement with another.</p>
<p>The inspiration of the Spirit provides us with God’s Word (rhema). Our meditation on this word or declaration of it produces tremendous results, bringing the Word into manifestation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well, holding on to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck with regard to the faith (1 Timothy 1:18-19 NIV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our theme scripture is very enlightening: to war a good warfare requires faith and a good conscience. Also, it’s important to know who you’re up against in this warfare. Ephesians 6:12 says, <em>“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”</em></p>
<p>These rulers of darkness are the ones that run the course of this world, manipulate and control the thoughts and minds of those who are rebellious to Christ and the Gospel. There’s no good whatsoever in demons. Everything about them is evil, and they have no restraint to wickedness except when we, by the power of the Holy Spirit, and in the Name of Jesus, restrain them.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6 tells us with what to put up our onslaught and wage our defense against these evil forces of darkness. Verse 13 says, <em>“Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand….”</em></p>
<p>Then in the 16th verse, after identifying the defence paraphernalia, he says, <em>“Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked… and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God”</em> (Ephesians 6:16-17). Here’s why the message of faith is so important; because it says, “Above all, taking the shield of faith!” This doesn’t mean you’re to look for a shield called faith; rather it means as you operate your faith in God’s Word, it’s a shield with which you shall, without doubt, be able to quench, neutralize, defuse and put out all the fiery darts of the wicked.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what missile the enemy throws at you; your faith quells and neutralizes them. Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God (Romans 10:17). The more of God’s Word you hear, the more your faith increases. And the more you put the Word of God to work, the more your faith is strengthened. Keep hearing God’s Word and putting it to work; your faith will be strong and effective. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness (Luke 22:53).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re in a time when there’s so much abuse of political power in many parts of the world. There’re some hostile laws, policies and actions in some states designed to be inimical to Christians because of their faith. If you’d read the story of Jesus’ arrest, before His crucifixion, you’ll see that these kinds of injustices aren’t new. Jesus experienced the abuse of power in high places.</p>
<p>John 18 recounts how Judas led the soldiers and officers sent by the high priests and Pharisees to arrest Jesus. Knowing all that was about to befall Him, the Lord went out to them and said, “Whom do you seek?” and they answered, “Jesus of Nazareth!” Then, Jesus said, “I am He.”</p>
<p>Immediately Jesus spoke and identified Himself, the soldiers and temple police were knocked out by the power of God and fell to the ground. Luke 22:52-53 NKJV tells us, <em>“Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs? When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not try to seize Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”</em></p>
<p>Notice the statement, “this is your hour, and the power of darkness.” Jesus understood that the power of darkness was at work, and that these men that came to arrest Him were not motivated by themselves, but by Satan. Jesus faced six trials within a few hours and none of them could convict Him.</p>
<p>The high priest had to frame something against Him out of anger, saying of Jesus, <em>“…He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy”</em> (Matthew 26:65). A few hours later, He was crucified on the Cross. Thanks be unto God! He offered Himself of His own free will (John 10:17-18). The quick trials, unreasonable laws, the lies and unchecked manipulations today aren’t new. Hence we must get on our knees to pray fervidly in the spirit, declaring that our cities are dominated by the light of the Gospel, and impacted by the force of righteousness. We have authority, and Jesus is Lord over all. Stand up for Him and His Church everywhere!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you’re born again, you have a new life. That life affects your whole spirit, soul and body. Our theme verse says if the Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, that same Spirit shall vitalize (make alive) your mortal body. This already happened, because the Spirit lives in you now.</p>
<p>Many aren’t experiencing this reality of the Word of God in their lives because they’re not acting on the Word. Even if you were born again fifty years ago, if you don’t understand this truth, you’ll be subject to the elements of this world; dominated by headaches, fever, diabetes and all manner of sickness and disease.</p>
<p>Don’t go through what spiritual slaves go through; come to a place in your life where you say, “Enough is enough; I refuse to be sick.” Learn to exercise authority over your body. If you can’t exercise authority over your body, how are you going to exercise it over cities and nations? Your body is the first place to practise authority.</p>
<p>If you feel the symptoms of sickness in your body, say, “No! A thousand times no! I’ve got the Spirit of God in me! I’ve got the life of God in me! I’ve got the strength of God in me, from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet! I’m healthy and sound! My body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, and no sickness, disease or infirmity can thrive therein! Hallelujah!”</p>
<p>Use your mouth. Speak words of healing and health over your body. As you speak, don’t let Satan deceive you that nothing is happening. Everything you say will happen! You can mend your heart; you can mend your lungs; you can mend your kidneys! Talk to your skin, your bones, your blood, and keep them in health. Glory to God!</p>
