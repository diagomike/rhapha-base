<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth (Acts 1:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some years ago, a young man came to me and said he suddenly woke up one day to discover half of his body had become numb. He had lost feeling on that side of his body, including his face. This happened overnight. When he talked to me about it, I knew he had to swing into action immediately. </p>
<p>So, I asked him to go over to a certain side of the platform, kneel there, and for an hour nonstop; he should pray in tongues as fast, hard, and as loud as he could. I told him to do this repeatedly for a few days and monitored him while he was at it. I knew it was serious business, but he didn’t need anybody to lay hands on him.</p>
<p>After some days of praying in the Holy Ghost like that, all the symptoms disappeared and he was completely healed. Hallelujah! After you’re born again, everything in your body is already touched by the power of the Holy Spirit. There’s life in you. You can’t be a failure or be diseased. You can’t be said to be barren.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you go through in life, take advantage of the power in you for the change and miracle you require. That power is activated as you pray in tongues, and it’s dynamic in its working. We read in our theme verse, <em>“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you….”</em> That power is “dunamis” (Greek)—the dynamic ability to cause changes.</p>
<p>There’s no situation you can’t change by yourself! The inherent power to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you could ask, think or imagine isn’t in heaven; it’s in you. You may have been told that you were born with an incurable disease; it doesn’t make any difference now, because you can change it! Put the Word to work; activate the power in you for a miracle. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full (John 16:23-24).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phrase <em>“…he will give it you”</em> in the verse above is “didomi” in Greek, and it means God will grant you what you require; He’ll make it happen for you. What Jesus said there gives us an open invitation to ask anything in His Name and expect to receive answers.</p>
<p>Sadly, some people aren’t putting this to work, yet they whine and gripe over their predicaments. He said, <em>“…ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.”</em> He doesn’t want you struggling through life, angry and miserable. He wants you joyful ALWAYS, and He knows one of the ways to make that happen is having your requests granted, you being in surplus and abundance.</p>
<p>Perhaps today, your business is failing or has failed, or your investments have gone down the drain; perhaps you’re facing serious challenges in any area of your life; the Lord is saying, “Ask what you will, and I’ll make it happen for you!” Whatever it is that you want, don’t cry; don’t beg; don’t gripe. Just act on His Word; ask and receive.</p>
<p>The Lord loves you. He’s more passionate and determined for your success than you could ever be. So, whatever troubles you, present it to Him as He has said. In Philippians 4:6-7, He said, <em>“Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes (Daniel 9:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fasting is a spiritual exercise, and it’s one of the vital conditions necessary for effective praying. Fasting isn’t the same as a hunger strike. It’s not about avoiding meals. After all, there’re folks who sometimes wouldn’t eat over a long period of time, probably because they’re busy; that doesn’t mean they’re fasting. Fasting means turning your attention away from food, and turning it to God.</p>
<p>Some people turn away from the food only to busy themselves with activities that don’t enhance their human spirit or help them to focus on God. For your fasting to be effective, you must set your heart on the Lord, on His Word, throughout the duration of the fast, and give quality time to praying in the Spirit.</p>
<p>Fasting, however, isn’t a way of persuading God to do something in your behalf. Fasting doesn’t change God; it changes you; it positions you spiritually so you can receive from Him. For instance, the instruction from the Lord to the apostles that Barnabas and Saul (who later became Paul) should be consecrated to the work of the ministry came as the apostles fasted and prayed: <em>“As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them”</em> (Acts 13:2).</p>
<p>The apostles could hear the voice of the Holy Spirit clearly, and they understood Him, because they were praying and fasting. Fasting gets you attuned to God; it’s a way of turning your spirit and mind away from the carnal things of this world in order to focus them on the Lord. That means you put away the secular magazines, films, TV shows etc., and set your heart and your mind on the Word in study, meditation and prayer.</p>
<p>As you do this, the flesh is subdued as your spirit fellowships with God. Therefore, when you pray, you’re able to utter words inspired of the Holy Spirit. Fasting basically reconditions your human spirit and makes you receptive to God’s guidance. He may have tried to lead or guide you in a certain way, yet you failed to decipher His signals. But when you fast and pray, you’re repositioned, and your spiritual re-orientation allows the Holy Spirit to minister to you in line with His perfect will.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled (Matthew 5:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sequel to our previous study, something else that fasting does for you is that it helps you build a strong desire. Fasting helps nurse your spiritual hunger or desire for whatever you’re praying about. Gradually, your desire moves from the soul realm to the spirit realm; it becomes a yearning of the spirit.</p>
<p>Perhaps, you’re a cell leader, fellowship coordinator or church Pastor and you’re praying for growth in your church or group; there has to be a strong desire for the increase you’re expecting; otherwise, it may never happen. A strong desire attracts to you whatever the subject of that desire is. Fasting without a definite and clear desire will achieve nothing. Because of your focus in a time of fasting, you’re able to attract through the Spirit, the finer signals, messages and visions of the higher planes of the spiritual.</p>
<p>As your spirit is thus inspired, you’d be quick to receive His Word and follow the guidance He gives you. The Bible says: <em>“The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple”</em> (Psalm 119:130). His Word will light up in your spirit and illuminate your path. Suddenly, you just know what to do, the steps to take that’ll bring about the results you desire.</p>
<p>In the preceding verse of scripture, the word “understanding” is translated from a Hebrew word that means or connotes “the ability to apprehend.” When God’s Word enters your heart, it gives you the ability to understand diverse subjects and circumstances, such that you’d know exactly what steps to take. Learn to develop a strong desire through fasting, prayer, and an unrelenting commitment to studying and meditating on the Word of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole. And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague (Mark 5:28-29).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of our theme scripture is the inspiring story of the woman with the issue of blood who pressed her way through an impossible crowd to touch Jesus for a miracle. Jesus wasn’t rattled that the “unclean” woman touched Him without His consent.</p>
<p>Remember, under the Law of Moses, it was unlawful for such a woman to be seen in public, let alone make contact with other people, because she was haemorrhaging; making her unclean. But Jesus, ever so loving and gracious, addressed the woman with such endearment. He said, <em>“…Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace”</em> (Luke 8:48).</p>
<p>Think about the Master’s gracious disposition to this woman! His love is beyond human comprehension; it’s unfeigned and divine. Also, consider how He healed lepers in His day. Luke 5 records a beautiful story of how He touched and healed a certain leper. The Bible says, <em>“And it came to pass… a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him”</em> (Luke 5:12-13).</p>
<p>The Master didn’t get infected from making contact with the infected man; rather, He cured the infection! That’s the kind of person you should emulate. That’s the example to follow, not those who advise you to hide from “viruses” and infections that Jesus gave us the power to heal.</p>
<p>He said in Luke 10:19*, “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”* I’m inspired by Jesus, and you should be too. Be inspired by His love; be inspired by how he affectionately touched the untouchables of broken humanity in His day, as He still does today; howbeit, through us! Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us (Romans 5:5).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible shows us that “hope” is one of the principles that’ll exist in the world to come. Hope is the ability to expect and to project into the future. Jesus demonstrated hope in His beautiful and inspiring prayer in John 17, as He committed His disciples into the Father’s hands. He said*, “Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word”* (John 17:20).</p>
<p>It’s amazing how Jesus trusted the Father with His hopes for the future of His disciples and those who would believe in Him through their witness. He not only had faith, but hope as well. He looked to the Father, with hope. What an inspiration!</p>
<p>There’s another instance where He demonstrated such great hope. That was when He prayed with great anguish and agony of soul in the Garden of Gethsemane, such that sweat came out of His body like great drops of blood. But I want you to notice the content of His prayers. The Bible says He prayed, <em>“…O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt”</em> (Matthew 26:39).</p>
<p>Jesus was a man of faith, but in this context, He was hopeful. He endured the Cross because of the outcome of His hope. He demonstrated hope while He hung on the Cross; hope even in death! This is the Christ that Paul referred to when he announced, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new”</em> (2 Corinthians 5:17).</p>
<p>Now, you’re in Him and can therefore be hopeful in the Father as He was, even in the face of death. Can you be hopeful in prayer that those who openly oppose Christ can truly believe and turn their hearts to Him like Saul of Tarsus, and receive salvation for their souls by the power of the Holy Ghost?</p>
<p>Learn the value of hope. The Word declares that “hope doesn’t disappoint, because of God’s love in our hearts” (Romans 5:5). Be inspired by His hope! That hope, the Bible says, is an anchor for the soul: <em>“That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast…”</em> (Hebrews 6:18-19). Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side (Psalm 71:21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord said to Abraham in Genesis 22:17-18: <em>“…in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed....”</em> Indeed, the Lord blessed Abraham and made him great. You’ll observe the blessing through several generations after him. Isaac, Jacob, David, Solomon all walked in this reality.</p>
<p>David, who was a great king, took it to another crescendo; he knew that in greatness there’re levels. So, he prayed, <em>“Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side”</em> (Psalm 71:21). There’re three ways of becoming great: you’re either born great or you have greatness bestowed on you, or you achieve greatness.</p>
<p>But thanks be unto God! When you were born again, you were born great; you were born into this wonderful family of God, connected with God Almighty and the Kingdom of God. You were born the very heir of all the riches and wealth of God’s Kingdom. To walk in this reality, first, you have to live beyond your senses. All you see isn’t all there is. There’s more to life than what you see or feel. The Bible says, <em>“For we walk by faith, not by sight”</em> (2 Corinthians 5:7).</p>
<p>Secondly, you must say the same thing in consent with God as it pertains to your greatness. Just like the psalmist, make confessions according to the Word and speak of your greatness. Declare by faith that of your increase, there’ll be no end. Henceforth, declare that the Lord is increasing your greatness in a significant way. It doesn’t matter what job you do, make it great, because there’s greatness in you. You’re royalty. Hallelujah!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Each one of us is ordained of God to be very successful. But you can’t really be a success until you know God’s plan for your life. You could be a success for “you” or for those cheering you on; but being a success for God is what counts. A success for “you” means you’ve achieved your goals and your dreams. A success for the world means you’ve fulfilled the world’s dream and expectation of you. But these aren’t true success. True success means you’ve achieved God’s goals and dreams.</p>
<p>Success for life means your accomplishments on the basis of God’s calling, His vision, dream, and plans. And it always has to be done in God’s way, not man’s way. You measure success at different points in your life. In academics, for example, if you were in class one and you were successful in your exams, that’s success in that class, not class two or three. Someone else who is in class two or three will be measured accordingly. When you get to a higher class, you’ll again be rated by the corresponding standards and requirements of that class. So, success is relative.</p>
<p>Be determined that at different stages of your life, you’ll be very successful in line with God’s plans for your life. The most important thing to you should always be: What does God want? What does He think? That’s the only way you can know whether or not you’re successful. And remember, His will, plan and purpose will always be consistent with His Word—the Scriptures.</p>
<p>There’re many who don’t care to know what God thinks. Some don’t even think that God has an individual plan for their lives to care for them, but the truth is, He does. The Bible says, <em>“’For I know the plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future’”</em> (Jeremiah 29:11 NIV). He not only cares, He has a plan that’s not only communicable, but one that can and must be actuated.</p>

When you’re deeply rooted in the Word, nothing shakes you; you’ll always win, irrespective of the adversities you face. It’s not enough to merely get excited when you hear or study the Word; take some time to meditate.</p>
<p>When you get excited outwardly, let it be because of the victory you’ve seen and obtained in your spirit, and the impact the Word has made on your spirit. The Word impacting your spirit is where the glory is. Consider Moses: After spending forty days and forty nights with God on Mount Sinai receiving the Commandments, the skin of his face shone by reason of the glory of the Word he received from God. To Moses, the commandments weren’t just laws; they were life.</p>
<p>When you deeply contemplate and meditate on the Word, the Word will take a hold of your spirit and impact your physical body, so much so that the glory of God will literally beam from you. 2 Corinthians 3:18 says, <em>“But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”</em> As you receive the Word, the intensity of the glory in your life is increased!</p>
<p>Read our theme verse again; it says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom…”</em> (Colossians 3:16). This is the way to keep yourself afire, living in victory always, unshakeable and unmovable, established in Him. Colossians 2:7 AMPC says, <em>“Have the roots [of your being] firmly and deeply planted [in Him, fixed and founded in Him], being continually built up in Him, becoming increasingly more confirmed and established in the faith, just as you were taught, and abounding and overflowing in it with thanksgiving.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time (Isaiah 60:22).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What an inspiring scripture! Observe that the prophet Isaiah didn’t say, “A little one is a thousand”; rather, the Spirit so accurately puts it; He says, <em>“A little one shall become a thousand….”</em> It does spell growth, change, going from one level to another. That means, when a little one is said to be “little,” it’s talking about a thousand. Imagine how big that is—proof positive that the Lord is ever interested in our growth and prosperity.</p>
<p>How would you read this and still have doubts about your greatness and prosperity being God’s idea and desire? 3 John 1:2 says, <em>“Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.”</em> The Bible is replete with information on the power and the glory of God, the honour, the majesty, the splendour of our Heavenly Father and His will to share what He’s got with His children. This is the glorious life of prosperity we’ve been called to and that’s the basis of our prosperity.</p>
<p>We aren’t running after or seeking prosperity, because the truth is, we’re children of this true God whose wealth is limitless, inestimable and unquantifiable; we belong to Him. The difference between Christians who believe in and walk in prosperity and those who don’t is this: the former believe in their true connection with God, knowing that since it’s real, they don’t need to seek prosperity; it just works in them.</p>
<p>The latter group, however, don’t understand it; hence, they keep seeking it, trying hard to get it. And because it eludes them, they criticize it. There’s no human being who doesn’t want to prosper. That’s a fact! The reason many work and continually seek to improve themselves is so they could have better means to take care of themselves, their families and loved ones, and help other people. Every human person wants to be able to do something, not only for himself but for others, and that’s prosperity.</p>
<p>Study the truths of God’s Word and accept its simple message with faith in your heart. Read about men and women described to us in the Bible who were prosperous, influential, powerful, successful, and served God in righteousness till their days were over; they had a great life all the way. Accept growth and prosperity and walk in it. It’s a function of our connection with divinity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth (2 Thessalonians 2:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sanctification is part of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Even though you’re born again and your spirit is alive to God, your mind still needs to be purified of all the garbage recorded therein. It’s the reason for the renewal of the mind the Bible talks about in Romans 12:2.</p>
<p>The more you study and receive God’s Word, the more the wrong thoughts, ideas and relics of the old nature in your mind are removed and replaced with God’s holy thoughts, His holy words and the manifestation of His kingdom. That’s why the Bible says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly…”</em> (Colossians 3:16).</p>
<p>That desire to do the wrong things, to go in the way of the world, to make the wrong choice, only the Word of God can get rid of it. So, Romans 12:1 says, <em>“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.”</em> Notice that He’s addressing God’s people and not the people of the world. Don’t yield your mind to sin; don’t yield it as an instrument of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>You’re a sanctified person. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 says, <em>“Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. <strong>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God</strong>.”</em></p>
<p>Notice our underlined portion! You’ve been sanctified by the Spirit to serve the living God. He’s purged your conscience of dead works through the vicarious sacrifice of Jesus Christ in your behalf. No wonder He says, <em>“But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and <strong>sanctification</strong>, and redemption”</em> (1 Corinthians 1:30). Blessed be God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom (Luke 12:32).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a profound statement made by Jesus in the verse above! However, when He said it, He wasn’t addressing the new creation. God isn’t “going to give” the Kingdom to you that are born again; the Kingdom is yours. You were born into the Kingdom; you’re an heir of the Kingdom. The Kingdom belongs to you, because it belongs to Jesus and you’re a joint-heir with Him.</p>
<p>Recall what He said in John 16:15: <em>“All things that the Father hath are mine…”</em>; that includes the Kingdom. Jesus lived the life of the Kingdom while He was on earth, and that made Him a mystery to the people of His day. He lived on a different plane. His words and actions were different from what they understood.</p>
<p>The Kingdom is your beloved country, the city Abraham was looking for. The Bible says, <em>“By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God”</em> (Hebrews 11:9-10).</p>
<p>Now, if the Kingdom is yours, what could you possibly be in need of? Jesus said in Luke 17:21, <em>“… behold, the kingdom of God is within you.”</em> He said, “SEE that you carry the Kingdom; you’re not just in the Kingdom; the Kingdom is in you!” If the Kingdom is in you, then it means all the treasures, riches, splendour and glories of the Kingdom are also in you.</p>
<p>Can you see why you should never have a mentality of lack, want and need? No wonder He said, <em>“…all things are yours”</em> (1 Corinthians 3:21). What God wants is that you live from the Kingdom; live the Kingdom life and seek its glory and expansion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all (1 Timothy 4:15).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people admit to having “blue days”; they’re excited sometimes, and at some other times they’re depressed, unhappy and wish they could end it all. If only such folks could get a hold of the Word and draw their inspiration from the Scriptures; it’ll make all the difference. I’m always inspired and blessed by the Word; I don’t have any blue or down days; I’m on top always; ever inspired!</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness”</em> (2 Timothy 3:16). Think about that! The Scripture is given by the inspiration of God; that means it’s God breathed. Then it says it’s profitable; meaning it gives you the advantage.</p>
<p>It’s also for doctrine, meaning it teaches and conditions you. It’s for reproof and correction: the Word moulds your character and gives you a new mindset. Finally, it’s an instruction manual for the life of righteousness. No other material could be this good for life. No other material could give you the advantage and inspiration you need to win in life every day.</p>
<p>The seventeenth verse further tells us the result of imbibing the Scriptures, applying yourself diligently to the Scriptures. It says, <em>“That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”</em> The Blessing of the Holy Scriptures! They were given to position you to be very successful, thoroughly furnished unto all good works—excellence; nothing is left out.</p>
<p>I knew from a very young age that I was going to be excellent in my life. I found some things in the Scriptures that gave me the impression—the absolute understanding—that I was going to be very successful. It was like a programmed projectile; I knew where I was going. The Word was given to programme my life for success, for excellence, for prosperity in everything. Didn’t you read about Abraham, Moses and David? These men were successful in everything, through God’s Word.</p>
<p>Likewise, through the inspiration of the Word, you too can be successful, and there’s no question about it. Study the Word for yourself. Give time to meditating on the Scriptures; the result is a life of undeniable success, ever-increasing glory, and unending prosperity. (Read Joshua 1:8 AMPC).</p>

<p><em><strong>A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things (Matthew 12:35).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God has given every human being the ability to imagine. It’s a gift we all have from Him. And it’s so important that you recognise the power of this gift and how it can shape your life. Your imaginative power is your creative ability. It doesn’t matter what your circumstances may be today. Maybe you’ve found yourself in the gutters of life, where you feel defeated and hopeless; you can effect a change and create the world you desire.</p>
<p>Even if you already have a great life, you can frame a new one, a more glorious and excellent life. It begins with knowing how to use your imaginative power. Whatever you can imagine, you can accomplish. And eventually, the sum total of your imagination, whether positive or negative, determines the quality of your life and personality.</p>
<p>Even in prayer, God wants you to use your imaginative power, because He loves to always give you ideas. He wants to grant you such extraordinary visions that you naturally wouldn’t live on the ordinary human plane. But He needs you to be willing to use your own imagination, so you can receive whatever He has to reveal.</p>
<p>For example, if you were running a mini shop and you want to expand the scope of the business, you’ll need to deploy your imaginative power. As you pray, God can help you see a chain of businesses, even though your present business is being conducted from just a room, perhaps even in your basement.</p>
<p>You may wonder, “Lord, is this possible?” He’d reply, “Yes, it’s possible; that’s why I showed it to you; that’s why I made you see it.” Someone may ask, “What if I don’t see anything as I pray?” In any case, you already have the power to create; you can create what you want! Some have the misconception that they can’t create for themselves what they desire. They believe visions should only come from God. But God lives in you. So, from within, you can create what you want; you can visualize whatever you desire and lay hold on it. When you pray, your imaginative power is a necessary ancillary tool for laying hold on what you’re praying for. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak (2 Corinthians 4:13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many say they believe and don’t do anything, but when you truly believe, you act. That’s what faith does; it’s the response or action you take on the basis of your believing. When you say you “believe,” it’s not passive but active; “believing” is a word of action; it’s actually “doing” your faith. That’s why the Bible says, <em>“Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone”</em> (James 2:17).</p>
<p>Faith requires a corresponding action; you prove your faith by your actions. “Believe” is “pisteu ” in Greek, which means to demonstrate your faith; to act your faith. Whatever it is that you believe about Jesus Christ is revealed in your actions. The Word, as it’s given to us in the Scriptures, can be trusted. But for it to be effective in your life, you have to do what it says.</p>
<p>Jesus said in John 14:15, “If you love me, keep my Word.” The Word of God is for doing. James 1:22-25 puts it in a nutshell: <em>“But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.”</em></p>
<p>Acting the Word is where the power is; that’s what profits you: <em>“Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it”</em> (Matthew 7:24-27).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust (2 Peter 1:4).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being partakers of the divine nature means we’re associates of the God-kind; it’s not something we “became”; we were born that way. You were born with the life and nature of God when you were born again. This is the reason it’s easy for you to please God; you don’t have to struggle, because His life is in you.</p>
<p>Some are still struggling, trying to become “better Christians”; that’s because they haven’t understood Christianity and the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. You can’t improve on perfect. The life in you is the God-life; it completely supplanted the human life you received from your parents. Just as there was nothing more for you to do to become more human after you were born of your parents, there’s nothing more required after you’re born again for you to be a partaker of the divine nature.</p>
<p>Even when a child can’t walk or talk yet, you don’t say, “This child isn’t human.” Rather, you start teaching the child how to walk and talk. It’s the same with the life that we have in Christ. You have only one nature, which is the divine nature, and it can’t be improved upon. What you have to do is study the Word of God and learn to live the divine life; live the Christian life!</p>
<p>As you learn God’s Word, the ways of God and the life of faith, certainly, your spirit will be built. Your life will be improved; but you’ll not become more righteous, because your righteousness is the righteousness of Christ. Righteousness is the divine nature; it’s the nature of God imparted to your spirit at the New Birth. According to the Bible, you’re as righteous as Jesus is, because He gave you His righteousness. Think deeply on this and let it create in you a new way of thinking and living.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life (Luke 1:74-75).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some Christians say they want to manifest the glory of God in their lives, yet they don’t live right. But Christianity is a call to righteousness. Righteousness is a gift, but you have to work out your salvation with godly reverence (Philippians 2:12); you have to live the life of a righteous person. It’s called right living. The Christ-life in you must be lived accordingly, and the Word of God is your light.</p>
<p>Jesus said, <em>“If ye love me, keep my commandments”</em> (John 14:15). The proof of your love for Him is to do His Word; it’s to manifest His love, His character. His life and nature in you—His righteousness in you—not only makes right living possible, but easy.</p>
<p>You can please Him every day without having to struggle. All you have to do is live the Word; take your steps and actions on the basis of God’s Word and walk in love. Then you’ll see His glory manifested in your life in ways you never thought possible. The Christian life is a life of glory every day; it’s about living out His righteousness even in simple things such as your daily decisions, conversations, relationship with others, etc.</p>
<p>You’ve been called into liberty, to live righteously for the Lord. Romans 6:14 says, <em>“For sin shall not have dominion over you....”</em> You have the nature of love and righteousness, and you can live above sin. The Bible says, <em>“Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son”</em> (Colossians 1:13). The Lord Jesus has given you the victory over sin; therefore, walk in righteousness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him (Colossians 3:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus said in Mark 16:17, <em>“...In my name shall they cast out devils….”</em> I would to God all of God’s children understood what this means; the authority and dominion we wield in His Name! When you address devils and situations in the Name of Jesus, they have no option; they must comply.</p>
<p>Then think about what we read in our opening verse: <em>“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus…”</em> (Colossians 3:17). This means you’re to live your life in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That simply means one thing: absolute victory for you every day. If you’d do what the Word says, your life will be full of joy, glory, excellence and victories. You can’t fail or be defeated in His Name.</p>
<p>When you pray, you’re guaranteed to receive answers, because every request you make is as though Jesus were the one making that request, since you’re making it in His Name. The Father sees your requests as Jesus’ request; you’re praying in His place and since Jesus can’t be turned down, your request can’t be denied. Glory to God!</p>
<p>It’s a legal thing; He gave us the power of attorney to use His Name and live in His Name. It doesn’t matter what challenges you might be facing; if you’d use the Name of Jesus, victory is assured. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions (Joel 2:28).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re different kinds of visions; there’s the vision where the Spirit of God shows you what to do in a particular situation and guides you on how to do it—vision for guidance—and there’re examples of such in the Bible. Acts 10:1-6 narrates the remarkable account of the Roman centurion named Cornelius who was guided through such a vision.</p>
<p>The Bible describes Cornelius as a God-fearing man who gave much alms to the poor. For this reason, God sought to save him. So, one day, God showed him a vision where he saw an angel telling him to send for Peter who would tell him what to do for him to be saved.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t all. In Acts 11, Peter himself saw a corresponding vision. He said, <em>“I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision… And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me. And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house: And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter; Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved”</em> (Acts 11:5, 11-14).</p>
<p>These scriptures clearly illustrate for us how God guides His people through visions. And if you’d lift your eyes in the spirit as well, He’d guide you in your endeavours. He’d give you visions and show you the right steps to take. As you look to the coming year, give yourself to the Word of God and yield to the leading of the Holy Spirit in prayer; you’d see visions of the things He wants you to do and the steps you should take.</p>

<p><em><strong>…I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it (Matthew 16:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ has grown! We’ve grown in understanding, in knowledge and in the exercise of our authority and dominion in Christ. It doesn’t matter that there’s an adversary who’s all out to oppose the Church and hinder the work of the Gospel; his efforts are futile. The Church is marching on, and Jesus said the “Gates of Hell” shall not prevail against it.</p>
<p>Jesus gave us dominion over the dethroned princes of darkness, over principalities, powers and spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. He put us in charge, to run things in the earth. In some countries, states and cities, some leaders are boasting against the Church; they’ve sworn themselves to be enemies of the Church. Well, they’ll take their place in history just like those before them.</p>
<p>Referring to His Church, the Lord Jesus said, <em>“Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder”</em> (Luke 20:18). When Saul of Tarsus spearheaded the persecution of Christians in the early Church, Jesus appeared to him on the road to Damascus and made him realize that he (Saul) was on a futile endeavour. The Bible specifically described Saul as <em>“...breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord...”</em> (Acts 9:1).</p>
<p>Then, the Bible says, <em>“And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven: And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do...”</em> (Acts 9:3-6). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>In Joshua 10:40, the Bible shows what happened to those who came against God’s people during the time of Joshua. It says, <em>“So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.”</em> Not one of them escaped; Joshua defeated them all!</p>
<p>The 42nd verse says, <em>“And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time....”</em> How? <em>“…because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.”</em> Hallelujah! We’re on the winning side of prophecy. We win only, and always. So, have no fear; serve God joyfully.</p>

<p><em><strong>For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re in the closing days of the Church age and we have to finish the work of the Lord gloriously before He returns. He said in Matthew 24:14, <em>“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.”</em> This is our charge; this is our call; and we’re at it.</p>
<p>While at it, the world will know that the Name of the Lord Jesus is the Name that’s greater than every name, every title and every government. We’ll subdue this world before the Master comes back. Our theme verse says, <em>“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.”</em> Then, the “Last Trump” will follow as the signal for our catching away: <em>“Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air….”</em> Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Ensure not to miss it. Luke 21:34 says, <em>“And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.”</em> Be alert and ready. The Rapture is almost here. It’s the reason we’re preaching the Gospel, preparing the nations for that glorious day. Make no mistakes about it; it’s so close; far closer than many realise.</p>
<p>After the Rapture takes place, the Bible says there <em>“…shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be”</em> (Matthew 24:21). The world is going to be a terrible place to be in during the Tribulation, during the reign of the Antichrist. Jesus said <em>“…except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened”</em> (Matthew 24:22).</p>
<p>For seven years, particularly during the second three and a half years, the Antichrist will rain terror upon the earth. It’ll be a time of great misery beyond anything the world has ever seen or will ever see. But thanks be unto God! After seven years, we’ll come back with the Lord Jesus Christ from heaven, to establish a new government of righteousness and peace for a thousand years. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man (Luke 21:36).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus Christ is coming again. 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 gives us a graphic revelation of His amazing return. It says, <em>“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.”</em></p>
<p>I’m so inspired just to think that one day, the Lord will show up with a shout. It isn’t someone else that’s going to shout for Him, but the Lord Himself will! Some people think we’re hyping His return too much, but that’s because they don’t know who Jesus is. He’s the Monarch of the universe. The whole earth belongs to Him—governments and galaxies inclusive. He rules the world.</p>
<p>While on earth, He often went with a multitude of disciples. How about when He entered Jerusalem? The Bible says, <em>“…all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?”</em> (Matthew 21:10). People came out from everywhere and lined the streets. All these happened when He was the lamb to be sacrificed. What do you think will happen now that He’s coming as the King of kings and Lord of lords!</p>
<p>Be inspired by the new heaven and the new earth; Revelation 22:5 says, <em>“And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.”</em> How glorious! We haven’t followed cunningly devised fables (2 Peter 1:16); we’ve received truth; we’ve trusted in His truth and lived in His truth.</p>
<p>What we’re doing for the Lord, reaching out with the Gospel and winning souls around the world, aren’t for nothing; we’re preparing for His return. He told us He’ll be back; so, we’re telling everybody. These are the final moments of the last days; the time left is so short. Therefore, we’ll fulfill His vision and prepare the world for His return. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me (Galatians 2:20).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How inspired are you about the life of Christ in you? Not many realize how sublime this is. Christ in you is everything; that was God’s dream and the purpose of Christ’s redemptive work. He came to make us sons of God, to make it possible for us to be indwelt by God and have His life imparted to our spirits. So, today, He lives in you by His Word and His Spirit.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16 says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom….”</em> The Word you’ve received dwells in you; and what does He do in you? Acts 20:32 gives us an idea; it says, <em>“And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up….”</em> The Word of His grace in you is effective in itself and by itself to build you up! And if His Word builds you up, it means you can’t fail, be destroyed, or be defeated.</p>
<p>His life in you by the Word is extraordinary; it causes you to grow up in God, in all things and in all areas. Ephesians 4:14-15 says, <em>“That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ.”</em></p>
<p>Then, John 14:23 tells us*, “…If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.”* So, the Father and Jesus live in you by the Holy Ghost; He’s alive in you by the power of the Holy Ghost; so, you aren’t alone!</p>
<p>It makes no difference where you are in this world; be conscious and aware that the Father and Jesus are at work in you—to achieve in and through you the extraordinary, the unthinkable, and the unexpected. The Bible tells us in Ephesians 3:20-21, <em>“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.”</em></p>
<p>Colossians 1:27 tells us, <em>“To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</em> You’re not an ordinary person; every step you take is a “Christ-in-you” person walking. “Christ in you, the hope of glory” means there’s glory in you everywhere you go; your life is full of glory. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation) (2 Corinthians 6:1-2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’re living in the day of salvation; the day of God’s grace, not His wrath. The Bible says, <em>“For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ”</em> (Titus 2:11-13).</p>
<p>As we approach the end of this present world, we’re to live circumspectly, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present them perfect in Christ Jesus (Colossians 1:28). He wants all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4).</p>
<p>That’s why He sent us to preach the Good News of salvation; to preach the Gospel. This is the day of the Gospel, and “Gospel” means good news! We’re ambassadors of Good News: <em>“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled to God”</em> (2 Corinthians 5:19-20).</p>
<p>In Matthew 9:37-38, Jesus said to His disciples, <em>“...The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few; Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.”</em> We’re His labourers for the harvest, His witnesses, sent with the message of His saving power. We’re the bearers of the Gospel of His grace.</p>
<p>Take the message everywhere this Yuletide. Preach it boldly, and He’ll confirm your words with signs, wonders and miracles. Remember, Jesus said, <em>“…this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”</em> (Matthew 24:14).</p>
<p>This Gospel is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes. It’s the power of God to make sinners righteous, to bring men into fellowship with God. What an honour it is to be the bearer of the Good News of Christ’s salvation, helping people discover Jesus, and turning them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</p>

<p><em><strong>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God (John 6:69).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Jesus walked the streets of Galilee, Capernaum, Jerusalem, many didn’t quite give attention to who He really was. Today is Christmas—the celebration of the birth of Jesus. Yet, the most that some know about Him is that He was born of a virgin, while others see Him as one of the greatest miracle workers to ever grace Israel. But His life was more than miraculous.</p>
<p>When Jesus walked the earth, He was God in the flesh; all of divinity was tabernacled in Him. He was the living body of the Almighty God. He was God alive, walking and talking in a man’s body. Read what Colossians 1:19 AMPC says about Him: <em>“For it has pleased [the Father] that all the divine fullness (the sum total of the divine perfection, powers, and attributes) should dwell in Him permanently.”</em></p>
<p>This should help you understand John’s statement in John 1:14: <em>“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.”</em> Jesus was the glory of God manifested to us. Hebrews 1:3 AMPC says, <em>“He is the sole expression of the glory of God [the Light-being, the out-raying or radiance of the divine], and He is the perfect imprint and very image of [God’s] nature, upholding and maintaining and guiding and propelling the universe by His mighty word of power….”</em></p>
<p>Jesus is the love of God manifested to us. He showed us a good example by loving everyone unconditionally, including His accusers. He loved and offered His life for us as a sacrifice for our sins: <em>“Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour”</em> (Ephesians 5:1-2).</p>
<p>Romans 5:8 says, <em>“But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”</em> These aren’t the attributes or works of a religious leader. No one in history loves, or could ever love like Jesus. He was God’s light, of whom John the Baptist bore witness, so that all men through Him might believe. John 1:9 says of Jesus: <em>“That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”</em> Amazing reality!</p>
<p>No wonder He’s celebrated, honoured and adored in heaven and in the earth. He has the greatest honour even in hell. He’s the greatest of all. The only one who could save man to the uttermost, and make the divine life available and possible for all men to receive: Jesus of Nazareth—the only true God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil (Hebrews 2:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word “destroy” in the verse above is from the Greek “katargeo”, and it means “to bring to nought.” That means Satan has been brought to nothing; he was made powerless—he and his cohorts of hell. Colossians 2:15 (Conybeare) says, <em>“He DISARMED the Principalities and the Powers [which fought against Him….”</em> The principalities and powers have been disarmed by Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Phillips New Testament puts it thus*: “And then having drawn the sting of all the powers ranged against us, He exposed them, shattered, empty and defeated, in His final glorious triumphant act!”* He exposed them; He got them stripped and took away from them all of their armour—everything of value! Blessed be God!</p>
<p>That hasn’t changed; they’re in that condition till today: Disarmed! Crushed! Shattered! Exposed and defeated The devil we’re dealing with today is crushed and dethroned. 1 Corinthians 2:6 talks about <em>“…the dethroned Powers who rule this world”</em> (Moffatt translation). In the spirit, they’re dethroned even though they seem to rule this world; the real power in the world today is the Name of Jesus!</p>
<p>Now you can understand why the apostles, in their day, were fearless and used the Name of Jesus fearlessly. It didn’t matter the persecution they faced; they were dauntless because they knew what power was really in office. They knew they were backed by the real power—Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>It’s the same in our day. We’re bold and confident in, and through Him. In His Name, we tame this world and keep Satan and his demons in subjection to us. In John 16:33 WEB, Jesus said, <em>“...Cheer up! I’ve overcome the world”;</em> when He did it, we were in Him. We overcame Satan, the world and its systems.</p>
<p>His Name has all authority. God has decreed that at His Name, every knee should bow—things and beings in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. And that every tongue should confess His Lordship, to the glory of God the Father (Philippians 2:10-11). Nothing and no one can stand against that Name. Thus, in celebrating Christmas, we’re proclaiming His victory, glory, power and dominion over the nations. The whole world belongs to Him. Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>A double minded man is unstable in all his ways (James 1:8).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to be perpetually successful, living the ever-victorious life you’ve been called to live, you have to be focused and consistent. In your confessions of faith, for example, you can’t talk strength, courage, victory, prosperity, health and wholeness, and at the same time speak weakness, fear, failure, poverty and sickness. The Bible says, <em>“Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?”</em> (James 3:11). That’s not going to work.</p>
<p>Our theme verse in the Amplified Version says, <em>“…a man of two minds (hesitating, dubious, irresolute), [he is] unstable and unreliable and uncertain about everything [he thinks, feels, decides].”</em> That means in his way of prosperity, he’ll be unstable; on his road of greatness, he’ll be unstable as well.</p>
<p>There’re lots of people who believe in a life that’s “up and down”; by that I mean an inconsistent, unreliable and uncertain life. That’s not for the Christian; we go upward and forward only. We allow no distractions. Set your sail. It doesn’t matter what tries to pull you this way or that way; make the Word of God your focus: <em>“…Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go”</em> (Joshua 1:7 AMPC). Praise God!</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Looking away [from all that will distract] to Jesus, Who is the Leader and the Source of our faith…”</em> (Hebrews 12:2 AMPC). Set your focus and go for the goal; and the great God of glory, who’s at work in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure, will see to it that you’re a success and you fulfill His destiny for your life. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children (Ephesians 5:1).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you explore every aspect of Jesus’ life and teachings and study what He did, the words He spoke, the miracles He performed and the lives He changed, you’d be inspired by His example. Nobody ever talked like Jesus. Not only did His words demonstrate His faith, hope and love, they also imparted same to His hearers.</p>
<p>In John 10:30, He said*, “I and my Father are one.”* On another occasion, He said, <em>“…I am from above…I am not of this world”</em> (John 8:23). No wonder, when He walked the earth, the High Priests and Pharisees were so concerned about His rising influence that they decided to send officers to arrest Him (John 7:32), but they returned without Him. And when they were queried, their response was such an intriguing one. They said, <em>“...Have you heard the way he talks? We’ve never heard anyone speak like this man”</em> (John 7:46 MSG).</p>
<p>Think about how He spoke words and great miracles ensued. He told Peter and His colleagues who had toiled all night and caught no fish, <em>“…Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught”</em> (Luke 5:4). When they cast their net, they had a great haul of fish, such that they experienced great difficulty bringing it to the shore. What a miracle wrought by His words!</p>
<p>The Bible records how He fed the multitude with a little boy’s lunch by speaking words; He invoked the power of multiplication on five loaves of bread and two pieces of fish and they became more than enough to feed five thousand men, women and children not counted (Luke 9:12-17).</p>
<p>We read in Luke 7:11-17 how He spoke words and brought a dead man (a widow’s only son) back to life who was already being carried to the place of interment. How about Lazarus who was dead, buried for four days and decomposing? Jesus, right in front of Lazarus’ tomb, spoke words and Lazarus came back to life. Amazing! (Read the entire account in John 11).</p>
<p>This is the Jesus that we serve; He used words like no one else and changed hopeless situations. Talk like Jesus. He said, “I speak the words of my Father.” So, like Him, speak words from the Father; speak the words of Christ. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven (Luke 6:37).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In John 7-8, the Bible tells us of how the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman before Jesus. She was said to have been caught in the very act of adultery. The Spirit, through John, specifically tells us they were trying to trap Him into saying something incriminating so they could bring charges against him (John 8:6). </p>
<p>However, the Master’s response to them was, <em>“…He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her”</em> (John 8:7). When they heard it, they all went away, disgruntled, leaving Him alone with the woman. When the woman’s accusers left, Jesus neither lashed out on her nor condemned her. Rather, He said to her, <em>“…go, and sin no more”</em> (John 8:11). How inspiring and comforting! His actions were ever so gracious. Also, consider when Peter denied Him after His arrest. To others, Peter should have been written off, not worthy to be called an apostle; but not with Jesus!</p>
<p>The third time He appeared to the disciples after His resurrection, He reinstated Peter. He asked Peter three times, “Do you love me?” to Peter’s affirmative responses, Jesus said, “Feed my sheep” (John 21:15-18). The Greek word translated “feed” in verses 15 and 16 aren’t the same. The first “feed” in verse 15 is “bosko” and it means to feed and keep the lambs.</p>
<p>But when Jesus repeated it in verse 16, He used a different Greek word “poimaino” which means to tend or to govern the sheep. Jesus didn’t say, “Peter, you’re such a disappointment; after all the miracles you saw with me and all your bragging that you’d follow me till the end, you still denied me. How can I even trust you, going forward?” No; He didn’t take Peter’s error to account.</p>
<p>O, the inspiration of the Master’s love! No wonder the same Peter, inspired by the Master’s great example, penned those beautiful words in 1 Peter 2:21-25: <em>“For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>…I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions… (Acts 2:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>God loves to show us visions when we pray. If you’re going to have extraordinary results in life, it’s important that you learn to catch the visions that the Spirit of God brings to you. When I pray, I see; I relate with divine visions; I’m lifted above this world; I receive ideas from God and get directions for life.</p>
<p>Some people don’t see visions when they pray. To be visionless is to be stagnated. But one sound idea from God can transform your life forever. This happens as you shut out the world and fellowship with the Holy Spirit in prayer. Then He shows you the future and helps you know the next vital step to take, and how to take it.</p>
<p>As you give yourself to the Word of God and yield to the leading of the Holy Spirit in prayer, He’d show you things to come, such that you don’t walk in darkness. Jesus said in John 16:13, <em>“Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.”</em></p>
<p>Being born again and filled with the Holy Spirit, you can know something of your future. You should never find yourself in a situation where you don’t know what to do next in your life. In John 8:12, the Master said, <em>“...I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”</em> Knowing this, you don’t have to worry about tomorrow; you can take His light and set it into your future, and your path will be illuminated to know and walk in His perfect will for you. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p> <em><strong>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him (1 Corinthians 2:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re those who read the verse above and conclude that there’re things God hasn’t revealed to us. But they are wrong. When it says, <em>“But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him,”</em> he’s quoting the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The next verse shows us the fulfillment: <em>“But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God”</em> (1 Corinthians 2:10). The twelfth verse refers to them as “the things that are freely given to us of God.” The Holy Spirit came to show you the things that are freely given to you. What are these things?</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 3:21 tells us: <em>“Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours.”</em> In other words, don’t glory in the flesh; don’t say, <em>“My parents or my uncle is the owner or director of such and such organization; they’re going to help me stand strong financially.”</em> Let your expectations not be in men, for all things are yours!</p>
<p>The next verse says, <em>“Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours”</em> (1 Corinthians 3:22). Things present and even things in the future: They’re all granted you in Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit was sent into your life so that you’d know these things, and then you’d use words to appropriate them in your life.</p>
<p>Knowing this therefore, have no consciousness of lack or need. There’s nothing you require that God hasn’t already granted you: <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue”</em> (2 Peter 1:3). He granted you all things and called you to glory and virtue; not to shame and suffering.</p>
<p>All that you require—whether money, ideas, human and material resources—have been granted you in Christ Jesus. You have everything required for an extraordinary life of righteousness and glory; everything that’s necessary for you to live and excel in the God-life. Christ is in you, and Christ is everything. Glory to God!</p>
