<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em><strong>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>I would to God every Christian grasps the import and profundity of what we just read in our opening verse! In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%206:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>, the Apostle Paul quoted God’s promise in the Old Testament to indwell man and the ensuing fulfilment of that promise. He said, <em>“…for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”</em></p>
<p>What a blessing! What glory it is to have the Holy Spirit in our lives today! He’s the greatest blessing of all; your greatest advantage. He knows everything and owns everything. Having Him in you means you’re made for life. He’s all you need to be everything God destined you to be and fulfil your destiny in life and in the Gospel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 2:12</a> says, <em>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.”</em> Without Him, you can’t know all that God has blessed and endowed you with in Christ. There’re blessings and benefits from God for you every day (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2068:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 68:19</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:11</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2011:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 11:3</a>). The Holy Spirit guides you into these blessings and sees to it that you enjoy them.</p>
<p>Live every day with the consciousness that you’re indeed the temple of the Holy Spirit. He’ll perfect His work and ministry in your life. He’s the Spirit of grace; He’s the Spirit of excellence. His joy is to make your life excellent and full of glory, and to perfect everything that concerns you.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in you is your assurance of an extraordinary life of victory, dominion, abundance and infinite possibilities. He’s the power and glory of your life. Become more conscious of Him, and of His presence in you. In you abides all the graces, blessings, wisdom, and goodness of heaven, because the Holy Spirit lives in you. Therefore, live from within. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Hebrews 4:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Everything that God has placed in this world isn&#x27;t for the angels or for Himself, but for us! If this is true, why should any Christian labour endlessly in prayer just to get God to give him something which belongs to him in Christ? Think about it!</p>
<p>Sadly, I’ve heard those who gripe, “I’ve prayed for five years, with intense fasting, and even sown seeds just to get healed of this ailment!” Life, to them, has become a spiritual warfare, or as it were, an endless struggle in prayer, just to live in health, pay a meagre house rent, pass their exams, or to even have a decent job.</p>
<p>The problem usually stems from their ignorance of what rightfully belongs to them in Christ. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2082:6-7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 82:6-7</a> says, <em>“I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.”</em> Why would they die like men? Why would they fall like one of the princes? It’s because “they know not”; that is, their ignorance!</p>
<p>First, you belong to a great and winning Kingdom. So, square up, chest out and chin up because Jesus already paid the full price for you to walk in victory and enjoy all the blessings. How would you talk, walk, or act if you knew that you’re superior to sickness, disease and infirmities? It’ll put an end to these unnecessary health struggles!</p>
<p>If you found out that you’re the seed of Abraham, an heir of blessings untold, and have been imbued with a life that’s incapable of poverty or failure—a life that can’t be defeated or destroyed—wouldn’t that immediately change the contents of your prayer? Get to know the Word for yourself; be acquainted with these truths. Remember, the life of blessings is your heritage in Christ Jesus. God already blessed you beyond measure (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:3</a>). Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues (Mark 16:17 NKJV).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Mark 16:17 NKJV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’re two things I’ll like you to observe in the theme verse. The first is the fact that the Lord Jesus gave us authority over demons. What is authority? Authority is delegated power; it’s the right to command and be obeyed or the ability to command and enforce obedience. It&#x27;s the right to command something, someone, or anything and be obeyed! For example, when we use the Name of Jesus to effect a change or make a command, that&#x27;s authority!</p>
<p>Secondly, He also gave us the power of attorney, that is, the legal right to act on His behalf or in His stead as His agent: the legal right to act in His Name. So, having been given the power of attorney, how much power do you wield? How much force can you exercise? And how much authority do you really have? It depends on how much power is behind the one that gave it to you.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how much power you&#x27;ve got; if someone with a higher authority than the one who authorized you comes, you have to submit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:18-19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 28:18-19</a> lets us in on the Master&#x27;s authority. It says, <em>“And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”</em> Notice He doesn’t say some power, but ALL power; also observe that He didn’t say that all power is given unto Him to exercise in Israel or some parts of the world; no! He said in heaven and in earth.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus has supreme and unrivalled authority. Hallelujah! When you issue commands to Satan, his demons, and the elements of this world in His Name, they’ll hear and obey you, because you function in Christ’s supreme authority and dominion.</p>

<p><em><strong>And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 4:17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Several years ago, the Lord told me that one of the most important things for men to do is to discover their purpose and fulfil it, but most never do. Therefore, they live empty lives, never realizing that there was a divine plan for them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:10: AMPC</a> says, <em>“For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].”</em></p>
<p>How important it is for you to discover your purpose! What joy and peace will flood your heart when you find yourself in the preordained paths in which you were born to walk! God doesn’t just do things; He has a purpose for everything. He has a purpose for the world, and He sure has a purpose for your life. It’s important that you find out God’s purpose for you.</p>
<p>A generic purpose for all of God’s children is that we were born for His glory; we were born to walk with God and bring Him honour. Let that basic purpose become established in your heart from today, and declare, “Lord, I thank you, because I was born for your glory.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, however, there’s a specific purpose for which you were created and placed on this earth. And it is in fulfilling that purpose that you truly bring glory and honour to God.</p>
<p>If you haven’t discovered that specific purpose, you can today. Be bold to ask the Lord and He’ll tell you. Sometimes, He’ll speak expressly as He did to Paul the Apostle (read: Acts 26:13-16). Other times, He’ll guide you into it, and every day, you’ll discover more and more of His purpose for your life as you walk by faith in accordance with His Word in all things.</p>

<p>In Christ, we don’t pray to be victorious; victory is our heritage; it’s our life! We were born to be triumphant always and in every place. That’s what the Word says and it’s immutable. Let your spirit get a hold of this truth, and live accordingly.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you won’t encounter challenges; but it sure means you’ll always win, regardless of the challenges. So, it makes no difference what happens, where you find yourself or who’s against you; you’re more than a conqueror. You can never be disadvantaged.</p>
<p>God has given you everything it takes to live victoriously every day. He gave you the Holy Spirit, gave you His Word, and gave you the Name of Jesus. Then, He also gave you the ability to speak, to use words.</p>
<p>By your words, you can chart your course in victory and success. You can make your life permanently triumphant. Whatever you say will surely come to pass. Therefore, in the face of adversity, declare God’s Word.</p>
<p>Every so often, affirm that good things are coming your way and happening for you and around you because the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord. Use your mouth— your words—to keep yourself on the victory highway, to transform circumstances, and to change situations to conform to God’s perfect will for you.</p>

<p><em><strong>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness… (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 26:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There are billions of people on earth today and no two fingerprints are alike in the whole world. We’re all uniquely gifted, blessed and called of God. So, let your joy be in fulfilling the calling that God has given you. You’re on a unique assignment; stay in the grace that God gave you, as no one can do it exactly like you.</p>
<p>Think about Paul: He was an apostle to the Gentiles; that wasn’t something fashionable in his day, but he celebrated his unique assignment. He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2011:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 11:13</a>, <em>“...I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office.”</em> He didn’t wish to have been sent to the Jews; Peter had that.</p>
<p>It’s like Joshua too; though He walked closely with Moses before Moses died, he understood the uniqueness of what God wanted him to do. In Joshua Chapter 1, God said to him*: “...go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them…for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them”* (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:2-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua 1:2-6</a>).</p>
<p>When Joshua got those marching orders, he understood that his assignment was unique from that of Moses. God had earlier told Moses, “I want you to bring my people out of Egypt” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203:7-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 3:7-10</a>). Moses brought them out of captivity in Egypt all right, but it was Joshua who took them into the land of promise and divided it for their inheritance (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua 1:2</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6</a>).</p>
<p>Have you established your unique assignment in that country, city, town, village, neighbourhood, school, or office? Don’t think you’re there just like everyone else, to do the same things they’re all doing. Understand that you’re on a unique assignment; fulfil your purpose with poise!</p>

<p><em><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 3:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening verse is about the most popular verse of the Bible. It contains the most powerful and most informative words in the entire Scripture. It says anyone who believes in the Son of God has everlasting life, meaning they’re separated from destruction, waste, failure, damage, etc.</p>
<p>What is everlasting life? Is it just life that goes on and on? No; that definition doesn’t even scratch the surface of what it is. To understand everlasting life, you first have to know what eternal life is. This might come as a surprise to some people who thought they were the same; but there’s a difference.</p>
<p>To be eternal is to be ageless: ageless without a beginning and ageless without an end. It’s a life that has no beginning and it has no end; it’s timeless. Eternity, thus, refers to timelessness and agelessness. More specifically, it’s a life that’s incorruptible, indestructible, imperishable, unending, and not subject to failure or death. This is the life and nature of God.</p>
<p>That’s why He’s called the Eternal One. The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2090:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 90:2</a>, <em>“Before you created the hills or brought the world into being, you were eternally God, and will be God for ever”</em> (GNB).</p>
<p>Everlasting life is eternal life with a beginning; it has a beginning but no end. The angels, for instance, have eternal life with a beginning. Though they live forever, they had a beginning. God, however, has no beginning; He’s absolutely eternal. The angels became eternal because God, the Eternal One, made them everlasting. To make them everlasting, He had to impart them with eternal life.</p>
<p>When you’re born again, you receive eternal life and become everlasting. You’re brought from your humanity into eternity. Receiving that life is your first entry into it; that’s the beginning of your life in eternity. From there on, you become a part of an endless life that’s imperishable, indestructible and incorruptible.</p>

<p><em><strong>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 1:27</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>To have the vital knowledge and live with the consciousness that Christ lives in you is one of the greatest blessings of Christianity. It is, in fact, your solution to all problems and answer to all questions. Christ in you is the wonder of Christianity.</p>
<p>When Jesus walked the earth, He was with the disciples as Emmanuel, God with us. But the Father’s dream was yet to be consummated. He wanted all of divinity in us, not just with us. He wanted His Spirit in us.</p>
<p>It’s the reason Jesus said, <em>“And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:16-17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:16-17</a>). The desire of the Father was actuated on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came to live in us.</p>
<p>Consider the amazing truth in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:11</a>: <em>“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.”</em></p>
<p>This means Christ in you—the Holy Spirit in you—is the life of your physical body; it’s your health, your deliverance, wholeness, and preservation. Christ in you is your right to walk out of any pain. Christ in you is your power over every crisis; it’s your dominion over darkness, poverty, lack and want. Hallelujah! Christ in you is the greatest blessing of all. Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which GOD PREDESTINED (PLANNED BEFOREHAND) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which HE PREARRANGED AND MADE READY FOR US TO LIVE] (Ephesians 2:10 AMPC).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which GOD PREDESTINED (PLANNED BEFOREHAND) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which HE PREARRANGED AND MADE READY FOR US TO LIVE] (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 2:10 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Sometimes people ask if there’s such a thing as predestination. “Can I really say that God prearranged my life?” they wonder. Absolutely! The Bible says He did; we just read it! Also, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:29</a> says, <em>“For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate....”</em></p>
<p>The question then arises: Is God, therefore, responsible for everything that happens in my life? Not really, because you’re a free moral agent; you’re responsible for your decisions and actions. Once you become an adult, you have a responsibility for your life, and the onus is on you to make the right decisions in line with God’s destiny and perfect will for you.</p>
<p>Just because God predestined your life for something doesn’t mean you’ll fulfil it. People don’t necessarily become what God planned for them to be. It’s a personal choice you make to fulfil God’s plan for your life and be all that He’s destined you to be.</p>
<p>Paul, in his letter to the Colossian church, sent a specific instruction to Archippus, telling him: <em>“...Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it”</em> ([Colossians 4:17](<a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Colossians" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Colossians</a> 4:17 kjv)). If the man didn’t have the responsibility of fulfilling the ministry that God committed to him, Paul wouldn’t have instructed him to see to it that he fulfilled it. This also meant it was possible for him not to fulfil it.</p>
<p>Make up your mind you’ll be everything God has destined you to be, you’ll do all that He’s predestined you to do, and you’ll walk in His preordained pathways.</p>

<p><em><strong>…when it seems as though you are facing nothing but difficulties, see it as an invaluable opportunity to experience the greatest joy that you can!

<p>Trials and temptations, as difficult as they are, are for your good. You’ll ultimately find joy in them. Your faith blossoms under pressure and you learn true patience as you endure.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want God to effect a change right away. We’re praying about a situation or something we want to prevent from happening, and we want instant answers. But there’re times when patience is needed while expressing your faith. God never wants us to panic at such times.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:4</a> in the Voice Translation says, <em>“…true patience brought on by endurance will equip you to complete the long journey and cross the finish line—mature, complete, and wanting nothing.”</em></p>
<p>Yes, there’ll be challenging times and uncomfortable circumstances, but the Word encourages us to count them all joy, knowing that the trying of our faith produces patience in us. Then the 4th verse tells us what patience, in turn, produces in us when we allow it to do its work and have its full effect. So don’t keep pushing and agitating; you could miss out on God’s plan.</p>
<p>Let’s read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:4</a> again, this time, in the Amplified Classic. It says, <em>“But let endurance and steadfastness and patience have full play and do a thorough work, so that you may be [people] perfectly and fully developed [with no defects], lacking in nothing.”</em> This is what patience produces in us: we become perfectly and fully developed [with no defects], lacking in nothing.” Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?

<p>All over the world, people pray in the Name of Jesus. They preach Him on the streets and every week in churches. Some have written books about Him, sung about Him, and prophesied in His Name. But a very painful reality is that many don’t know who He really is.</p>
<p>True, they’ve heard about Him, but He’s not merely “a great religious leader” that many know Him as; He is God. Sadly, even among preachers, some only know Him as Saviour who saved us from our sins. But Jesus is much more than that. He’s Himself God: the omnipotent, immortal God, living in unapproachable light of divine glory, coequal with the Father and the embodiment of the Godhead. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2:9</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%206:14-16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 6:14-16</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus is the King of kings and Lord of all, who has all authority in heaven, in earth, and under the earth. We’re His witnesses, and we have to let the world know that He’s real and that He came to die as a man for all men; He was raised from the dead and lives forever. Let’s get busy, telling the whole world about Him.</p>
<p>The work we’re doing here on earth isn’t an end in itself. One day, we would have told the last person; we would have held the last conference or the last church service; we would have completed everything He asked us to do, and then we’ll hear that trumpet sound. The Lord will appear and we&#x27;ll receive crowns of glory: “And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 5:4</a>).

<p>There&#x27;s so much that the Lord wants to do through His children in the earth in these last days, but the limiting factor for many has been knowledge. How do you hope for something that you don’t even know exists? You can&#x27;t expect something that your imagination can’t fathom. </p>
<p>But thanks be unto God! The Bible says in the last days, knowledge shall be increased. Through this knowledge, we’re doing the impossible, the unthinkable, and the unimaginable. The Holy Spirit is helping and preparing the Church for what He wants to do by availing us of true, accurate, and precise knowledge of His Word. </p>
<p>Through Him, we know the things that are freely given to us by God: <em>“Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>). Life is limited by your knowledge or understanding. There&#x27;s a whole lot that happens to you when you get the right knowledge, the knowledge of God’s Word. Your capacity is tremendously increased; you become aware and are able to comprehend the wonderful blessings God has prepared for you to enjoy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:32&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 20:32</a> declares, <em>“And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.”</em> You already have an inheritance bequeathed to you in Christ, but through the knowledge of God, you’re able to take a hold of what’s rightfully yours. I admonish you today, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:16</a>).

<p><em><strong>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 4:18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’re certain negative forces that affect people’s actions, choices and decisions; one of them is fear. Fear is a tormenting spirit. There’re different kinds of fear: The fear of failure, the fear of the future, the fear of man, the fear of death, the fear of darkness, and so on.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, those who are driven by fear can’t even define what they’re afraid of. Yet, they perpetually live in fear. But we’re never to be moved by fear, because we’re born of God and live by faith. In your life, make up your mind that you’ll never be ruled by fear.</p>
<p>Never allow fear to prompt you to take an action or stop you from taking one. The Bible says fear entraps, but if you trust in the Lord, you’re safe (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2029:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 29:25</a>).</p>
<p>There are people who are bound by the fear of insecurity. Even some leaders experience these fears in their leadership roles. But the Bible says, <em>“For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 1:7</a>). That means if you’re born again and filled with the Holy Spirit, fear has no place in your life. You should never be ensnared by fear. You have the Spirit of power, of love, and of a sound mind. Blessed be God!</p>
<p>It makes no difference the darkness in the world and how dismal the state of the world economy gets; refuse to be agitated. Trust the Lord; He leads us in perpetual triumph. God has ordained your victory, promotion, and prosperity in the midst of darkness. He already planned that you’ll be a success in this life, irrespective of what’s going on in the world around you. So, live confidently every day, knowing that your faith is the victory that overcomes the world. <em>&quot;For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world; and this is the victory that conquers the world, even our faith&quot;</em>(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:4&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 5:4 AMPC</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice (Ephesians 4:31).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:31&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 4:31</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Spirit says through Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>, “In malice, be as children, but in understanding be men.” Children don’t keep malice. They don’t harbor resentment; they have a pure and innocent mind. That’s how God wants us to live.</p>
<p>The same admonition He gave in our theme verse is repeated in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:8</a>. It says, <em>“But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.”</em> All these are listed together because they’re all related.</p>
<p>Resentment will prompt you to negative actions and filthy communication; therefore, eschew it. So many ventures today were started on the basis of resentment. Someone was angry about the way things were being done in a certain establishment and went on to start his own. Even some churches have been started that way too.</p>
<p>You can’t get God’s approval on a venture, enterprise or action that has anger, resentment and bitterness as its driving force.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus alluded to this in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2023:27-28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 23:27-28</a> when He said, <em>“Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men&#x27;s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.”</em></p>
<p>Harbouring resentment, bitterness, anger, hatred, or jealousy eventually produces adverse effects in a person, because these negative forces lead people to unwholesome actions. Remember, we’re called to walk in love.</p>
<p>When you walk in love, you’re a master; you’re in dominion. The Bible says love isn’t self-seeking, touchy, fretful or resentful. It takes no account of the evil done to it, neither does it pay attention to a suffered wrong (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013:5&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 13:5 AMPC</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (2 Corinthians 5:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 5:17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There are those who are haunted by guilt and memories of the past. They’re fighting so hard to overcome painful memories. They’re in bondage to their past, probably because of some terrible things they had done or the hurt they suffered, and they’ve been living with the pain ever since.</p>
<p>You need to understand what it means to be born again, to be a new creation: you’re a brand new person. You’re not the same person who had those horrible experiences. That person died in Christ. The new “you” is absolved of all guilt; free of errors and imperfections.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:18</a> says, <em>“Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.”</em> Jesus wasn&#x27;t only delivered on account of our sins, He was also raised for our justification (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 4:25</a>). What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means you were declared “not guilty&quot;; no charge against you. The reason is simple: you’re a new creation; a brand new person without a past. So, even if you did something wrong in the past that still makes you feel guilty, it’s all based on memory and emotions. In Christianity, we don’t walk by our feelings; we walk by faith. We live on the affirmation of God’s Word.</p>
<p>Don’t recollect a bitter experience you might have had many years ago and start crying that God should forgive you. Refuse to be held captive by guilt or memories of the past.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 4:25</a> AMPC says Jesus was raised from the dead for <em>“…(our acquittal), [making our account balance and absolving us from all guilt before God].”</em> When you come to Jesus, He makes you free from every kind of bondage: <em>“If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:36&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:36</a>).

<p><em><strong>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 28:18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Immediately after the Lord Jesus made the extraordinary statement in our theme verse, He charged us to go into every man’s world on account of ALL power that’s been given unto Him and preach the Gospel to every creature.</p>
<p>We’re the extension of His Kingdom, of His reign and rulership in the earth. It’s part of the reason He charges us to pray. He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 18:1</a>, <em>“Men ought always to pray and not give up.”</em> He wants us to be relentless and persistent in prayer and effect changes in our world and in the lives of men everywhere.</p>
<p>He’s charged us with the responsibility, and He gave us the authority, to transform our world. He knew we would contend with evil forces, so He gave us dominion over them. We have the right arsenal—the Name of Jesus and the Word of God on our lips—to deal with demoniacal forces.</p>
<p>When you observe, for example, that things are going awry in your nation, get to praying fervently in the Spirit. Rebuke Satan and his cohorts of darkness responsible for deception, hardships and wickedness, and reassign angels to take charge where they had held sway. Pray often like this to hinder the works of darkness in your nation and around the world.</p>

<p><em><strong>This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%201:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Timothy 1:18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2010:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 10:3</a>). In other words, though we live in the human body, our war isn’t according to the flesh. Then the 4th verse tells us about the weapons of our warfare: <em>“(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds).”</em> These weapons aren’t manmade or invented by human understanding; rather, they operate through God to the pulling down of strongholds.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what kind of strongholds they are; whether they be intellectual strongholds, mental strongholds, political strongholds, scientific strongholds, or medical strongholds! We have weapons to dislodge these evil strongholds and render them ineffective and futile. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit, through the Apostle Paul, tells us about one of these effectual weapons of our warfare in our opening scripture—prophecy! Use prophecies as a weapon as you wage spiritual warfare by faith. God’s Word about you is prophecy. Therefore, always speak forth His Word.</p>
<p>The Word of God from your lips is the sword of the Spirit (the “rhema” of God). This is an inspired utterance of the Word of God from your mouth. It’s a prophetic word. With it, you chart your course in life from glory to glory. You can re-frame and re-plan your life. You can override the sequence of unpalatable events in your life or circumstances.</p>
<p>What has God said about you? What has He said about lost souls? What has He said about your situation? Use those words to make war and cause His will to be established in your life, in your nation, and in the lives of men and women around the world.</p>

<p><em><strong>Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%201:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Timothy 1:19</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>From our theme scripture, we observe the connection between faith and a good conscience. You need both for a balanced and effective Christian life. Your conscience is the voice of your spirit. Your conscience can be trusted, but it’ll only be dependable if your spirit is educated with the Word of God.</p>
<p>Some people do terrible things; they sponsor or participate in acts of wickedness, violence and bloodshed. And their conscience allows them to do such things. Why? It’s because of the condition of their spirits. Their conscience has been educated to permit such evil and wickedness. Their conscience has been seared with a hot iron (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%204:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 4:2</a>). But if your spirit is conditioned by the Word of God, you’ll have the voice of God in your heart, and it’ll be different.</p>
<p>The Bible says out of your heart—your spirit—are the issues of life (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 4:23</a>). It’s therefore important that you train your spirit with the Word to be a sure guide. Never allow negative thoughts and ideas—thoughts of bitterness, wickedness, evil, violence or terror—grow in you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:16</a> says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly….”</em> Store the Word of God richly in your heart, and you’ll be able to bring every negative thought into captivity to the obedience of the Word (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2010:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>).

<p><em><strong>…I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 10:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the beautiful things about discovering your divine purpose in life is that it keeps you focused. Your purpose defines your life, giving you a focus and a direction. A synonym for purpose is “intent” or “design.” Intent or design is never general; it must be clear, definite and specific for it to be realistic and effective.</p>
<p>Our Lord Jesus had a clear purpose for coming into the world, and He expressed it unequivocally. He said, “I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it to the full” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:10</a>).</p>
<p>The Word says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 3:8</a>: <em>“...For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.”</em> Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2019:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 19:10</a>, Jesus declared, <em>“...The son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.&quot;</em> His purpose was very clear: He came to do the will of His Father.</p>
<p>He said, <em>“...My nourishment comes from doing the will of God who sent me, and from finishing his work”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%204:34&amp;version=TLB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 4:34 TLB</a>). We see from this statement of Jesus, a very powerful principle of life revealed: the pursuit and fulfilment of your divine purpose is the true sustenance of life; it’s the fuel that keeps your engine running while you’re on the face of this earth. Even in the natural sense, few things stimulate, keep alive, or stir courage as much as going after a goal and accomplishing it.</p>
<p>We also see purpose expressed in Paul’s narrative of his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:13-16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 26:13-16</a>). He appeared to Paul to make him a minister and a witness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 26:16</a>). He futher reveals to Paul that he was “to open the eyes of the Gentiles and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Christ Jesus” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 26:18</a>).</p>
<p>This was Paul’s reason for being; this was his life’s mission, and he said in verse 19, <em>“...I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.”</em> Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%209:26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 9:26</a>, he said*, “I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air.”* In other words, I’m focused on my mission; I’m definitive about carrying out God’s plan for my life. That’s how it ought to be. Be focused on your assignment, on your God-given purpose. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:32&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 8:32</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When people don’t know the truth, they believe a lie, and as a result, they suffer in life. God said, <em>“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea%204:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hosea 4:6</a>). This is really touching; it’s one of the reasons we’re teaching God’s people His Word through this devotional so they’ll walk in truth and in the realities of the new life in Christ.</p>
<p>What is truth and how does God see you? Truth is reality; truth is the Word of God. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:17</a>, Jesus said in prayer to the Father, “thy Word is truth.” Many have their lives in jeopardy and experience defeat, sadness, gloom, failure and sickness because of their ignorance of God’s Word.</p>
<p>But thanks be unto God! The Bible says through knowledge shall the just be delivered (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2011:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 11:9</a>); the knowledge of who you are in Christ and your heritage in Him will transform the entire quality of your life. Understand that as a Christian, you’re a different breed. The Bible says, <em>“But ye are a chosen generation…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:9</a>). The word “generation” is the same word for “breed.” You’re a special breed, superior to sickness, disease and everything of darkness and the devil.</p>
<p>Also, you have an incorruptible life—a life of victory, success, excellence and great glory. It’s a life that can’t be infected by any plague or disease. You can’t be poisoned or destroyed. Jesus said, <em>“And these signs shall follow them that believe…if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:17-18</a>).</p>
<p>You have to know and consciously affirm these truths about yourself every so often. You’re a partaker of the divine nature. The life in you is divine and sustained by the Spirit of God who lives in you: <em>“But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:11</a>). Live with this consciousness and exercise yourself in these truths!</p>

<p><em><strong>According as he hath chosen us in him…unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ…wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved (Ephesians 1:4-6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>According as he hath chosen us in him…unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ…wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:4-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:4-6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people live their lives in the hope that God will accept them on the basis of their good works. But our good works aren&#x27;t enough to give us a right standing with God. You may even be going through a situation and thinking, “When I look at my life, I can’t even find any sin; so, why am I going through this?”</p>
<p>Well, the Bible says <em>“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:8-9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>). Furthermore, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 2:16</a> says, <em>&quot;...by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.&quot;</em> </p>
<p>The struggle to live right, to please God so as to be accepted by Him, is unnecessary. Why should you work so hard, struggling to be accepted by Him, when the Spirit already calls us through the Word as, <em>“...accepted in the beloved”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:6</a>)? You’ve been accepted and declared righteous before God. Accept this truth and now live to please Him accordingly.</p>
<p>God chose you before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blame before Him in love, and He predestined you to be accepted in His presence. It’s part of what His righteousness in your spirit has produced for you; you can boldly stand in the presence of God without guilt, inferiority or condemnation. In Christ, you have right standing before God. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Now that you’re born again, you dwell in God’s presence, and you’re at liberty to serve Him as He desires. Until and unless this becomes your present-hour consciousness, your Christian walk will be a struggle. Christianity for you should be an everyday experience of divine fellowship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him (Colossians 3:9-10).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:9-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 3:9-10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When you were born into this world, you came with the human life from your parents. This was the life you lived until you were born again and received another life: the life and nature of God. Does this, therefore, imply that you have two lives in you: a human life as well as the divine one? Absolutely not!</p>
<p>As a Christian, you only have one life, and it’s the God-life. The human life ceased to be because it was replaced by this life and nature of God. You didn’t receive an additional life; it was a supplanting of the old with the new. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</em> The use of the word “creature” in the verse lets us know that what’s being described is something new and strange that the world can’t recognize because it has never seen it before.</p>
<p>That’s like what the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 3:1</a>, <em>“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.”</em> Now that we’re the sons of God, the world doesn’t recognise us because we&#x27;re changed.</p>
<p>We’re no longer subject to sickness, disease, failure, or death. We’re new creations, born with the life and nature of God that transcends the ordinary human life. This is the message of Christ. This is why He came: <em>“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:12</a>).

<p><em><strong>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust (2 Peter 1:4).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Peter 1:4</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The word translated as “promises” in our opening verse needs to be properly understood. In the New Testament, the same Greek word &quot;epaggelia&quot; was translated as “promise” more than fifty times. However, in 2 Peter, another Greek word &quot;epaggelma&quot; was translated as “promise” twice. This was a different type of promise, but the Bible translators didn’t distinguish between the two. I’ll explain.</p>
<p>The first type of promise is futuristic. It’s like when one says, “I’ll give you $200,000 tomorrow.” That’s a promise. But there’s another type when someone tells you, “I’ll give you $200,000” and then proceeds to write a cheque that’s dated today. Now, that cheque is the promise, not the money.</p>
<p>The promise is that if you take the cheque to the bank, the money will be there. So, it depends on whenever you want to cash it. If the first type of promise fails, there might be no consequences; but not the second one; it must not fail. If it fails, that’s a criminal offence in financial terms, because it&#x27;ll be a dud cheque.</p>
<p>This second type of promise is what’s written in our opening verse. These aren’t futuristic promises but promises backed already with fulfillment. They’re real already, waiting for whenever you want them “cashed.”</p>
<p>Observe again what the Bible says: <em>“Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature….”</em> This means that by &quot;cashing&quot; these precious promises, we become associates of the God-kind. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>It’s time to cash your cheques and start participating in the divine experience. But how do you cash them? It&#x27;s by speaking God’s language; it’s by declaring words of faith in agreement with God.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the concluding part of the format of prayer Jesus gave to His disciples, He taught them to say, “Thine is the Kingdom.” He was referring to the Kingdom of God. But in St. Mathew’s gospel, there’s another expression, “the Kingdom of heaven,” which, though interchangeably used with the Kingdom of God, is different. </p>
<p>While the Kingdom of God refers to the rulership or dominion of God, which transcends territories and is universal, the Kingdom of heaven is applied particularly in connection to the Messiah, Jesus Christ, and His messianic reign. It’s that part of the Kingdom of God that’s established in the earth and is headed by Jesus.</p>
<p>The vision of the Kingdom of heaven is the establishment and expansion of the Kingdom of God in the earth; it’s the work of Jesus Christ, of which we, the Church, are a vital part. It’s important for us to know our role. Each one of us actually has a responsibility, first, to see to the expansion of the Kingdom of God, because we belong in that Kingdom: <em>“But seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:33</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord’s injunction for us to seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness calls for every one of us to reappraise our priorities and walk accordingly. Your ultimate desire should be that the Kingdom is advancing through you as you impact your world with the Gospel.</p>
<p>Devote your time, efforts and resources to the furtherance of the Gospel. There’s so much more you can do to ensure God’s Word prevails in your city, region or country, and the world.</p>

<p><em><strong>For the Kingdom of God is not just fancy talk; it is living by God’s power (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%204:20&amp;version=NLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 4:20 NLT</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our previous study, we learnt about the Kingdom of heaven and how its purpose is to establish the Kingdom of God in the earth. But what’s the Kingdom of heaven? It refers to the political government of Jesus Christ. The Bible says, <em>“ …and the government shall be upon his shoulder...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%209:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 9:6</a>). This is dealing with His structures and political arrangement.</p>
<p>Even though the Kingdom of heaven is in the earth and ruling the spirit world, it’s not yet governing the people. To understand this, think of a political party that’s already active with members, but hasn’t assumed authority over the government of the state or nation.</p>
<p>When that party eventually takes over the government, everything changes. In the same way, once the Kingdom of God is truly and duly established in the earth, then the Kingdom of heaven takes over! But for now, the political structures in the world today will continue to nose-dive, and the world will keep having more problems until the Rapture takes place. The period of tribulation will then follow, after which the Lord Jesus will appear from heaven.</p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%207:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 7:27</a> <em>“And the Kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the Kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.”</em> At His second coming, the Lord Jesus gets the Kingdom! He’ll establish His political structures on earth and take over. Hallelujah! He’ll reign and rule and, in the end, deliver the Kingdom to God the Father.</p>
<p>Understand that all the things we’re doing for the Lord on earth today aren’t an end in themselves; they’re trainings for greater Kingdom responsibilities ahead. Therefore, serve the Lord wholeheartedly, and make up your mind to accomplish big things for the Kingdom, knowing that there’s a “hereafter”.</p>

<p><em><strong>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly (John 10:10).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 10:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There&#x27;re three important questions in life: “What?” “How?” and “Why?” To know “what” is to begin to live; to know “how” is to begin to succeed; and to know “why” is to begin to reign; because that’s when you’re fulfilling purpose.</p>
<p>Whether you’re asking these questions in your personal life, for your personal growth, business, job, finances, family, or ministry, these three questions will locate you. However, the most important of them is “Why?” It’s the age -old question that mankind through all generations has grappled with.</p>
<p>Why were you born? Why are you here on this earth at this time? Why are you a teacher, a doctor, a farmer, a politician, a soldier, a singer, or a minister of the Gospel? Why do you do what you do? Your “Why” is your purpose, your reason for being.</p>
<p>Purpose is the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists. It refers to intent, design, and the reason for a cause or action; and it also alludes to the relevance or usefulness of a thing.</p>
<p>So, have you discovered your purpose? Do you know why you’re in this world? What are the intents, designs or reasons for the actions you take and the things you do? Why were you recreated in Christ? The Word of God gives clear answers and insights into your purpose in the earth.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:9 AMPC</a> says, <em>“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God&#x27;s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.”</em></p>
<p> You were created to bring God glory—to show forth His praise—to set forth His wonderful deeds and display His virtues and perfections in the earth. Thus, your life should be about living for Him, pleasing Him and fulfilling the purpose for which you were born again. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2019:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 19:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When we emphasize the importance of knowing the Word of God, some think we mean acquiring “Bible Knowledge” from a university or religious institution. That may have its place, but knowing the Word by revelation and guidance of the Holy Spirit is different.</p>
<p>There’re Bible scholars who studied Bible knowledge as a course but have no idea what the Word of God is. All scripture is God-breathed; that is, the contents and the message of the Bible came from God and are inspired by His Spirit. It’s His document of truth, and it’s trustworthy and dependable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:16&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 3:16 AMPC</a> says, <em>“Every Scripture is God-breathed (given by His inspiration) and profitable for instruction, for reproof and conviction of sin, for correction of error and discipline in obedience, [and] for training in righteousness (in holy living, in conformity to God&#x27;s will in thought, purpose, and action).”</em> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 4:12</a> further tells us something extraordinary about the Word of God. It says, <em>“For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”</em></p>
<p>But then, what is the Word of God? The Word is that message from God that reveals or communicates His works, will, thoughts, plans, purposes and pursuit to bring men into, or promote, fellowship with Him in love. It&#x27;s His message of truth with the content and power to build His image into the life of the hearers.</p>
<p>Now, the content of the Word is the embodiment of Christ&#x27;s revelations, provisions, perfections and instructions, profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction, instruction and for training in righteousness. Therefore, knowing or having the knowledge of the Word means knowing God in His thoughts about anything. You know His thoughts, opinions, ideas, and agenda; you’re looking into God&#x27;s mind or His heart about anything! What a wonder!</p>

<p>God loves you more than you love yourself. He knows what’s best for you and always wants the best for you. Therefore, you can trust Him with your life. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%201:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 1:19</a>, He said, <em>“If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.”</em> The Living Bible renders it in a rather fascinating way. It says, <em>“If you will only let me help you, if you will only obey, then I will make you rich!”</em></p>
<p>Thank God we’re His obedient children! So you can trust Him to make you rich and make your life glorious. Your responsibility is to submit to His will by living in His Word. It’s those who are ignorant of God’s Word and of His love that struggle and try to wrest the steering-wheel of their lives from His grasp. They haven’t fully yielded to His Word, to His will and purpose.</p>
<p>When you know Him, you’re at rest. You discover that He’s more passionate for your success than you could ever be. That discovery changed my life many years ago. It made me submit to His choices and follow His Word wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Accept His love. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:13&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:13 AMPC</a> says He’s transferred us into the Kingdom of the Son of His love. Have confidence in His love. Dare to believe Him, and submit to the destiny that He’s chosen for you. It’s a unique destiny. And in His Word, He’s laid out the blueprint for your life: how you should live. Follow His Word, for that’s how you submit to His will. His Word is His will expressed.</p>

<p><em><strong>…He [God] was made visible in human flesh, justified and vindicated in the [Holy] Spirit, was seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, [and] taken up in glory (1 Timothy 3:16 AMPC).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>…He [God] was made visible in human flesh, justified and vindicated in the [Holy] Spirit, was seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, [and] taken up in glory (</strong></em>[<em><strong>1 Timothy 3:16 AMPC</strong></em>](And great and important and weighty, we confess, is the hidden truth (the mystic secret) of godliness. He [[a]God] was made visible in human flesh, justified and vindicated in the [Holy] Spirit, was seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, [and] taken up in glory.)<em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening verse leaves no doubt about who Jesus is; He is God, made visible in human flesh, justified and vindicated in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, and taken up in glory! Hallelujah!</p>
<p>It brings to mind the story of the hastily prearranged prosecution of Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014:60-63&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 14:60-63</a>. The high priests conspired with the Jewish Council to find some evidence against Jesus by which they could sentence Him to death, but they couldn’t find any. Then they asked Jesus, <em>“…Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”</em></p>
<p>The Master’s response was unambiguous and unequivocal. He said, “…I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” For this, they condemned Him to death and took Him away because He dared to declare Himself to be God in human flesh. But that’s who He is. To say “Jesus is the Son of God” means He’s God in human flesh.</p>
<p>God came to us in a human body. That was what He was crucified for. No wonder Paul said the fullness of the Godhead, that is, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit— the totality of Deity—is tabernacled in Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:19</a>).</p>
<p>When you stand before the throne of God, you aren’t going to be seeing some blinding light as the Father, and then the Lord Jesus standing beside Him on the throne; neither will you see the Holy Spirit like a bird on top of the throne, no! Jesus is on the throne and the Father is in Him. He is the complete embodiment of Deity. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people… (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Peter 2:9</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may read the four gospels and not get a picture of the Christian life and who the Christian really is. This is because the gospels don’t completely give us the full picture of the life of Jesus after His resurrection. The account of His life before His ascension was very brief.</p>
<p>It’s part of the reasons He told His disciples about the Holy Spirit—the Spirit of truth—who would show them things to come and guide them into all truth (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:12-13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 16:12-13</a>). Therefore, the most appropriate reference point for the Christian, as you study the New Testament, are the epistles.</p>
<p>Someone might ask, “How about the Book of Acts?” The Book of Acts is a catalogue of the acts of a baby Church. The Church in the Book of Acts had just started out in the Faith; so, it might not be the best expression of the Christian life, though it’s a good place to start. But for deeper and greater insights into the life of God&#x27;s new creature in Christ, you’d have to study the epistles!</p>
<p>For example, Paul&#x27;s epistle to the Roman church—the Book of Romans—is an extraordinary exposition of the doctrine of the supremacy of Christ and of faith in Christ as the source of salvation. Also, consider his beautiful letter to the Ephesian church; it details how new converts can grow in their spiritual knowledge of God and in the realities of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Think about Peter’s writings; in chapter one verse four of his second epistle, he said, <em>“Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature….”</em> What a description of who the Christian is: we’re participators or sharers of God’s divine nature; associates of the God-kind—carriers or conveyors of the God-life. What a blessed reality!</p>
<p>There’s also the prophetic word on the millennial reign of Christ: everything the Lord promised to the Jews in the millennial reign is what He already gave the Church to enjoy today.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to know about the Christian life and who the Christian is, you need the Book of Acts, the revelations and admonitions in the epistles, and all the promises prophetically given to the Jews in the Millennium. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>If we say we are his, we must follow the example of Christ (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:6&amp;version=CEV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 2:6 CEV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is the education of the human mind, but there&#x27;s also the education of the human spirit. In these last days, through the ministry of the Word and the Spirit, we&#x27;re raising God&#x27;s people to become effective witnesses.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is growing, and thanks be unto God for making it possible for a whole lot more people to hear the Word of God and be raised. It&#x27;s akin to watching newborn babies grow up; it evokes some kind of excitement in parents as they watch their children go through various stages of growth.</p>
<p>At a certain level of growth, all that the parents are required to do is give the required instructions, guidance, supervision and direction. They ensure the babies are feeding well, getting the right treatment, living in the right environment, exercising their bodies, and so on.</p>
<p>But soon enough, through observation, the babies begin to talk and attempt to act like the parents. That way, they’re being raised; the things you do affect them, and they tend to become more and more like you. It&#x27;s the same thing spiritually. The Apostle Paul said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>, <em>“Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.”</em> </p>
<p>Now, because the Lord is in fellowship with us, talking to us, teaching us, feeding us and doing things before us, and we have His Word to give us a good picture, we become more and more like Him, acting, talking, relating with others as He would.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 3:15</a>). Open your heart to be raised by the Word. Receive with meekness the love, hope, faith, power, prosperity, truth, strength, soundness of mind and body that the Word brings to you. Embrace the Word, which is able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>
