<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together (Romans 8:17).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In the first chapter of Ephesians, Paul highlights what God accomplished in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His own right hand—in the place of authority—in the heavenly realms. He possesses all power, and He&#x27;s glorified (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:20</a>). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Now, read what the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:6</a><em>: “And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.”</em> The same God that raised Jesus from the dead and sat Him at His own right hand has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ. This is huge!</p>
<p>The term &quot;sit together&quot; is from the Greek word &quot;sugkathizo&quot;; it implies joint sitting or shared authority. We have joint sitting with Christ. We are where He is, and we have what He has. The authority He possesses is extended to us. Everything Jesus commands is done in our name, and everything we command is done in His Name.</p>
<p>This is all legal. Our “joint sitting” with Christ is not of this earthly realm but heavenly; it has been established from heaven. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 18:18</a>, the Lord Jesus, before his ascension declared, <em>&quot;Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&quot;</em></p>
<p>We’re His legal representatives on earth, and what we declare and speak in the earth is endorsed in the heavens. We&#x27;re entrusted with the responsibility of manifesting the glory of God in our world and establishing His will in the earth. Confidently exercise your authority in Christ. Enforce God&#x27;s will and manifest His Kingdom where you are.</p>
<p> </p>

<details class="details_lb9f alert alert--info details_b_Ee" data-collapsed="true"><summary>Prayer</summary><div><div class="collapsibleContent_i85q"><p>Dear Father, thank you for the privilege and blessing to have joint sitting with Christ, and for the authority and responsibility you’ve reposed on the Church to enforce your will in the earth. Even now, your righteousness, excellence, beauty and grace fill the nations, and your Kingdom reigns and rules in men’s hearts, in Jesus’ Name. Amen.</p></div></div></details>

<p><em><strong>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life (1 John 5:13 NIV).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:13&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 5:13 NIV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Eternal life is the life and nature of God. It’s the organic and existential attributes of Deity. However, it’s not enough for you to know that this life and nature of God is now yours; you have to seize it. That’s the thrust of the Spirit’s communication through Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%206:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 6:12</a>. It says, <em>“Fight the good fight of faith, <strong>lay hold on</strong> eternal life….”</em></p>
<p>The Greek rendering of our underlined portion is “epilambanomai.” It means to take a hold of something without letting go. In other words, don’t just be aware that you have eternal life; seize eternal life; take possession of it. This means to live it like you have it.</p>
<p>Every blessed day, walk in the consciousness that you have the life of God in you. Think, act, and live as one who’s filled with eternal life. Every now and then, affirm that you have the divine life. It’s incorruptible and can&#x27;t be tainted or defiled by sickness, disease, failure, death or the devil. </p>
<p>If as a Christian, you’ve been sick and praying, “Oh God, please take away this sickness from me.” That may not change anything, because He already did when He gave you eternal life. Before God, you’re already perfect even though you might be going through trials, pains and difficulties. In His sight, there’s nothing wrong with you. </p>
<p>Therefore, align yourself with His thoughts and visions through the Word and declare, “I’m perfected in Christ Jesus; I refuse to accommodate any sickness, disease or pain in my body because I have the life of God in me! I’ve taken hold of eternal life.” You’re an associate of the God-kind; live in this consciousness and be who you are in Christ.</p>

<p><em><strong>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205:26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 5:26</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Nobody ever talked like Jesus. He spoke the most profound and sublime words ever, with such confidence and audacity that beats the natural mind. Think about what we just read! In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 6:38</a> He said: <em>&quot;For I came down from heaven….&quot;</em> He was unapologetic about His identity and origin, and that’s how we ought to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:17</a> says, <em>“Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because <strong>as he is, so are we in this world</strong>.”</em> This is how you must think, talk, and live. Be conscious of your divine heritage and identity. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:4</a> says, <em>“Ye are of God, little children….”</em> That means you hail from God.</p>
<p>So, like the Lord Jesus, boldly affirm who you are. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:12</a>, He said, <em>&quot;...I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&quot;</em> Confidently declare the same truth about yourself because He also said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 5:14</a> AMPC, <em>&quot;You are the light of the world....&quot;</em> Be conscious of who you are in Christ; be bold to call yourself what God has called you.</p>
<p>Let your consciousness of your divinity control everything about your life. You can live as successfully as Jesus did by following His example and the principles by which He lived. Become conscious of the God-life in you and boldly speak accordingly.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A distressed lady, tormented by evil spirits and trapped in a seemingly hopeless situation was once brought to me. During this encounter, the demons identified themselves by revealing their names, reminiscent of the account in the Bible where Jesus encountered a legion of demons.</p>
<p>I commanded the devils to come out of her in the Name of Jesus, and they did. But just about twenty-four hours later, I received news that this same lady, who was free from this demonic influence, was in trouble again. I immediately called for her to be brought back to me. As soon as I saw her, I discerned that the demons had returned.</p>
<p>Again, I addressed the demons to come out of her. And they did! Praise God! Here’s something to understand: although we have authority over demons, we do not have dominion over human beings. People have the will to decide whether to invite these devils back into their lives through their choices and behaviours.</p>
<p>There’re instances when, being led by the Spirit, we issue injunctions to restrain specific demons from returning; the demons know they’re under orders not to return. Jesus exemplified this when He commanded the unclean spirit to come out of a boy and enter him no more (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 9:25</a>). Obviously, the little boy couldn’t make decisions for himself, hence Jesus barred the demon.</p>
<p>In the realm of the spirit, you sit with Christ; you occupy His place of authority with the power of attorney to use His Name. All the powers of darkness respond to, and recognize your authority in Christ. Therefore, be bold to exercise this dominion today over demons and circumstances.</p>

<p><em><strong>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:53&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 6:53</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:23-26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 11:23-26</a>, Paul shares an important revelation he received from the Lord. He recounts the events of the night the Lord Jesus was betrayed, highlighting the profound significance of the Holy Communion. Although John&#x27;s account of that night does not explicitly mention the Communion, it provides valuable insights into other significant details.</p>
<p>On that night, Paul narrates: Jesus took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to His disciples and said, &quot;Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&quot;</p>
<p>Similarly, He took the “Cup” after supper, saying, &quot;This cup is the New Testament in my blood. As often as you drink it, do it in remembrance of me.&quot; Through partaking in the Communion, we announce or proclaim the Lord&#x27;s death until He comes again: <em>&quot;For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord&#x27;s death till he come&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>).</p>
<p>The word &quot;shew&quot; in the verse above carries a profound meaning. It is translated from the Greek word &quot;kataggello,&quot; which goes beyond simply displaying or showing something. It conveys the idea of &quot;declaring&quot; or &quot;announcing.&quot; When we eat the bread and drink the cup, we’re making a formal declaration and proclamation.</p>
<p>The significance of the Communion lies in its connection to the last testament or will of Jesus Christ. The last will of a person before their death holds tremendous importance. Therefore, when we partake of the bread and cup, we&#x27;re not only participating in a symbolic act but also declaring and announcing the New Testament—the final will of the Lord.</p>
<p>In that will, Jesus bequeaths His wealth, rights, and privileges to us. He delivered everything to us. That will is now in force. The beauty of it all lies in His resurrection; the resurrection of Jesus ensures that no one can cheat us out of the blessings and provisions of His will. Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>…unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:48&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 12:48</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When you study the Book of Acts, and also Church history, you’d observe that the early Church, even though they suffered intense persecution and opposition both from the devil and human adversaries, waxed greater and stronger.</p>
<p>The early Church suffered intense persecution under Roman emperors; they were subjected to cruel tortures. Some were burnt alive and used as human torches. Some were stabbed to death; others were plunged into boiling oil, stoned and clubbed to death. Yet, the apostles and saints of the early Church endured all these and the Church outlived its enemies and detractors.</p>
<p>Remember that the early Church was still in its infancy during the great persecution. But through their prayers and faith, using the Name of Jesus, they eventually subdued Rome. Rome is gone but the Church lives on. They subdued every adversity. The impact of that seemingly “baby” Church was undeniable.</p>
<p>Now think about the fact that the early Church didn’t have the kind of knowledge and revelation of God and the Scriptures as we do today. They didn’t have the expositions of Paul or the beautiful compilations from Peter, John, and the other apostles. Yet, they did great exploits. So we have no excuse. We must do more.</p>
<p>Those who came before us, without the resources that we have today, lived faithfully and triumphantly. If they used the Name of Jesus to raze kings and kingdoms, establish God’s righteousness in the earth, what then is expected of us?</p>
<p>Do you see why you can’t and must not be quiet or complacent about your Christianity? Preach the Gospel boldly, and proclaim the Name of Jesus everywhere. This is your time. Impact your world with the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, which has been committed to your trust. Remember, to whom much is given, much is also required (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:48&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 12:48</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil (Hebrews 2:14 ASV).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%202:14&amp;version=ASV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Hebrews 2:14 ASV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When you bring something to nought, it means you make it useless, bring it to zero, nix, nothing! That’s what Jesus did to the one who had the power of death, that is, the devil. This is something very crucial for every Christian to grasp: the Lord Jesus Christ, through His death, brought Satan to nought; He crushed him!</p>
<p>Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2:15</a> reiterates this as he paints for us the picture of how Jesus engaged Satan in that awful combat in hell and defeated him and all the cohorts of darkness: <em>“And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.”</em> The Conybeare translation says, <em>“He disarmed the principalities and the powers, which fought against Him....”</em></p>
<p>The principalities and powers are disarmed, completely rendered powerless; they’re brought to nothing. Hallelujah! In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>, the Moffatt translation reveals an intriguing truth. It says, <em>“We do discuss &#x27;wisdom&#x27; with those who are mature; only it is not the wisdom of this world or of the dethroned Powers who rule this world.”</em> </p>
<p>This brings to light the reality that although these powers may hold sway in the earthly realm, they&#x27;ve been dethroned in the spiritual realms. Thus, the true power in this world resides in the matchless Name of Jesus.</p>
<p>No wonder the Bible says, <em>&quot;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:9-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 2:9-10</a>). The authority vested in His Name extends over all things. Every one of us has the privilege to employ that Name and access its inherent power. Use it against Satan, the forces of darkness and challenging circumstances, and they’ll respond to you.</p>

<p>Isn’t it instructive that the Lord Jesus didn’t say, “Preach the Gospel to human beings only?” Rather, He said, “Preach the Gospel to every creature.” It means you can proclaim God’s Word to anything and everything around you, because everything has intelligence.</p>

He spoke to a tree and it withered from its roots (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:12-14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 11:12-14</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:20-21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20-21</a>). He spoke to maimed limbs, a withered arm, and even corpses. It brings to mind the sovereign declaration of almighty God in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2017:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 17:5</a> when He said concerning Jesus, <em>“…This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.”</em></p>
<p>Everything in heaven, in the earth, and under the earth, living and non-living, have been commanded to hear and obey Jesus. This also extends to us because He’s the head and we are His body. We live in Him—in His Name and in His authority. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:17</a> says as He is, so are we in this world. We’re one with Him. Therefore, everything in life has been commanded to hear and obey us.</p>
<p>Remember the words of Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 11:23</a>, <em>“For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.”</em> You will have it if you say it.</p>
<p>Prophesy and speak the Word to everything around you. Proclaim the Word to your money and the things you own. Put this principle to work and you’ll always have testimonies.</p>

<p><em><strong>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%206:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Timothy 6:12</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Spirit, through the Apostle Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:16</a>, instructs us to use an amazing arsenal of the spirit—faith: <em>&quot;Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.&quot;</em> Your faith is a shield.</p>
<p>Observe the certainty of the Spirit’s communication: He says with the shield of faith, you shall be able to extinguish ALL the fiery darts of the wicked. So, don&#x27;t say, “Lord, the trials became too much and I didn’t know what to do, so I gave up.” No! Don’t quit. Don’t cower. Use your faith. Faith always wins.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how or from what direction the devil throws his darts at you; use your shield of faith. The “darts” could create some trouble or pain in your body; stand your ground. Extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked with your shield of faith. And while at it, remember the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:17</a>).</p>
<p>The sword of the Spirit is the Word of God from your lips. It doesn&#x27;t matter the debilitating challenges in your life; don&#x27;t be quiet. Keep affirming the Word. Just as the Word prevailed in Ephesus (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 19:20</a>), it’ll prevail over that predicament.

<p><em><strong>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us (</strong></em><a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Ephesians%203:20%20kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 3:20</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, reveals the limitless power available to us. In <a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Colossians%201:27%20kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:27</a>, he tells us, <em>&quot;To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&quot;</em> Christ in you is all the power you need. Glory to God!</p>
<p>I want you to observe something in the opening text again: <em>“…according to the power that <strong>worketh in us</strong>.”</em> Then, <a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/2%20Corinthians%204:7%20kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 4:7</a> says, *“But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.”*The power is in you. Christ is in you. Christ in you is all the power you need for any change or transformation you desire in any area of your life.</p>
<p>If you’re a Pastor, for example, and you desire a transformation in your church, and to operate at higher levels of ministry, the power to make it happen is within you. The Bible says out of your heart shall flow rivers of living water (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 7:38</a>).</p>
<p>Life issues from your heart (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 4:23</a>); all the prosperity, blessings and abundance you could ever imagine, require or desire are in your heart. How do you activate that power to work for you? It’s by consciously meditating on the Word and speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>You can bring that power to bear today on anything or any area of your life. It brings to mind the words of the Master in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2017:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 17:20</a>: <em>“…nothing shall be impossible unto you.”</em> You can do anything, be anything, and get anything.

<p><em><strong>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 1:27</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Observe the powerful construction in the verse above; it says, “Christ in you, the hope of glory.” It doesn’t say, “Christ with you” or “Christ from Heaven&quot;; rather, it says, &quot;Christ in you.” This is the mystery—a revelation that remains consistent throughout Scriptures.</p>
<p>In the book of Genesis, we read of God’s voice walking in the garden in the cool of the day, as Adam and Eve heard His voice (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3:8</a>). At various times, God appeared to individuals like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Whenever He revealed Himself, they built altars as symbols of the places where they met with Him.</p>
<p>However, such encounters were occasional; they were not in constant fellowship with Him. But God had a new plan. He revealed Himself to Moses and introduced His Name as Jehovah—the Lord in the camp—God among His people. He instructed Moses to build a tent, where He would meet with them. The glory of the Lord entered the Tabernacle, and Moses communed with God there.</p>
<p>As they journeyed, the tabernacle was carried with them, symbolizing the presence of the Lord. Later, David desired to build a permanent house for God, but God gave the plans to Solomon, David&#x27;s son. Solomon constructed the magnificent temple, and when it was completed, God filled it with His glory (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Chronicles%207:1-3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Chronicles 7:1-3</a>).</p>
<p>But thanks be unto God; today, a greater glory than what was manifested in the temple of Solomon, a greater glory than the one Moses saw on the mountain in the presence of God resides in us. Hallelujah! The Holy Spirit who manifested as the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night, now dwells within us. O, how glorious we have become!</p>

<p><em><strong>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us… hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:4-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 2:4-6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>To be seated with Christ in the heavenly realms means you’ve been exalted to the highest position of authority, dominion and power. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:21</a> gives further insight into your exalted position in Christ. It describes where you are as, <em>“Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named….”</em> How profound this is!</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus has been set far above all the different classes of spiritual beings—principalities, powers, might or thrones, dominions and every name that is named—and you’re in Him. The Father set Him in this high place of glory, placed all things under His feet, and legally declared Him to be the head over all things for the benefit of the Church (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22-23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>).</p>
<p>The Church is His body; therefore, you’re elevated with Him in glory. Someone might say, “Isn  ’t that going too far? Should we really think so highly of ourselves?” Emphatically yes! We didn’t ask for it; it’s the result of His grace and love. Read our opening scripture again.</p>
<p>What the Bible says is that you shouldn’t think of yourself more highly than you ought to think (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12:3</a>). God wants you to think highly of yourself but not more highly than you ought to think. In other words, don’t think you’re higher than your fellow brothers or sisters in Christ, because we’re all together in this exalted place in Christ. We’re all equal, and valuable to God. We’re chosen, royal and peculiar.</p>
<p>See how Paul describes it in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:6&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:6 AMPC</a>: <em>“And He raised us up together with Him and made us sit down together [giving us joint seating with Him] in the heavenly sphere [by virtue of our being] in Christ Jesus (the Messiah, the Anointed One).”</em> Hallelujah! How could you read this and not think highly of yourself? You’re exalted with Him in glory; it’s a joint sitting in the heavenly sphere.</p>

<p><em><strong>…God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 12:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Observe what our opening verse says: God has given to every man the measure of faith. He’s already done it. Each one of us was given the same measure of faith when we received the Gospel. </p>
<p>According to the Lord Jesus, with the smallest ounce of faith, you can do the impossible: <em>“…verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2017:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 17:20</a>). But what is faith? How does the Bible define faith?</p>
<p>The answer is in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:1&amp;version=ampc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 11:1</a>. It says, <em>“Now faith is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things [we] hope for, being the proof of things [we] do not see…”</em> (AMPC). How does faith come? It’s through the Word: <em>“So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 10:17</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord doesn’t want you to remain at the level of small faith; He wants your faith to grow and be strong. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 10:17</a> tells us that faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God. The emphasis is on “hearing,” that is, the continued bombardment of your spirit with the Word of God. But the way to build your faith strong and make it effective is by exercising it, that is, acting on the Word.</p>
<p>Your faith will be weak if you don’t exercise it. Weak faith causes people to stagger, and as a result, fear grips them and they&#x27;re defeated by the crisis of life. However, the cure for weak faith is putting the Word to work, acting on the Word.</p>
<p>The Bible says about Abraham, <em>“He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 4:20</a>). Build your faith strong by using it even in the seemingly small or simple matters of life. Exercise your faith all the time. Act on the Word, and build your faith strong.</p>

<p><em><strong>…O Nebuchadnezzar…our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.

<p><em><strong>…O Nebuchadnezzar…our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%203:16-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Daniel 3:16-18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were threatened by the government of the day to bow down to the king&#x27;s golden image or burn in the fiery furnace. They refused to compromise, choosing rather to die than to cower. Their inspiring statement of conviction and absolute commitment to the Lord is what we read in our theme scripture.</p>
<p>Their unwavering faith in God infuriated the king who ordered that they be thrown into the fiery furnace. The fire was so intense that it burnt and killed the men that threw them in. Howbeit, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were unscathed. The Lord protected them.</p>
<p>When Nebuchadnezzar noticed they were unhurt by the blazing furnace, he repented and declared, <em>“…Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him…Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%203:28-29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel 3:28-29</a>).</p>
<p>That’s what happens when you stand your ground in faith, in spite of fierce and daunting opposition. Soon enough, your detractors will be inspired by your faith and convictions, which could lead to their salvation. So, serve God with your life.</p>
<p>Your job may be taken away from you for preaching the Gospel, but they can’t take away the joy of the Lord that’s in your spirit. They may liquidate your company, but they can’t liquidate your spirit. God is able! Trust Him. Never find yourself apologetic, intimidated, or reluctant to express your convictions about Christ and the message of the Gospel. He’s greater than any government, institution or power. He’s the Monarch of the universe.</p>
<p>Therefore, stand your ground for Him in faith. Take a cue from Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.</p>

<p><em><strong>For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%206:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Hebrews 6:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2014:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 14:23</a> that there’s profit in all labour. Everything you do or sacrifice for the sake of the Gospel is recorded (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Malachi%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malachi 3:16</a>), and the Lord also rewards you for it. This gave me immense joy decades ago when the Lord showed me that He’s not unrighteous to forget my work or labour of love.</p>
<p>I had been told I was wasting my time and my life for preaching the Gospel and holding crusades in remote villages. But then I saw our opening verse and wept for joy. I praised, screamed, and worshipped the Lord.</p>
<p>There’re times you’re about the Lord’s work and there seem to be persecutions from all angles. And it’s as though you’re wasting your time and wasting your life; at such times, always remember that God isn’t unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love.</p>
<p>He’ll reward you for all that you do and have done in the propagation of the Gospel. He&#x27;ll reward you for all your prayers for souls to be saved, your financial contributions to the spread of the Gospel, your personal evangelical efforts to win souls to Christ, and all your sacrifices.</p>
<p>Remember the words of Jesus: <em>&quot;…Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel&#x27;s, But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2010:29-30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 10:29-30</a>). Your blessing isn&#x27;t deferred until you get to heaven; it begins here on earth.</p>
<p>Whatever you’re doing for the Lord, keep at it. Keep spreading His Word. Keep spreading His righteousness. Keep impacting your world with His glory. Remain steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:58&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:32&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 20:32</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Did you notice that the Bible doesn’t tell you to build yourself with the Word; it says the Word will build you. So, all you have to do is digest the Word; have it inside you so that you can talk it and live it. The Bible says, <em>“Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:16</a>).</p>
<p>Not only is the Word able to build you up, it’s able to give you an inheritance. Maybe your friend got a large inheritance from his grandfather that made him rich, but you didn’t quite get anything from yours; it makes no difference. Your inheritance in Christ supersedes and outclasses any inheritance you could ever get in this world.</p>
<p>As an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ, you’re the inheritor of everything God owns, which includes the whole world. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2024:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 24:1</a> says, <em>“The earth is the LORD&#x27;S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.”</em> In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Haggai%202:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haggai 2:8</a>, He said, <em>“The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.”</em></p>
<p>Also, read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2050:10-12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 50:10-12</a>; the Lord said, “<em>For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine…for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.”</em> This should give you an idea of your inheritance in Christ.</p>
<p>The inheritance was given to you in Christ Jesus the moment you were born again. You were given all things that pertain to life and godliness. But Satan, being a rebel, may try to cheat you out of God’s best. Stand your ground and keep your focus on the Word of God. Every so often, declare, “I’m what God says I am, and I have what God says I have. The whole world is mine. Glory to God!”</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you (Matthew 7:7).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 7:7</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In our opening verse, the Lord tells us to do three things: To ask, seek, and knock. This seems to suggest a difference between the three of them. When you study the Bible, you’ll clearly see the difference.</p>
<p>Jesus said*, “For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened”* (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 7:8</a>). When you ask, it’s either you’re asking God or you’re making a demand on the basis of your faith. Like when the Lord says, <em>“Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%202:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 2:8</a>). He says when you ask, you’ll receive.</p>
<p>In seeking, you’re not asking anybody; you’re actually in pursuit of something. For instance, you may be seeking knowledge or information on a subject matter. You may even be seeking opportunities in a certain industry. He says, “seek, and ye shall find.” Seek, and you’ll get it.</p>
<p>Imagine that you asked the Lord for your community and He gave it to you. Even though you’ve received it in your spirit, you still have to go out as an act of faith to get it. That’s what the Master did: <em>“For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2019:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 19:10</a>). As you go out and take your steps by faith, you’ll find what you’re looking for.</p>
<p>“Knock” teaches importunity in prayer. Jesus gave an example of a certain man who had a friend come to him at midnight. He didn’t have bread to give him, so he went to knock on another friend’s door to ask for bread. His friend refused to get up because he and his family had already gone to bed, but the man didn’t stop knocking.</p>
<p>Then, Jesus said, <em>“I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2011:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 11:8</a>). Jesus used these three to teach His disciples never to give up, and that faith works.</p>

<p><em><strong>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries (1 Corinthians 14:2).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 14:2</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Recall the account in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 10</a> of Peter ministering in the house of Cornelius. The Bible says, <em>“While Peter was still speaking...the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the message. And the believers from among the circumcised [the Jews] who came with Peter were surprised and amazed, because the free gift of the Holy Spirit had been bestowed and poured out largely even on the Gentiles. <strong>For they heard them talking in [unknown] tongues (languages) and extolling and magnifying God...”</strong></em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010:44-46&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 10:44-46 AMPC</a>).</p>
<p>Notice the latter part; the people were praising— extolling and magnifying God—as they spoke in other tongues. When you praise the Lord from your spirit like that, His glory will be manifested in your behalf. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 16:25</a> says Paul and Silas, in prison, prayed and sang praises unto God and as they did, there was a miracle in the prison; they were supernaturally released.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while you’re praying in other tongues, besides praise or prophetic revelation, some of those tongues could also be coming forth through your spirit as intercession. This means that at such moments, in the spirit, you&#x27;re praying for someone or some group; it could be your country, your city, or the Church.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, it could go from speaking in tongues into deep sighs and groanings, and you can’t explain it, except the Holy Spirit interprets to you in your understanding what the prayer is about. These and more could happen as you pray in tongues. Glory to God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Where is your faith?... (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 8:25</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, as long as you’re under the cover of someone else, that person may exercise authority over you and your circumstances and it&#x27;ll produce results, to a certain degree. For example, as a young Christian many years ago, I went on a trip with a friend of mine and a couple of others. We had some preaching engagements.</p>
<p>This happened at a time when I used to experience serious stomach problems. So while we were on this trip, I wouldn&#x27;t eat anything because I would throw up whatever I ate within a few minutes of eating it. I had to watch others eat until my friend, who couldn’t take it anymore, asked me: “Are you fasting?”</p>
<p>I opened up and explained the situation to him and he said to me, “In that case, as long as we’re together on this trip, you’ll not have any problem with your stomach; eat.” I yielded myself immediately to his words, more like riding on his faith, and started eating normally.</p>
<p>And guess what? There was no problem throughout the trip. But when I got back home, the very first thing I’d eat, I threw it all up. The stomach trouble resurfaced. I understood exactly what happened. I submitted myself to my friend’s authority throughout that journey, and it worked.</p>
<p>But there’s just how far such faith can go in helping you deal with life’s issues. I realized I had to put my own faith to work and when I did, I got the victory. You’ve got to keep growing your own faith by increasing your knowledge of the Word and strengthening it by putting it to work. Life is spiritual and you’re responsible for your life—the things that happen with you.</p>
<p>When the disciples ran to Jesus in desperation during the turmoil on the sea, as read in our theme verse, Jesus asked them, “Where is your faith?” He made them realize they could have done something about the situation without necessarily coming to Him.</p>
<p>It makes no difference what has happened or is happening with your finances, job, health or in any area of your life; don’t fret or cry for help! Use your faith. Declare words of faith. The Bible says, <em>“Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 11:3</a>).</p>
<p>With your faith affirmations, you can repair, arrange and reconstruct things and circumstances to synchronize with God’s perfect will for your life.</p>

<p><em><strong>He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20107:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 107:20</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>

<p>Most times, people become sick when an outside force attacks their bodies. It could be a virus or germ, which is a spirit of infirmity. “Spirit of infirmity” refers to anything from very small entities to sizable spiritual beings; they function alike, but they&#x27;re not part of your body. They’re all external forces that can come against (attack) your body.</p>
<p>Whether it’s some bacterial, viral, or a demonic force, you ought to deal with all three of them the same way. You’ve got to repel them; otherwise, they’ll cause harm. You should never be a victim. Jesus said, <em>“…if they (Christians) drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:18</a>). Believe the words of Jesus!</p>
<p>Once any symptom shows up, that’s the time to deal with it with the Word. If you don’t act as radically as you should, the pain could become so excruciating that it becomes difficult for you to pray. Satan’s goal is for you to get weaker and weaker until you’re too weak to pray or make any confession.</p>
<p>You’ve got to act when you still can. The Bible talks about certain characters who lose their appetite for all food due to sickness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20107:17-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 107:17-18</a>). When people fall sick, it becomes difficult for them to eat, and as a result, they get weaker and weaker towards death.</p>
<p>Don’t wait till you get too weak to pray. Put your faith to work. Meditate on the Word of God. The Word of God is medicine to your physical body (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 4:22</a>). No wonder our theme verse says, <em>“He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.”</em></p>
<p>He didn’t send drugs; He sent His Word, because His Word produces healing and health for the sick. No matter how severe the sickness might be, just keep meditating on the Scriptures. Keep affirming your healing and health and before long, the infirmity will be repelled and you’ll come out victorious!</p>

<p><em><strong>Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me (Hebrews 13:5-6).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:5-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Hebrews 13:5-6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening scripture is very insightful. It unveils a profound principle in the concluding part of the 6th verse. With an understanding of this principle, you hold the key to amazing possibilities: <em>“…he hath said… So that we may boldly say.”</em> In other words, God gave us His Word—He said what He said—so that we can boldly respond in agreement with Him.</p>
<p>Your response to God, to His Word, is where the blessing is. Let’s read it again: <em>“…for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:5-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 13:5-6</a>). Notice it doesn’t say, “He hath said, so that you might quietly say”; no! You’re to boldly affirm His Word.</p>
<p>Faith is boldly affirming what He has said! In this context, you declare “The Lord is helping me right now; He has said &#x27;I will not leave you helpless.&#x27; Therefore, I’m helped from heaven; I’m helped from above!” When you respond this way on the basis of what He has said, you’ll always win.</p>
<p>For example, Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 28:20</a>, “…lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the age.” I therefore boldly declare that the Lord is with me; therefore I have no fear but walk in favour, victory and dominion always and in all things.</p>
<p>Even now, release words on the basis of what God has said. Declare, “I’m abundantly supplied (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>). I have everything I require for life and godliness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3</a>). No weapon fashioned against me shall prosper, and I can do all things through Christ that strengthens me. Amen.&quot; Such declarations activate your dominion and position you above the forces of this world.</p>

<p><em><strong>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may KNOW him that is true… (1 John 5:20).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may KNOW him that is true… (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 5:20</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Greek word translated “know” above is “Ginosko.” It’s a kind of knowledge gained by revelation or impartation. For example, being born again, we have the witness in our spirits that we’re the children of God (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:16-17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:16-17</a>). Having received eternal life from Jesus Christ, there’s a knowledge in your heart that God is your Father. This isn’t an assumption; it’s knowledge imparted to us by the Holy Spirit that we’re born of God. We’re heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.</p>
<p>How could you be broke, or live an ordinary life, with the knowledge that you’re a joint heir with Christ? Being a joint heir with Christ means everything that belongs to Jesus Christ belongs to you in the same way that it belongs to Him. He doesn’t own any more of it than you do.</p>
<p>Also, through the same knowledge of God in our spirits, we’ve come to realize that nothing can work to our disadvantage. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:28</a>­ says, <em>&quot;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God….”</em> Notice the phrase “we know,&quot; meaning that the knowledge is absolute. This isn’t an assumption.</p>
<p>The knowledge that we’ve overcome the world is in our spirits; we’re more than conquerors and victors in Christ Jesus. It doesn&#x27;t matter how dark and gloomy things get; be unruffled. The knowledge we have and by which we live is beyond the senses.</p>
<p>Likewise, when we pray, our prayers transcend the arena of assumptions. Our prayers produce results because of our deep and intimate knowledge of the One to whom we pray. Our relationship with Him is based on our knowledge of Him; it transcends religious rituals and formulas.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we pray about something, it’s because we’re confident that it’s in accordance with the Father&#x27;s will. If it’s not His will, we don’t desire to pursue it. Our knowledge of Him causes us to trust Him completely, following His guidance.</p>

<p>The new creature in our opening verse, is a new type of man, a mystery to the world. He’s the dream of the Father. Being born again, you’re not like anything the world has seen before. You’re the first and the best of everything that God made (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:18</a>).

<p>Death, sickness, disease and everything of darkness can’t, and shouldn’t, reign in your physical body, because your human life was supplanted by God’s divine life. You live by the Spirit now, not by blood: <em>“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:12-13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:12-13</a>). This is the amazing life of the new man in Christ!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%206:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 6:16</a> says, <em>“…for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them….”</em> God’s dream from the foundation of the world is fulfilled in the new man in Christ. The mystery that was hidden from ages and generations has now been made manifest, and fulfilled in us. That mystery is Christ in you, the hope of glory (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:26-27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:26-27</a>). Hallelujah! What does this mean to you even now? It means you ought to walk in the fullness of the blessings of the Gospel of Christ.

<p><em><strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s nothing you could ever need or desire for a godly life that’s not already yours. But the way to make all that’s already yours in Christ a reality in your life is a function of your knowledge of Him. Read our theme scripture again: it’s about your knowledge of Him. This kind of knowledge is full, exact knowledge— “epignosis” (Greek).</p>
<p>God’s provisions aren’t going to come to pass in your life just because they’re written in the pages of the Bible; there’s a knowledge of Him that you must have, knowledge that unites the knower with that which is known.</p>
<p>Something so beautiful and powerful about knowing Him is that not only do you get to know and are able to appropriate all that He’s given to you, but you also get to know yourself. The more you know Him, the more you know yourself. His Word mirrors you; in Him, you see you. You can never really know yourself as God knows you until you know Him.</p>
<p>The way to know Him, and get to discover you, is to study and meditate on the Word. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 3:18</a> shows the Word to be the mirror of God that reveals your true description. It says, <em>“…we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.”</em></p>
<p>Search and discover who you really are by looking into the mirror of God; by getting to know the Lord. The moment you get a hold of what the Word says is yours, or who the Word says you are, respond by affirming accordingly. That’s how you endorse His Word to come to pass in your life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:3</a> says God has blessed you with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 3:21</a> declares, <em>“…all things are yours.”</em> God has given you everything you require to live victoriously and be a success in life.</p>

<p><em><strong>...The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working] (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205:16&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>James 5:16 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening verse is quite instructive. It says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available, dynamic in its working. Who is a righteous man? That’s you!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:21</a> tells us that God has made you righteous. In the mind of God, you are as righteous as Jesus is righteous because the righteousness that you have is the righteousness of Jesus Christ. Blessed be God!</p>
<p>In the 17th verse of James chapter 5, Elijah is cited as an example of a righteous man whose prayer was effective: <em>“Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.”</em></p>
<p>Elijah prayed that way because of the sins of the nation. The nation had regressed and turned to the worship of Baal. So, he prayed for a change and one of the things he wanted was for there to be no rain for three and half years, to get the people&#x27;s attention.</p>
<p>When the people repented, the Bible says Elijah prayed again, and the heavens gave rain. We can make remarkable changes through prayer that even heaven will respond.</p>
<p>Elijah&#x27;s prayer was deeply heartfelt and continued; he displayed unyielding persistence. That’s how you pray when you’re set to effect changes. You don’t give up; you don’t give in. You persist until there’s a change.</p>

<p><em><strong>Despise not prophesyings (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:20</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Apostle Paul’s defense of the Gospel before King Agrippa and Bernice, as recorded in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 26</a>, Paul emphasized the importance of prophecy. He did it by confronting King Agrippa with a direct question. He asked him*, &quot;King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest&quot;* (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 26:27</a>).</p>
<p>Paul challenged Agrippa&#x27;s understanding and faith in the prophecies regarding the coming of the Messiah. God’s only proof for the people at the time was prophecy. There were so many prophecies about the Saviour—the Messiah—and they had to keep searching the Scriptures for these prophecies. They had to turn to the words of the prophets.</p>
<p>For example, the prophet Isaiah had prophesied, <em>&quot;Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%207:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 7:14</a>). In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%209:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 9:6</a>, he further prophesied*, &quot;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&quot;*</p>
<p>Prophecy is like a guiding light. Our opening verse charges us not to despise prophecies. The prophetic words of scripture and of the Spirit are important. The same Paul who asked the king Agrippa the question above said to Timothy, <em>“This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%201:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 1:18</a>).</p>
<p>Like Timothy, trust the prophetic words of Scripture and the prophetic words of the Spirit to you, and use them to make war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (Romans 8:11).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:11</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In relation to our opening scripture above, an important question to ask would be, does the Holy Spirit live in you? If the answer is yes, then it means the Holy Spirit has given life to your hitherto death-doomed or death-prone body. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>That means there’s no death in your body. Life works in you. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of life; He’s the life-giver, and because He lives in you, He has given life to your physical body.</p>
<p>Often, we say the Christian isn’t an ordinary person; he’s one with the Lord, on the same mission and purpose with the Lord. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:10</a>, the Lord Jesus declared, “…I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” He came to give eternal life to those who would believe in Him.</p>
<p>Now that you’re born again, you’ve become one spirit with the Lord (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>). The Bible calls Jesus, “a life-giving Spirit.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:45-47&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 15:45-47 NIV</a> says, “So it is written: <em>&quot;The first man Adam became a living being&quot;; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven.”</em></p>
<p>That also makes you a life-giving spirit, because as He is, so are you (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:17</a>). Not only has He made you a partaker of His life, you’re also a dispenser or distributor of eternal life. It’s your life’s purpose to bring the lost into the life of righteousness through the Gospel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%201:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 1:10</a> lets us know that Jesus Christ has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel. Eternal life is unveiled through the preaching of the Gospel. As people listen to you preach, eternal life, which encompasses salvation, prosperity and the righteousness of God is unveiled to them.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 20:21</a>, <em>“…as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.”</em> He’s chosen you to manifest the God-life to the nations. He sent you as a bearer of His Gospel, to bring others into the glorious life in Christ. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof (Proverbs 18:21).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Proverbs 18:21</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>As a Christian, never speak death. Speak life only. Your words rule your life; they control your future. Who you are today, what you’ve become, is the result of your words. That’s the reason you must train yourself to talk right.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%206:1-2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 6:1-2</a> says, “My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.” Those who have found themselves in certain precarious situations are snared, taken captive, or bound by their words.</p>
<p>Our affirmations rule our lives; they affect us. So, when it comes to words, never say anything that’s inconsistent with the Word of God about your life. For example, never jokingly say something that is against your body or your life, because you’re going to have what you say (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2011:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 11:23</a>).</p>
<p>If you speak death, you’re going to have death! On the other hand, if you speak health, prosperity, strength, courage and life, that’s what you’ll have! The same way you can build your life with your words, you can destroy your works with your own mouth.</p>
<p>The Bible says, “A man&#x27;s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018:20-21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 18:20-21</a>). When it says, “A man&#x27;s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth,” it’s referring to words!</p>
<p>Notice also it says, “And with the increase of his lips shall he be filled…”; that’s referring to the words of wisdom pouring out of your mouth. Speak life to your finances, your home, your children, your business or job; speak righteousness to your nation and peace within its borders. Always remember that your words are infused with divine energy to create new and glorious realities, transform circumstances, and change situations to conform to God’s provisions, plans, and purpose for you in Christ.</p>

<p><em><strong>We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak (2 Corinthians 4:13).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 4:13</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’re those who complain, “I thought this faith thing works! I believe in the Word for my health, why isn’t it working?” For such people, it could be that they’ve only mentally assented to the Word; that’s not what works. True faith is of the heart.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 1:16</a> tells us that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is the power of God that works; in other words, it brings or causes salvation for everyone who believes. The one who doesn’t believe it can’t have the benefit of it, and believing is of the heart and not the head (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:8-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 10:8-10</a>). It’s your spirit that makes contact with God.</p>
<p>Faith is not a response of the brain or the mind; it’s not some kind of magic or a formula, no! Faith is the response of the human spirit to the Word of God. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206:6-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 6:6-10</a>, for example, when Jesus encountered a man with a withered arm while teaching in a synagogue, He instructed the man to stretch out his hand, which he did, and his hand was restored.</p>
<p>There’s no way the man would have received a miracle if he had tried to rationalize the Master’s instruction in his head. But he responded with his spirit to the Word! The man heard Jesus in his spirit and acted from his spirit.</p>
<p>It reminds of a similar account in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 2</a> when the Lord Jesus healed a man sick of the palsy. He said to the man, <em>“…Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 2:11</a>). The hitherto paralyzed man stood up and walked away, offering praises to God.</p>
<p>The man couldn’t have risen unless he responded from his spirit. You see, his spirit wasn&#x27;t crippled, as the ailment or infirmity resided in his body. So, how could a man with that condition have risen? The answer is simple: When he heard the words of the Master, he acted from his spirit, and it produced results. Once you can believe the Word with your heart and voice it from your mouth, it’ll produce results. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds. Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20149:5-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 149:5-6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20149:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 149:5</a> exhorts the saints to be joyful in glory and sing aloud upon their beds. The ensuing verse 6 says, <em>&quot;Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand.&quot;</em> This is a prophecy from the Old Testament, and you have to understand that the revelation of the New Testament Church was hidden from the prophets of the Old Testament. Thus, when the passage speaks of &quot;a two-edged sword in their hand,&quot; it reflects their viewpoint based on their perception of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>However, a fascinating shift takes place in the New Testament: the two-edged sword isn&#x27;t in the hand; rather, it’s in our mouths. Talking about Jesus, the Apostle John writes, <em>“And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201:15-16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 1:15-16</a>).</p>
<p>Notice it says this two-edged sword protruded from his mouth and not his hand. We don&#x27;t fight with a sword in our hand; the sword is in our mouth. Again, in Revelation 19:15, the Bible says, <em>“<strong>And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword</strong>, that with it he should smite the nations….”</em> That is remarkable.</p>
<p>In the 21st verse, it says, <em>“And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, <strong>which sword proceeded out of his mouth</strong>: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh”</em> (Revelation 19:21). This sword is the prophetic Word of God in your mouth. That’s our weapon of war today in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 51:20 says, <em>“Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms.”</em> With the Word on our lips, we cut the enemy asunder. We paralyze all the works of the devil everywhere. Blessed be God!</p>
