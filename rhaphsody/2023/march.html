<p><em><strong>Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness (Isaiah 41:10).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2041:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Isaiah 41:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The words we just read in our opening scripture are quite inspiring and profound; amazing promises for Israel. While the fulfilment for Israel would be at the millennial reign of Christ, we presently live in and enjoy those blessings as the Church of Jesus Christ. They’re our reality in Christ Jesus, NOW!</p>
<p>We’re fearless and walk in dominion because the Lord is our God; He’s our strength; we’re marvellously helped of Him. We’re upheld by the right hand of His righteousness. The right hand of His righteousness refers to Christ. And Christ is our righteousness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2054:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 54:17</a>, He says <em>“No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper….This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.”</em> This is part of the blessings of being His righteousness and walking in righteousness.</p>
<p>There’s more. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2045:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 45:24</a>, the Bible says, <em>“Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.&quot;</em> Think about that! It says all your adversaries shall be ashamed. Anyone who’s incensed against you shall be mortified; disgraced. It’s the Word of the Lord.</p>
<p>Then in the twelfth verse of Isaiah 41, the Lord says concerning your adversaries, <em>“Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing….”</em> This is your heritage because you walk in His righteousness!</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2051:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 51:7</a>, He tells us never to be perturbed by the reproach of men. The Word already declared the end of their actions: they’d be abased and brought to shame! Yours is to keep walking in righteousness, bearing fruits of righteousness. The Bible says, <em>“In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come near thee”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2054:14&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 54:14</a>). Glory to God! This is your life. Walk in the light of it.</p>

<p><em><strong>Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%207:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 7:4</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Is it possible to be joyful in tribulation? Emphatically yes! That’s our life in Christianity; it makes no difference what we face, we’re unruffled and full of joy because we know the end from the beginning! We always win.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 4:17</a> says, <em>“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.”</em> This is God’s Word; it can’t be overturned. No wonder James said, “Count it all joy when you go through diverse tests” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:2</a>).</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how severe the pressures get, we never say, “I can’t take it anymore.” Rather, we stand strong and unmoveable. We never get flustered, because it’s our nature to triumph. We endure hardness with cheerfulness; we’re <em>“Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:11</a>). Glory to God!</p>
<p>Always remember that the adversities of life are the opportunities for your greatness to be tested and manifested. Therefore, in the face of opposition, always declare, “Greater is He that’s in me, than he that’s in the world!”</p>
<p>Victory is in your spirit. This was the understanding of the Apostle Paul when he said, “I rejoice in my infirmities; I welcome trouble” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2012:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>). Have the same consciousness. Welcome challenges! Christ lives in you! With His Word in your heart and in your mouth, you’ll withstand any test and always prevail. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 6:19</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>If you truly believe that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, then that should be the end of sickness or disease in your physical body. You have to consciously meditate on the fact that the Holy Spirit vitally and literally lives in you. He perambulates your body to keep it healthy.</p>
<p>Your health was perfected when Christ took up His abode in you. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20138:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 138:8</a>, the psalmist prophesied, <em>“The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me….”</em> This has become a reality in Christ Jesus. Your health has been perfected in Him. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Part of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in you, and His impact on your physical body is to see to it that your body stays perfected in health. It’s the reason He guides you to nurture your spirit, soul, and body with the Word. It’s the reason He guides you with wisdom on healthy living. </p>
<p>So, take charge of your health and rule over your body with the Word of God. Refuse to yield to sickness. Divine health is your birthright and nature in Christ. Choose to be healthy and strong every day. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:5</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s nothing you might be experiencing today that’s a surprise to God. He knew you and knew everything about your life before you came into this world. He planned your life excellently for His glory. Therefore, let nothing discourage you. Trust Him and be patient.</p>
<p>The Bible says He foreknew and predestined you to be conformed to the likeness of His Son, Jesus. He prearranged your life for glory and excellence. He said to Jeremiah: <em>“Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%201:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).</p>
<p>It’s akin to what He says to us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:10 AMPC</a>: <em>“For we are God&#x27;s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].”</em></p>
<p>He already planned your life for His glory. So even when things get difficult, remain in His perfect will by staying on the Word. He has said, <em>“…all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:28</a>). This is a guarantee.</p>
<p>In your walk with the Lord, trust Him, knowing that He never fails and His timing is always perfect. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:4</a> says, <em>“But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.”</em> You need patience for a balanced, successful and stable Christian life. Keep your trust and hope in Him alive, for the Bible says those who trust in Him shall never be disappointed (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:5</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2045:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Isaiah 45:24</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s a beauty and an attraction about your life because you’re the righteousness of God. When you walk in righteousness, men will come to you to hear God’s Word, and to be imparted by His life and nature of righteousness that’s in you. </p>
<p>It reminds of what the Prophet Isaiah said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2060:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 60:3</a>, <em>“And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.”</em> Righteousness attracts! It pulls people to you who want to come to know and serve your God.</p>
<p>Thanks be unto God that this righteousness isn’t something you strive to attain; it’s God’s blessing and gift to you in Christ. That gift of righteousness was activated and became effectual in your life the moment you were born again.</p>
<p>Therefore, always affirm that you have the righteousness of God. This is important because of what we read in the first part of our theme verse. It says, <em>“Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and strength….”</em> As you make that declaration, you’d find yourself bringing forth more fruits of righteousness, and producing greater works of righteousness.</p>
<p>Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 15:16</a>, <em>“Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain….”</em> You’re ordained to bear lasting fruits in soul winning; in leading others to Christ. Hallelujah! It’s part of the workings of the righteousness of God in your life.</p>

<p><em><strong>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 6:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In Christianity, faith is our lifestyle. When the Scripture tells us to take up the shield of faith against the enemy, it means our faith is a shield. With your faith, you’ll be able to neutralize or put out all the fiery darts of the wicked one.</p>
<p>There’re fiery missiles directed at you, and they’re coming from demoniacal forces. But with your faith, you can put them out. Discouragement and anger, for instance, are missiles of the enemy. Some people could be by themselves and suddenly have anger and discouragement assault their minds. Those are darts of the enemy.</p>
<p>Some suddenly feel something like a hard object hit them from the side, yet there was no physical object or person present; that’s a fiery dart of the enemy. For some others, it comes as a sudden sharp pain somewhere in the body. But thanks be unto God! These darts from the enemy can be neutralized with your shield of faith.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:4</a>). <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 5:4</a> says, <em>“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”</em> Your faith is what you need. This is what puts you over and above Satan and the circumstances of life.</p>
<p>Remember that you don’t have to look around for a shield called faith; faith is in your spirit as Paul succinctly puts it in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12:3</a>. Keep building your faith strong by learning and acting on the Word. Irrespective of what happens around you, refuse to fear; speak the Word in faith. That’s how to use your shield of faith to put out Satan’s wiles and stratagems. Stand on God’s Word, and your victory will be as sure as the Word is. Hallelujah!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It’s important that you understand the spirituality of divine instructions. Divine instructions are for your life; so always take them seriously. A lack of understanding of spiritual truth and yielding to a fit of anger led to Moses’ grievous mistake that cost him leading the children of Israel into the Promised Land.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers%2020:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numbers 20:8</a>, God instructed Moses to speak to the rock to bring forth water for the children of Israel to drink. But when Moses got to the rock, instead of talking to the rock as God had said, he struck the rock with his rod. Water came out all right, but God was displeased with him.</p>
<p>A previous instruction to Moses in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2017:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 17:6</a> was for him to strike the rock for it to bring forth water, which he did and water came out. But this time, the rock wasn’t to be smitten a second time, because that rock was Christ ([1 Corinthians 10:4](<a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/1</a> Corinthians 10:4 kjv)). Christ was to be smitten only once; after that, you talk to Him for whatever you want.</p>
<p>Even though Moses acted in disobedience by striking the rock twice, water still came out. But it didn’t produce the result God wanted. That tells us something: It&#x27;s not about the result you want, it’s about what&#x27;s right in the sight of God. Is the Father pleased?</p>
<p>These things we read in the Scriptures are for our learning (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2015:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 15:4</a>). Practise spiritual understanding, spiritual wisdom, and walking in the Spirit. That&#x27;s your call. Only if we live this way can we please the Lord in all things. Understand the truth behind His instructions and do them. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (2 Peter 1:3).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6</a>, Jesus taught His disciples how to pray; and even though He didn’t intend for that prayer to be repeated ritualistically, He said something very profound in verse 11. He said, <em>“Give us this day our daily bread”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:11</a>).</p>
<p>Remember, this was before He brought us into the Kingdom. That means God had a plan for everybody. The word, “bread” there is symbolic; it isn’t just the staple food you prepare from a dough of flour and water. Rather, it means today’s supply; everything you require for today, to live joyfully and fulfil God’s purpose. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>When I read this many years ago, it dawned on me that I had a lot of leftover daily bread that had accumulated over time that I hadn&#x27;t taken possession of. Then I said, “In the Name of Jesus, I receive them all!” After all, the daily bread doesn’t get expired with God.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joel%202:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joel 2:25</a>, He said, <em>“And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm….”</em> If He can restore all of that, then there’s no expiration with Him.</p>
<p>So, if you’ve never taken possession of that which belongs to you since you became a Christian, that means you’ve been living a life below your status, in spite of the accumulation of wealth in your heavenly account.</p>
<p>But the good news is, you can call forth your supply even now, through your faith-filled affirmations. Our theme verse says He’s made everything available to you for life and godliness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3</a>). Call them forth in Jesus’ Name.</p>

<p>Our theme verse shows that the Word is able to regulate your mind to think right all the time; to think the Kingdom way. Someone might say, “You know I’m African, Asian, American, or European, and I think as such”; no! When you’re born again, you’re from God’s Kingdom. You’re to think as one from heaven.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12:2</a> says, <em>“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed</em>(transferred; transfigured) *by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”*Walking in God&#x27;s Word and having your mind renewed by the Word is the easiest thing for a Christian because the Word is your life.</p>
<p>You were born of the Word (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 1:23</a>); you have the life of the Word; so it’s easy for your perception, your outlook on life, to be from the Word.

<p><em><strong>Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 14:30</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s very easy for Satan to use people in whom he’s deposited something of himself, for example, selfishness or greed. Anyone who is selfish isn’t walking in the love of God. Love rules over selfishness. God’s love is gracious. Selfishness in the heart is an invitation to satanic influence, for Satan is the author of selfishness.</p>
<p>This is why you must eschew selfishness and greed, and other traits that are consistent with Satan&#x27;s nature. Don’t allow Satan to have any of his traits in you. Jesus said, <em>“…the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:30</a>). Satan had nothing in Jesus. There was nothing Satan could lay claims to or which he could influence in Jesus.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the way it should be with you; Satan should find nothing in you that attracts him to you or that he can use to promote his agenda. It’s the reason you must walk in love at all times. Love is the antidote for selfishness and greed. Then also, speak the truth always.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%206:16-19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 6:16-19</a> highlights traits that are consistent with Satan’s nature that you must eschew. It says, <em>“These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him: A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.”</em></p>
<p>The Bible says “Give no place to the devil” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:27</a>). Don’t permit or give vent to any of his traits in your life. Walk in God’s light—His Word—and everything of Satan and darkness will be repelled from you.</p>

<p><em><strong>I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2042:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Isaiah 42:6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Isn’t it glorious that we already have and are living in the blessings that the children of Israel would enjoy as a nation at the Millennium? For example, the gift of righteousness; we were born in righteousness, but at the Millennium, they&#x27;d just begin to enjoy righteousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2023:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 23:5</a> says, <em>“Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.”</em> This is about the millennial period. The 6th verse says, <em>“In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.”</em></p>
<p>In the Millennium, the Lord will be their righteousness; they’ll come into the Millennium, not living by their own righteousness or trusting in their own righteousness but in the righteousness of the one they had nailed to the Cross. But as the Church, we already have and live as the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>It’s the same with justification. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2045:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 45:25</a>, talking about the millennial period, the Bible says, <em>“In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.”</em> They’ll come into justification at the Millennium; meanwhile, we’ve had and lived in justification for two thousand years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:1</a> says we’ve been justified; that is, declared righteous; acquitted. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:39&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 13:39</a> says by him (Jesus Christ), all that believe are justified from all things, from which they couldn’t be justified by the Law of Moses. We have and enjoy now what has been promised to the Jews in the Millennium. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:32&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 8:32</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truth liberates, uplifts, blesses and transforms. Truth inspires and energizes you. And what is truth? Truth is the Word of God. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:17</a> says, <em>“…thy Word is truth.”</em> Guiding us into all truth is the ministry of the Holy Spirit; it’s something that God wants for your life. He is the Spirit of truth. Truth is reality.</p>
<p>One day, the Lord showed me something really remarkable about knowing and walking in truth. I&#x27;ve mentioned it on different fora, but it bears repeating. It was about a man who was diagnosed with cancer and was told he had only a short time to live.</p>
<p>But when the Lord showed me the same man in a vision, He said, “Look at him; he&#x27;s been diagnosed with cancer; therefore, he believes he has cancer. But in reality, there’s no cancer.” Then I looked at the man and there was no cancer in his body.</p>
<p>That means factually, there was cancer, but when you superimpose the truth on facts, the facts will change and line up with truth. This is what many don’t realise. But that&#x27;s how to walk with God; that&#x27;s how to live with God. You superimpose His Word—the Truth—on the facts and circumstances of life.</p>
<p>It brings to mind what <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 4:18</a> says: <em>“…for the things which are seen are temporal…”</em>; that means they’re subject to change. The growth or tumour may be there, but the Word of God—which is the TRUTH and the reality—says you&#x27;re perfected in Christ.</p>
<p>Take your eyes away from facts; fix your gaze on truth, on the reality of God&#x27;s Word, which confirms and guarantees your victory, divine health, prosperity, dominion, and glorious life in Christ. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you (Luke 10:19).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 10:19</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The word “power” is referenced twice in the verse above. But they don’t exactly mean the same thing. In the first reference where it says, “Behold I give unto you power,” it’s translated from the Greek, “exousia”, which means authority. The second one is from “dunamis” (Greek), which means power, ability, or &quot;working.&quot; Jesus gave us absolute authority over the power, ability or workings of the adversary.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s a difference between authority and ability. Let’s take the president of your country as an example. In his personal capacity, he can’t withstand the army of his country. But he’s got the authority of the state behind him! Therefore, when he exercises supreme command and control over his armed force or the military, they have to comply!</p>
<p>With all their weapons of war, the entire armed forces are at the president’s bidding; when he gives an instruction, they’re obligated to obey. They have power, weight or substance; but the president has authority. Authority changes everything.</p>
<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much power or force the enemy wields or can gather; you’ve been given authority over him in Jesus’ Name. The Bible says His Name is <em>“high above all other government and authority and power and dominion, and every title of sovereignty used either in this Age or in the Age to come&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:21&amp;version=WNT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:21 WNT</a>). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>When this same Jesus tells you, “nothing shall by any means hurt you,” you better believe and act on it. Read what He tells us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:4</a>: <em>“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”</em> Glorious news!</p>
<p>No wonder the Psalmist affirmed, <em>“The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2027:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 27:1</a>). You have nothing to fear in this life. Reign and rule in the Name of Jesus every day. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 1:30</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>As a Christian, the favour of God upon your life has distinguished and qualified you to be the head and not the tail, to be the best and receive the best. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%205:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 5:12</a> says, <em>“For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.”</em> </p>
<p>In your life, be forever conscious that you’re divinely favoured. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:6</a> says He has made us accepted in the beloved. The word, &quot;accepted&quot; there is the Greek, “charitoo” which refers to being highly favoured.</p>
<p>It’s the same word that the angel brought to Mary in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201:28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 1:28</a>: <em>“And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art <strong>highly favoured</strong>, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.”</em> If the angel were to come to you today, he’ll use the same expressions, because it&#x27;s already written concerning you that you’re blessed and highly favoured!</p>
<p>This is what Paul was telling the Christians in Corinth in our theme verse when he called them sanctified. The word, “sanctification” is from the Greek “hagiasmos” and it means to be separated unto God, to be distinguished in Christ. You’ve become friends with God.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202:52&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 2:52</a> says concerning the Master, <em>“And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.”</em> Did you know that the same is true about you? You have favour with God and with man. Therefore, in your life, welcome favours every day. Your life has been beautified with divine favours from God. Affirm this every day about yourself. Hallelujah!</p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Peter 5:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Every Christian who is effective in soul winning and the spread of the Gospel around the world is marked by God for blessings. Satan also targets such saints. If you&#x27;re a good giver in the house of God, for example, just as Heaven and the angels mark you for blessings, Satan also marks you for attacks.</p>
<p>What does Satan attack? What does he go for? It&#x27;s not just your job; he knows you&#x27;re not sponsoring the Gospel just because you have a good job. It&#x27;s not your money either, for he knows if he attacks your finances, you can always get more. What he goes for is the Word of God in your life. He knows that that’s your secret; he knows the Word is your inspiration and strength.</p>
<p>You weren’t committed to the things of God and to giving financially in the house of God until you heard the Word that changed your life and made you commit your life and resources to the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. So, it’s about the Word! The devil will try to take the Word away from you or discourage you. He’ll try to keep you away from the church or cause trouble between you and whoever teaches you the Word.</p>
<p>As the opening verse says, <em>“Be sober, be vigilant…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 5:8</a>). Guard the Word in your heart. Always drive it deep into your spirit through meditation. Continue evermore in the fellowship where the Word is being taught you, rejoicing in the Lord always.</p>
<p>The more committed you are to the things of God and in the house of God, the more vigilant you ought to be in the spirit, walking in love and humility. Keep increasing in the knowledge of God’s Word, and speak in tongues often. Be filled with the Spirit, and your spiritual alertness and sensitivity will always be at its peak.</p>

<p><em><strong>God has put all things under the authority of Christ and has made him head over all things for the benefit of the church (Ephesians 1:22 NLT).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>God has put all things under the authority of Christ and has made him head over all things for the benefit of the church (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22&amp;version=NLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:22 NLT</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ is a mighty, indomitable force. No institution, power, government or entity can stand against it. This is because the dominion and rulership of Jesus over principalities and powers; over every ruler, authority, government, and realm of power in existence, is for the benefit of the Church.</p>
<p>The Church is enthroned with Him. We should be fully aware of our authority in Christ. The Bible says about Jesus, <em>“Now he is far above any ruler or authority or power or leader or anything else—not only in this world but also in the world to come”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:21&amp;version=NLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:21 NLT</a>).</p>
<p>The 22nd verse is what we read in our theme verse. It says, <em>“God has put all things under the authority of Christ and has made him head over all things for the benefit of the church”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22&amp;version=NLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:22 NLT</a>). God gave Christ this authority for the benefit of the Church. He’s already done it! All the title and power given to Jesus will be of no use if we (the Church) don’t use it. It’s ours to use. He gave us His Name so that we could use it to keep Satan in check, and prevail over circumstances.</p>
<p>He has put us in charge of this world, to tame it and overwhelm it with His righteousness, glory and grace. This is why you should affirm every day, “I reign and rule over Satan and the elements of this world!” Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Refuse to be overwhelmed by anything in life; use the authority of Jesus. Use His Name. All authority is vested in His Name; use it every day.</p>

<p>In these last days, the strategy of the enemy is to destroy many with fear and deception. But the way to tackle and cure the effects of deception is by making the truth known.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re so grateful to God for Rhapsody of Realities. Through it, we’re making the truth known every day, in every nation and in every known and living language of the world. Blessed be God!</p>
<p>Be a part of the great crusade of spreading the truth to the nooks and crannies of the earth through the distribution of Rhapsody of Realities in all languages of the world to all nations. God wants to protect His people. He wants to guide and lead them, and He does this through the Word and the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Let’s make His truth known. When people don’t know the Word of God, they get deceived, robbed, and destroyed. God said, “My people are destroyed for their lack of knowledge.” Not only should you consciously increase in your knowledge of God, help others to know the Word.</p>
<p>Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 28:19</a>, <em>“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations....”</em> In other words, teach them the truth; show them how to live so they’re not deceived. Anyone who’s ignorant of the Word of God is in darkness, because the Word of God is truth and light.</p>
<p>It’s the same for anyone who’s destitute of the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth. He’s the One who guides you into all truth so you can walk in truth and also make it known to others. His truth (His Word) is your shield and buckler (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2091:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 91:4</a>).

<p>Sometimes, we try to get God to do something about the world, about the plight of suffering humanity, not realizing we’re actually His hope for the world. We’re His outstretched arm of blessing to the world. He blessed us, and made us the conveyors of His blessings to our world.</p>
<p>His Word says He made all things beautiful; He created humanity to live in peace, joy, safety, prosperity and abundance. He wants us to keep things that way. We’re supposed to look at the things happening in the nations that aren’t consistent with the will of God and effect changes. We’re the ones to prove His good, acceptable, and perfect will in the earth (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12:2</a>).</p>
<p>It brings to mind the words of Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 18:18</a>: <em>“Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”</em> Understand what this means: we give vent to the glory of God in the earth. We give vent to His will. We allow the good things of God to come into this world.</p>
<p>We’re the ones to scrutinize everything in the world and decide which is acceptable or is in the perfect will of God, and then bring that into this earth. It&#x27;s our calling. No wonder the Bible says, <em>“For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God… the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:19-21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:19-21</a>).</p>
<p>We’re the hope of the world to bring joy, righteousness, peace and prosperity. We’re the ones to deliver the world from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, and we’re at it. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 3:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>It’s amazing what we can do, what we can have—the blessings and glory we can experience—when we use the Name of Jesus. Think about what we just read in our opening verse. The Name of Jesus brings healing and health; perfect soundness to your body. Glory to God!</p>
<p>Throughout the gospels, you find various instances where people touched the hem of Jesus’ garments and received instant healing. An example is the woman with the issue of blood in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 8</a>. The Bible says she came behind Jesus and <em>“...touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:44&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 8:44</a>).</p>
<p>The word “border” in this verse is “Kraspedon” in Greek and it means “fringes” or “tassels.” Also, in Matthew 14, when Jesus came to the land of Gennesaret, the people of that region rushed to Him for healing, and the Bible says they <em>“...besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2014:36&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 14:36</a>).</p>
<p>The Master didn’t have to do anything; all they needed was to touch the border or fringes of His garment and they were healed. But it’s even more glorious today! You don’t have to touch His garment; at the mention of His Name, every sickness bows; cancers dematerialize; maimed or paralysed limbs are made whole. His Name is the answer today.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%206:56&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 6:56</a>, the Bible says everywhere Jesus entered: <em>“…villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.”</em> That same power is still available today in His Name.</p>
<p>No wonder He charged us to heal the sick, cleanse the lepers and raise the dead (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 10:8</a>). He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:17-18</a>, <em>“And these signs shall follow them that believe…they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”</em> Blessed be God!</p>

<p>The world today might be experiencing terribly agonizing times, but the Bible clearly shows that these things aren&#x27;t new: <em>“The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%201:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>).</p>
<p>There were economic hardship, deception, fear, and terrorism back then as there are today. These were, and still are, tricks used by the adversary to oppress people. But our God is faithful throughout all generations. He leads us in perpetual triumph. It doesn’t matter the darkness in the world, refuse to fear.</p>

<p>As Christians and soul winners, we should be concerned enough to know if anyone in our congregation has strayed away or fallen by the wayside. We’re never to give up on anyone. The Lord expects us to account for every soul.</p>
<p>The words of Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:12</a> should be our inspiration always in dealing with those that the Lord adds to the Church. He said, <em>“While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:12</a>). The Lord Jesus accounted for every soul that God gave Him.</p>
<p>Soul winning must have accountability; we have to be accountable for the souls the Lord has given to us. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2015&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 15</a>, the Lord Jesus told the parable of a shepherd with one hundred sheep who left the ninety-nine to go search for the one that got missing in the wilderness. When he found it, he carried it home rejoicing, and invited his friends and neighbours to celebrate. Then, the Master said, <em>“I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2015:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 15:7</a>). Here, Jesus was ministering to the Jews, but He wasn’t talking about one who had never come to the Lord, but one who had strayed away.</p>
<p>There’s a difference between the one who has never been in the church and the one who’s been in church but strayed away. We must go after them to win them back. So, today, call or visit that brother, sister, or family that you know hasn’t been coming to church. Share the love of Christ with them and keep interceding for them. When you win them back, the Bible says there’ll be great joy in heaven. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want…He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name&#x27;s sake (</strong></em><a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Psalm%2023:1;%20Psalm%2023:3%20kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 23:1,3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Did you know that wisdom and righteousness are intertwined? The wisdom (Greek: &quot;phronesis&quot;) that I’m talking about is practical wisdom. It&#x27;s the outworking of the righteousness of God in your life. When we talk about the righteousness of God, we’re talking about practical wisdom at work, the expression of &quot;phronesis.&quot;</p>
<p>We’re children of righteousness, and you can’t walk in righteousness and fail in wisdom (&quot;phronesis&quot;). The underlined portion of our theme verse says, <em>“…he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness….”</em> Walking in the paths of righteousness is &quot;phronesis.&quot; It means you don&#x27;t go anywhere by chance. You don&#x27;t meet anybody by chance; in your path, there’re no accidents. Everything is prearranged by God.</p>
<p>In studying the relationship between wisdom and righteousness in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%208:12-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 8:12-18</a>, Wisdom says, <em>“I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.”</em></p>
<p>With wisdom leading you in the paths of righteousness, you could never be poor. So, every day, declare, “Wisdom is at work in me today! No chance occurrences in my life. Predestination is at work in me.” Your life was planned by God to be in the paths of wisdom and righteousness. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth (James 3:14).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%203:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>James 3:14</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The verse of scripture above was written to God&#x27;s people. It shows that it’s possible to find a Christian who could be walking in bitterness, envy and strife. According to our theme verse, when you notice bitterness, envy, and strife in your heart, take a stand against them. Don&#x27;t deny them; deal with them, because they’re devilish.</p>
<p>In the ensuing verse 15, still referring to anger, bitterness and strife, it says, <em>“This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%203:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 3:15</a>). The word “devilish” above is the Greek, “daimoniodes” which means “demonic” or that which is inspired by a demon.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t allow your life to be influenced by demons; don&#x27;t get into strife. Ordinarily, Satan can’t force his will upon anyone, except those who yield to his antics and influence. Sadly, some people yield themselves to the devil without realizing it. It’s the reason you must walk in the Spirit and in the knowledge of the Word at all times. This is vital for a victorious Christian life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 5:16</a> says, <em>“This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.”</em> The same James who wrote what we read in our theme verse also wrote in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 4:7</a>, <em>“Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”</em> You submit yourself to God by yielding to the Word.</p>
<p>Then, being yielded to the Word, resist the devil and he’ll flee from you. That’s the key: it’s being yielded to the Word; giving yourself to the Word by doing the Word! It’ll rid you of envy, strife, pride, jealousy, bitterness, anger and everything unwholesome or unclean. It’ll bring you into a place of sanctification. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:25-26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Mark 1:25-26</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>As Christians, we’ve been given dominion over Satan and the powers of darkness in the Name of Jesus. We have to use what we’ve got. Don’t negotiate with demons. When you say to them, “Out!” they have to obey because you’re using the authority of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The Bible says the people were amazed at Jesus in His day because with authority He commanded unclean spirits and they obeyed Him (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 1:27</a>). The Bible says, <em>“…he cast out the spirits with his word…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%208:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 8:16</a>). That’s what you’re to do.</p>
<p>Exercise your dominion in Christ; use the power of the Holy Spirit. The Good News Bible translation of our theme verse says, <em>“Jesus ordered the spirit, ‘Be quiet, and come out of the man!’ The evil spirit shook the man hard, gave a loud scream, and came out of him.”</em> They couldn’t resist Jesus; and they can’t resist you.</p>
<p>As you pray and intercede for people and for nations, cast out devils! Command the evil spirits responsible for the wickedness, confusion and darkness in the world to come out of your nation, city, town and village. Command the prince of the power of the air to take his hands off the people so the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ may shine in their hearts to receive salvation.</p>
<p>Satan has no right to run things in your life, in your home or in the lives of your loved ones. Exercise your authority in Christ against him. Don’t wait for someone else to do it for you. Every Christian has the ability to cast out devils. Jesus has given you the authority; walk and live in His Name. Use what you’ve got!</p>

<p><em><strong>And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 18:1</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Prayer is important for the Christian. There’re certain things that won’t change until you pray. Prayer covers not only the communication—the content of the prayer—but also our meditation during the times of prayer.</p>
<p>Even the seclusion is important; when you have to shut yourself away from everything and everyone else and be alone with the Spirit of God so He can talk to you and open your eyes. As you speak in tongues, rolling your mind through the Scriptures, He’ll unveil Himself and His truth to your spirit. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>These are some of the secrets from God&#x27;s Kingdom given to His children to be successful in life. You ought to live in victory even in the midst of the storms, and the life of victory in Christ is very simple. Whenever it’s possible to stay away from everything else to pray, do it. Always stir yourself and respond to the call and urgency of prayer from your spirit.</p>
<p>Jesus said, <em>“…men ought always to pray...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 18:1</a>). <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:18</a> says, <em>“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit….”</em> Give attention to praying in tongues. You have to pray always by the Holy Spirit; the words have to be energized, communicated, inspired and anointed by the Holy Ghost. That’s what makes the difference. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith… (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2012:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Hebrews 12:2</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 3:14</a>, the Lord Jesus said something symbolic. He said, <em>“And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up.”</em> This had to do with the Jews in the wilderness, when they were bitten by fiery serpents that caused them burning pain and death.</p>
<p>God then instructed Moses to make a serpent of brass, raise it on a pole, and everyone who looked at it would live. He didn&#x27;t say they should look at the serpent and pray; there were no ceremonies, no rituals; all they had to do was to look at the brazen serpent and live. And when they looked, they were healed. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This was symbolic of Jesus at the Cross, taking your place of sorrow, pain, disappointment, sickness and failure, that you should never suffer them. But beyond the Cross, we now have His life. We live because He lives.</p>
<p>By reason of His resurrection, we’ve been brought into a newness of life: <em>“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:4</a>). The life we have now is divine.</p>
<p>Therefore, what you have to look at today isn’t the Cross, but His Word! In His Word, you see what He’s done for you, who He’s made you, and your heritage in Him. Our opening verse says looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith. Who is Jesus? He is the Word!</p>
<p>It makes no difference the dire situations and circumstances that you face; don’t gripe or whimper! Look to the Word! Look to the Word and see your glorious and glorified life! Look to the Word and see your success, victory and prosperity. Look to the Word and see that you’re indomitable, full of the Holy Ghost and power. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (Romans 8:26).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:26</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the most important kinds of prayer is one in which the Holy Spirit Himself prays through you in intercession for the saints. That’s what we read in our opening verse above. There’s the one in which your spirit is praying in tongues, like the Apostle Paul said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2014:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 14:14</a><em>: “For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.”</em></p>
<p>However, there’re times your spirit may have been praying and it gets to the level where the Holy Spirit takes over that prayer. At that moment, it’s not your spirit that&#x27;s praying anymore but the Holy Spirit praying through you with deep sighs and groanings. You find yourself praying with intense, profuse uncontrollable tears; you’re wailing, not out of sorrow or anguish but of soul-travail. No words are being formed; you even have to hold your stomach as though you’re in pain, but there’s no pain. It’s the Holy Spirit travailing in prayer through you.</p>
<p>Read our theme scripture again; it says the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which can’t be uttered in articulate speech. This is an amazing way to pray effectively and it’s important that you yield yourself to the Holy Spirit to pray through you like this from time to time. It’s His work through you.</p>
<p>When He prays through you, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:28</a> tells us the result: <em>“And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD (Isaiah 54:17).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2054:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Isaiah 54:17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>This opening verse is one of the blessings of Israel’s millennial kingdom under the Messiah; but it’s true of us in Christ today. In Him, we live and move and have our being. We’re guaranteed divine protection from all weapons of any nature, formed or used against us.</p>
<p>In Christianity, we dwell in Christ. Christ is our home. In Christ, we’re in safety. We’re immune from hurt or harm. It’s like what God did for the children of Israel in the Old Testament. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2012:22-23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 12:22-23</a> says, <em>&quot;And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.&quot;</em></p>
<p>He told the children of Israel to stay inside their houses because the death angel was coming to town; there would be no safety outside. Then He instructed them to mark their doorposts and lintels with blood to prevent them from being destroyed along with the Egyptians.</p>
<p>They did as God instructed and they were preserved. As long as they stayed where God told them to stay, the death angel couldn&#x27;t touch them. It’s the same thing today; as long as you’re in Christ—as long as you stay in the truth of God’s Word—death, evil and peril will &quot;pass over&quot; you. You’ll live perpetually in victory.</p>
<p>When the reality of the Word and who you are in Christ dawns on you, you suddenly come to a place of absolute confidence and independence, where you realize that you’re superior to Satan and nothing he does can affect you. This is our life in Christ. Glory to God!</p>

<p>Our opening verse reminds of what the Apostle Paul said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:14-15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 3:14-15</a>: “I bow my knees before the Father of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.” Learn to bow your knees in prayer. Sometimes people go through tough times and severe persecutions. The way to deal with such situations is on your knees in prayer.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018:1-8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 18:1-8</a>, the Lord Jesus emphasized the importance of persistence in prayer. This is because being the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus, you can change anything through prayer. When Satan stirs persecution against us, take it to the Lord in prayer.</p>
<p>Never allow any crisis or situation take your attention such that you begin to mull it over, feeling helpless. One minute with the Holy Ghost will make a far much greater impact than five hours of melancholy and sad cogitations. So, pray in, and with, the spirit. <em>&quot;Is any among you afflicted? Let him pray…&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 5:13</a>). <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:18</a> says, <em>“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit….”</em></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter the persecution or how unsavoury the economy of your nation is; keep praying about it. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%2011:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a> says, <em>“If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.”</em></p>
<p>Keep watering the clouds with prayer; soon enough, the condensation will take place and there’ll be a deluge: the answers will come pouring down.</p>

<p><em><strong>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true...honest...just...pure...lovely...of good report...think on these things (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Philippians 4:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Some time ago, the report went viral of a 32-year-old nurse who was accused of murdering seven new-born babies, including two brothers from a set of triplets. She carried out this despicable act over the course of a year in the neonatal unit of a certain hospital.</p>
<p>The Police had recovered apparent confession notes from her home after her arrest in which she had penned some of her heinous thoughts. On one of the notes, she had written in capital letters: “I AM EVIL. I DID THIS.” What would make a lady carry out such a diabolic act, and confess herself as evil? Those suggestions were given to her by demons.</p>
<p>There&#x27;re so many evil things that demons make people do which the people, in their natural minds, would never do. But demons practise on people for some time by suggesting things to them. Those bad thoughts come to their minds again and again until they start enjoying them.</p>
<p>They may be thoughts of suicide or thoughts of hatred. Such thoughts can come to someone for no reason, and when he or she dwells on them, the demons go to the next level of making them act their thoughts.</p>
<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:27</a> says, <em>“Neither give place to the devil.”</em> You give place to him by giving place to his thoughts and words. Don’t entertain his thoughts. When He comes with those negative, depressing thoughts— thoughts that are contrary to God’s Word—tell him off immediately. Respond with the Word and he’ll flee.</p>
<p>If he tries to run rampage around you, remember what Jesus said would be a sign for those who believe in Him; He said, <em>“...In my name shall they cast out devils…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:17</a>). So, cast him out; cast out his thoughts.</p>
<p>So many things that happen in our world are influenced by demons. That’s because the system of the world was created by Satan. And only men and women of faith in the Word of God can use the Word of God to change things.</p>

<p><em><strong>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%204:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 4:20</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Jesus came to this earth, it wasn’t His day. In Luke 22:53, at the verge of His crucifixion, He said to the soldiers, <em>“…this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”</em> So, He allowed Himself to be arrested. When He ministered, He didn’t go beyond the city of Jerusalem (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024:49&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 24:49</a>). That wasn’t His day.</p>
<p>The Day of Christ is when He returns to judge the nations and begin His 1,000-year reign upon the earth. (Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%201:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 1:10,</a> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 2:16</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Thessalonians%202:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>). The Bible says, <em>“In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2023:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 23:6</a>).</p>
<p>All those things will happen in His days, for 1,000 years! That’s at the Millennium. But this is the day of the Church! Glory to God! Realize this and take advantage of it. This is the day in which we must use all that He’s given us for His glory. You&#x27;ve got to have the manifestation of power in your life! The Kingdom of God isn’t in words only, but in power also (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%204:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 4:20</a>).</p>
<p>The tremendous miracles, signs and wonders performed by Jesus and the apostles were chronicled in the Bible to inspire us and to let us know we can do the same in our day through the power of the same Spirit. Use what you’ve got. Praise God!</p>
