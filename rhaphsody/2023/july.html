<p><em><strong>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 9:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>We just read that God is able to make all grace— every favour and earthly blessing—come to you in abundance. Grace sets you apart. It brings you acceptability, honour, dignity, liberality and kindness. It attracts to you the right people, circumstances, and resources that are in line with God’s purpose for your life.</p>
<p>Therefore, you ought to thank the Lord every day for His grace at work in your life. According to the opening verse above, God makes this grace abound towards you. He directs it towards you in abundance.</p>
<p>Even now, say out loud, “I walk and function in divine grace that differentiates me in the world and sets me apart for glory and excellence. I’m a child of grace.” Hallelujah! The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 2:1</a>, <em>“…be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.”</em> Take advantage of His grace.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 9:8 AMPC</a> and see the will of God for your life and the result of His grace at work in you: <em>“And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation].”</em> Blessed be God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him (1 John 4:8-9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:8-9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 4:8-9</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When we talk about the love of God, it’s actually the demonstration of the righteousness of God. The love of God is the righteousness of God at work. Why does God love? It’s because of His righteousness. Our opening text says, “God is love.” He is love because it is righteous to love.</p>
<p>If there’s no object of love, love can’t be expressed. Moreover, you can only express love to a being that can receive and reciprocate love. So, the righteousness of God causes the nature of love to emanate from Him and be expressed from Him. Love that is inactive is not love.</p>
<p>Wherever the righteousness of God is in manifestation, the love of God is experienced. Therefore, when you see a brother or a sister who&#x27;s not walking in love, it&#x27;s because they don’t understand the righteousness of God. And because they don’t understand it, they’re not living in it. Their problem begins with their very relationship with God, not even with the person or the people they have trouble with.</p>
<p>The more you know the Lord, the more you understand His righteousness, and the more His love is reflected back to you and from you. Remember what He did: In Christ Jesus, He made you the righteousness of God; you’re the expression of His righteousness. If that&#x27;s true, how can you not walk in love?</p>
<p>God is love; in other words, that’s who He is; that’s His nature. The same is true of righteousness; God is righteous; that’s His nature. So when we teach people about walking in love, that&#x27;s really for the babes in Christ. You haven’t matured in Christ until you&#x27;re really walking in love, and you will not walk in love until you understand and live in the righteousness of God.</p>

<p><em><strong>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? ...Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us (Romans 8:35-37).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? …Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:35-37&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:35-37</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Sometimes, when people give their hearts to Christ, they assume they aren’t supposed to face adversities or persecutions. But the Bible says count it all joy when you go through diverse tests (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:2</a>). Tests, trials and persecution are all part of the package; never be flustered by them, because you’re more than a conqueror. You’re a victor in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>The devil will try to sway you or throw darts at you. He may prowl around, seeking whom he may devour, but the Word tells you what to do: resist him with your faith! <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:16</a> says to use the same faith—your shield of faith—to neutralize and extinguish Satan’s fiery darts: <em>“Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.”</em></p>
<p>We’re not on the defensive but on the offensive against Satan and his cohorts of darkness. We’re adequately fortified against their onslaughts and have dominion over them. Whether they are principalities, powers, or the rulers of the darkness of this world—they are subject to you in the Name of Jesus.</p>
<p>Keep living in the victory of Christ. Dominate your world, dominate your environment, and give Satan no chance. The Bible tells us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:27</a> to give no place to the devil. Remember Jesus gave us power to cast out devils. Therefore, use that authority in His Name and subdue the evil and wicked one.</p>
<p>That’s what Jesus said to do: <em>“And these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:17</a>). It’s the first of the things He said we could do in His Name. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are &quot;Yes&quot; in Christ. And so through him the &quot;Amen&quot; is spoken by us to the glory of God (2 Corinthians 1:20 NIV).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>For no matter how many promises God has made, they are &quot;Yes&quot; in Christ. And so through him the &quot;Amen&quot; is spoken by us to the glory of God (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%201:20&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 1:20 NIV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>God never makes a promise until He has fulfilled it. Every promise was fulfilled in Christ: <em>“For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%201:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).</p>
<p>So, if God tells you something that sounds like a promise, He already fulfilled that promise. Let me explain it to you this way: imagine He puts ten thousand dollars in your account, then He calls you on the phone and says, “Son, or daughter, I will give you ten thousand dollars if you’d do XYZ.”</p>
<p>Now, He only made that promise because He already put the money in your account. This is simple to understand when you realize that God doesn’t have a future; He lives in eternity. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2090:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 90:2</a> says, <em>“Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, <strong>even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God</strong>.”</em> Future for man is history with God.</p>
<p>Now you can better understand Paul’s beautiful conclusion in Hebrews 4:3 that all <em>“…the works were finished from the foundation of the world.”</em> In other words, before the earth was created, God had completed His work. Before you ever came on the scene, before your parents ever dreamed of coming together, God had known you and concluded everything about you.</p>
<p>Think about it: we’re already in the month of July, but before we ever knew 2023 was the Year of the Prolific Church, the Lord already put everything in place to make it so. What you require isn’t to ask God to make you prolific; no! Simply walk in the grace of that word.</p>
<p>With that grace, take your community, seize your city, and dominate your country for Christ. Flood everywhere with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Let it be said of you as it was said of the apostles in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%205:28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 5:28</a>: <em>“… behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine....”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>For we are God’s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 2:10 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Bible teaches that there are two paths for every man. There’s a natural path, and then there’s a divine path. The natural path is subject to causes and effects. For example, if you were born in a certain neighbourhood or attended a certain school, it would be easy to predict how you’d turn out. This is why it’s easy for Satan to toy with the natural paths or natural destinies of people.</p>
<p>The divine path, however, is different. It begins when you’re born again, and this path is like a mystery. The world can’t figure you out or predict your life, because being born again, God has made you a limitless wonder. Your life is one of infinite possibilities because of His divine ability at work in you.</p>
<p>Choose the divine path. The divine path makes your life worth living. You’ll keep making remarkable progress on every side, because you’re piloted by the Holy Spirit. While people are still wondering at your advancement, you’ll hear the Spirit’s voice saying, “Look up, I’m taking you higher.” You’ll just keep pushing forward and making progress.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re reading this today, and you’ve never been born again, I urge you to give your heart to the Lord even now, so that you can begin your journey on the divine path. Turn to the <a href="https://rhapsodyofrealities.org/call-to-salvation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Prayer of Salvation</strong></a> page at the back of this devotional; pray that prayer, and mean the words with all your heart. You’ll be awakened to the fatherhood of God and His light will shine in your spirit, guiding you in the way of success, prosperity and victory evermore.</p>

<p><em><strong>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full (John 16:24).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 16:24</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening scripture reveals the heart of the Father and His desire for us: He wants your joy to be full always! That’s because being joyful is very important in the Kingdom of God. The Bible says <em>“A joyful, cheerful heart brings healing to both body and soul…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2017:22&amp;version=TPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 17:22 TPT</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, it makes no difference what happens around you or the situations you face; exude joy; rejoice evermore. The beautiful part is that our joy is of the Holy Spirit, and therefore, independent of circumstances: <em>“For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and <strong>joy in the Holy Ghost</strong>”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2014:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 14:17</a>).</p>
<p>We’re full of joy even in the face of adversities and persecution: <em>“My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:2</a>). That means no room for frustration in your life; no room for anger, sadness, or bitterness. Only the joy of the Lord is expressed and manifested through you. When others see you, they see joy: joy unspeakable and full of glory.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us about the children of Israel that their joy was heard afar off as they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced after rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem: <em>“Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah%2012:43&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nehemiah 12:43</a>).</p>
<p>Their joy was heard afar off! That tells us joy has expressions. Laughter is an expression of joy. Praising God—being exultant and exuberant with praise to Him—is an expression of joy. Singing songs of praise in thanksgiving is an expression of joy.</p>
<p>Give no place to gloom in your life. In spite of the terrible things happening in the world today, be full of joy every day. Joy is one of the products of your recreated human spirit (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 5:22</a>). Therefore, generate and release joy and excitement from inside you—always.</p>

<p><em><strong>According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Peter 1:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The latter part of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 3:21</a> corroborates what Peter pens for us in the verse above. It says, <em>“…all things are yours.”</em> That’s because all things are in Christ, and Christ is in you. Therefore, both things present and things to come, are all yours!</p>
<p>God’s divine power, not your own ability or human wisdom, has given unto you ALL things that pertain to life and godliness. This means you’re not supposed to ever be in lack or want except you choose to. You’ve got to believe this because it’s God’s Word about you.</p>
<p>When God says He’s done something, you don’t have to try to claim it; you simply accept it and act accordingly. His Word is all the proof you need. For example, when money is paid to your account in the bank, they probably send you a message or give you a document that confirms that the money has been paid into your account, and you believe it. You go about living and acting as one who has that amount deposited in the bank. You even make deals and transactions on the basis that you have that money in the bank. Meanwhile, all you have is a text message or deposit slip from the bank that they have your money.</p>
<p>Now, that’s the way God wants you to act. Trust what God has written to you—His Word—more than the writings from the bank. His Word is more dependable. Let your confidence be on the basis of His Word.</p>
<p>Don’t place a limit on your life. You’re a child of God, and He’s brought you a life of endless resources, limitless blessings and opportunities. Consciously and consistently walk in the light of God’s Word. There’s nothing you could ever need or desire for a godly life that’s not already yours in Christ. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>Give financially for soul-winning and the establishment of God’s righteousness in the earth and in the hearts of men. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 9:7-10</a>, the Spirit, through Paul, emphasized how giving is directly connected to righteousness.</p>
<p>A true giver is concerned about the spread of the Gospel to all peoples, and the reign of God’s righteousness in the earth. Therefore, do all you can, and more, to support and promote the spread of the Gospel around the world. Be extravagant about it.</p>
<p>God showed us the perfect example: He gave His Son, Jesus Christ, for the salvation of mankind, showing that the true value of a human soul is Jesus. The whole world is nothing, compared to the value of a human soul.</p>
<p>No wonder Jesus said, <em>“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208:36-37&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 8:36-37</a>). Knowing this, therefore, commit yourself and your resources to soul-winning.</p>
<p>Let the spread of the Gospel around the world become your heartbeat. Be radical in your commitment to Christ and His cause, and live for Him wholly and truly. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Hebrews 9:24</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020:11-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 20:11-18</a> tells us the story of the first appearance of the risen Lord. After Jesus was crucified and buried, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb on the third day to anoint His body with spices. When she arrived at the tomb, she found that the stone covering the entrance had been rolled away. Rattled, Mary ran to tell Peter and John, two of Jesus&#x27; disciples, that someone had taken the body of the Master.</p>
<p>The Bible records for us in the 11th verse that after Peter and John left, Mary stayed at the tomb, weeping. As she turned to leave, she saw a man standing there, whom she did not recognize (the man was Jesus). He asked her why she was crying, and she again explained that someone had taken away Jesus&#x27; body.</p>
<p>At that moment, the Master called her by name, &quot;Mary,&quot; and she realized that it was Jesus Himself. Overjoyed, Mary turned, perhaps to hug Him, but He instructed her to not touch Him, and told her why: <em>“…Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 20:17</a>).</p>
<p>This means that before meeting with the disciples in Galilee, and before anyone could touch Him, He would have ascended to the Father, as our High Priest and presented His blood. Whereas the priests of the Old Testament had to offer sacrifices year after year for a yearly atonement, Jesus did it once and obtained eternal redemption for mankind.</p>
<p>So, His sacrifice was in His own blood which He went to heaven to present. His blood was accepted as read in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%209:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 9:12</a>: <em>“Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.”</em></p>
<p>In Matthew’s account, when He came to Galilee, the first thing He said to His disciples was <em>“...All hail...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 28:9</a>). In other words, “It’s done! It has happened! I’ve presented my blood and obtained eternal redemption for mankind.” Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver (2 Corinthians 9:7).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 9:7</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The story of Abraham in Genesis 22 helps us to better understand Paul’s words in our opening scripture. After years of waiting to have a child, Abraham and Sarah eventually gave birth to Isaac in their old age. But one day, God asked Abraham to offer his only son, Isaac, as a sacrifice (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2022:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 22:2</a>).</p>
<p>I’m aware that there’re religious books and certain movies that highlight Abraham’s disappointment upon receiving that instruction. To them, he gave Isaac reluctantly, grudgingly, sorrowfully, and regretfully. No, he wasn&#x27;t sorrowful; he did it by faith.</p>
<p>Remember the Bible calls Abraham the father of faith; he was a man of faith who demonstrated his faith that God could raise Isaac from the dead, and symbolically, that’s exactly what happened: <em>“By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son…Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:17-19&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 11:17-19 NIV</a>).</p>
<p>Abraham trusted completely in the Lord and offered Isaac cheerfully. No wonder, in the Lord’s impending judgement against Sodom, He deliberated, <em>“…Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2018:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 18:17</a>).</p>
<p>God wouldn’t leave Abraham out of His plans; He wouldn’t do without him. That’s exactly what the Word says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 9:7 AMPC</a>: <em>“...for God loves (He takes pleasure in, prizes above other things, and is unwilling to abandon or to do without) a cheerful (joyous, “prompt to do it”) giver [whose heart is in his giving].&quot;</em></p>
<p>We’re Abraham’s seed. Like him, we give in faith; we’re cheerful, joyous, “prompt to do it” givers. We give from the heart, and nothing is ever too much for us to put into the spread of the Gospel. The result is a life of ever-increasing greatness, relevance and impact in the Kingdom of God. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth… (Revelation 1:5).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth… (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%201:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Revelation 1:5</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When I was a much younger Christian, as I went about preaching to people, asking them to receive Christ’s salvation and be born again, some of them confronted me with the question: “Why should I be born again, when even Jesus wasn’t born again?”</p>
<p>From my limited understanding at the time, I answered that Jesus didn’t have to be born again, because He was the Son of God. But as I studied the Bible, I found out Jesus had to be born again, and He was indeed born again. The question that this may immediately bring to your mind would be: when was He born again?</p>
<p>According to our opening scripture, Jesus was born again the day He was raised from the dead. So why did Jesus have to be born again? The answer is simple: He needed to be born again because He was made sin for us on the Cross. The Bible records that God <em>“...made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). </p>
<p>Jesus took on our nature as our perfect substitute. He took our place and became ‘us’ on the cross. When God looked at Jesus on that cross, He saw you; He saw me; He saw every man, woman, boy, and girl ever born, and that’ll ever be born into this world. Our sins were laid on Him and He died in that state—our sin bearer—and was buried for us.</p>
<p>But thank God it didn’t end there! When He had paid the full penalty for our sins, the Bible says He was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father for our justification: <em>“Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 6:4</a>).</p>
<p>He needed to be raised from the dead into a new life, the resurrection life, to prove that what He did for us was adequate for our justification. He’s called “the first begotten of the dead”; that means the first to come out of spiritual death and be born again. He heads up the new creation. Glory to God!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:1-23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 13:1-23</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:1-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 4:1-20</a>, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:4-15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 8:4-15</a> record a simple story Jesus used to illustrate and teach spiritual lessons: the parable of the sower. In explaining the parable, Jesus said the seeds that fell by the wayside represented those who hear the Word of God and don’t understand it. Thus, Satan comes immediately and steals the Word from their hearts (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:14-15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 4:14-15</a>).</p>
<p>This means Satan is watching out for the Word. When the Word of God comes to you, Satan comes also. Recall that the first time the Word of God came to Jesus openly, Satan came also. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 3:17</a>, God said from heaven, “this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</p>
<p>Immediately, Satan also came and tempted Jesus, saying, <em>“…If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 4:3</a>). He challenged the Word that came to Jesus. but Jesus responded with the Word, saying, <em>“…It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 4:4</a>). He affirmed scriptures back to Satan.</p>
<p>When the Word comes to you about the glory or the power of God for your life and future, receive it with your spirit, and through meditation, drive it deep into your heart. Refuse to allow Satan to steal or take the Word away from you; he will try. He’ll throw his darts at you like missiles. But do what Jesus did; respond with the Word!</p>
<p>The Word of God in your mouth is the sword of the Spirit that cuts the adversary in pieces and discomfits his agenda, stratagems and manoeuvres. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For we are God&#x27;s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live] (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 2:10 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Observe that the apostle Paul didn’t say “We were or we shall be God&#x27;s own handiwork.” He uses the present tense to describe that right now, God has His label on you. In other words, no matter where you go in this great world, in the realms of the spirit, they recognize who you are because God’s label is on you.</p>
<p>You’re recreated in Christ Jesus. Someone might say, “But God created everything, so everyone is his workmanship.” That’s different from Paul’s thoughts. There was the first creation in the book of Genesis, but Paul’s emphasis was on a special creation—a recreation in Christ Jesus—those of us who are born again.</p>
<p>Then he tells us the purpose of this new birth: that we may do those good works which God predestined and planned beforehand for us, taking paths which He prepared ahead of time. Hallelujah! Again, this shows that for those of us that have been recreated in Christ, God has prepared our paths—everything about our lives—to be excellent and full of glory.</p>
<p>That’s not all; we’re to live, not just life, but the “good life” which He prearranged and made ready for us to live. Now, you can better understand why sickness, disease, infirmity or poverty shouldn’t be a part of your life. Let this be your confession. Every so often, declare, “I’m recreated in Christ, for beauty and for glory; good things are in my path, and the righteousness of God is expressed in and through me always.” Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together (Romans 8:16-17).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:16-17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:16-17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Some Bible Translators grappled with the Spirit’s communication through the apostle Paul in our opening scripture when He referred to us as “joint-heirs” with Christ. It was too big for their theology. Therefore, some of them decided to translate it as “co-heirs” instead of staying with the original Greek rendering which is “sugkleronomos”: joint-heirs.</p>
<p>A “Co-heir” shares in the inheritance, but not in joint-ownership. Unlike co-heirs, joint-heirs own the inheritance jointly, with undivided interest; they have equal rights to the entire inheritance. Let’s put it this way: while co-heirs can share it thirty-seventy or sixty-forty, or some other relevant fractions, the case with joint heirship is that, no one gets anything without the other; they have equal ownership over the whole hundred percent.</p>
<p>To be a joint-heir with Christ means everything that belongs to Him belongs to you, in the same way and degree that it belongs to Him. No wonder the Word declares that in Christ, all things are yours (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). Praise God!</p>
<p>How can you know this and be limited in life? Nothing should limit you, not your job or business. Nothing should get you hemmed in financially, because you’re an heir of God, and a joint-heir with Christ. Think about what He owns, then you’ll know how limitless and unsearchable your riches and resources are.</p>
<p>You have all things that pertain to life and godliness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3</a>). Therefore, lift your head above the clouds, and think like God; live a limitless life. Meditate on this truth today that you’re a joint-heir with Christ, and your creativity, ingenuity, inventiveness and innovativeness will come alive; you’ll become a solution provider!</p>

<p><em><strong>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) (Ephesians 2:4-5).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:4-5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 2:4-5</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>What a profound portion of scripture we just read! The Apostle Paul explains a spiritual truth that emphasizes our union with the Lord in His crucifixion, death, burial and resurrection when he said, <em>“Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:5</a>).</p>
<p>When Jesus was on the cross, we were the ones on the cross; He was our substitute. When He died, we were in Him. When He was buried, in the mind of justice, we were all buried. When He went to hell and defeated Satan and the demons of darkness as Paul detailed in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2:15</a>, in the mind of God, we were in Him. We defeated Satan in Christ.</p>
<p>Then the Bible shows that God raised Jesus from the dead; when that happened, we were raised together with Him. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:6</a> says, <em>“And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.”</em> This is how God sees us now. Everything that Jesus did was for us—the whole world; we were in Him.</p>
<p>Think about it: Jesus rose from the dead with a new life—the resurrection life; that’s the life we have in us today, because as He is, so are we in this world (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:17</a>). When you received Christ, you didn’t receive the life with which Jesus went to hell; you received the life of the righteous Jesus without sin.</p>
<p>He went to hell with our sins, defeated the devil, paid the full penalty for sin, and came back to life as the righteousness of God. Hallelujah! Now, by virtue of the New Birth, we also have become the righteousness of God in Him: <em>“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Proverbs 4:23</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word &#x27;keep&#x27; in the opening scripture doesn’t mean to hide something. The Hebrew word is “natsar” and it gives the picture of a stronghold mounted over something valuable. Thus, you’re to mount guard over your heart; keep your heart sanctified with the Word. </p>
<p>The reason the Bible places a premium on mounting guard over your heart—maintaining a perfect heart—is that out of it are the issues of life. Everything flows from your heart. In other words, everything you need for life is actually in your heart right now.</p>
<p>Everywhere you would ever go, everything you would ever have, everything you’d ever enjoy in this world is in your heart. The Bible says He has set eternity in our hearts (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%203:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>). The Kingdom of God is in our hearts (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 17:21</a>). What then are you supposed to do?</p>
<p>Fill your heart with the Word so only good will always come forth from your heart. Never let anything unwholesome take root in your heart. Pride, anger, malice, bitterness, hatred—these are poisonous to the heart.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 4:8</a> gives us an idea of what God wants you to fill your heart with: things that are honest, just, pure, lovely, of good report, virtuous and praiseworthy. Nothing meets this qualification better than God’s Word. That’s why you must allow the Word of God to dwell in you richly (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:16</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>God did this because he wanted you Gentiles to understand his wonderful and glorious mystery. And the mystery is that Christ lives in you… (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&amp;version=CEV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 1:27 CEV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In Christianity, we haven’t embraced a religion; what we’ve actually received is God&#x27;s nature—His life. Don’t let anyone deceive you that Christianity is just one of the religions in the world; it’s not. It’s a relationship; a call to the transcendent life of glory and love. When you have a relationship with someone, that isn’t religion.</p>
<p>Those who describe Christianity as a religion do so because all the outward things that religious people do seem to be consistent with some of the outward things Christians do. For example, in religion, they pray, or probably have a book that they read; they also have religious rites and rituals that they follow.</p>
<p>In Christianity, we have sacraments like the Holy Communion, Water Baptism, etc.; yet, that doesn’t make it a religion. You can’t look at an animal and say “If it has two hands and two legs and can walk, then it is a human being”; that isn’t enough. Otherwise, gorillas and other apes will be categorized as humans.</p>
<p>Christianity is a real experience; it’s the active life of God in a human being; it’s Christ alive in you; it’s a real comradeship with the real and living Christ—a call to oneness with divinity: “<em>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>). Hallelujah! In Christianity, we live and move in Christ (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 17:28</a>); we’re members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:30</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:26-27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:26-27</a> consummates it all! It says, <em>“Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations…which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.”</em> Christianity is Christ alive in the quarters of your heart; a real relationship with a real God. Christianity is a walk with God in righteousness. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God&#x27;s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Peter 2:9 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The verse we just read is absolutely profound! How I jumped, ran, skipped and shouted for joy at such a sublime discovery many years ago when I first read it as a young lad. I’m still so stirred and excited each time I meditate on it. We’re of the true royal bloodline.</p>
<p>First, observe that the apostle Peter didn’t say, “But you shall be”; rather, he says, “But you are!” That’s not a promise but a present-hour reality. Nobody knows you better than God. His Word is a mirror, and now the mirror is showing and describing how God sees you. You’re a royal priesthood; you’re royalty.</p>
<p>This is far bigger and more transcendent than all the royal families of the world put together. Theirs is just a matter of political position. But ours is the result of our divine ancestry. Read our opening scripture again; it says <em>“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God&#x27;s] own purchased, special people….”</em></p>
<p>How were you purchased? The Bible says, <em>“You must know (recognize) that you were redeemed (ransomed) from the useless (fruitless) way of living inherited by tradition from [your] forefathers, not with corruptible things [such as] silver and gold, But [you were purchased] with the precious blood of Christ (the Messiah), like that of a [sacrificial] lamb without blemish or spot”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:18-19&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 1:18-19 AMPC</a>).</p>
<p>The blood of Jesus represents His life; that’s your true value. And because of that blood with which you were purchased, you live above the corrupting influences of this world. Yours is the true royal bloodline. Your heavenly Father is the Monarch of the universe, and you’re His heir—His purchased, priceless possession!</p>

He’s the Spirit of truth, and part of His ministry in your life is the unveiling of truth. It brings to mind another prayer of the Spirit through Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:17&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:17 AMPC</a>: “For I always pray to God… that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation [of insight into mysteries and secrets] in the [deep and intimate] knowledge of Him.”</p>
<p>Without the understanding and insight that the Spirit gives, your interpretation of life would be ordinary, mundane and useless. It will be difficult to grasp spiritual realities.</p>
<p>Consider the disciples of Jesus for example; though they had been with the Master, they didn’t understand many things that He taught them, because they hadn’t received the Holy Spirit. When He spoke of His death, burial and resurrection, they grappled with it, because they lacked spiritual insight and understanding at the time.</p>
<p>That’s how come even after He rose from the dead, some of them still doubted. But after His resurrection, when He came among them, the Bible says <em>“…<strong>he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost</strong>”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 20:22</a>). What He did was to open their understanding by the Holy Spirit so they could receive and comprehend spiritual realities. From then on, they had spiritual insight; they understood the words of Jesus.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit comes into your life, He gives you understanding so you’re no longer in the dark about God’s Word, life, or anything. Through that insight and understanding, you know the paths of life that bring success, joy, victory and prosperity; you’re led in wisdom, glory and righteousness. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me (John 14:6).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 14:6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>If you don’t know Jesus, you can never know or find truth. You may only find facts without truth. Truth and fact are not the same. A fact is the assertion of sensorially verified information about something that exists or has happened. While truth, on the other hand, is reality beyond the senses.</p>
<p>According to the Scriptures, the Word of God is truth— reality: <em>“Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:17</a>). Truth is an affirmation of what God has said about any given condition, situation or circumstance. Truth is spiritual law. Someone may tell you a “fact” but not tell you the truth, because truth goes beyond facts.</p>
<p>Truth will reveal motives. In a law court, for example, one of the things the justice system looks at is the accused&#x27;s motive, purpose or intent in committing a crime. That is, the driving force, the urge, the impulse, or the desire that induces the criminal’s action.</p>
<p>It’s true that a motive can be useful in conjunction with other evidence to confirm or prove that a person committed a crime, especially if the accused offender denies doing so. However, time and time again, these unreliable systems of criminal justice have misjudged and convicted the wrong people, because they deal mainly with facts.</p>
<p>How can you judge a man’s motive? You have to know his heart. How can you know a man’s heart? It’s only God’s Word—the truth—that exposes, sifts, analyzes and judges the very thoughts and purposes of the heart. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:12&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 4:12 NIV</a> says, <em>“For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.”</em></p>
<p>Therefore, always subject the facts about any situation to the truth of God’s Word. Override facts with truths. For example, it doesn’t matter the facts resulting from the doctor’s diagnosis concerning your health; the truth is you have the divine life; therefore, divine health is your nature in Christ. Sickness, disease and infirmities have no place in your body. Hallelujah! Truth is greater than fact. Live in and by God’s truth today, and every day. Amen.</p>

<p><em><strong>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified (Romans 8:30).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:30</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Amplified Classic version of the opening text says, <em>“And those whom He thus foreordained, He also called; and those whom He called, He also justified (acquitted, made righteous, putting them into right standing with Himself). And those whom He justified, He also glorified [raising them to a heavenly dignity and condition or state of being].”</em></p>
<p>Observe the explanation of the word “Glorified”; it says, <em>“… [raising them to a heavenly dignity and condition or state of being].”</em> In other words, when you were born again, when you came to Christ and received eternal life, you were brought into a life of heavenly dignity. We have the most sublime and most imperial identity!</p>
<p>The apostle John explains the fellowship that has ushered us into this life of glory: <em>“That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 1:3</a>). The word translated “fellowship” is the Greek, “Koinonia.” It also means partnership. So, he’s dealing with comradeship.</p>
<p>Thus, our fellowship, partnership or comradeship is with the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Peter says we’re called to glory and excellence: <em>“For His divine power has bestowed upon us all things that [are requisite and suited] to life and godliness, through the [full, personal] knowledge of Him Who called us by and to His own glory and excellence (virtue)”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3 AMPC</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:12-13).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Christian is not an ordinary person. He’s born into God’s class. Being born again made you a partaker of the divine nature; an associate of the God-kind (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:4</a>). When you were born of your biological parents, you became an associate of the human-kind; you became as human as your parents that gave birth to you. </p>
<p>However, that human life you got from your parents was depraved, death-doomed, and corruptible. Therefore, it needed to be supplanted by the life and nature of God. It’s the reason Jesus said, <em>“Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 3:7</a>).</p>
<p>Now that you’re born again, the indomitable, incorruptible and transcendent life of God has supplanted the human life. This absolutely beggars the natural mind; to think that in reality, we’re literally sons of God—born of Him. </p>
<p>No wonder John cries out, <em>“Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God…Beloved, now are we the sons of God…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:1-2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 3:1-2</a>). The word translated as “Sons” is the Greek, “teknon”; it actually refers to someone that is born of another, in contradistinction to the Greek “huois”, which may not be ‘sons’ by birth.</p>
<p>The apostle John uses the word “teknon” to emphasize that you’re actually born of God. Everything in life reproduces after its kind. An eagle reproduces eagles, a dog gives birth to dogs, and humans give birth to humans. Now, since God gave birth to us, who are we?</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, quoting the psalmist, gives us an answer. He said, <em>“...Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:34&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:34</a>). Think about yourself the same way you’d think about Jesus when He walked the earth; how He lived, His extraordinary walk! The scripture declares: <em>&quot;...as he is, so are we in this world&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 4:17</a>).

<p><em><strong>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures (James 1:18).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>James 1:18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Observe the beginning of the construction in the opening verse; it says, <em>“Of his own will begat He us….”</em> That means the Lord gave birth to us of His own volition. It was His choice to give birth to us with the Word of truth that we should be a kind or a type of first fruit of His creatures!</p>
<p>What’s the meaning of first fruits? First fruit means the first and the best of anything; it implies top class. You’re top class, excellent all the way, because you’re born of God. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The same truth is reiterated by the apostle Peter in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 1:23</a>: <em>“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”</em> John also referenced the fact that this happened by God’s own design; it was His will: <em>“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:12-13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:12-13</a>).</p>
<p>It was His will to make you top-class. So, live your best and be your best for Him. Keep your mind on the image of you that God has given you in His Word. You’re His peculiar treasure, His reproduction, His excellent handiwork, a bundle of success, an achiever, and a victor in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>He made you for glory and beauty. See how He describes you in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:10 AMPC</a>: <em>“For we are God&#x27;s [own] handiwork (His workmanship), recreated in Christ Jesus, [born anew] that we may do those good works which God predestined (planned beforehand) for us [taking paths which He prepared ahead of time], that we should walk in them [living the good life which He prearranged and made ready for us to live].”</em> Let this put springs in your steps.</p>
<p>It makes no difference who condemns you; refuse to be distracted by what others might be saying about you. What counts is who you are in Christ: you’re top-class; perfected in righteousness, holy, unblameable and unreproveable in God’s sight (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:22</a>).

<p><em><strong>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them (Ephesians 2:10).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 2:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Potential is a latent ability, a hidden power that hasn’t been developed. It is that unused ability, hidden away in the inner recesses of your heart, mind, and soul. Potential is what you could be that you aren’t yet, what you could do that you haven’t done, or everything inside you that is yet to be actuated. Potential doesn’t refer to the successes you’ve achieved, but the ones that are possible that you’re yet to achieve.</p>
<p>Many have lived and died without actuating their potential or fulfilling God’s dream for them; many have died without becoming what He wanted them to be. Nothing could be more miserable than that! How would you feel if, at the judgment seat of Christ, you’re shown everything you could have been, and the possibilities you could have fulfilled but that were never actuated?</p>
<p>So, learn about the real you through the Word and stand up to be what the Word has described you to be: one with limitless possibilities and ability to do more and be more.</p>
<p>Remember the words of the Lord Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2012:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 12:24</a>. He said, <em>“Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.”</em></p>
<p>Consider a fruit-tree seed: That seed has the potential of not just becoming a tree, but a forest. Every tree has the potential of a forest. God doesn’t only reserve the rights, but also intends to hold men accountable for their potentials. We’re dealing here with your potential in God. The Bible says, <em>“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).</p>
<p>At the Judgment, some are going to see all that they were meant to be that they never became, all they could have said that they never said, and all they could have done that they never did. So make up your mind you’d be everything God has chosen you to be. Trust the Holy Spirit to help you see and live to your fullest potential and fulfil your destiny and calling in Christ.</p>

<p><em><strong>But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 20:24</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:17-27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 20:17-27</a>, Luke tells us how Paul and his team left Troas and sailed to Miletus where he gave his heartfelt farewell to the elders of Ephesus. There, he reminded them of how he served the Lord with all humility, in tears in the midst of adversity, affliction and trials.</p>
<p>In the twenty-third verse, he said, <em>“…the Holy Spirit clearly and emphatically affirms to me in city after city that imprisonment and suffering await me. But none of these things move me; neither do I esteem my life dear to myself…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:23-24&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 20:23-24 AMPC</a>). This great apostle minced no words about the fact that he had put his life on the line for the sake of the Gospel. What an inspiration! What a commitment!</p>
<p>When you go through the scriptures written by the apostle Paul and the other apostles of the Lord, have you ever thought what it cost them to get the message across to us? Study Church history, and you’ll discover that many of them were killed for the sake of the Gospel.</p>
<p>Read about Stephen. His success in converting Jews drew the indignation of the Sanhedrin and he was stoned to death. Some were beheaded, crucified, burned at the stakes and others were thrown into cauldrons of boiling oil. So, you have to count the cost.</p>
<p>Be ready and willing to lay your life on the line for the Gospel, especially in these last days. Nothing should be too much for you to give up, give, or go through for the Gospel. No matter the sacrifices you make for the Gospel, be ready and willing to give your life for it, if it comes to that.</p>
<p>How dear is your life? Is it so important that you wouldn’t do more for the Lord, just so you could save your name, yourself, or the money you’ve got? Is that all there is about life to you? You should come to that point in your life where you’re absolutely convinced that nothing is too much for you to give for the Gospel, including your life. Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%208:35&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 8:35</a>, <em>“For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel&#x27;s, the same shall save it.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%201:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 1:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 19</a>, Luke vividly captures for us some of the Apostle Paul’s unpleasant experiences as he went about preaching the Gospel. He talked about his personal risks and imprisonments, the riot orchestrated by Demetrius the silversmith, and, in the 22nd chapter, how a commander ordered that he be taken into the barracks to be flogged and interrogated.</p>
<p>No wonder Paul himself recounts, <em>“…in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2011:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 11:23</a>). In his first epistle to the Corinthian church, Paul recalls his experience at Ephesus and said, <em>“…I have fought with beasts at Ephesus…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:32&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>). In his second epistle, he narrated how in Asia, it became so bad that he felt he and his companions were on death row, but graciously had supernatural deliverance (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%201:8-9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 1:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>This same Gospel has been committed to your trust; will you take it lightly or put your all into it? Would you stick out your neck to preach the Gospel to your co-workers or business associates even if it means losing your job or losing out on business contracts you’ve so much desired?</p>
<p>How about your family members who aren’t yet born again? Would you go all out for them, or remain quiet to avoid being hated, disliked or ostracized? There’re those who for the fear of losing the relationships they’ve built, will never witness to their friends. How sad!</p>
<p>You’re a witness to your generation, and the Lord will hold you responsible as their witness. You’ve got to be committed to bringing salvation to those in your world. What you’re into isn’t about saving your head; it’s not about the comforts of life or the benefits you get out of it, no! You’re not into this for what any man can give you, but for the honour and glory of Christ the Lord.</p>

<p><em><strong>But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%201:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 1:9</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Bible tells us that God asked Abraham to offer up Isaac, his only son, whom he had at an old age. Abraham didn’t hesitate or complain; as he went ahead to offer Isaac, God promptly stopped him. As the book of Hebrews reveals, Abraham had Isaac raised back to life.</p>
<p>As far as God was concerned, it was a resurrection because Abraham had totally given up Isaac. It was God who said, “Abraham, stop! Don’t hurt the child.” Abraham had faith in the resurrection. The Bible says, <em>“For he reasoned that God was able to raise [him] up even from among the dead. Indeed in the sense that Isaac was figuratively dead [potentially sacrificed], he did [actually] receive him back from the dead”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2011:19&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 11:19 AMPC</a>).</p>
<p>It’s the same thing that Paul was talking about in the opening scripture where he narrated how he and his companions were so weighed down beyond their strength, and their situation was so devastating that they felt within themselves the very sentence of death.</p>
<p>So instead of trusting in and depending on themselves, they depended on God who raises the dead. What a mindset! They had given up on life as far as they were concerned; they had the sentence of death in themselves but they had a resurrection consciousness.</p>
<p>That’s just like Jesus who gave Himself up, knowing that the Father will raise Him back to life! We’re the children of faith, the children of Abraham, and we act like Abraham. We carry the resurrection consciousness in our spirits.</p>
<p>In that condition, nothing is kept back from the Lord, because you know that He is the God who raises the dead! Anything He asks you to give is multiplied back to you a thousandfold and more. Abraham offered Isaac and he became the father of many nations. His descendants became as countless as the sand on the seashore.</p>
<p>So, serve the Lord truly, joyfully and fully. The very idea to give your all to Him shouldn’t trouble, destabilize or give you sleepless nights when you have the resurrection consciousness. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God? (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Mark 12:24</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 13:8</a>). Therefore, what He did in Bible days, He’s still doing today; He’s consistent. His Name has the same power, the same authority to unstop deaf ears, open blind eyes, heal lame legs, restore maimed limbs and even raise the dead as it did in Bible days.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 10:13</a>). This applies to “anybody” and it’s true and still relevant. So, it doesn’t matter how bad you or others might think your case is; if you’d call upon the Name of the Lord, He’ll hear and answer you.</p>
<p>The Name of Jesus saves, delivers, protects, heals, preserves and makes whole. Perhaps the doctors have given up on you or on a loved one to die, maybe because of kidney failure, a heart disease, or a nervous breakdown. Don’t fret; our Lord is gracious, kind and all-powerful! Call on His Name and there’ll be a change.</p>
<p>Remember that there is no document in the world that is truer than the Bible—the Word of God. God’s Word is His will. And we know through His will that anybody who calls on Him shall be saved. All you have to do is believe; receive His message—His plan for you to walk in divine health and victory—and act on it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 9:23</a> says, <em>“…If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.”</em> These words aren’t mere clichés; they came right out of the lips of the Master; they’re forever true. He said, “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:35&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 24:35</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2013:31&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 13:31</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2021:33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 21:33</a>).

<p><em><strong>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust (2 Peter 1:4).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Peter 1:4</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The image the Apostle Peter conjures in our minds in the verse above stemmed from a Greek mythology. It had to do with the Greek pantheon, or the collective group of gods headed by Zeus, king of the gods. So, the actual expression, “partakers of the divine nature,” is the Greek “theias-phuseos,” which means “associates of the God-kind.”</p>
<p>Thus, Peter was referring to a greater pantheon headed by Jesus. Being born again, we’ve been brought into fellowship or oneness with the God-kind. We’re in that league, meaning that we’re in a fraternity of divinity, a communion of the God-kind. Some Bible scholars have had issues with this. Their disagreement isn’t because Peter’s thoughts were wrong, but they were so afraid to believe what the Word says.</p>
<p>Others argue that Peter shouldn’t have used words that primarily centre around or relate to Greek history, culture or the Greek gods. But there are several other texts attributed to Peter in the epistles that were written and influenced by Hellenistic culture. For example, Peter, for the first time in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:2</a> uses the term “epignosis.” The term epignosis is Hellenistic, and it&#x27;s used 20 times in the Bible out of which 16 of them were all from Paul. Four of them are from Peter (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:2</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:8</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%202:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 2:20</a>).</p>
<p>Epignosis is a higher form of knowledge; it means exact, precise or absolute knowledge that can only be attributable to God. The Hellenists or Grecians in their religiosity believed that only the gods knew everything; only the gods can have absolute knowledge. If these Hellenistic thoughts woven into scriptures are accepted, why should anyone disparage the Hellenistic inference or understanding of the pantheon that Peter seeks to communicate?</p>
<p>You belong in the fraternity of the God-kind, having been born into God’s class, with His divine life in your spirit. Now, you’re indestructible, impregnable and always victorious, having been translated from the ordinary realm of mankind to the supernatural class of the God-kind.</p>

<p><em><strong>And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation] (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 9:8 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2024:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 24:1</a> says, <em>“The earth is the LORD’S, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.”</em> In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Haggai%202:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Haggai 2:8</a>, the Lord declares His sovereignty over the earth’s resources saying, <em>“The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.”</em> </p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2050:10-11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 50:10-11</a>, the Lord said*, “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.”* Hallelujah! This same God that owns the world and everything in it, including all its inexhaustible and inestimable wealth, is able to direct all grace towards you for you to enjoy everything He owns.</p>
<p>God is able to direct all the grace you require for anything in this life towards you such that you’re never behind in competence or ability. Someone might say, “If that’s the case, then, go ahead and do it, Lord; direct all grace towards me.”</p>
<p>The scriptures already told us what prompts Him to do it: He does it for givers. Read <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:7-8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 9:7-8</a> and see the connection: all channels of blessings are focused on the giver! You can’t block the giver’s way, impede his advancement, or stymie his growth and blessings, for he’s graced on every side.</p>
<p>That’s not all. As a true giver, not only does God direct all grace towards you, but He ensures you have more than enough to give all the time. You’re always, and under all circumstances, and whatever the need, self-sufficient, possessing enough to require no aid or support, furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation. This is God’s Word and blessing for you as a giver. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Philippians 2:13</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Word of God is a propelling force; it’s a propelling power. It gives you the spiritual motivation, and enables you to do. The Word effectually works in you, energizing and creating in you the power and desire to actualize your dream.</p>
<p>Success comes from “doing,” that is, acting, not from seeing only. There’re many with great ideas—in business, politics, ministry, etc., —that never came to light because they never took action. If only they’d meditate on the Word.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:8&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua 1:8 AMPC</a> says, <em>“This Book of the Law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe and do according to all that is written in it. For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall deal wisely and have good success.”</em> Notice it didn’t say: “...but thou shall meditate therein day and night <em><strong>and also observe to do</strong></em>…”; neither did it say, “Meditate on it and do it”; no! Rather, it says if you’d truly meditate on the Word, you cannot but do it. The “doing” is a result or implication of you meditating on the Word.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:16</a> says to let the Word of God dwell in you richly; have it in your spirit in abundance because of what it does in you. When you’re in church for example, and the Word is being taught, there’s a ministry of the Word going on at such times; your spirit is being built, strengthened and stirred to act on the promptings, ideas and visions that come to you from God’s Spirit. Hallelujah!</p>
