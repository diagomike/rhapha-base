<p><em><strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek (Romans 1:16).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 1:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When you believed in Jesus Christ, you became a Christian and started living out your understanding of Christianity. Your life became a daily expression of your idea or perception of Christianity. Consciously or unconsciously, you became a reflection of your &quot;gospel.&quot;</p>
<p>“My gospel?” you may be wondering. Yes! Every one of us has a “gospel.” Your gospel is your perception of Christ: who He is and what He came to do. You can’t live above your revelation of the Gospel. Whatever you believe about Jesus will affect your speech, thinking process, and outlook on life. You’ll see everything through your “Gospel screen,” as it were.</p>
<p>This is why it’s important to have an accurate knowledge of the Gospel of Christ. What’s your understanding of the Gospel? What’s your opinion of Christ? Who is He, and what do you believe about Him?</p>
<p>One of the things I did for myself in my early years was to ask myself, “What do you really believe about Jesus?” Using the Word of God, I began to probe my heart to find out what I truly believed about Jesus, and I wrote my answers in a notebook.</p>
<p>There’re things you need to address for yourself as a Christian because you can only give to others what you have. You may preach the Gospel to people, but have you preached it to “you”? Do you have personal convictions about it?</p>
<p>Paul said, <em>“For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek”</em>(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 1:16</a>). Have you come to that conclusion about the Gospel? If you truly believe and understand the Gospel, you’ll preach it with fervour and urgency. You won’t spare anything to ensure it permeates your community, city, country, and every man’s world. Let your convictions of Christ drive you.</p>

<p>The Bible says, <em>“Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). That means you’re God’s house, His holy sanctuary.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%203:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 3:1</a>, the Bible says, <em>“Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling….”</em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:22&amp;version=cev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:22</a> (CEV) says, <em>“…God made peace with you, and now he lets you stand in his presence as people who are holy and faultless and innocent.”</em> Think about that! Then <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:4</a> says, <em>“According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love.”</em> Hallelujah!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2019&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 19</a>, when Moses brought the people from the camp to meet God, the Bible tells us that God descended on Mount Sinai with a terrible display of power: the mountain shuddered in huge spasms, with smoke billowing from it, so much so that the people trembled before the Lord. God only stepped on it and it was declared a holy mountain.</p>
<p>His presence made it holy. Now, think about the fact that He didn’t indwell the mountain; but He indwells you! Hallelujah! You’re more holy than Mount Sinai. No wonder He tells us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:25-27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:25-27</a> that Christ gave Himself for us—the Church—that He might sanctify and cleanse us with the washing of water by the Word, and present us to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that we should be holy and without blemish. Blessed be God!</p>

<p><em><strong>For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do SHEW the Lord&#x27;s death till he come (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 11:26</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The synoptic Gospels, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:26-28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 26:26-28</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014:22-24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 14:22-24</a>, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022:19-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 22:19-20</a> capture for us the words of Jesus the night He was betrayed. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022:19-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 22:19-20</a> tells us, <em>“And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.”</em></p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, by the Spirit, reiterated this in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011:23-26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 11:23-26</a>, part of which we read in our theme scripture. Notice the underlined word, “shew”; it’s the Greek, “kataggello,” which means to proclaim, declare, and make known. As often as you take communion, you’re announcing, proclaiming, declaring, and making known the Lord’s death. What&#x27;s the benefit of that?</p>
<p>First, understand the significance of His blood—which we will forever talk about—that He shed for us; that’s the blood that purges, cleanses and speaks for you when anything goes wrong. When we talk about “His blood,” we’re actually referring to His death.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 2:2</a> says <em>“And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.”</em> He made a new will—the New Testament in His blood. And a will is of no effect until the testator dies. So, we proclaim His death because we know God raised Him from the dead. But He died that we might live. His death is the ratification of the will or testament of Jesus Christ, the Seed of Abraham and Son of God.</p>

<p>The Holy Communion is a very important sacrament in the Church, but many take it without understanding its spiritual import and impact. When you take the Holy Communion, you aren’t only fellowshipping with the body and blood of Christ, you’re administering life to your body because it has curative powers! It&#x27;s more potent than any medication.</p>
<p>In explaining the parable of the sower to His disciples in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:3-4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 13:3-4</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013:18-19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18-19</a>, the Lord Jesus revealed that the ones who received seed by the wayside represented those who hear the Word but don’t understand it. As a result of their lack of understanding, Satan comes immediately and steals the Word sown in their hearts, and they lose out.</p>
<p>God&#x27;s Word mixed with understanding produces divine results. Henceforth, have the understanding that when we “break bread,” we’re commemorating the vicarious death of Christ, the sacrificial Lamb that was given up for you. Also, the “Cup” signifies the New Testament sealed in His blood. His divine blood was shed for us for the remission of sins, so that sin should not have dominion over us.</p>
<p>So, today, it doesn&#x27;t matter what the condition has been; you might have been diagnosed with lung, kidney, heart, stomach or skin problems; take the Communion and declare, “No cancerous growth, weakness, disease, infirmity or sickness can thrive or survive in my body. I&#x27;m healthy, vibrant and strong.” Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 3:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When preaching the Gospel, some Christians focus primarily on the subject of sin, emphasizing the need for people to repent of their sins. The message of repentance was apt for the Jews because they were under the Law. What was required of them was to turn away from wrong when they sinned, unto God.</p>
<p>However, non-Jews—the Gentiles—had nothing to turn away from because they were never under the Law, which in itself was their condemnation. The Bible says, <em>“For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:13</a>).</p>
<p>But then, the Bible says, <em>“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 3:23</a>). This includes both Jews and Gentiles. If the Gentiles didn’t break the Law because it wasn’t given to them, where then was their sin?</p>
<p>We learn in the book of Genesis that when God created Adam and Eve, they were in the presence of a holy God. They lived in His glory. But they were cut off from that glory when Adam sinned against God.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:19</a> says, “<em>For as by one man&#x27;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.”</em> Through one man’s offense, all men fell short of the glory, but now, in Christ, the glory is restored: <em>“…Christ in you, the hope of glory”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:27</a>). Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This is why your approach of the Gospel shouldn’t begin with the issue of sin; rather, it should begin with the message of love. That’s the key; that’s how Jesus puts it in our opening scripture. Love was His motivation.</p>
<p>Notice in that verse that He said nothing about sin. That’s the Gospel of Christ. It’s a message of love and a message of life—the life and nature of God—that His death, burial and resurrection has made possible and available to everyone who believes.</p>

<p><em><strong>But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Peter 2:9</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people would easily agree with you when you describe yourself as a child of God, but when you say you’re divine, they pause and warn you of going too far. But, isn’t it contradictory to disagree that a child of God is divine? </p>
<p>Being a child of God isn’t merely a religious rhetoric. Rather, it means you’re an associate of the God-kind. You’re a God-man or God-woman. The Bible says, <em>“Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:4</a>).</p>
<p>If you follow the tenses carefully, you’ll realize that this isn’t a promise; He’s already done it. He’s made us partakers of the divine nature. The actual Greek rendering says, “Associates of the God-kind,” like when you say “mankind.” So, who really are you?</p>
<p>If you’re born again, you’ve been brought into the God-kind: a divine pantheon. You have the divine life. The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:13&amp;version=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 5:13 NIV</a>, <em>“I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.”</em></p>
<p>God wants you to know you have eternal life. That’s the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The life you got from your parents when they gave birth to you has been supplanted by eternal life. You now have the divine life that dispels and obliterates all sicknesses, diseases, and afflictions. This is what makes us invincible in life. This life dispels darkness, poverty, failure and death. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For a true servant of our Lord Jesus will not be argumentative but gentle toward all AND SKILLED IN HELPING OTHERS SEE THE TRUTH… (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:24&amp;version=TPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Timothy 2:24 TPT</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>I remember years ago, I was preaching to a class of little children less than ten years old. A trained child evangelist had invited me, and he stood at the back as I preached to the children. While sharing the Word with them, I turned over to the evangelist and saw him weeping profusely.</p>
<p>As I wondered why he was crying, he walked up to me and said, “You just preached Jesus, not only to these children in here, but also to me.” My speech and my preaching to those kids weren’t with enticing words of man&#x27;s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>).</p>
<p>As you grow in your Christian walk, it’s important for you to know how to articulately and effectually communicate the Gospel. As a young preacher, that was one of my biggest concerns; I knew if I didn’t communicate right, people wouldn’t hear me right. If they didn’t hear me right, they wouldn’t believe right. And if they didn’t believe right, their faith would be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>To communicate the Gospel effectively, you have to first give yourself to the study of God’s Word: <em>“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 2:15</a>). When you study the Word and it gets into your spirit, it inspires, transforms, informs, educates, and cultures you.</p>
<p>Also, you have to trust the power of the Holy Spirit to help you convey the message in a way that’ll transform lives. The Lord Jesus said, <em>“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 7:38</a>). This refers to the Holy Spirit pouring out through you.</p>
<p>As the Word enjoins us to be filled with the Spirit, do accordingly. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:18-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:18-20</a> says, <em>“And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Do not be so deceived and misled! Evil companionships (communion, associations) corrupt and deprave good manners and morals and character (1 Corinthians 15:33 AMPC).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Do not be so deceived and misled! Evil companionships (communion, associations) corrupt and deprave good manners and morals and character</strong></em> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:33&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>(1 Corinthians 15:33 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus warned us to be wary of deception. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 24:4</a>, He cautions, <em>“…Take heed that no man deceive you.”</em> In the epistles, the Apostle Paul repeatedly warned of the dangers of deception. Notice what he said in the opening text, <em>“Do not be so deceived and misled...”</em>; because it’s easy to be deceived.</p>
<p>Satan&#x27;s capital strategy in derailing Eve was deception. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2011:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>, Paul captures it; it says, <em>“But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.”</em> Therefore, by understanding how Satan deceived Eve, you can gain insight into how to stay ahead of him and prevent yourself and others from being deceived.</p>
<p>Remember that Paul was speaking to God&#x27;s people when he said, <em>“Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015:34&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 15:34</a>). The knowledge of God keeps your heart in the right place. So, get your mind on the right subject, get your heart in the right direction! The cure for deception, therefore, is the knowledge of the truth: the accurate knowledge of the Word; this will both deliver and protect anyone from deception.</p>
<p>Keep in mind what the Bereans did in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2017:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 17:11</a>: <em>“These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.”</em> Also, note Paul’s admonition to Timothy, <em>“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 2:15</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>Yes, God is more than ready to overwhelm you with every form of grace, so that you will have more than enough of everything —every moment and in every way. He will make you overflow with abundance in every good thing you do (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:8&amp;version=TPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 9:8 TPT</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the ways to live a life of influence, honour and impact in the Kingdom of God is to be a real giver, generous to the cause of the Gospel. It’s so inspiring to see those who are filled with the utmost zeal to spread the Gospel into every nook and cranny of the world. See yourself as responsible for reaching everyone in your world and in regions beyond with the Gospel before the Lord’s return.</p>
<p>Think about the impressive testimony of Rhapsody of Realities devotional being available in all known and active languages of the world, making it the most translated material in the whole world. This happened because many around the world made themselves available, giving their time and resources to see that billions of people can read the message of the Gospel in their native language. You can choose to be a part of this today.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever. Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness)”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%209:9-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 9:9-10</a>).</p>
<p>Giving is righteousness, and by sowing seeds of righteousness, you produce fruits of righteousness. He says, “his righteousness remaineth forever.” Yes, Christ has made you righteous, but there’re fruits of righteousness and they come from your works of righteousness. Works of righteousness are seeds of righteousness, and being manifested primarily in your giving, they’ll return in an abundant harvest. Amen.</p>

<p><em><strong>But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Obadiah%201:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Obadiah 1:17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Lord spoke through Moses concerning Joshua and Caleb and said, <em>“...The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance, you and your children&#x27;s, forever. Yes, you have lived totally for GOD”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2014:9&amp;version=MSG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua 14:9 MSG</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord had said specifically to Caleb, “Hebron shall be yours,  ” but Hebron had giants—the Anakims— who were in large walled cities. Caleb was unfazed; he professed that he was just as strong to possess the land as he was forty-five years prior when he spied out the land; very inspiring!</p>
<p>Caleb converted the inheritance to a possession; he took possession of Hebron and it became his and his family’s land to this day (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%2014:13-14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua 14:13-14</a>). It&#x27;s one thing to have an inheritance, but it’s another thing to have it in your possession. An inheritance can be allotted to you, but “the giants” might try to prevent you from taking possession of it. But you should stand your ground in faith and declare, “In the Name of Jesus, I take possession of all that belongs to me in Christ Jesus!”</p>
<p>The Lord has qualified and made you fit to become a partaker of the glorious inheritance of the saints in light; there’s an inheritance for you (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:12</a>). Let nothing cheat you out of God’s best. By the power of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God in your mouth, take full possession of all that’s yours in Christ, irrespective of the circumstances.</p>
<p>As you study and meditate on the Word, not only will you discover your inheritance in Christ, but you’ll also begin to relate with and enjoy all that God has made available to you. The inheritance was already yours, but through the knowledge of God’s Word and your faith-filled words, you take possession. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2026:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Isaiah 26:2</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll like you to observe two things that qualify a nation to come into the gates of God. The first is righteousness. The second is that the nation must have and walk in the truth. What nation is this custodian and observer of the truth?</p>
<p>God’s Word is Truth, and His truth was given to us in Christ Jesus. Thus, the Church of Christ is this nation that keeps the truth. Paul, writing to Timothy in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%203:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 3:15</a> called the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth. We belong in the Church which is the custodian of the truth. The Church is a righteous nation. We’re God-like in true righteousness and holiness (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:24</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). Everyone who has accepted Jesus as Lord and Saviour has been made righteous!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:24&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:24</a> (AMPC), Paul highlights that we were created in true righteousness and holiness: <em>“And put on the new nature (the regenerate self) created in God&#x27;s image, [Godlike] in true righteousness and holiness.”</em> If you walk with sin consciousness, you wouldn’t know that you’re righteous. But His gate is opened to the righteous ones—the Church! What a blessing!</p>
<p>Peter corroborates this in his first epistle when he called us a holy nation: <em>“But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God&#x27;s] own purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:9 AMPC</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Mark 4:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the most profound principles in the Word of God that guarantees a continuous increase in finances is the principle of giving. Your giving is a channel to facilitate your receiving, for there can be no receiving without first giving.</p>
<p>Sadly, a lot of people give to God with the mentality of lack or loss. No; that’s not wise. Such a mentality stops the miracle of receiving from taking place. Kingdom consciousness of giving is different. When you give to God, be more conscious of the promise on your giving.</p>
<p>Remember what Jesus said about the sower who sowed his seeds on good ground. He said it yielded fruits that sprang up and increased and brought forth thirty, sixty, and a hundred fold harvest (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 4:8</a>). So, you could have a thirtyfold return, a sixtyfold return, or a hundredfold return on your giving.</p>
<p>With the right mentality, you can set in motion all the miracle-power of God to cause a thirtyfold, a sixtyfold, or a hundredfold return on what you’ve given! Train yourself to become positive with God in your giving. When next you give an offering or a seed to God, do it with the mentality of someone who is in the Kingdom and you’ll have amazing testimonies.</p>

<p>However, these things are essentially determined by the content and quality of your mind. When your mind is stayed on the Lord and His Word, you’ll experience perfect prosperity, health, rest, and strength. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>Your mind is very important to God. That’s where He seeks to work. If He can get a hold of your mind, you can be everything He wants you to be. You can become as healthy, prosperous, and successful as you ever want to be. So, it begins with the mind. Why is your mind so important? It’s because God has fashioned the mind as the instrument for your transformation.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12:2</a>). There’re no limits to what you can achieve, and absolutely no restrictions to how high you can propel yourself in the highway of victory when your mind is governed and regulated by the Word.</p>
<p>With your mind established on the Word, the possibilities are endless. So always fix your mind on the beautiful realities of the Word. It’s an effective way to create the ideal framework and system for your life and make the most of the unique life and blessings God has given you.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Holy Spirit is the one who gives life, that which is of the natural realm is of no help. The words I speak to you are Spirit and life... (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206:63&amp;version=TPT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 6:63 TPT</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 19:20</a> tells us that in the city of Ephesus, <em>“So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.”</em> This is no surprise at all because when you study <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%202:2-3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 2:2-3</a>, the Apostle John, by divine revelation, unveiled the state of the Ephesian church. It was a very spiritual church.</p>
<p>However, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:14-16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 3:14-16</a>, the Apostle Paul prayed for them and said, <em>“For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man.”</em></p>
<p>He said, “I am praying for you that God would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened (invigorated) with might—miracle-working ability. He’s emphasizing the importance of giving recognition to the working of God’s Word in our lives and the working of the Holy Spirit in our Christian growth.</p>
<p>Another version says to be strengthened with excellence by the Holy Spirit in your inner man; so that what you learn of God’s Word will not just be in your head but working by the Holy Spirit in your life. He’s talking about the power of God’s Word and the Holy Spirit working out that which is the perfect will of God in your life so that your Christianity will be effective and evincive.</p>

<p><em><strong>Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2022:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Proverbs 22:24</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’re many things that could deface one’s beauty in the spirit; one of them is anger. Our opening verse says, <em>“Don&#x27;t hang out with angry people; don&#x27;t keep company with hotheads”</em> (MSG). In other words, avoid them. When God tells you to avoid something or someone, you better take it seriously.</p>
<p>You might say, “I only get angry once in a while”; no! Anger is a quick destroyer; avoid it! Don’t even try to “tame” it; banish it. If you’ve been termed or described as someone who’s hotheaded and quick to anger, get before the Lord in prayer and ask the Holy Spirit to help you deal with anger. Then give yourself to the Word in meditation.</p>
<p>Don’t try to suppress anger; get rid of it. You may say to me, “Pastor Chris; I&#x27;ve always had anger in me since I was much younger, and by following God all through the years, I’ve been able to suppress my anger with the Word.” That’s wonderful, but God doesn’t want you at that level. It’s not a matter of suppressing the anger with the Word, it&#x27;s a matter of not even allowing anger any space in your life.</p>
<p>Harbouring anger has resulted in some deadly ailments and unexplainable challenges in the health of many people. But I tell you, if they’d eschew anger, they’ll be healthy. The Bible says anger dwells in the bosom of fools (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%207:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a>). And in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20107:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 107:17</a>, who does the Bible say are afflicted? Fools! <em>“Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.”</em></p>
<p>The scriptures are replete with verses that admonish us against anger. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2037:8&amp;version=cev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 37:8</a> (CEV), the Bible says, <em>“Don&#x27;t be angry or furious. Anger can lead to sin.”</em> Paul, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:31&amp;version=ampc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:31</a> (AMPC) warns, <em>“Let all bitterness and indignation and wrath (passion, rage, bad temper) and resentment (anger, animosity) …be banished from you….”</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:8</a>, he also tells us, <em>“But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.”</em> Banish anger from your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success (Joshua 1:8).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua%201:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Joshua 1:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s a word I’ll like you to notice in the opening text. It’s the word, “observe”. Many Bible scholars have had difficulty interpreting it; they’ve wrestled for years with that terminology. To them, it means “that you may understand how to do”; but that’s not it.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word translated observe is “shamar”; it means to watch for the purpose of doing. It’s like looking out for something so you can do; “copying to do” or “hearing to do”! Following what the Lord told Joshua, if you’d meditate on the Word as you should, you’d be propelled to do what the Word says.</p>
<p>Paul alludes to this in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippians 2:13</a> when he said, <em>“For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”</em> This is akin to what the Lord said to Joshua in the theme verse. Do you want to be successful, prosperous, and deal wisely in the affairs of life? Do you want to be able to help other people become successful and prosperous? Meditate on the Word, day and night.</p>
<p>Meditating on the Word will give you an understanding, a motivation, and an inspiration to do what God wants you to do. Practice this for at least half an hour every day. [Psalm 1:1-3](<a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Psalm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Psalm</a> 1:1-3 kjv) further tells us the overwhelming blessings this will produce in your life: you’ll be standing firm like a flourishing tree planted by God’s design, deeply rooted by the brooks of bliss, bearing fruit in every season of life; never dry, never fainting, but ever blessed and unendingly prosperous. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2047:6-7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 47:6-7</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The scriptures give us more than enough information on God&#x27;s relationship with us and how He defines His role as God, as Lord, and as our Father. In each of these roles, He expresses Himself differently. He also wants us to know our role: the various roles we play with respect to Him, His Kingdom, one another, and the world.</p>
<p>However, in every single role that we play, He expects us to praise Him. Thus, the primary reason we come together as God&#x27;s people is to offer praises to God. For a long time, this seemed to have taken a back seat in the Church, but thank God there’s been a change!</p>
<p>God’s people all over the world, by the Spirit, are recognizing their role as priests to offer sacrifices of praise to God. That’s our primary calling. He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:9</a>, <em>“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.”</em></p>
<p>When we live according to our calling to offer praise to the Lord—extolling His greatness and worshipping His holy Name—we will most certainly enjoy the fullness of the blessings of the Gospel of Christ as Paul puts it in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2015:29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 15:29</a>. It’s God’s will for us.</p>
<p>Even now, begin to praise the Lord! Remember, praise must have content; therefore, offer to the Lord words of praise and thanksgiving; make confessions of His greatness, grace and glory. Declare that there’s none like Him, for His Kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion endures from generation to generation. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah%209:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Nehemiah 9:12</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The opening verse brings to mind what happened to the children of Israel as they journeyed out of Egypt. The Bible tells us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2013:21-22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus 13:21-22,</a> that they carried their own atmosphere through the wilderness for forty years.</p>
<p>Nehemiah also referenced this atmosphere of bliss in which the children of Israel lived. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah%209:21&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nehemiah 9:21 (AMPC)</a> says, <em>“Forty years You sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.”</em></p>
<p>The Lord hasn’t changed. The Father’s loving-kindness didn’t end with the children of Israel; it’s even better with us today. When you were born again, you were born into God’s glory; born into God’s spiritual cloud; that’s the Holy Spirit. You live in His presence, in a divine atmosphere of joy, bliss and glory, where you’re sustained and nurtured by Him, absolutely independent of circumstances. You’re fully at rest.</p>
<p>Those who live outside this atmosphere of bliss are the ones who face disappointments, anger, frustration, and discomfort; always agitated from within because nothing seems to be going on right.</p>
<p>But in Christ, which is the supernatural environment you were born into, your joy and satisfaction overflows. His presence in, with, and about you makes you an oasis of love in a troubled world. Be mindful of this always. There could be chaos or anarchy everywhere, but in Him, you’re at peace and in safety. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him (Ephesians 1:17).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In his beautiful prayer for the Ephesian church, the Apostle Paul referred to our heavenly Father as the “Father of glory.” That’s quite instructive. He isn’t saying that God is a “glorious Father,” but that He’s the Father of glory. It tells you who you are; you are “Glory!” That’s your Name.</p>
<p>If a man is called the father of John, then it means he has a son called John. If God is the Father of Glory, and you’re His son (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 3:1</a>), then your name is “Glory!” You might say, “Pastor Chris, that&#x27;s just a conjecture”; no! What is Jesus called?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 1:3</a> says He’s the brightness of God’s glory, and the express image of His person. Jesus is the effulgence of God&#x27;s glory; He&#x27;s the manifestation of the glory of God. Jesus is the glory of God encapsulated in a body. And the Bible says in 1 <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 4:17</a> that as He is, so are we in this world.</p>
<p>Making us His glory is part of what He came to do. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%202:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 2:10</a> says, “<em>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory….”</em> Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:18&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 3:18 (AMPC)</a> tells us something remarkable. It says, *“And all of us, as with unveiled face, [because we] continued to behold [in the Word of God] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are constantly being transfigured into His very own image in ever increasing splendour….”*Observe that it says the Word of God is a mirror, just as James also tells us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:23</a>. </p>
<p>But here’s the most beautiful part: When you look in a mirror, you see yourself. Now, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 3:18</a> says when you look in the mirror of God, you see the glory of God. How can you see the glory of God in the mirror, if you are not the glory of God? Every good mirror reflects or projects the image before it. If your reflection is called the glory of God when you look into the mirror of God (the Word of God), then you are the glory of God. Praise God!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord (2 Corinthians 3:18 NKJV).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%203:18&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>2 Corinthians 3:18 NKJV</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>God gave us His Word to enable us see ourselves the way He sees us, understand things from His perspective, and live to fulfil His perfect will. God’s Word reveals God’s image and opinion of you, which is the image and opinion He wants you to have of yourself.</p>
<p>So as you study the Word and see your true image and identity, retain the picture; don’t forget who you are. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:23-24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:23-24</a> says, <em>“For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: <strong>For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Observe the underlined portion. Interestingly, it doesn’t say that the one who doesn’t do the Word forgot what he looked like”; rather, it says such a fellow is like a man who looks carefully at his own natural face in a mirror, thoughtfully observes himself, and then goes off and forgets “the kind” or “the type” of man that he saw.</p>
<p>God&#x27;s Word reveals the type or kind of person you are; the “species” of being that you are. That&#x27;s extraordinary. For example, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:4</a>, the mirror—the Word—shows that you’re a partaker of the divine nature, an associate of the God-kind.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:22</a>, the mirror shows that you’re seated together with Christ, and all things are under your feet. You have dominion over all things. You reign victoriously over Satan, sickness, failure and death. Hallelujah! This is who you are according to God’s Word; live accordingly. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord (1 Corinthians 1:9).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Corinthians 1:9</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>I’m ever so grateful to the Lord for all that He’s made possible and available to us in Christ Jesus. Think about the possibility of fellowship with God. You wouldn’t find that in any religion, as no religion offers you fellowship with God. But Jesus brought us into fellowship with God. What an amazing reality!</p>
<p>In our prayers, for example, there’re special kinds of communications with God that help us build our spirits, because we&#x27;re in a rich fellowship with the Lord. The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 1:3</a>, <em>“That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.”</em></p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 1:9</a> says, <em>“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.”</em> The Apostle Peter takes it further in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3-4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3-4</a>. He says, <em>“According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature….”</em></p>
<p>The Greek word that&#x27;s translated “partakers” comes from the same root word as fellowship; it’s “Koinonia.” Thus, “partakers of the divine nature” is translated from “koinonos theias phuseos,” and that means associates of the God-kind. This implies that we&#x27;ve been brought into the fellowship of the divine, heavenly pantheon.</p>
<p>No wonder the Bible says, <em>“…Ye are gods…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2082:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 82:6</a>). The Lord Jesus, quoting the psalms, reiterated this truth in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:34&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:34</a>, <em>“…Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?”</em> This is the wonder of Christianity; it’s the whole essence of the Lord’s death, burial and His glorious resurrection.</p>
<p>How beautiful it is to know that we’re in fellowship with the Sovereign King, the Monarch of the universe, as John so succinctly puts it in 1 John 1:3. You’ve been translated from the ordinary realm of mankind to the supernatural class of the God-kind, where you can enjoy true, deep and quality fellowship and union with divinity. What a blessing!</p>

<p><em><strong>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 6:33</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In our walk with God, it’s important to always keep in focus our purpose in the earth; why are we here? Our primary purpose is to establish and extend the Kingdom of God to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Habakkuk%202:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habakkuk 2:14</a>). It’s our responsibility to make this happen. It’s our job!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 28:19</a> conveys the mandate of the Master; He instructed, <em>“Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”</em> In essence, He wants us to make students or pupils of the nations. What a calling!</p>
<p>There are many who think God is running this world by Himself and so whatever happens is His will. If that were true, why would Jesus teach His disciples to pray in this manner, <em>“…Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%206:9-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 6:9-10</a>). Why admonish them to pray that way if God’s will is always being done in the earth? We pray that way because it&#x27;s our responsibility to enforce His will in the earth.</p>
<p>God&#x27;s will is always done in heaven, but in the earth, only God’s people can pray His will into manifestation. So, in prayer, speak forth salvation in your city, your state and in your country. Pray that righteousness fills the land and the Gospel has free course and is glorified, resulting in a massive harvest of souls into the Kingdom. Amen.</p>

<p><em><strong>Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>James 5:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>There’s no hopeless situation that we can’t change through prayer. Read our theme scripture in the Amplified Classic; it says, <em>“…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working].”</em> Our prayers are not empty.</p>
<p>Think about Paul and Silas for a moment. They were captured, beaten, and thrown into a dungeon with their feet clamped in stocks. But the Bible records in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2016:25-26&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 16:25-26</a> that: <em>“…at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one&#x27;s bands were loosed.”</em></p>
<p>How remarkable this is! Two men prayed and sang praises to God, and there was an earthquake! How loud could they have been singing for their voices to have caused an earthquake and broken off all the prisoners’ chains? It lets you know that it certainly wasn’t the volume of their singing; it was the power of their prayer!</p>
<p>There’s nothing you can’t change through prayer. Therefore, make prayer a major feature in your life and a major part of your daily routine. It will strengthen you and help you maintain focus even in the face of the toughest temptations and persecutions.</p>

<p><em><strong>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022:40-42&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 22:40-42</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>No one exemplified the power of prayer in overcoming temptation better than our Lord Jesus. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%205:7&amp;version=ampc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 5:7</a> gives us an idea why He prayed to the Father the way He did in our theme scripture: He (Jesus) <em>“...shrank from the horrors of separation from the bright presence of the Father”</em> (AMPC).</p>
<p>That separation from the Father was what He never wanted to experience even for a moment. As a result, He knelt and prayed, and as He did, something remarkable happened: <em>“…there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022:43&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 22:43</a>). The <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022:44&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44th verse</a> says, <em>“And being in an agony he</em>(Jesus) <em>prayed more earnestly….”</em></p>
<p>Remember, the earnest prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available, dynamic in its working (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%205:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 5:16</a>). Jesus, being in agony, prayed more earnestly. His prayer was so intense that the Bible says <em>“...His sweat became like great clots of blood dropping down upon the ground&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022:44&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 22:44 AMPC</a>).</p>
<p>Thanks be unto God; His prayer was answered. He submitted Himself to the will of the Father by becoming sin for us so we would become the righteousness of God in Him. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>When He was done praying, He said something instructive to His disciples as seen in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022:45-46&amp;version=niv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 22:45-46</a>: <em>“When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. “Why are you sleeping?” he asked them. “Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation”</em> (NIV). The problem isn’t being tempted, but falling into the temptation. Jesus here shows us we must pray to avoid falling into temptation.</p>
<p>Remember, He was about to experience the horror of being separated from the Father, and had to wrestle with the temptation to say, “No, I’m not doing this!” He knew He had to pray, because He had Himself taught that <em>“...Men ought always to pray, and not to faint”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2018:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 18:1</a>). </p>
<p>Like the Master, give yourself to prayer. In the place of prayer, your spirit is conditioned to discern and walk in God’s perfect will, and your faith is strengthened to overcome temptations and rule over circumstances. You’re invigorated with the might of the Spirit to live victoriously every day. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Colossians 1:9</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Book of Genesis tells the touching story of Abraham and his nephew, Lot. When God called Abraham to leave his homeland for a foreign country, Lot journeyed with him (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2012:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 12:4</a>). As God blessed Abraham in his pilgrimage, Lot was also blessed. They were both so blessed that the land where they sojourned at some point could no longer contain their herds. </p>
<p>Fighting often broke out between Abraham’s herdsmen and Lot’s, until Abraham said, <em>“…Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren. Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2013:8-9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 13:8-9</a>).</p>
<p>This was where Lot’s problem began. He looked at the lush green plains of Jordan on one side and the dry patch of land on the other. He chose the luxuriant side, and pitched his tent near Sodom, a land of wickedness, not knowing that God’s judgement was imminent upon Sodom. </p>
<p>When God rained fire on Sodom as retribution for the iniquity of its people, Lot’s life was spared as a result of Abraham’s intercession. But he (Lot) lost everything he owned in the crisis and ended up in a cave. This happened to Lot simply because he missed God; not because he was a bad person. In fact, the Bible says that Lot was a righteous man (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%202:7-8&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 2:7-8 NIV</a>).</p>
<p>So in your life, the best place to be, always, is at the centre of God’s will. Never be carried away by the allures of this world. The choices you make shouldn’t be based on the cravings of the flesh, but according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. For example, don’t relocate to a particular city or country simply because of its economic prospects. You could be making a costly mistake. The Bible says, <em>“There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death”</em> ([Proverbs 14:12](<a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Proverbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Proverbs</a> 14:12 kjv)).</p>

<p><em><strong>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him (1 John 2:15).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 2:15</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Timothy%201:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1Timothy 1:5</a> says, <em>“Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.”</em> A pure heart is a heart that loves the Lord truly and believes His Word absolutely (without any questions or doubts).</p>
<p>Something you should do often is to check the condition of your heart that it’s pure towards God in love. Your love for Him must be unfeigned. In reviewing what we read in our opening verse, the example of Demas, a certain character in the Bible, readily comes to mind.</p>
<p>Demas worked closely with Luke, the writer of the “Gospel of Luke” and “Acts of the Apostles.” He also worked very closely with the great Apostle Paul. In fact, Paul listed him among his fellow-labourers in the Gospel: <em>“Epaphras, who is one of you, a bondservant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers…Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%204:12-14&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 4:12-14 NKJV</a>).</p>
<p>Paul also mentioned him in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philemon%201:23-24&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philemon 1:23-24 NKJV</a>: <em>“Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.”</em> So, Demas was a co-labourer with Paul. He was in very good company, and had a ministry to fulfil.</p>
<p>But in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%204:9-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Timothy 4:9-10</a>, Paul tells Timothy: <em>“Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me: For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica....”</em> This explains why some people start well and end up badly: their love for the Lord is not genuine. Paul said Demas forsook him, because he loved the world. You can’t love the Father and love the world at the same time. To love this world is to not have the love of the Father in you.</p>
<p>All the while Demas was labouring with Paul, Luke and the other ministers of the Gospel, he was lusting after the world and the things of this world. And for that reason, he ultimately couldn’t fulfil his divine destiny and purpose.</p>
<p>Love the Lord with a pure heart. Serve Him truly. Let Him be all that matters to you, for the Bible says, <em>“Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 6:24</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him (1 John 2:15).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 2:15</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>This was one of the first Bible verses that impressed upon my young, receptive mind as an eight-year-old. It’s God’s declaration, and it’s final. It says if you love the world, the love of the Father isn’t in you. You may confess a thousand times that you love God, but if you’re in love with the world or the things of the world, the love of the Father isn’t in you.</p>
<p>Some have asked, “Why would God tell us not to love the world when the Bible says, ‘For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son? Why can’t we also love the world like the Father did?’”</p>
<p>God loved the world of men; not the systems and the things therein. He loved the people and sent Jesus, His Son, to save them from their sins; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 2:16</a> says, <em>“For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.”</em> The Scripture is admonishing us against worldliness and carnality.</p>
<p>Refuse to be influenced or carried away by the spirit of the world. The Bible says, <em>“…know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%204:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 4:4</a>).</p>
<p>As saints of God, we shouldn’t engage in unspiritual discussions where sometimes they spend hours arguing about their favourite sport teams and almost get into fisticuffs. They spend hours watching movies and TV shows, but when it’s time to pray or study the Word, they fall asleep.</p>
<p>Don’t get carried away and sucked in by such things to the point that they drive your life and distract you from your purpose. You’re in this world for a divine purpose. So, think differently and be conscious of that higher purpose for which God in Christ has called you.</p>

<p><em><strong>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness…And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204:31-33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 4:31-33</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Scriptures give a vivid account of an extraordinary prayer meeting that the members of the early Church had following the threats from the religious council. It records that as they prayed, the entire building where they were gathered shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the Word of God with boldness. </p>
<p>Notice the resultant effect of being filled with the Holy Spirit: they went forth and preached the Word of God with boldness—the very thing they had been threatened to desist from or face dire consequences. They had already received the Holy Spirit in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:1-4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 2:1-4</a>. But in Chapter 4, they were filled again with that same Holy Spirit whom they had earlier received.</p>
<p>The Bible charges us, “...be not drunk with wine wherein is excess; but be filled with the spirit.&quot; The International Standard Version says, “Keep on being filled with the Spirit,” speaking to yourself in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord&quot; (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:18-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:18-20</a>). When you’re filled with the Spirit, you’re not timid or intimidated; you preach the Gospel with boldness and power.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve been desiring to preach the Gospel to the people you work with, but it seems you’ve been shy or afraid. Get filled with the Holy Spirit! Pray in tongues until you’re supercharged—speaking to yourself in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.</p>
<p>Soon enough, you won’t need to be prompted, instructed or encouraged by anyone to witness to those around you. Jesus said, <em>“He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers (gushers) of living water”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%207:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 7:38</a>). You won’t have to force it out; there’ll be an overflow, and the Word will issue forth from your lips with power. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 10:38</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%209&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 9</a>, the disciples, walking alongside Jesus saw a man who had been born blind. They asked, “Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?” As far as they were concerned, God in His justice system was punishing the blind man or his parents for their sin. What a mindset!</p>
<p>Read the Master’s response: <em>“Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work”</em> (<a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/John%209:3-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 9:3-4</a>). Many read this and run off with the idea that the man’s blindness is one of the “works of God.” That’s erroneous!</p>
<p>The translators, on their own prerogative, put a punctuation—a full stop at the end of the 3rd verse— that should have never been there. The more accurate rendering is, <em>“…that the works of God should be made manifest in him, I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day.”</em></p>
<p>Jesus was saying, “In this blind man, we see the work of Satan, but for the work of God to be manifest in him, I have to do something about it!” He then went ahead and healed the man. Hallelujah! The work of blindness didn&#x27;t come from God. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 10:38</a> tells us, “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.”</p>
<p>The oppression came from the devil, but the Father sent Jesus, anointed with the Holy Ghost and with power, to heal and restore maimed limbs, give sight to the blind, mend the brokenhearted, deliver those who are oppressed of the devil, and even raise the dead. These are the works of God! Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>…If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; AND NOTHING SHALL BE IMPOSSIBLE UNTO YOU (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2017:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 17:20</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Lord isn’t responsible for the evils or the mishaps that people experience; it’s not consistent with His nature. He is love personified; there’s no darkness in Him. Whatever you may have suffered that’s inconsistent with the provisions of Christ in His Gospel didn’t come from God. You’re responsible for your life—the things that happen with you. It’s about your faith and how you use it.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said in our opening scripture, <em>“… nothing shall be impossible unto you.”</em> This is a sovereign declaration; so, the question is, what are you doing with your faith? How are you putting your faith to work? The Bible says, <em>“Now the just shall live by faith…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2010:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 10:38</a>).</p>
<p>Using your faith to deal with the crises of life every day is your responsibility. But the problem is some have made their faith void or of non-effect: <em>“For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 4:14</a>). Can faith be made void? Emphatically yes!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%207:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 7:13</a>, Jesus rebuked the Jews for making God’s Word of non-effect by their tradition. “Tradition” here refers to your way of life, your culture, and the things you believe. If these things are inconsistent with the Word of God, you make the Word of non-effect in your life, and your faith is made void.</p>
<p>Your trust must always be in the finished works of Christ; live by His faith (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%202:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galatians 2:20</a>). Hallelujah! How do you live by His faith? It’s by living the Word, being a doer of the Word. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:22&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:22</a> says, <em>“But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.”</em></p>
