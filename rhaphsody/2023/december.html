<p><em><strong>…He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His [own] right hand in the heavenly [places], Far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named [above every title that can be conferred], not only in this age and in this world, but also in the age and the world which are to come (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:20-21&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:20-21 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Many today still don’t understand the authority that’s vested in the Name of Jesus and the power of attorney given to us to use it. That’s why they’ve never fully enjoyed the benefits of it. Jesus has a Name that’s superior to all titles of authority in this world and in the next. So learn to use His Name.</p>
<p>The Weymouth New Testament describes the transcendent greatness of His power and might, the supremacy and dominion of His Name, His reign and glory both in this age and in the age to come. He’s in the <em>“… heavenly realms, high above all other government and authority and power and dominion, and every title of sovereignty used either in this Age or in the Age to come”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:20-21&amp;version=WNT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:20-21 WNT</a>).</p>
<p>The most beautiful part is that His authority, rulership, reign and dominion are for the good of the Church: “…Christ rules over all forces, authorities, powers, and rulers. He rules over all beings in this world and will rule in the future world as well. God has put all things under the power of Christ, and for the good of the church he has made him the head of everything” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:21-22&amp;version=CEV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:21-22 CEV</a>). </p>
<p>He is all that He is for our advantage. His Name wields all the power that it wields for our benefit: <em>“...God has put all things under the authority of Christ, and he gave him this authority <strong>for the benefit of the church</strong>”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:22&amp;version=NLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:22 NLT</a>).</p>
<p>Never live as a victim. Don’t live an ordinary life. Use the Name of Jesus. He said, “All authority is given unto me in heaven and in earth.” Then on the basis of that authority, He said, <em>“Go ye therefore…”</em> (Matthew 28:19). Devils, angels, life, death, hell, the world, circumstances, living and non-living things hear and respond to us in His Name. Therefore, be conscious of the transcendent greatness of His Name; live and do all things in His Name (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:17</a>).</p>

<p>It’s important that you always testify of God’s goodness and the victories He’s wrought in you and through you. Our opening verse says, <em>“…they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony….”</em> Learn to testify always! Let your environment feel the impact of your testimonies.</p>
<p>Firstly, testify the Word. Declare the Word as it concerns you. Say what the Word says. Secondly, testify of His works of grace and love. Now, apart from your testimonies glorifying God and inspiring faith in others, they also cause Satan and his demons to take notice of you and flee from you.</p>
<p>Demons really can’t tell what you think or know, but when they hear your testimonies, they’ll transmit the message to their cohorts to stay away from you, because they can see that you know who you are. This is because they’re very proud figures and they don’t like to be disgraced. They know if they try to mess around you, you’ll cast them out.</p>
<p>So, make it a habit to always testify of the power of God, the integrity of His Word, and the power of the Spirit in your life. Not only will it cause you to experience more blessings, it causes consternation in hell. Never consider anything the Lord does for you or through you to be too small to talk about. There’s power in your testimony to completely neutralize the adversary and cause him to back off.</p>
<p>It makes no difference what daunting challenges the enemy throws at you—testify that the greater One lives in you; therefore, you’re marvellously helped of the Lord and have overcome the adversary and all adversities. As you do, the Lord’s power and glory will be manifested in your situation. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis 3</a> tells us that the serpent beguiled Eve. He is further described as “the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 12:9</a>). In the 10th verse of <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 12</a>, he is called <em>“...the accuser of our brethren....”</em> Peter, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%205:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 5:8</a> calls him your adversary: <em>“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”</em></p>
<p>An adversary is an enemy, an opponent, an opposer. Some people are trying to make Satan look good by introducing new songs with lyrics that portray him as your friend. Don&#x27;t be deceived; Satan is not and could never be your friend! He’s your adversary, howbeit, a defeated one.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:3-4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 4:3-4</a> pens another identity of Satan’s personality, referring to him as the god of this world. But thanks be unto God; you’re not of this world! You don’t belong in Satan’s jurisdiction; therefore, he’s not in any way a factor, because you’re superior to him; give him no place or chance in your life.</p>
<p>You have dominion over Satan and the rulers of darkness to keep them defeated, to keep them subdued under your feet. The Lord Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 10:19</a>, <em>“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Therefore we are buried with him by  baptism into death: that like as Christ  was raised up from the dead by the glory  of the Father, even so we also should  walk in newness of life (Romans 6:4).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 6:4</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Many don’t realize that the Christian isn’t actually the “redeemed.” If Christianity were all about redemption or salvation from sin, there wouldn’t have been the need for Jesus to rise from the dead. His death on the Cross would have been enough; it paid for all our sins and guaranteed complete propitiation. But that’s redemption and not Christianity.</p>
<p>Redemption refers to saving someone by paying a price. So when Jesus died, He paid the price for man’s redemption with His own life; He did that for all humanity, not for Christians. The Christian is the result of Christ’s resurrection, not His death.</p>
<p>This should make it clearer: when Jesus hung on the Cross, in the mind of God, every human person was hanging on the Cross too (in Him), for He was our substitute. When He cried out, “It is finished” and gave up the ghost, we also died in Him. Hallelujah! Now, when He came out of the grave, when He resurrected, we were also in Him.</p>
<p>That’s the big thing which Satan didn’t see coming and the angels still marvel at and seek to look into: Christianity is based on the resurrection of Jesus and not on His death. The resurrection of Jesus Christ gave us something far beyond redemption; it ushered us into a newness of life. We’ve been raised up together with Christ (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 2:6</a>).</p>
<p>Romans 10:9 lets us know that salvation comes by believing in the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and the subsequent confession of His lordship. A Christian, therefore, is one who identifies with the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>Thus, just as Christ was raised from the dead into a newness of life, the Christian has no past. That’s why the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>: <em>“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature...”</em>; meaning that he is a new species, one that never existed before.</p>
<p>Being born again, therefore, you’re not the “redeemed”; you’re the fruit of the redemptive work of Christ. Redemption was consummated with His death, but Christianity came from the resurrection. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>But test and prove all things [until you can recognize] what is good; [to that] hold fast (1 Thessalonians 5:21 AMPC).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>But test and prove all things [until you can recognize] what is good; [to that] hold fast (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thessalonians%205:21&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 Thessalonians 5:21 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In Romans chapter 12, the Spirit of God, through the Apostle Paul, lets us in on something absolutely remarkable. He says, <em>“And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God”</em>(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 12:2</a>). How do you renew your mind?</p>
<p>It’s by changing your way of thinking, exchanging your thoughts for God’s thoughts. And when that happens, you’ll be able to “prove” the good, the acceptable and the perfect will of God.</p>
<p>The English rendering of the word “prove” doesn’t give us the best expression of what the Spirit conveys in that verse. The Greek word is “dokimazo”; and it means to examine or scrutinize. It parallels the activities at the customs service section at the entry port of any country. Passengers are scrutinized, and in high-alert cases sophisticated machines are used to provide animated images of suspicious items. At that moment, the traveller’s eligibility is ascertained either for entry or denial into that country.</p>
<p>You’re God&#x27;s man or woman who decides, after scrutinizing, to allow only things that are consistent with the good, acceptable and perfect will of the Father to come into your world. This is easy to understand because we are His righteous ones; we give vent to His glory; we give vent to His will. It&#x27;s our calling. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Recall the words of the Master in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 16:19</a>: <em>“… whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”</em> When you disallow or permit something on earth, heaven gives the authority and backs what you’ve said.</p>
<p>Consciously and vehemently refuse the works of evil and forbid them in your nation, in your body, family, job and around you. Allow only the divine realities of the Kingdom into your world. It begins with the renewing or transformation of your mind. With a renewed mind, you’ll think, permit and express only God’s thoughts, His righteousness, love, kindness, joy and peace in your life and your environment. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus brought and offered the Kingdom to the Jews; He preached to them saying, “The kingdom of God is at hand” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 3:2</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 4:17</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201:14-15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 1:14-15</a>; <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 10:9</a>).</p>
<p>However, they rejected His message and turned down His offer of the Kingdom. As a result, He declared to them, <em>&quot;Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit”</em>(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2021:43&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 21:43 NIV</a>).</p>
<p>The Kingdom was offered, and all those who accepted its message received eternal life. Christians are those who have accepted the message of the Kingdom, received eternal life into their spirits, and are now members— citizens and heirs of that Kingdom.</p>
<p>No wonder the Bible tells us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:16-17&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:16-17 (NKJV</a>), <em>&quot;The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs--heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.”</em></p>
<p>Despite living in a world filled with wickedness and evil, He has granted us this extraordinary privilege to be heirs of His Kingdom. We’re not of this world. We don&#x27;t belong in Satan’s realm; we’re not under Satan’s jurisdiction or authority.</p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:13</a> that God has delivered us from the power of darkness and translated us into the Kingdom of His Love-son. Blessed be God! Also, He’s made us kings and priests in His glorious Kingdom to produce fruits of the Kingdom—fruits of righteousness and eternal life.</p>
<p>We’re the ones Peter referred to when he said, <em>“But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light”</em>(<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:9</a>).

<p><em><strong>And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 16:15</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Oftentimes, we’ve witnessed certain people being promoted, honoured, esteemed, and respected by men. However, while men may promote and esteem from the outside, it is God who truly knows the heart. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 16:15</a> tells us that what is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Haman in the Bible, a wicked and malevolent fellow. Haman served as an advisor to King Ahasuerus in the Persian Empire and was greatly respected and promoted to the highest-ranking office in the government. Yet, his heart was filled with hatred and evil intentions.</p>
<p>Haman’s wickedness was evident in his intense hatred for Mordecai, a Jewish man who refused to bow down to him. He even plotted to exterminate all the Jews and spearheaded a decree to annihilate them. But through the heartfelt prayers of the Jews, the Lord foiled his evil plans, and in the end, Haman faced the consequences of his wickedness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2017:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeremiah 17:10</a> reminds us that God searches the heart and examines the mind, getting to the root of things. He sees men as they truly are, not as they pretend to be. Similarly, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%2016:7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Samuel 16:7</a> tells us that God looks beyond outward appearances and sees the heart.</p>
<p>So, as you journey through life, be mindful of your heart and intentions. Don&#x27;t deceive yourself, thinking that you can deceive others, for the Bible says God cannot be mocked.

<p><em><strong>But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked (1 John 2:5-6).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him. He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:5-6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 2:5-6</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Being born again, the love of God is already perfected in us. His love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who lives within us (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:5</a>). It’s no use praying, <em>“O, Lord put more of your love in my heart!”</em> No! You possess the fullness of God&#x27;s love in your heart. You can love as He loves. That’s why the Bible enjoins us to <em>“…walk, even as he walked&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 2:6</a>).</p>
<p>If you claim to abide in Christ, you should live as He did; emulate Him. He was love personified. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:1-2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:1-2</a> tells us to emulate Him in our love-walk: <em>“Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma” (NKJV).</em></p>
<p>We can live, act and think like Him because we have the same life with Him. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%202:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 2:16</a> says, <em>“…But we have the mind of Christ.&quot;</em> So, like the Master, never be intimidated by circumstances. In every situation, manifest the glory and power of divinity. Nothing could limit Jesus. He exercised absolute dominion over the forces and elements of this world.</p>
<p>Never be intimidated by the challenges that you face, no matter how tough they are; walk as Jesus walked! Today, you’re the manifestation of Him, you’re the expression of Him. This is what true Christianity is—living the Christ-life—the unveiling and outworking of Christ in and through you. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And Jesus came and spake unto them,  saying, All power is given unto me in  heaven and in earth (Matthew 28:18).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 28:18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Some people brag about having authority in specific places, perhaps in a nation, city, street etc. For some, it’s even in classrooms, such that they become bullies and terrorize their classmates. But there’s one whose authority transcends the universe and extends to all of heaven, the earth, and under the earth. His Name is Jesus! Blessed be God!</p>
<p>The Bible says no one and nothing is exempted from His rule, His dominion and authority. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:20-22&amp;version=MSG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:20-22 MSG</a> sheds more light on the unrivalled and unparalleled authority that He wields. It says, <em>“...God raised him from death and set him on a throne in deep heaven, in charge of running the universe, everything from galaxies to governments, no name and no power exempt from his rule. And not just for the time being, but forever. He is in charge of it all, has the final word on everything….”</em></p>
<p>The most exhilarating part of this is the fact that His authority is given to us because we’re one with Him. We’re His seed and we prolong His days. He rules through us. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%209:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 9:6</a> says, <em>“…and the government shall be upon his shoulder….”</em> His shoulder refers to the Church— us; we’re His body in and through which He speaks and acts today.</p>
<p>This should help you understand why soon after He affirmed in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 28:18</a> that all authority is His both in heaven and in earth, He immediately charged us in the ensuing verse 19 to go and teach all nations. That’s extraordinary, because it means we sit on His seat. We function by His authority.</p>
<p>It’s the reason we can do the same works that He did. He gave us power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 9:1</a>). Read what the Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:17&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:17 NKJV</a>: <em>“And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons....”</em></p>
<p>You have unrivalled authority in the Name of Jesus to cast out devils and tame circumstances. There’s nothing you can’t do, and there’s no hopeless situation you can’t change. You can do all things in His Name. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For if by one man&#x27;s offence death  reigned by one; much more they which  receive abundance of grace and of the  gift of righteousness shall reign in life by  one, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>For if by one man&#x27;s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 5:17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Many think that the verse above refers to us reigning with Jesus Christ in the sweet-by-and-by; no! It’s talking about us reigning—“kinging”—in the earth NOW by Jesus Christ. At the millennial reign, we will reign with Him; but today, we reign by Him or through Him. There’s a great difference between the two.</p>
<p>What Paul captures for us in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:17</a> is different from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2020:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 20:6</a> which says, <em>“…they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” Notice that here, it says, “and shall reign with him….”</em> The word “with” is translated from the Greek, “meta,” which denotes to do something together with another or alongside. That&#x27;s the one that&#x27;s coming in the future. So, now, we&#x27;re not reigning with Christ.</p>
<p>In Romans 5:17 the Greek word &#x27;Dia&#x27; is used, which means &#x27;by&#x27; or &#x27;through.&#x27; Thus, we&#x27;re reigning by or through Jesus NOW; we’re reigning in His Name. Hallelujah! We’re called to exercise dominion and to live as masters and victors in life through Jesus Christ. We reign over Satan, darkness, the world and all creation.</p>
<p>The actual Greek rendering of the word “reign” means “to king.” You’re supposed to be “kinging” in life. The Amplified Classic translation says we <em>“…reign as kings in life through the one Man Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One)”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:17&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:17 AMPC</a>).</p>
<p>As we take up the responsibility of prayer, using the Name of Jesus and operating in His stead, we enforce the Father’s will in the earth and establish His righteousness in the nations of the world!</p>

<p>There’re those who due to lack of proper understanding of the Scriptures are confused about the deity of Jesus. The Scriptures are unambiguous about it. Even the portion we just read in our theme verse leaves no one in doubt as to the fact that the one being referred to as God is Jesus.</p>
<p>Some have asked, &quot;If Jesus is God, how can He set Himself at His own right hand in the heavenly places as stated in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:19-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:19-20</a>?” First, you have to understand the extraordinary nature of God in which He&#x27;s able to manifest Himself in different ways; it’s the mystery of His nature.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us about the divine nature of the Godhead in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; one God, but manifests in three separate persons. We&#x27;re never going to see three Gods in Heaven, or three thrones with the Father sitting on one, the Son on another, and then the Holy Spirit on the third one; no! It’s only Jesus, because in Him dwells the fullness of the Godhead bodily (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%202:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 2:9</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 1:19</a> says, <em>“For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell.”</em> Recall at the baptism of Jesus, as He came out of the water, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descended on Jesus. Simultaneously, a voice spoke from heaven and said, <em>&quot;...This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 3:17</a>).</p>
<p>What an extraordinary manifestation of the three persons: The Son is baptized in water, and right away He’s filled with the Holy Spirit, and the Father speaks from heaven! The first time the angels saw God Almighty in a body was when Jesus was born in Bethlehem. The Bible says, <em>“And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:14</a>). God became flesh and dwelt among us, and yet His presence and His voice would speak from heaven. Amazing!</p>

<p><em><strong>Who shall separate us from the love of  Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or  persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or  peril, or sword?...Nay, in all these things  we are more than conquerors through  him that loved us (Romans 8:35-37).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?...Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:35-37&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Romans 8:35-37</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>You could have trials and challenges, from inflation to economic recession, health issues, family problems, etc. The good news, however, is that it doesn&#x27;t matter the challenges you face or the situation in your country, the Word says, in all these things we’re more than conquerors through Christ. This should give you comfort, peace and joy.</p>
<p>Knowing we would encounter challenges in this world, the Lord Jesus assured us of victory when He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:33&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 16:33</a>, <em>&quot;… be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”</em> Distressing situations abound in all human societies because of man’s fall and failure, but the Word declares <em>“...in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:37&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:37</a>).</p>
<p>You’ve been lifted over and above the depravities and corrupting influences of this world. Recall our opening verse again; it states clearly that neither tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, nor sword can separate us from the love of God, because in spite of them all, we are more than conquerors.</p>
<p>Now, if this meant that you’d conquer no matter what you face in this world, that would have been wonderful. But it means much more than that. It means you’ve gone past conquering, because you conquered in Christ! You’re now living in the victory of Christ!</p>
<p>That means there’s nothing to struggle with or try to overcome anymore, because you’ve already won. Don&#x27;t allow the circumstances of life or the economic situation in your country make you a victim. You were born into the victorious life when you were born again.</p>
<p>Now you can understand why the Apostle Paul, in spite of the great persecutions and adversities he faced dismissed them as light affliction: <em>“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>). Then in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2020:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Acts 20:24</a>, he said, <em>“...none of these things move me….”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Let your light so shine before men, that  they may see your good works, and  glorify your Father which is in heaven  (Matthew 5:16).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>Let your light so shine before men, that  they may see your good works, and  glorify your Father which is in heaven  (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Matthew 5:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2032:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 32:17</a> says, <em>&quot;And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever.&quot;</em> We’re the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). So, when the Bible talks about the work of righteousness being peace, it’s telling you what you must produce as a result of your nature: your work is to establish peace.</p>
<p>The word “peace” is from the Hebrew “shalom” and it refers to the totality of the human welfare—health, prosperity, etc. So, your work is to produce health, prosperity, and peace. Remember the words of the Lord Jesus in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%209:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 9:5</a>. He said, <em>“As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</em></p>
<p>He didn’t say those things just to distinguish Himself alone; He said it so we would know to speak accordingly. You’re the bearer of His peace. Places where there had been war, bloodshed, hostilities, and wanton destruction of lives and properties can have peace when you show up; darkness is dispelled and the righteousness of God is established. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Our God is the God of peace. Therefore, peace in the nations is His will. The Lord Jesus said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:27&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:27</a>, <em>“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you….”</em> How the world needs this today—the peace that only Jesus gives. We’re the ones to help others and the nations experience this extraordinary life of peace through prayer, the preaching of the Gospel, and our works of righteousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%202:1-2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Timothy 2:1-2</a> says, <em>“I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.”</em> That’s it! Peace with extraordinary grace for prosperity, excellence, preservation and rest will mantle the nations and hearts of men as we pray for all men, as we carry out the works of righteousness. So it makes no difference the turmoil, distress and troubles in today’s world; decree peace, health and prosperity for your city and nation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2012:28&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Proverbs 12:28</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though the verse above is in the Old Testament, it lays the groundwork for a principle that extends into the New Testament. It says, <em>&quot;In the way of righteousness is life….”</em> The righteousness of Christ gave us eternal life. We couldn’t please God, but Jesus did on our behalf.</p>
<p>Remember that Adam disobeyed God and committed high treason against God. But Jesus Christ, the second and last Adam, fulfilled God&#x27;s will and on account of His obedience, we’ve been made righteous: <em>“Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For as by one man&#x27;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:18-19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:18-19</a>).</p>
<p>Consider again the construction in our opening verse: <em>&quot;In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.&quot;</em> In the path of righteousness, death has no place; it’s a &quot;death-free pathway.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 8:2</a>, <em>“For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.&quot;</em> The Greek construction here isn’t referring to being delivered from sin as if you were trapped in it, or being rescued or delivered from death as if you were in its clutches. Rather, it’s saying that in Christ Jesus, you’re death-free; there’s no death in you.</p>
<p>The human body is referred to as the &quot;body of death&quot; in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 7:24</a>. From the moment a person is born, they carry death within them. Everything is done to prevent the person from dying. This is because humanity inherited the curse of death in the world. </p>
<p>So Paul says, “<em>O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 7:24</a>). The very next verse says, <em>&quot;I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207:25&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 7:25</a>). Jesus provided the solution; the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made us death-free. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>Surely his salvation is nigh them that  fear him; that glory may dwell in our  land. Mercy and truth are met together;  righteousness and peace have kissed  each other (Psalm 85:9-10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2085:9-10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Psalm 85:9-10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2085&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 85</a>, the Psalmist prophetically shows a significant relationship between salvation and the land. Then, in the 10th verse, he prophetically paints a beautiful imagery: <em>&quot;Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.&quot; The Hebrew word translated &quot;mercy&quot; is &#x27;chesed,&#x27; which is often translated as &quot;lovingkindness.&quot;</em></p>
<p>What we have as lovingkindness in the Old Testament is the equivalent of grace in the New Testament. It represents God&#x27;s unmerited favour; and this lovingkindness was often expressed through covenants. The New Living Translation calls it &quot;unfailing love&quot; because it was based on the unbroken covenant God had with His people, making it reliable and trustworthy: <em>&quot;Unfailing love and truth have met together. Righteousness and peace have kissed&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2085:10&amp;version=NLT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 85:10 NLT</a>).</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul, in his beautiful discourse in Romans 5, brings this to mind when he said, <em>&quot;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:1</a>).</p>
<p>Thus, the psalmist’s prophetic utterance finds fulfilment in us today—the new creation in Christ. In us, grace and truth have met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Blessed be God.</p>
<p>Why is that so important? In those times, they were mostly farmers, and their prosperity often depended on what came out of the land. The Bible says, <em>“Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2085:11-12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 85:11-12</a>).</p>
<p>This was how the psalmist could relate with it; and remember, it was still prophetic in his time. This shows the relationship of God’s blessings, salvation and righteousness with the land, that is, your nation or your country; they are key to what happens in the earth. In other words, as a result of grace and truth, righteousness and peace, there will be prosperity, wholeness and wellness in the earth. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2019:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 19:9</a> says, <em>“…he that speaketh lies shall perish.”</em> A Christian shouldn’t tell lies. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:9</a> says, <em>“Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds.”</em> Telling lies is inconsistent with your nature as a new creation in Christ. You’re a man or woman of truth, because you’re the offspring of Truth: <em>“Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth…”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James%201:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">James 1:18</a>).</p>
<p>Lying is one of the cardinal attributes of Satan. In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208:44&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 8:44</a>, the Lord Jesus aptly described Satan when He said, <em>“…He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.”</em></p>
<p>The Word of God is truth (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 17:17</a>). And the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Truth (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016:13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 16:13</a>).</p>
<p>Now, a liar isn’t merely someone who told a lie but one who loves and makes a lie; he constructs lies (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revelation 22:15</a>); he plans or strategizes his lies. He knows what he is doing is wrong but still goes ahead to do it for selfish reasons.</p>
<p>A liar is also one who speaks contrary to God’s Word. As long as a man’s confessions are inconsistent with God’s Word, they’re lies. 1 Peter 3:10 reveals something instructive; it says, <em>“For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile.”</em> To speak guile is to speak in antithesis to the Word.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>“… put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:24&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 4:24</a>). Now that you’re in Christ, you’ve put on the new man; you have the God-nature. Act accordingly. Speak the truth always.</p>

<p><em><strong>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers (E</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204:29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>phesians 4:29</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>As Christians, we have the Spirit of Christ. We’re the light of the world. We’re to think, love, talk, and conduct all our affairs in life like Him. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:17</a> admonishes us to allow every detail in our lives—our words and actions—to align with the character of Christ: <em>“And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus….”</em></p>
<p>In other words, the character and presence of Jesus ought to radiate through you in your every day walk. Like Him, let your words be gracious and graceful. Practice the love of Jesus through your words.</p>
<p>People remember you more for the things you said to them and how you made them feel through your words. So, make up your mind that your words will communicate the presence and love of Jesus. Let the world see Jesus in you. Let them feel His love in the words you speak.</p>
<p>In the same way that the Lord Jesus was confident to say, <em>“...If you have seen me, you have seen the Father...”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:9&amp;version=CEV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:9 CEV</a>); your testimony ought to be, <em>“If you have seen me, you have seen Jesus.”</em> Let Him be who they see and hear when they listen to you.</p>
<p>Never use terrible, abusive and insulting words even if you’re angry. Never be happy that your words made someone else sad. That’s inconsistent with your nature of love. Be like Jesus: the Bible says, <em>“...And the common people heard him gladly”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2012:37&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 12:37</a>). When people hear you, they should be glad because of your gracious and graceful words of life to them that stir the love for Christ in their hearts.</p>

<p><em><strong>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 1:14</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The opening verse is one of the descriptions given to us in Scripture of the Lord Jesus; He’s full of grace and truth. Are you aware that the same is true about you? In the 16th verse, it says, <em>“And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.”</em> </p>
<p>The Amplified Classic says, <em>&quot;For out of His fullness (abundance) we have all received [all had a share and we were all supplied with] one grace after another and spiritual blessing upon spiritual blessing and even favour upon favour and gift [heaped] upon gift.&quot;</em> Now that you’re in Christ, your life exudes favour upon favour, grace upon grace.</p>
<p>Every day of your life, you can boldly affirm, &quot;Of His fullness, I have received abundant grace—grace heaped upon grace. I have grace before God, grace before men, and grace for every assignment; I have grace everywhere I go, and I’m walking in increased grace every day.&quot;</p>
<p>The Christian life is a life of unending grace; there is more than enough grace for you every day. No need to be overwhelmed or exasperated by the burdens of life. No need for the struggle. Act on the Word. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hebrews 4:16</a> says, <em>“Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.”</em> </p>
<p>What grace do you require? Is it grace to run your home? Is it for your academics? Is it for ministry? Is it to raise your kids? Is it to multiply your finances? That grace is available to you in superabundance; obtain it. Always affirm you’re full of grace and your life is full of divine favour everywhere and every day.</p>

<p><em><strong>Wherefore, my beloved… work out your own salvation with fear and trembling (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202:12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Philippians 2:12</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Word of God is for doing; we’re doers of the Word; we work the Word. As long as the Word remains in the pages of your Bible, it won’t produce any results for you. But when you meditate on the Word and speak it forth, it comes alive and active.</p>
<p>Think about this: A lady who was diagnosed with breast cancer asked that I prayed for her. But I told her she could put the Word to work; she could use her mouth to cut out the cancerous growth. I explained to her what the mouth is—&quot;stoma&quot; (Greek), the front or edge of a weapon. She was excited and immediately got to work. She spoke consistently to the growth, in faith, over a period.</p>
<p>When I saw her a few months later, she was completely healed; the cancer had dematerialized and she was perfectly normal. She worked the Word. Glory to God! If you’re sick, broken or afflicted in your body and you desire to be well, put your faith to work. Work the Word.</p>
<p>All the blessings of God are already packaged and delivered to you in Christ. The Bible says, <em>“...all things are yours”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%203:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Peter 1:3</a> says He’s <em>&quot;…given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness….&quot;</em> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:3</a> says He has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.</p>
<p>God already did everything He needed to do for you to have and enjoy a glorious life. But you have the responsibility to put the Word to work in your life. You’re the one to ensure all the wonderful blessings of God manifest in your life. Affirm the Word for your healing, prosperity, victory, promotion etc. Declare your prosperity without wavering. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth  with the Holy Ghost and with power: who  went about doing good, and healing all  that were oppressed of the devil; for God  was with him (Acts 10:38).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010:38&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Acts 10:38</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>It has never been God’s will for anyone to be sick or afflicted with diseases and pains. Rather, He wants all men well. Read our opening verse again and notice those the Lord Jesus healed; they were oppressed by the devil, not God. The devil made them sick, but God wanted them well and sent Jesus to heal them.</p>
<p>Consider for example the man who was possessed by a legion of demons in the region of Gadara. The demons caused him to exhibit violent behaviour and live among tombs, but Jesus cast the demons out of him and he was instantly restored to his right mind (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%205:1-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 5:1-20</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%208:26-39&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 8:26-39</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209:14-29&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 9:14-29</a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2017:14-21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 17:14-21</a>, and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%209:37-43&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 9:37-43</a>, the Bible shows us how a father brought his son to Jesus, explaining that the boy had been suffering from seizures due to a demon. Jesus rebuked the demon and healed the boy. These and several other examples are proof that God wants people well, vibrant, strong and free. </p>
<p>In fact, in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=3%20John%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 John 1:2</a>, His desire is clearly stated. He says, <em>&quot;Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.&quot;</em> Think about that! He wants you to prosper, and that refers to material and financial prosperity, and also be in health, which is the physical prosperity or wellbeing of your body—your health.</p>
<p>Then He adds, <em>&quot;…even as thy soul prospereth,&quot;</em> emphasizing that your spiritual prosperity is paramount, and your soul only prospers through the Word of God. So stay in God’s Word; meditate on it and you’ll always live in health, for God’s Word is medicine—health for the physical body: <em>“My son, pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to a man&#x27;s whole body”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%204:20-22&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proverbs 4:20-22 NIV</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The thief comes only in order to steal  and kill and destroy. I came that they  may have and enjoy life, and have it in  abundance (to the full, till it overflows  (John 10:10 AMPC)</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>The thief comes only in order to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance (to the full, till it overflows (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&amp;version=AMPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 10:10 AMPC</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening verse is so heart-warming and enlivening. It clearly states a specific reason for which Jesus came, which is for you to have and enjoy life to the full. Take a moment to meditate on this: He came for you to enjoy the transcendent life that He’s given you. That’s His plan and He doesn’t want anything to cheat you out of it.</p>
<p>This is contrary to what religion teaches. In religion, people may feel compelled to sacrifice themselves to please God. However, in Christ, it’s different. He died and was sacrificed for you. He gave His life for you to have His life.</p>
<p>The Bible says, <em>&quot;But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:8</a>). In <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 3:16</a>, the Apostle John reveals, <em>&quot;Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us….&quot;</em> Thanks be unto God; after laying down His life for us, He was raised for our justification. And on that basis, you’re to have and enjoy life to the full, till it overflows.</p>
<p>It may be challenging for some to believe that He came for them to have life and enjoy it, especially if they&#x27;ve had a different experience for a long time. Some others may wonder, can one truly enjoy life while battling sickness, pain, weakness or infirmity of the body?</p>
<p>The answer is evident—no! But as already stated, it’s the reason Jesus gave us His life, which is uninfectable, a life that’s superior to sickness and disease. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:11-12&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 5:11-12</a> says, <em>“…this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life….”</em> You have that life now; it’s the God-life. Enjoy it!</p>
<p>It’s your heavenly Father’s delight to see you healthy, vibrant, strong, joyful, and brimming with life. Therefore, embrace His plan for you to have and enjoy life to the full. Be exuberant with joy as you contemplate the life of glory, dominion, abundant grace and peace that He’s given you in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the Day of Judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>1 John 4:17</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When you received Christ, you received His life and nature and became like Him. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:1&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 3:1</a> further explicates this truth. It says, <em>&quot;Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.&quot;</em></p>
<p>We’re His offspring, born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:12-13&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:12-13</a>). Think about it, if you’re born of God, what does that make you? Divine! No wonder He said through the psalmist, <em>“I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2082:6&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 82:6</a>).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus reiterated this truth when He said, <em>“... Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:34&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:34</a>). The people of the world may not recognize us, just as they didn’t recognize Jesus when He came. But today, through divine revelation, our eyes have been opened to this truth to walk accordingly.</p>
<p>The Bible says <em>“Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 3:2</a>). What does this mean? It means our physical bodies will be transformed into glorified bodies at the Master’s return. But right now, we have His life and nature—as He is, so are we in this world.</p>
<p>Recall that after His resurrection, His disciples were gathered in a room, with the doors and windows shut, but Jesus came into their midst through a wall. They initially thought He was a ghost but He invited them to touch Him, emphasizing that He had flesh and bones, unlike a ghost.</p>
<p>Outwardly, our divine nature, personality and identity may not be readily apparent to the people of the world, but it makes no difference. We’re who God says we are—sons of God—not only for the future but right NOW!</p>

<p><em><strong>And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places (Ephesians 1:19-20).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:19-20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:19-20</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>When God raised Jesus from the dead, He set Him at His own right hand, <em>“Far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:21</a>).</p>
<p>Right hand in Scripture means the place or seat of power. It’s like you say, &quot;Jim is my right-hand man&quot;; it means Jim represents and speaks for you; you’ve given him your authority. Jesus being seated at God&#x27;s right hand means He’s seated in the seat of power; God operates through Him. That&#x27;s amazing!</p>
<p>But then we observe something remarkable about the infinite expanse of Jesus&#x27; dominion. His dominion surpasses all levels and hierarchies of power. It’s <em>“Far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:21</a>). Blessed be God!</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus reigns supreme in this world as it is now and also in the ages to come. He holds unmatched authority over all things, and His Name stands above every title. Praise God! The Amplified translation renders it beautifully. It says Jesus is far above <em>“…every title that can be conferred], not only in this age and in this world, but also in the age and the world which are to come”</em> (AMPC).</p>
<p>The New Living Translation emphasizes something even more interesting; it says, <em>“…he is far above any ruler or authority or power or leader or anything else in this world or in the world to come.”</em> In other words, call them whatever you want—the superiority of the Lord Jesus is undeniable—transcending all persons, all limits and all boundaries.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the Lord Jesus Christ in whom you believe and whose birth is celebrated at this time all around the world. His authority knows no bounds and has no equal. His power extends throughout eternity. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202:8&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Luke 2:8</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202:8-14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 2:8-14</a> provides a remarkable account of the angelic announcement to the shepherds in the fields near Bethlehem. As the shepherds were keeping watch over their flock by night, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, filling them with awe and reverential fear.</p>
<p>The angel reassured the shepherds, saying, &quot;Fear not&quot; and went ahead to deliver the good tidings of great joy that would be for all people. The angel proclaimed the birth of a Savior in the city of David, who is Christ the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the angel gave the shepherds a sign to find the new-born Saviour. They would find the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. Suddenly, the heavens were filled with a multitude of angels, praising God and declaring, <em>&quot;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%202:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke 2:14</a>). What an announcement!</p>
<p>His goodwill toward all men hasn’t stopped since then. This is our Gospel! This is what Christmas is about! The Bible says, <em>“To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:19&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>).</p>
<p>God is looking at all nations today with goodwill. Jesus Christ was God’s love message; He was God’s love letter to the world. When Jesus came, He was the expression of the will and nature of God; He was the expression of the Father’s righteousness! He was the manifestation of God’s love.</p>
<p>Now, the most sublime of it all is that He made us the expression of His will and nature. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 Corinthians 5:21</a> declares, <em>“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.”</em> In Christ, we are made the righteousness of God. Every day of your life, you’re the unfolding of the Father&#x27;s heart. In other words, you are the revelation of the Father&#x27;s heart and of His will.</p>

<p><em><strong>And this is life eternal, that they might  know thee the only true God, and Jesus  Christ, whom thou hast sent (John 17:3).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 17:3</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>As we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, it’s important for us to grasp the full import and meaning of eternal life. The fact that Jesus brought this life makes it absolutely imperative that we know what it means. What then is eternal life?</p>
<p>To understand what it means, you’d have to first understand what the Scripture says about God, about the divinity of Jesus Christ, idolatry, and life itself. Many have only known eternal life to be the life and nature of God. But I’ll give you a definition that clarifies it. Eternal life is the organic and existential attributes of deity.</p>
<p>In those few words, you have the distinguishing factors—everything that separates our God from all others that may be called gods. These attributes must be organic, and they must be existential. And you can only find that in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as expressed in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>That is what makes it beautiful because we don’t see Him, yet we can call Him God. But who is He when you don&#x27;t see Him? That is why many have represented God with whatever they think He is—stones, wood, or some materials and shape—but our God is real and true.</p>
<p>Some people may argue that He doesn&#x27;t exist, but He came to us in Jesus Christ. The Bible says, <em>“And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:14 NKJV</a>).</p>
<p>Jesus is Himself, God. Hallelujah! And He is eternal life: <em>“And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. <strong>This is the true God, and eternal life</strong>&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205:20&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 5:20</a>). <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:2&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 1:2</a>: <em>“For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.”</em></p>

<p><em><strong>He was in the world, and the world was  made by him, and the world knew him  not (John 1:10).Acts 4:1-12 &amp; Ezra 5</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:10&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 1:10</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:14&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 1:14</a> says, <em>&quot;And the Word became flesh…</em>&quot; (NKJV). In essence, the Word changed form and became manifest in the flesh, and that’s Jesus! Where was Jesus before He was born in Bethlehem? He was in God as God’s Word. For example, your words right now are in you until you speak them forth.</p>
<p>Words are thoughts clothed with vocabulary. When you speak, you speak your thoughts. Your thoughts are clothed with language so someone else can understand. So, your thoughts reside within you until you express them in words.</p>
<p>When you&#x27;re thinking about something, nobody else can discern your thoughts; they remain concealed within your heart. However, when you speak, your words become tangible and can be captured in time. This is why we can record your voice and replay it later. Five years down the line, someone can hear what you said, but it was hidden in your heart until you uttered it.</p>
<p>Imagine if your words, once captured in time, could step out of a computer or a recorder and materialize as the very things you said. This is precisely what God did through Jesus Christ. Jesus became the embodiment of God&#x27;s will, a revelation of His divine purpose and the manifestation of His boundless love.</p>
<p>If you wanted to understand what God is like, you only needed to look at Jesus. He declared, <em>&quot;I and my Father are one&quot;</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:30&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:30</a>). And He consistently performed the works and spoke the words that emanated from the Father. In essence, Jesus was the living expression of God&#x27;s Word.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s quite common for people to be puzzled by certain aspects of Jesus&#x27; life, such as when God spoke from heaven during His baptism. So, they say, “If Jesus was the manifestation of God, how come, when He was being baptized, God spoke from heaven?”</p>
<p>God&#x27;s nature and capabilities are far beyond our understanding. We can draw a parallel from modern technology: when I preach from a particular location, anywhere in the world, my voice is heard in every known country and territory on earth and in multiple languages. If that is possible in this world, then think about what God can do! His ability to speak from heaven while Jesus was on earth transcends human limitations.</p>

<p><em><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave  his only begotten Son, that whosoever  believeth in him should not perish, but  have everlasting life (John 3:16).</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:16&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 3:16</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>Did you know that the statement in our opening verse is a divine decree? You’re kept from perishing for believing in Jesus Christ. That means nothing and no one can harm you. Jesus said in Luke 10:19, <em>“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”</em></p>
<p>He also said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:18</a> that if you drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt you. This is your heritage in Christ. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2091:5-7&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 91:5-7</a> says, <em>“Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.”</em></p>
<p>Notice the latter part; it says the evil, the pestilence, and the terror that destroy others won’t come near you; why? Because you’re in Christ! Christ is a place; and therein you’re shielded from the destructions, calamities and degradations of this present world. Hallelujah! </p>
<p>It further reminds of the words of the Prophet Isaiah in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2054:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 54:17</a>, <em>“No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper…This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD....”</em> The reason the weapons can’t prosper is that you have eternal life—the indestructible, incorruptible and impregnable life of God! </p>
<p>Remember what we read in our opening verse: <em>“… whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</em> It’s a life of absolute mastery and dominion, a life of glory, victory, success and excellence. Because of this life in you, no evil force can prevail against you. You’re more than a conqueror! Glory to His Name forever! </p>

<p><em><strong>That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you THE SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION in the knowledge of him: The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:17-18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 1:17-18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The underlined portion in our opening scripture above seems to suggest that the Apostle Paul was referring to two different things: the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of revelation, but no! He’s dealing with one and the same thing: the Spirit of wisdom bringing you revelation— the unveiling of mysteries—“apocalupsis” (Greek).</p>
<p>The Spirit of wisdom refers to the operations of the Spirit of God in wisdom, the Spirit of God manifesting Himself in wisdom. The use of the word “and” in that expression needs to be properly understood. In the Greek rendering, the word translated “and” is also translated “in,” “with,” or “for.” Therefore, a better rendering of that expression is “…the spirit of wisdom <strong>in</strong> revelation” or “the spirit of wisdom <strong>for</strong> revelation” in the exact knowledge of God. </p>
<p>In the Amplified Classic version, it says, <em>“[For I always pray to] the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation [of insight into mysteries and secrets] in the [deep and intimate] knowledge of Him”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201:17&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 1:17</a>). This is the ministry of the Spirit of wisdom in your life: He brings you revelation—insight into mysteries and secrets. </p>
<p>Secondly, He brings you light (photizo—Greek); He floods your path with light. He illuminates your mind with extraordinary sagacity and amplitude of comprehension. Thirdly, He brings you counsel and direction such that life ceases to be mysterious to you. </p>
<p>Always acknowledge that you’re filled with the Spirit of God in wisdom and spiritual understanding; therefore you know and can discern His will. Every so often, declare, “I have insight into mysteries and secrets; I function at the highest level of excellence and in the perfect will of God, because I’m filled with the Spirit of wisdom for revelation in the deep and intimate knowledge of Christ.” Hallelujah! </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>For he is our peace, who hath made both  one, and hath broken down the middle  wall of partition between us (Ephesians 2:14).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202:14&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Ephesians 2:14</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus came to bring us into fellowship with God. He came to establish an intimate relationship—a oneness between God and man so that man can truly know God; and He achieved it. In Christ Jesus, we were given eternal life; the life and nature of God was imparted to our spirits. </p>
<p>He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010:10&amp;version=NIV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 10:10 NIV</a>, <em>“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.”</em> The Christ-life in its fullness is what you received when you received Jesus as Lord of your life. The Bible says in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203:4&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colossians 3:4</a>, “Christ is our life”; He’s the life of the one who’s born again. What a Gospel! </p>
<p>This is what He wants us to preach and teach around the world. He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark 16:15</a>, <em>“...Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.”</em> He wants us to let the world know that a relationship with Almighty God is possible; righteousness is possible and available. All it takes is to believe: <em>“…whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:15&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 3:15</a>). Hallelujah! </p>
<p>Jesus died for our sins, but He rose triumphantly from the dead after three days. His death settled the charges against us, but it didn’t make us one with God. It was His resurrection that gave us eternal life and brought us into oneness with God. </p>
<p>Now, Jesus Christ isn’t only the Lord of your life but also one in and by whom you’ve found rich and deep fellowship: <em>“That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201:3&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 1:3</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Corinthians 1:9</a> says, <em>“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.”</em> This is what God had always wanted with man: fellowship! Jesus made it a reality. Hallelujah!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>No man hath seen God at any time;  the only begotten Son, which is in the  bosom of the Father, he hath declared  him (John 1:18).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201:18&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>John 1:18</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>The word &quot;declared&quot; in our opening verse originates from the Greek term &quot;exegeomai,&quot; signifying not just a mere declaration but the act of rehearsing or unfolding something. In essence, Jesus rehearsed divinity to us. He came to reveal God in a way we could relate with and understand. </p>
<p>The life of Jesus was a living testament, a vivid portrayal of the Kingdom&#x27;s principles and the divine way of living. This profound truth is why the Bible instructs us to follow in His footsteps, for He’s given us an example to emulate. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202:21&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 Peter 2:21</a> underscores this beautifully: <em>&quot;For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.&quot;</em> Jesus came to show us the Father&#x27;s love, character and will. He said in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:9&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John 14:9</a>, <em>“…he that hath seen me hath seen the Father…”</em>; a claim only the One who was God in the flesh could make.</p>
<p>[Ephesians 5:1-2](<a href="https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Ephesians" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bibleapi.rhapsodyofrealities.org/Ephesians</a> 5:1-2 kjv) says, <em>&quot;Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children. And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us....&quot;</em> The term &quot;followers&quot; translates from the Greek word &quot;mimetes,&quot; denoting not merely followers but imitators, those who copy another. We’re called to be imitators of God, but how can we imitate God when we haven&#x27;t seen Him?</p>
<p>Jesus made it possible! He came to reveal God&#x27;s nature and His love for us. God loves us; we know because we see from the Scriptures how Jesus was moved by love and compassion. Jesus in action was God at work.</p>
<p>Now we can manifest the Father’s love, His righteousness, mercy, compassion and grace because that’s what Jesus did when He walked the earth. We have the life of Christ in us, and His love is poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:5&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Romans 5:5</a>). The Apostle Paul tells us, <em>“And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma”</em> (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%205:2&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ephesians 5:2 NKJV</a>).</p>

<p><em><strong>Being filled with the fruits of  righteousness, which are by Jesus  Christ, unto the glory and praise of God  (Philippians 1:11).</strong></em></p>

<hr>
<p><em><strong>Being filled with the fruits of  righteousness, which are by Jesus  Christ, unto the glory and praise of God  (</strong></em><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%201:11&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Philippians 1:11</strong></em></a><em><strong>).</strong></em></p>
<p>God sent us to take His presence to the peoples and nations of the world, demonstrating to them the character of the Spirit. But what’s in that presence? It’s the righteousness of God. When we bring the presence of God to an individual or a community, we’re bringing them the righteousness of God. </p>
<p>This very much aligns with the vision of Jesus. He came to set up the Kingdom of God in the earth; He came to establish God’s righteousness. Before His birth, the angel announced to Mary that His name shall be called Emmanuel—God with us (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%201:23&amp;version=kjv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew 1:23</a>). That’s God’s presence, and Jesus was the righteousness of God unveiled in flesh.</p>
<p>God’s presence is His righteousness in manifestation. That&#x27;s why we preach and teach the righteousness of God; because only through His righteousness can the people experience His Person. You can’t know God with your senses; you can’t know Him until you understand His righteousness, which is revealed in His acts of love.</p>
<p>It’s the reason we want the whole world to know who Jesus is. We want the whole world to experience the righteousness of God. When we talk about the love of God, the love of God actually is the demonstration of the righteousness of God. </p>
<p>Wherever the righteousness of God is in manifestation, the love of God is experienced. We’ve been made His righteousness, which means the righteousness of God is in manifestation through you in your world—in your office, in your home etc. You hold forth the fruits of God’s righteousness everywhere.</p>
<p>It’s the reason when you get involved in a matter, it shouldn’t be about taking sides with anyone but about establishing the righteousness of God, because that’s what we represent; that’s what we’re called to establish. Glory to God!</p>
