<p><strong>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends (John 15:13).</strong></p>
<p>Most people have never known what divine love is, and as a result, they define it on the basis of their relationships with human beings. They think they know and have experienced the love of God because of the things He’s done for them, such as in salvation, health, deliverance, abundance, and many other blessings they experience.</p>
<p>Well, Jesus dying in our behalf to prove His love for us was an awesome blessing indeed; He said, <em>“Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends”</em> (John 15:13). However, here, He wasn’t referring to divine love, but to human love. When He died for us, He didn’t die as God; He died as a man; that was what made His death in our behalf valid. The love He expressed for us at that point was the love that a man would have for his friends.</p>
<p>Divine love, however, is different. Jesus said in John 14:10, <em>“...I am in the Father, and the Father in</em> *me....”*He experienced the love of the Father the way no man ever did; He walked in the Father, and the Father walked in Him. That’s the kind of love that resulted after the Cross; that’s the love He brought us into. He invites us to open our eyes, open our understanding and look beyond human love, and embrace His divine love! He saved us with His own love, gave His life for us, so we could experience the Father’s love through <a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fellowship</a>.</p>
<p>The only way you experience the love of God is to be in fellowship with the Father, and that’s what Jesus made possible through the life He gave us; the resurrection brought us into that fellowship; into divine love with the Father. With the resurrection, we came out as new creations; and He gave us the Holy Spirit so we could fellowship with the Father. Now, we can really enjoy the love that’s beyond the Cross. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><strong>But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble (James 4:6).</strong></p>
<p>When the Lord gives you an assignment, He empowers you for whatever He calls you to do, by granting you grace for the job. When He increases your responsibilities, He also increases the grace. Except He increases your ability for the higher responsibility, you really can’t accomplish that purpose. That’s why increased grace is so important. Grace here, is the bestowal of special favour and ability to fulfil God’s plan for your life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as you study the Scriptures, you’d discover that there’re different graces. For instance, there’s the grace for salvation, and every child of God received that grace. The Bible says, <em>“For by grace are</em> <em>ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast”</em> (Ephesians 2:8-9). It’s akin to what the Bible says concerning faith: <em>“…according as God hath dealt to</em> <em>every man the measure of faith”</em>(Romans 12:3).</p>
<p>Just as God dealt to everyone in Christ the measure of faith, even so has the grace for salvation been given to all men. But then, there’s the gift of faith, which is different from the measure of faith given to us in Christ. Likewise, Titus 2:11 says, “For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men.” But there’re also different graces in Christ.</p>
<p>Hebrews 4:16 says, “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need .” In other words, there’s grace for your assignment; there’s a grace for anything the Lord instructs you to do or that’s consistent with His plan and purpose for your life. Therefore, knowing the Lord’s plans and purposes, you can obtain whatever <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grace</a> you require. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>For the Word that God speaks is alive and full of power [making it active, operative, energizing, and effective] … (Hebrews 4:12 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
<p>The Bible gives the account of a certain man who was sick for thirty-eight years, and laid by the Pool of Bethesda. At that pool was a rendezvous of broken humanity, waiting for the stirring of the water by an angel. The first person to get in, after the water had been stirred, got healed of whatever disease he had. However, this man hadn’t been able to get in, and when Jesus met him, He asked, <em>“…Wilt thou be made whole?”</em> (John 5:6).</p>
<p>Rather than affirm right away that he wanted to be well, he started complaining to Jesus, lamenting how there’d been no one to help him into the pool (Read John 5:7). Not minding his complaints, the Master said to him, “…Rise, take up thy bed, and walk” (John 5:8). The Bible says, “And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked…”(John 5:9).</p>
<p>How come the man didn’t complain this time, but acted the moment Jesus said, “Rise, take up your bed, and walk”? It reveals the power of God’s Word! There’s something about the words of Jesus; He said in John 6:63, “…the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.” At the words of Jesus, life permeated the hitherto dead limbs and paralyzed body of the man, and before he could think, he was already standing, healed by the power of God! That’s the power of the Word in manifestation. Remember, he didn’t even know who Jesus was, at this time (John 5:12-15).</p>
<p>In several of our healing meetings, people testify of a voice telling them to walk, or do what they hitherto couldn’t do due to sickness, disease or an infirmity of the body. The moment they acted on the word they heard, a miracle ensued, irrespective of the case. They didn’t have to reason out the voice; they knew it was from God, and acted accordingly from their spirit.</p>
<p>That’s the way to respond to God’s Word; it’s from, and with, your spirit! God’s Word is addressed to the human spirit, not to the head or mind. He knows that the Word in your spirit, mixed with <a href="https://rhapsodybible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faith</a>, will surely produce results.</p>

<p><em><strong>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God (1 Corinthians 2:12).</strong></em></p>
<p>Part of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life is to unveil your inheritance to you; to show you the things which are freely given to you by the Father. He’s the only one that knows your inheritance enough to make them available to you. For example, the Bible says God has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ (Ephesians 1:3). You can only know what these spiritual blessings are by the Holy Spirit!â€‹</p>
<p>How do you describe spiritual blessings? How do you identify them? What do they look like? How can you tell what’s from God, and what’s not from Him? It’s only by the Holy Spirit! That’s what we read in our theme scripture. The ensuing verse says, <em>“Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth…”</em> (1 Corinthians 2:13). In other words, these spiritual blessings are made manifest through the language of the Spirit; words inspired in us by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>For example, when you say you’re born again, man’s wisdom thinks you mean you’ve turned over a new leaf, or you’ve merely changed your ways of doing things, but no; it’s much more profound than that! It means you’ve become a new creation; one with God; an associate of the God-kind. This isn’t a piece of information for the intellect or from the intellect, but a revelation of the Spirit; an esoteric insight unveiled to your spirit by the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Life in its fullness, peace, righteousness, divine healing, health, prosperity, forgiveness, fellowship with the Father and with the Son Jesus Christ, are among God’s glorious blessings given to you to enjoy freely. The Holy Spirit came, not only to reveal these blessings to you, but also to teach you to walk in the fullness of the blessings of the Gospel. Recognise His ministry in your life and He’ll lead and guide you in the transcendent life in <a href="https://www.christembassy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christ.</a></p>

<p><em><strong>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him… (1 Corinthians 2:14).</strong></em></p>
<p>The natural man is the man that’s not born again; the life in him is the ordinary human life; that’s what makes him a natural man. However, when you’re born again, you’re not by any means a natural man, because your human life has been supplanted by God’s divine life. Jesus said in John 3:6, <em>“That which is born of the flesh is flesh</em>*; and* <em>that which is born of the Spirit is</em> <em>spirit</em>*.”*</p>
<p>The one who’s born again is born of the Spirit by the Word: <em>“Being born again, not of corruptible seed,</em> <em>but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever”</em>(1 Peter 1:23). You’re born of the Word the same way Jesus was born of the Word; the life in you is the life of the Word. This is the reason you’re indestructible. We just read it: the Word that gave birth to you—the Word from which you came—is indestructible; it lives and abides forever.</p>
<p>Being born again, you’re the heavenly man; the God-man from heaven, with the life of Christ. Refuse to see yourself as human; you’re divine! As Jesus is, so are you in this world (1 John 4:17). You might ask, “Won’t that be going too far?” No; it’s the truth!</p>
<p>Psalm 82:6 says, <em>“I have said, Ye are gods; and all</em> <em>of you are children of the most High.”</em> The Lord Jesusquoted the very same scripture in John 10:34-36. Until, and unless you see yourself, not as a human being, but as a god in the earth, you’ll suffer what human beings suffer.</p>
<p>You’re not an ordinary person. Recall the words of Jesus in Mark 16:17-18: <em>“And these signs shall follow</em> <em>them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.”</em></p>
<p>Anyone who can do the things Jesus outlined in the portion of the scripture above is certainly not human; and that’s you. You’re the believing one; a divine personality, with the same <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">life</a> and nature with God.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God (John 3:3).</strong></em></p>
<p>In our previous study, we learnt that the Christian isn’t a natural man. The natural man is subject to defeat, failure, poverty, and the uncertainties of life; he’s governed by the rudiments of this present evil world, and without hope in life. Ephesians 2:12 describes his life as an utter tragedy, because he lives in this world without hope and without God; a terrible state to be in.</p>
<p>If the foregoing describes you or someone you know, that can change even now. Yes, you may have lived as a natural man, subject to the depravities and corrupting influences of this natural world, but you can start a new life today, by being born again. Jesus said except a man is born again, he can’t escape the destruction and perils in this world.</p>
<p>Why should anyone remain a natural man, and be buffeted by the storms and harsh gusts of life? Only the one who’s born again is separated from darkness, evil, and from perishing. John 3:16 says, *“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish….”*The death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus disconnected you from the domain of Satan, and this world of darkness and turmoil, and transferred you into Christ; into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</p>
<p>The negative forces of this world can’t prevail against you. Failure, sickness, poverty, and everything negative aren’t a part of your life when you’re born again! You live in the victory of Christ every day, such that at the end of life on earth, you’ll stand before Him in glory. But that can’t happen if you’re not born again; if you remain a natural man.</p>
<p>The natural man can’t receive the things of the Spirit of God. But when you receive Christ into your heart, and get to know the Holy Spirit, He’ll unveil the heart of the Father to you.</p>
<p>If you’ve never been born again, this is your moment: turn to the Prayer of <a href="http://www.articles.online-rhapsody.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salvation</a> page at the back of this devotional, pray the prayer, and mean the words with all your heart.</p>

<p><em><strong>According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love (Ephesians 1:4).</strong></em></p>
<p>As Christians, we were chosen in Christ, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and without blame before Him in love. We were chosen in Him before the foundation of the world. From the beginning of time, God set the seal of approval, that when Christ shall come and die, and provide salvation for the world, everyone who would come into Him would be glorified.</p>
<p>Moreover, not only are we chosen in Christ, we’re also without blame: <em>“…that we should be holy and without blame before him in love”</em> (Ephesians 1:4). How could we be without blame, with all our mistakes, errors, and faults? Jesus took our blame. The Bible says, “<em>And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled. In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight”</em> (Colossians 1:21-22). He did all that for us on the Cross, so we could become inheritors of His righteousness; justified, holy, sanctified, and without blame. You don’t have to struggle to be holy or blameless; you don’t have to try to impress Him to accept you; He already accepted you.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:5-6 says, <em>“Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.”</em> God set all of these in motion before the foundation of the world. He planned that you’d live the glory life, void of sickness, failure, and the decadence of today’s world. He planned that you’d be the proof of His goodness, the expression of His righteousness, and the effulgence of His <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glory</a>.

<p><em><strong>…for he hath said…So that we may boldly say… (Hebrews 13:5-6).</strong></em></p>
<p>Christianity is called the “Great Confession”; it’s a life of words. As Christians, we live by words. In Romans 10:9, we see the confession principle as the very basis for salvation. It says, “…if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved....” The vital aspect of salvation is activated and becomes real when you make the confession of the Lordship of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Thus, in Christianity, your words—your confessions—are so important. The Lord Jesus said in Matthew 12:37, <em>“For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy</em> <em>words</em> <em>thou shalt be condemned.”</em> In Mark 11:23, He said, <em>“For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith</em>*”* ; He placed a premium on <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">words</a>.</p>
<p>Your confessions create realities. You create new realities for today and the future with your words. The Bible says, in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth, and tells us how He did it: He did it through words. Through the power of the spoken word, He reframed and brought order to the world, which had become a chaotic mass (Genesis 1:1-6). What God did at the beginning was to reveal to us how to bring order, beauty, and glory to our lives, circumstances, and situations through words.</p>
<p>Chart your course in victory and success with your words; make your life perpetually triumphant. Even now, speak words that are consistent with God’s divine provisions, plans, and purpose for you in Christ, and whatever you say will surely come to pass. Affirm that good things are coming your way, and glorious things are happening for you and around you, because you’re the seed of Abraham.</p>

<p><em><strong>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart…In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths (Proverbs 3:5-6).</strong></em></p>
<p>One day, as I studied the Bible, some thoughts went through my mind. I pondered, “If the Lord really does know everything, that means He knows tomorrow.” Then again I thought, “Since He knows the future, then He knows everything I’ll ever do, say, think, and everywhere I’ll ever go.” Now, all that while, I was meditating on the Scriptures and having this soliloquy.</p>
<p>The result was, I realised that the Lord could actually see in my tomorrow or in the future if I’m going to do or say something that’s not right. And since He already knows, He can fix things ahead for me. Then I said, “Lord, since you know my tomorrow, can you effect some corrections ahead before I ever get there?” Interestingly, He wasn’t quiet about it, and He didn’t reprimand me either for having all those thoughts. Rather, He said to me, “You’re right; I can do it if you want me to.” This reveals how truly kind and gracious He is. We can, and should, actually trust Him with our future.</p>
<p>Imagine that you have a child crawling on the floor, and you can see something dangerous in front of him, and you know the child is going to pick it up. Surely, you’re going to go ahead of the child to eliminate that danger. If you’d do that, how much more our heavenly Father! That’s one of the reasons you can trust God to lead you. If you trust Him with your future, He’ll direct your path. If you trust Him, He’ll go ahead of you, and fix things. He can change anything for your good; for your advantage. Even if you’ve gone in the wrong direction all your life, if you’d embrace Him today, He’ll make everything right. He can create for you a new destiny. He’s God Almighty!</p>
<p>Not only does He know everything about you, He knows everything about life. The future belongs to Him; He made it; without Him, there’s no future. Put yourself, therefore, into His guiding arms, under His Lordship, for His Lordship is the lordship of love. Trust Him without reservation, and He’ll make your life beautiful; He’ll lead you in glory and excellence, to fulfil your <a href="https://rhapsodybible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">destiny</a> in Him.</p>

<p><em><strong>Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness (2 Corinthians 9:10).</strong></em></p>
<p>When you sow seeds, our opening verse explains what happens: God multiplies your seed sown and increases the fruits of your righteousness. Notice it doesn’t say, “He increases the fruits of the seed,” but that He increases the fruits of your righteousness!</p>
<p>This shows that the seeds we sow are about our works of righteousness. Giving is one of the graces ministered to us by the Holy Spirit, and when we give or sow seeds, we’re demonstrating, living out, our life of righteousness. So, when a Christian isn’t giving, he’s not living the life of righteousness.</p>
<p>We give because we have the nature of our heavenly Father, not because of anything we desire to have in the earth. All things are already yours. Your <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faith</a> can get anything! But we’re called to demonstrate righteousness.</p>
<p>Referring to the grace of giving, 2 Corinthians 9:12 says, <em>“For the administration of this service not</em> <em>only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God.”</em> How would you like your life to cause some more praises and thanksgivings to go to God, because of something that was accomplished through your giving? Your giving causes thanksgivings to go up to God! That’s the life of righteousness.</p>
<p>This is the mindset God wants you to have as you sow your seeds, and give into the Gospel. Giving is our nature, our way of life, because it’s our life of righteousness. The more you give, the more the harvests of your righteousness come to you from everywhere, and they come in different shades and forms: physical, material, and spiritual things; and you become greatly enriched! Praise God!</p>

<p><strong>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give</strong> <strong>it</strong> <strong>you (John 16:23).</strong></p>
<p>You should have results every time you pray. God asked us to pray because He wants to answer our prayers, but we must pray correctly. There’re some simple rules of prayer; basic fundamental principles that, if not applied, you’ll be praying amiss.</p>
<p>For example, in the New Testament, we pray in the Name of Jesus. We don’t ask Jesus for anything; we don’t pray to Him. You can tell Him how much you love Him, and give thanks to the Father, in His Name, but we don’t pray to Jesus, in the Name of Jesus; that’d be wrong. When we pray, we stand in the stead of Jesus; we’re taking His place. So, we can’t be praying to Him in His Name, or while standing in His stead; that won’t make any spiritual sense.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we pray knowing that we’re the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus. Our righteousness gives us a right or guarantee of hearing with God. This is what makes our prayers effectual and effective. James 5:16 (AMPC) says, *“…The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working].”*Thus, prayer in the New Testament is geared to effecting changes. When there’re challenges, we can make power available in <a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prayer</a>—power for change!</p>
<p>Jesus said, <em>“…men ought always to pray, and not</em> <em>to faint”</em>(Luke 18:1). That means pray always, and don’t give up, because when you pray, you make power available for the works of righteousness; you effect definite changes in the realm of the spirit to your advantage. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>And God is able to make all grace (every favor and earthly blessing) come to you in abundance, so that you may always and under all circumstances and whatever the need be self-sufficient [possessing enough to require no aid or support and furnished in abundance for every good work and charitable donation] (2 Corinthians 9:8 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
<p>I made up my mind many years ago to walk in the fullness of the blessings of the scripture above, and I’ve been living in it ever since. It’s the life Christ has given us. Under all circumstances, and whatever the need is, we’re supposed to be fully self-sufficient, requiring no aid or support! Sadly, this hasn’t been the experience of many, because most have never been taught, while some haven’t dared to believe it.</p>
<p>Don’t settle for a beggarly life. You’re an heir of God, and a joint-heir with Christ. Everything the Father owns belongs to you; think and live as one who truly owns the world, for you truly do. God has made you self-sufficient, requiring no aid or support.</p>
<p>The Greek word for “sufficiency” is “autarkeia,” from where we get Autarchy, an economic system of self-sufficiency. This is what we have in Christ. If you’d learn to activate this life, you’d live in absolute prosperity.</p>
<p>Your success in life isn’t dependent on circumstances. Think about it: Does God need help? Does He need supply, aid or support from anywhere? Of course not! Being His children, He expects us to come to this understanding.</p>
<p>Even if you’re already advanced in years; in your old age, you can still be in prosperity. He says, <em>“If</em> <em>they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures”</em> (Job 36:11). This is the life He’s given us; one of superabundance, where you possess enough for every good work and charitable <a href="http://rhapsodyofrealities.org/sponsor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">donation</a>.

<p><em><strong>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith (Galatians 6:10).</strong></em></p>
<p>Our opening verse is so profound; it lets us know that as  Christians, we have a responsibility beyond our biological families. God expects you to cater for your household, your nuclear and extended families, but beyond that, you must also cater for those who are outside of your immediate biological family, especially those in the household of faith. You become a success when you look out for others and reach out to help them.</p>
<p>God’s idea, His plan for your prosperity, is for you to have more than enough to be able to help others abundantly. When you think of helping others, He channels His grace towards you in an extraordinary way to make it happen. So, be a helper and a lifter of others. There’ll always be opportunities for you to be a blessing to others, and anytime that opportunity comes your way, seize it.</p>
<p>For example, it’s Christmas season, a time of joy, merriment, and celebration. But there’re some who aren’t able to celebrate, not because they don’t want to, but because they just don’t have the wherewithal. Some can’t even afford a decent meal at this time; yet, it’s Christmas. God wants you to remember such people and help them. If you have to seek them out to help them, do so.</p>
<p>You may also want to find out about corporate endeavours in your local church geared towards helping the poor and needy in the inner cities, and be a vital part of it. Give others a reason to celebrate. Let others benefit from your prosperity. God has made you rich, and given you more than enough for yourself and to be able to <a href="http://bit.ly/ICM-RORBackToSchoolInitiative" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help others</a>.</p>
<p>The Lord wants you to be a blessing. His grace abounds in your life; acknowledge it; use it for good works. Share what you have. Look around in your place of work, your street, and especially your local church and find someone you can lend a helping hand. If you don’t find one, meet your Pastor and ask him or her; you’ll be connected with someone to whom the Lord can make you a blessing this Yuletide season.</p>

<p>Until the Holy Spirit becomes real in your life, your life will be ordinary. It’s the Holy Spirit that brings you into fellowship with God, and sanctifies you. Therefore, live in real fellowship with the Holy Spirit. Talk to Him, and listen to Him. Interact with Him.</p>
<p>Imagine that a particular family just moved into your neighbourhood, and they live next door to you. If you want to make friends with any member of that family, you’d make the effort to meet that person and make an acquaintance. You’d introduce yourself to them, and would like the opportunity to regularly have conversations with them. Now, when you make these efforts to get acquainted with them, you’re recognising them. You’re introducing yourself to them because you think they’re worth the attention.</p>
<p>In the same way, the Holy Spirit has to be recognised. Interestingly, the word translated “spirit” in Greek, as well as Hebrew, is the same word for “wind” or “breath.” But this doesn’t mean the Holy Spirit is wind; He’s a person, and He lives in you. You’re in Him and He’s in you; so you don’t have to go next door to look for Him before you can fellowship with Him. He knows your thoughts, but you’re going to have to talk to Him because thoughts are empowered when vocalised. So, talk to the <a href="http://www.loveworldbooks.org/lwb/store/?tracking=ror" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Holy Spirit</a> and receive from Him as well. </p>
<p>When you begin to enjoy this glorious, wonderful, fellowship with the Holy Spirit, you’ll realise that, indeed, He’s the greatest friend anyone could ever have, and the best teacher there is! He’d teach you about your ministry, business, finances, family, health, etc. He’ll teach you everything, even to the minutest detail of your life. And guiding you with His power, He ensures you’re always on top; never disadvantaged, and forever victorious! Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you (2 Corinthians 6:17).</strong></em></p>
<p>Social media is becoming an integral part of life, and more and more people are catching on to it. But don’t be swayed or moved by its frenzy that’s pushing a lot of people to absurdity today. On various social media platforms, you find many displaying a high level of indecency, posting awful pictures, and you’ll wonder if they ever had any sense of honour.</p>
<p>As a Christian, <a href="https://rhapsodybible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Bible</a> teaches moderation, not excesses. There’re things you just don’t allow. A Christian has some decency. Today, you can pass by a shopping mall or public squares or parks and find people in compromising positions. Don’t condescend to that level of behaviour.â€‹</p>
<p>As Christians, we have a higher life, and higher standards; we have decency. There should be some decency in your dressing, speech, and way of life. There’re places you just shouldn’t be found in. Our opening verse says, <em>“…come out from among them, and</em> <em>be ye separate…”</em> ; in other words, be different. You have a different life, a different culture, and a different mindset; it’s called the mindset of the righteous.â€‹</p>
<p>You were sanctified by the Spirit; meaning that He separated you and declared you holy and undefiled. Therefore, walk in righteousness. Don’t let those of the world drag you into ungodly behaviours; otherwise, you can’t win them. Your standard has to be higher to win them.</p>
<p>Copy the Master; think like Him; act like Him; talk like Him. There’s a decency that goes with the Spirit of God, and that decency must be in your life. Let everything about you edify others, and bring glory to the Lord in every way, and every day, for you’re the light in a dark and perverted world.</p>

<p><em><strong>Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place (2 Corinthians 2:14).</strong></em></p>
<p>In Psalm 7:17, David said, “I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.” Looking back at the year 2018, our hearts are filled with gratitude to the Lord for all the supernatural accomplishments we had both as a ministry and in our individual lives.</p>
<p>Irrespective and independent of the situation or your immediate circumstances, you should give thanks to the Father. Worship and praise Him, no matter what! The Bible says, <em>“In everything give thanks: for this is</em> <em>the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you”</em>(1 Thessalonians 5:18). “In everything” means “in every situation”; you’re to give Him thanks in, and for, all things.</p>
<p>When you look at the year in retrospect, be joyful and excited in your spirit, thankful to the Lord for all He’s done for you. Count your blessings. Don’t muse over the disappointments or things you wished you had accomplished but that you didn’t. Rather, rejoice over what He’s done for you and celebrate your accomplishments.</p>
<p>Remember, we walk by faith, and not by sight; joy is an expression of your faith. In rejoicing and giving thanks to the Lord, you’re getting His attention on your <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faith</a>. Sometimes, we give thanks in expectation. That’s why He tells us, <em>“Be anxious for nothing, but in</em> <em>everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus”</em> (Philippians 4:6-7 NKJV).</p>

<p><em><strong>In whom we have redemption through</strong></em><em><strong>his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace (Ephesians 1:7).</strong></em></p>
<p>Reading the scripture above without some in-depth study, one might conclude that what we have in Christ is “forgiveness,” because of the way the King James renders it. But in reality, what we have in Christ completely transcends that.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is a pardon; the remission of judgment. When you’re “forgiven,” it means you’re not going to be punished for the offence, but you’re still a recorded offender. But in Christ, our sins aren’t merely forgiven, but remitted. The Greek word is “aphesis”; the complete blotting away or removal of sins according to the riches of His grace.</p>
<p>In Christ, the error itself is removed; you’ll not be judged, not because you’ve been pardoned, but because the sin doesn’t exist! So, if a Christian does something wrong, and says, “I can’t just forgive myself,” that means he doesn’t really believe in Jesus and His vicarious death. He died on account of our sins. He’s not just asking you to forgive yourself, He’s telling you that He’s greater than you and He’s the Judge, and that your sins are remitted.</p>
<p>If you believe that He’s the ultimate Judge, and that He’s not holding your sins against you, why should you feel so frustrated because of your errors? Don’t be like those who are saddened by their past mistakes whenever they want to pray. They remember something wrong they had done and allow it to dissipate their <a href="http://www.loveworldbooks.org/lwb/store/?tracking=ror" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faith</a>. Some, as a result of the errors they made, have gone into severe depression. Some others have succumbed to suicidal thoughts, unable to face the shame and possible humiliation. But that’s so wrong!</p>
<p>Yes, you did something wrong; you messed things up, but don’t let it dominate you. Jesus took responsibility for your wrongs; He paid the price already. Refuse to allow the failures and mistakes of yesterday keep you in bondage.</p>
<p>The power of sin to ruin you has been removed, because the Bible says sin shall not have dominion over you (Romans 6:14). When Satan reminds you of your sin, you ought to remind him of the death of Jesus on the Cross, through which you have remission—complete blotting away of sin. Hallelujah!</p>

<p>In the Psalm above, David wasn’t asking the Lord for strength; rather, he declared, “…the Lord is the strength of my life….” This ought to be your confession always; Christ is the strength of your life. If He’s the strength of your life, you don’t need to ask Him for strength, because if you have Him, you have strength. He doesn’t merely have strength; He is Strength. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>There’s no room for weakness in your life. The Apostle Paul, with this understanding, made an extraordinary claim in 2 Corinthians 12:10. He said, *“…for when I am weak, then am I strong.”*He knew His strength was the Holy Spirit that dwelt in him. No wonder He said, <em>“I can do all things through Christ who</em> <em>strengthens me”</em>(Philippians 4:13 NKJV).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the source of all strength, and He lives in you. Therefore, never confess weakness. Romans 8:26 says, <em>“…the Spirit also helpeth our</em> <em>infirmities…”</em> ; in other words, His strength is available to you, and takes over when you think you’re at your weakest.</p>
<p>Never pray, “O Lord, strengthen me”; that’s praying amiss. Someone might ask, “What’s wrong in praying that the Lord should strengthen us? Didn’t Paul pray for the Christians in Ephesus to be strengthened with might in their inner man by the Spirit?”</p>
<p>In Ephesians 3:14-16, you’d notice Paul didn’t pray that <a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prayer</a> for himself; he had a different understanding. Moreover, he was praying for the ministry of the Spirit to be fulfilled in the lives of the brethren at Ephesus. He wasn’t praying as a weak man and asking, “O God, please strengthen me”; no! The Word already says, “The Lord is your strength.” Therefore, yours is to consciously and constantly declare, “The Lord is my strength” and as you say that, you’re strengthened.</p>
<p>It’s like praying, “O God, give me more power”; He already said in Acts 1:8, <em>“But ye shall receive power,</em> <em>after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you….”</em></p>
<p>Therefore, having received the Holy Spirit, you don’t need to ask God for more power; the Holy Spirit, the power of God Himself, lives in you! So like David, declare, <em>“I will love thee, O Lord, my strength…my</em> <em>rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high-tower”</em>(Psalm 18:1-2).</p>

<p><em><strong>Beloved, now are we the sons of God…</strong></em><em><strong>(1 John 3:2)</strong></em></p>
<p>Concerning Jesus, the Bible says, “He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not…” (John 1:10-11). The world didn’t know Him because they tried to figure Him out by their senses; they were looking at His outward appearance. They couldn’t see that He was the maker of the universe. God Himself was with them but they didn’t recognise Him.</p>
<p>Likewise, the world also doesn’t recognise us as new creations and associates of the God-kind. They think we’re ordinary, but we’re sons of God. We’re God-men in the earth; we’re divine, because the life in us is the life of God.</p>
<p>John 1:12 says, <em>“But as many as received him, to</em> <em>them gave he power to become the sons of God….”</em> He gave us the right, the ability, to become the sons of God. We’re not going to become sons of God when we get to heaven; we’re sons of God NOW! James 1:18 declares, <em>“Of his own will begat he us with the word of</em> <em>truth….”</em></p>
<p>When you heard the<a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gospel</a>, and opened your heart to the Word, the life of God was imparted to your spirit, and you were born again. But the world still looks at you and thinks they’re seeing the same old person. Just because you’re encased in an ordinary human body doesn’t mean you’re ordinary. 2 Peter 1:4 describes you as a partaker of the divine nature; you’re in God’s class of being, the divine class. You’re not a mere mortal; you’re actually a god in the earth. Think about it: animals give birth to animals and humans give birth to humans. God, therefore, would most certainly give birth to gods. That’s why He said in Psalm 82:6, <em>“I</em> <em>have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.”</em></p>
<p>Get to know who you are, because when you get to know who you are, you’ll know what belongs to you and live to your full potentials. Be bold in your life. You’re a child of God; a joint-heir with Christ; the world belongs to you. Refuse to live an ordinary life or as an ordinary person.</p>

<p><em><strong>Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength (Nehemiah 8:10).</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people never laugh unless they’re listening to some jokes by a comedian. A comedian may say or do some funny things to make you laugh, but all that is transient; true joy is inside you. Having received the Holy Spirit, God expects you to generate <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joy</a> and excitement from within.</p>
<p>Always learn to release joy from inside you. Never allow anything take away your joy. Our opening verse says, <em>“…the joy of the LORD is your strength.”</em> It’s not talking about the joy you get when you receive some good news or when something you’ve been expecting pulls through for you; no, it’s the joy of the Lord! That joy comes from the Holy Ghost; it comes from the Word. And you’ve got to express it, because as you do, the power is released and your challenges bow.</p>
<p>Every time, and in every place where the Holy Spirit manifests Himself, there’s always great joy. And where there’s joy, it’s difficult for Satan to penetrate. This is why when Satan wants to destroy a family, one of the things he does first is to destroy their joy. Everybody becomes sad, angry, long-faced, and frustrated. Even the children return from school looking sad and gloomy. Therefore, because there’s no joy in the home, the devil can take over. So, never give him a place in your home, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>In the midst of trouble, in the midst of dire challenges, release joy from within. As you do, the challenges will crumble before you; the tumour will pass out of your body; the debts will be settled supernaturally! This is the reason the Bible says, <em>“My</em> <em>brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations”</em>(James 1:2). If you’ve lost your joy to circumstances of life, it’s time to take it back. Stir it up from within. Glory to God!</p>

<p><em><strong>But Jesus told him, “Anyone who lets himself be distracted from the work I plan for him is not fit for the Kingdom of</strong></em><em><strong>God” (Luke 9:62 TLB).</strong></em></p>
<p>As Christians, we should never take the Gospel of Christ lightly. By Him were all things created; He’s Lord of heaven and earth. We ought to be bold about Him everywhere. No one follows Him and misses the way. You can never give Him too much. He gave His life for you. Therefore, He deserves your all; your love, attention, time, everything! Your priority should be: Jesus first, and everything else afterwards.</p>
<p>When you make Him your priority, you’ll never need to worry about anything else; He’s wisdom personified, and if you walk with Him, He’ll give you all the <a href="https://rhapsodybible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wisdom</a> that you need to guide you, and cause you to deal excellently in all things. Trust Him with your life. Never think you’d lose for giving up anything or everything for Him. If you ever face challenges or troubles because of Him, He’ll lead you through victoriously. He’s ever so gracious and kind.</p>
<p>Refuse to allow anything distract you from serving Him and living for Him as you should. Be about His business, doing that work which He planned for you before the foundations of the earth. Remember, when you face Jesus at the judgment seat of Christ, He’s going to ask you: “What did you do with the assignment I gave you? Did you do my work?” Therefore, finish well; finish strong. Don’t be distracted. Like the Master Himself, let your goal, your inspiration and driving force, be to do the will of Him that sent you, and to finish His work.</p>
<p>Prove your love for the Master; do the things He’s asked you to do. If you prove your love for Him, He’d never let you down; you can bet your life on that. Give Him your love; give Him your heart, and He’ll give you such fulfilment that you could never know otherwise. Get excited about serving Him and living for Him; and everything else will fall into place.</p>

<p><em><strong>As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly (1 Corinthians 15:48).</strong></em></p>
<p>Oftentimes, we hear some people say, “I don’t know that man from Adam.” Such statements are indicative of the fact that such people are tracing their lineage to the first Adam. But when you’re born again, your ancestry or lineage isn’t from the first Adam; it’s from the second Adam, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The verse preceding our opening verse says,**“*The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven” (*1 Corinthians 15:47). So, like Jesus, you’re heavenly; meaning that you’re not subject to this world, its elements or systems. Jesus conquered and subdued this world when He walked the earth. That’s what He expects of you too, because <em>“…as he is,</em> <em>so are we in this world”</em> (1 John 4:17).</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 15:45 says, <em>“And so it is written,</em> <em>The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.”</em> Christ Jesus, whose image and likeness you bear is the Lord from heaven; a life-giving Spirit. He’s now your root; you’re connected to, born from, and of, Him! Your ties with the first Adam have been severed completely and forever.</p>
<p>Read Psalm 87:6; it says, <em>“The LORD shall count,</em> *when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there.”*He’s talking about the new creation who was born in Zion! God doesn’t trace your lineage to the land of your earthly nativity. This is what Jesus meant when He said to the Jews, <em>“...Ye are from beneath; I am from</em> <em>above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world”</em> (John 8:23). He knew He was different. It’s the same with you today. You’re heavenly!</p>
<p>On the contrary, those who aren’t born again are earthy. We call them “earthlings”; they’re of this world, and subject to the corrupting influences of this world. This is the reason you must preach the Gospel to everyone in your sphere of contact, and beyond, that they may hear the <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gospel</a> of Christ and be converted from being earthy to being heavenly. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>All scripture is given by inspiration of</strong></em><em><strong>God… (2 Timothy 3:16).</strong></em></p>
<p>God’s Word enlightens us about the things of God, and helps us know His will, plan and purpose. If you know His written Word, you’ll know the unwritten Word, because you’ll become acquainted with the author of the written Word—the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>There’s a difference between an author and a writer. We have several writers of the books of the Bible; the prophets and the apostles who wrote the Scriptures for us; but they’re not the author. Our opening verse says, <em>“All scripture is given by inspiration</em> <em>of God…”;</em> “God” here is the Holy Spirit. If you ever want to know how God thinks, His language, His mind, thoughts, and opinions, then you’ve got to study and meditate on the Scriptures.</p>
<p>Sometimes, some people wonder, “How do I know when God is talking to me? I don’t want to confuse the voice of God with my mind.” You can learn His language; you can know His views, His opinions, His ideas, all from the Scriptures. Your heart becomes clear in such a way that you can separate the voice of the Holy Spirit from other voices.</p>
<p>You’ve got to learn the Scriptures; give attention to the Word of God. When you study the Bible, make notes. As you read, some thoughts will come to you; write them down. When you notice something striking, underline it; mark your Bible. Make annotations in your Bible. Don’t just read like you’re reading a newspaper.</p>
<p>There’re those who read the Bible; they even teach others, but aren’t really acquainted with the truths and revelations of the Spirit, and that’s sad. Paul said, <em>“And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power”</em>(1 Corinthians 2:4). That’s what it should be. You need illumination, and it’s the Holy Spirit that opens the eyes of your spirit to the truths of the <a href="https://rhapsodybible.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scriptures</a>, for your growth and edification. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>[The Father] has delivered and drawn us to Himself out of the control and the dominion of darkness and has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love (Colossians 1:13 AMPC).</strong></em></p>
<p>The message of Jesus Christ is encapsulated in His liquid love. His love flows. His words and actions are laden with love. Everything about Him is an expression of divine love. The totality of His personality is love. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>It’s Christmas eve, and what beauty it is to celebrate with this consciousness! So, as you go about expressing the joy and warmth of the season, keep in mind the very essence of our celebration: love. This is our message to the world; that they may know of Christ’s love for them.</p>
<p>Have confidence in His love. If He’d love you, then you’re lovable; you’re valuable. He never compares you with someone else. You’re unique to Him, and when He relates with you, it’s as though you’re the only one that exists. And He’s never tired of you. Glory to God! How can anyone know this and contemplate suicide?</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how much debt you owe, or the crises that seem to have overwhelmed you; if you’d only embrace the message of Jesus Christ and His liquid love, things will change. You may have so made a mess of your life, that now, all you see are your mistakes and their repercussions.</p>
<p>But you see, you’re the reason Jesus came; you’re the reason He was born. He came to take responsibility for your wrongs, including your financial errors. He cares about you that much. If only you’d accept His <a href="https://www.christembassy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">love</a>! We’re talking about someone who’s so powerful, loving, and so gracious! No error or mistake is ever too much for Him to handle. He’s bigger than your troubles. If you’d only believe this; it’ll change everything for you.</p>
<p>Dare to believe Him, and accept that He loves you more than you love yourself, and He’ll beautify your life; He’ll make you ride on the high places of the earth. Praise God!</p>

<p><em><strong>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory (Colossians 1:26-27).</strong></em></p>
<p>Today, the whole world is celebrating Christmas—the birth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. However, many don’t fully understand the spiritual significance of His birth. He was born into this world so He would live in us and through us.</p>
<p>If He doesn’t live in you, then you don’t understand Christmas, even though you join others to celebrate it. You’ve only heard a story, but you’ve got to believe, and come into the vital experience of that story by receiving Jesus Christ into your heart. Christ in you is the reason for Christmas. Everything Jesus came to accomplish was so it would be possible for man to become God’s living tabernacle. This was God’s plan all along, and He achieved it in the birth, death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Now, through Jesus Christ, we’re in fellowship with God; we’re in union with Him. Refuse to see yourself as a nobody, because you’re a God-carrying vessel. Now that Christ lives in you, you’re sanctified and glorified.</p>
<p>Colossians 2:9 says concerning Jesus, <em>“For in him</em> *dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”*As Jesus walked the earth, all of divinity was at home in Him. He was God alive in a man’s body; but guess what? We’re exactly like Him! 1 John 4:17 says, “As He is, so are we in this world.” Colossians 2:10 says, <em>“And ye are complete in him</em> (Christ) <em><strong>….”</strong></em> The Amplified Classic version makes it even clearer; it says, <em>“And you</em> <em>are in Him, made full and having come to fullness of life [in Christ you too are filled with the Godhead—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—and reach full spiritual stature]. And He is the Head of all rule and authority [of every angelic principality and power].”</em></p>
<p>Therefore, like Jesus, the Godhead is at home in you; the fullness of the Godhead tabernacles in you. Blessed be God! This is the reason Jesus came—to make you one with God—to make you more than a conqueror! Have this consciousness as you celebrate Christmas, and live the victorious life that’s yours in Him.â€‹</p>

<p><em><strong>That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3).</strong></em></p>
<p>The big deal about Christmas is the purpose for which the Lord Jesus was born into this world, and the import of that purpose for humanity. In John 10:10, He told us that He came that we might have life, and have it to the full.</p>
<p>However, life from, and through Jesus was so we could be in fellowship with God. 1 Corinthians 1:9 says, <em>“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the</em> <em>fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.”</em> 1 John 1:3 says, <em>“…our fellowship is with the Father, and with his</em> <em>Son Jesus Christ.”</em> This is what Jesus made possible for us. He brought us into <a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fellowship</a> or oneness with the Father.</p>
<p>Now we can walk with the Father, talk with Him, and reveal Him, because of Jesus. Now we live in God’s presence forever; we’re in Him, and He’s in us; such blessed union as Jesus prayed in John 17:21; now, we’re inextricably one with Him.</p>
<p>This is what makes Christmas worth celebrating; it’s the celebration of our oneness with the Lord. Take advantage of your union with the Lord and enjoy the full benefits of all that belongs to you in Christ.</p>

<p><em><strong>Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth (Philippians 2:9-10).</strong></em></p>
<p>In Matthew 28:18, Jesus said, “...All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.” No one in all of history ever had the audacity to make such a statement; only Jesus. He’s the Saviour of the world; the Lord of heaven and earth. Being the Lord of heaven and earth means His Name has power and commands respect in heaven, in earth, and under the earth.</p>
<p>It’s on the basis of His Lordship and authority that He sent us to make disciples of all nations; to preach the Gospel with boldness and power. He said in Matthew 28:19, <em>“Go ye therefore, and teach all</em> <em>nations….”</em> He commissioned us to use His sovereign authority to make disciples of all men.</p>
<p>The extent of His authority and greatness of His power is revealed in our opening scripture. All things are subject to Him. The Father and the Holy Spirit both answer to the Name of Jesus. Colossians 1:19 says, <em>“For</em> <em>it pleased the Father that in him</em> (Jesus) <em>should all fulness dwell.”</em></p>
<p>The Church needs to be bolder and more audacious about Jesus. We’re not serving a mere religious leader, but One who’s Lord of all. He has all authority in heaven, in earth, and under the earth. Therefore, be unapologetic in your identity with Him, and speak boldly of Him.</p>
<p>God gave you His Spirit to live in you and embolden you, so you can serve Him courageously, and proclaim the Gospel with boldness. If you were asked to pray or speak anywhere, don’t be intimidated or ashamed to speak or <a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pray</a> in the Name of Jesus. Proclaim His Name boldly, because you know who He is; He’s Lord of all: <em>“The word which God sent unto the</em> <em>children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)”</em> (Acts 10:36).</p>

<p><em><strong>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that</strong></em><em><strong>ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us (1 Corinthians 5:7).</strong></em></p>
<p>In  Exodus  12:12,  as  a  result  of  Pharaoh’s hard-heartedness,   the   death   angel,   the “destroyer,” was going to visit the land of Egypt and wreak havoc. However, the Lord instructed each household of the children of Israel to kill a lamb and rub the blood on the two side-posts, and on the upper door-post of their houses.</p>
<p>God said to them, <em>“And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt”</em> (Exodus 12:13). That’s where the term “Passover” came from. That lamb that was slain was the symbol of the Passover; it was called the Passover lamb.</p>
<p>We read in our opening verse that Christ Jesus is our Passover; He was slain for us, and His blood was used as that symbol. He was judged in our place like that lamb back in the Old Testament was slain for the Jews. Then, on the night of His betrayal, after He had broken bread with His disciples, He took the cup and said, <em>“…This cup is the new testament in my blood: this</em> <em>do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me”</em> (1 Corinthians 11:25).</p>
<p>Our salvation came from His blood. Therefore, we’ve passed from death to <a href="http://enterthehealingschool.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">life</a>. There’s therefore now no judgment, no destruction for us who are in Christ Jesus, because Christ our Passover has been sacrificed for us.</p>
<p>The destroyer shall not come to your house. It doesn’t matter in whatever way or form he comes to destroy; whether he comes with poverty, disease or infirmity of any kind, you’re shielded, because you’re in Christ. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>He who speaks in a [spiritual] tongue edifies and improves himself... (1 Corinthians 14:4).</strong></em></p>
<p>The importance of praying in tongues can never be overemphasised. As a Christian, to significantly improve your spiritual growth and comprehension, praying in tongues is an extremely vital element. But sadly, there’re those who say, “Well, our church doesn’t believe in speaking in tongues.” Understand that speaking in tongues isn’t a denominational phenomenon. Every Christian ought to speak in tongues! That’s where the secret of power is.</p>
<p>Our opening verse says, “He who speaks in a [spiritual] tongue edifies and improves himself….” The question is, do you want to improve yourself? Do you want to operate at a new level of spiritual maturity and efficiency this incoming year? Do you desire to make tremendous progress and take giant strides in all affairs of life? Speaking in tongues will help. The Bible says, “But you, beloved, build yourselves up [founded] on your most holy faith [make progress, rise like an edifice higher and higher], praying in the Holy Spirit” (Jude 1:20 AMPC).</p>
<p><a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Praying</a> in tongues will help you make progress, and cause you to rise like an edifice, higher and higher. The more you pray in tongues, the more sensitive you are to the Spirit, to receive and follow His guidance in all you do.</p>
<p>For example, maybe you don’t yet know the precise steps to take to expand or advance your ministry, business, or career in the coming year; take some time to speak in tongues. You’ll have spiritual insight and foresight.</p>
<p>Another important advantage of speaking in tongues is that it charges you up, like a battery. And when a battery is fully charged, it works effectively and lasts longer. Satan may throw darts at you, to distract you, but praying in the Holy Ghost makes you formidable; you’ll be able to withstand anything, and resist every evil.</p>
<p>Any time you face challenges in your life, get into your closet, and speak in tongues; charge yourself. When you’re done, you’ll be filled with the wisdom to prevail and excel. Keep yourself perpetually “high” on God’s power by speaking in tongues always!</p>

<p><em><strong>Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of the righteous man availeth much (James 5:16).</strong></em></p>
<p>Sometimes, people wonder why they pray and nothing happens. They desire changes that don’t take place, and the reason is they’re not making power available for the change they desire. God shows us how to make power available for change in our opening verse.</p>
<p>The Amplified Classic translation explains it more; it says, <em>“Confess to one another therefore your faults</em> <em>(your slips, your false steps, your offenses, your sins) and pray [also] for one another, that you may be healed and restored [to a spiritual tone of mind and heart]. The earnest (heartfelt, continued) prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available [dynamic in its working].”</em> The prayer that changes things has the peculiar quality of being earnest, heartfelt and continued. That means it’s not done casually; you don’t pray for only two minutes and go away, no; you press in your prayer, and take a hold of your desire with your spirit.</p>
<p>This kind of prayer is done with much passion and emotion; therefore, you may have to separate yourself from everybody and from everything else. Do this as you prepare for the New Year. Pray in tongues passionately and fervently until you receive the prophetic word in your heart.</p>
<p>When that power is made available through <a href="http://prayer.rhapsodyofrealities.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prayer,</a> go ahead and give the Word; it’ll come to pass. Make tremendous power available for the things you want to do and experience—your goals and desires—the changes you want to see in your ministry, family, finances, job, academics, or other areas of your life in the coming year. Hallelujah!</p>

<p><em><strong>Whoever wants to embrace life and see the day fill up with good, Here’s what you do: Say nothing evil or hurtful (1 Peter 3:10 MSG).</strong></em></p>
<p>The New Year is only hours away and I’m sure you’ve had so much to celebrate and be grateful to the Lord for in the outgoing year. Of course, while some are celebrating and testifying about the year, some others may be feeling dejected, wondering why their lives were full of pain and suffering in the outgoing year, and then hoping that in the New Year, things will be different.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not you had a fantastic, supernatural 2018, there’s hope for the future. You have to decide that you’re going to have an extraordinary 2019. God’s Word shows you how. If where you are right now isn’t where you want to be, it’s your responsibility to change things; and the tool for this is in your mouth!</p>
<p>Our opening verse says if you want to have your days filled up with goodness and good things, use your tongue correctly. How do you want your life to be in the coming year? It’s up to you! Speak in line with <a href="http://bit.ly/rhapsodycompendium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">God’s Word</a>; in line with the experiences you want to have. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>Your life goes where your words go; you journey in the direction of your words. Therefore, let your communication be wholesome. Don’t voice fear, uncertainties, and unbelief; affirm the Word. Practise this, and you’ll experience the blessings of the Word; your experiences will be in sync with the Word and the realities of the Kingdom life. Jesus said you shall have what you say (Mark 11:23).</p>
<p>As you go into the New Year, one of the critical decisions you must make is to yield your tongue to the Word! Practise talking right, and watch your life consistently go forward and upward!</p>
